QUESTION:
Like many people in this difficult economy, my partner was laid off this year. As you can imagine, it's a stressful time for us. We're now currently living on one income, so we've had to cut back on things like eating out and entertainment. But on top of the financial stress, my partner is handling his job situation poorly. At first, after the initial shock wore off, he was applying for jobs regularly and even got a couple of interviews. These didn't go anywhere. But lately, he seems to have lost a lot of the drive that he once had. Now he's applying to maybe one job a month, if that. He spends the rest of his time playing video games and talking about how unfair the world is. When I try to talk to him about looking for jobs or trying to do improve his morale through means such as going out and meeting people, he brushes me off or shuts down. It seems like his unemployment situation has crushed him, and it's dragging us both down. I don't want to leave him because I love him, and because leaving him would really seem like I'm kicking him when he's down. But this situation also isn't sustainable. His negativity and avoidance of reality is rubbing off onto me and harming our relationship. How can I through to him, and how can we improve the situation?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
What you’re describing is a deeply challenging situation, one that touches on the emotional and practical strains unemployment can place on a relationship. It’s clear you care deeply for your partner and want to support him, but you’re also feeling the weight of his withdrawal and negativity, which is understandable. When someone faces a significant setback like job loss, it’s common for motivation to ebb and for feelings of discouragement or unfairness to take hold. However, the way this manifests—through avoidance and shutting down—can create a painful dynamic for both of you.

One important step is to acknowledge that your partner’s current behavior is likely a reflection of his internal struggle, not a reflection of his feelings toward you or your relationship. That doesn’t mean you have to accept the impact it’s having on you or your shared life. Your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to want a more balanced and hopeful atmosphere.

When you try to talk to him and he shuts down, it might help to shift the approach from problem-solving or urging action to simply listening and validating his experience. Sometimes, when people feel overwhelmed, they resist pressure to “fix” things because it can feel like an added burden or a reminder of their perceived failures. You might say something like, “I can see this is really hard for you, and I’m here to listen whenever you want to talk.” This can open a door without making him feel cornered.

At the same time, it’s important to gently express how his current way of coping is affecting you and the relationship. Framing it as your feelings rather than his shortcomings can reduce defensiveness: “I’m feeling really worn down by the negativity and the distance between us. I want us to find a way through this together.”

Encouraging small, manageable steps might be more effective than pushing for big changes. For example, suggesting a short walk together, a shared meal, or a low-pressure social activity can help break the cycle of isolation and negativity without overwhelming him. These moments can also remind both of you of the connection beyond the stress.

If your partner continues to withdraw and the situation remains harmful to your well-being, it’s important to consider your own limits. Supporting someone doesn’t mean sacrificing your own mental and emotional health. Sometimes, creating a bit of space or seeking outside support—whether from trusted friends, family, or professionals—can provide both of you with new perspectives and relief.

Ultimately, this is a difficult season, and it’s okay to acknowledge that it might not resolve quickly or neatly. Your love and commitment are strengths, but so is your right to a relationship that nurtures you both. Balancing compassion with honesty about your needs will be key as you navigate this together.

I have a number of Carolyn_Hax_chats saved in the directory ~/Desktop/build_llm_karpathy/sources/carolyn_hax_chats. I would like to merge all of these together into a single document that I can use to train my LLM.

Can you write a Python script that does this? I want the Python script to merge the chats in order from most recent to least recent. I also want the script to ignore any chat files that are empty. All of the others should be used for the larger document.

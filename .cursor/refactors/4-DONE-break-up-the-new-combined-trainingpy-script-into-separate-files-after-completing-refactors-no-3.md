# Break Up The New Combined Training.py Script Into Separate Files After Completing Refactors No 3

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/build_llm_karpathy`

## Contents

The new combined file that will be created via merging training.py and resume_training.py wil be large, as training.py already is. We need to break out these file into multiple smaller files and functions. This wil make it more maintainable and follow the single-purpose philosophy. 

Break out logically contained pieces of logic in this new file into separate  functions/files.

<!-- DONE -->

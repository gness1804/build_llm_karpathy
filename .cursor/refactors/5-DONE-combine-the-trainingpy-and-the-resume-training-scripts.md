# Combine The Trainingpy And The Resume Training Scripts

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/build_llm_karpathy`

## Contents

The two training scripts, training.py and training_resume.py, Have a lot of overlap. But I think they've diverged quite a bit. I would like to combine these scripts together in order to make them more maintainable and reduce the risk of bugs. Can you write up an instruction document on how to do this and your recommendations? I want to use a cheaper model to combine the scripts and then come back to using you for when I resume training. Save the instruction document in .cursor/progress.

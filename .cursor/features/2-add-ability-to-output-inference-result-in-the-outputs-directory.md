# Add Ability To Output Inference Result In The Outputs Directory

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/build_llm_karpathy`

## Contents

Right now, we output the outputs of training runs into the outputs directory. I would like to also be able to output inference results into the same directory. It would probably be under a sub-directory called inferences, and the results for the training runs could be under a sub-directory called training or something like that.

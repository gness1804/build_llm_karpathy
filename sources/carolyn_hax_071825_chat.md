Still seeking justice from the man who killed my husband
Guest Jul 18, 11:03 a.m.
QUESTION: Two days after I told my husband he was going to be a father, he was hit and killed by a distracted driver. Because the driver was 19, he got off with probation and community service. I read an impact statement, so did my in-laws, and several friends of my husband but none of it mattered. All that mattered to the judge was that driver was young and had his whole life in front of him so he got off with a slap on the wrist. I sued for wrongful death but it was settled out of court and the insurance company paid the money so that guy will never really pay in any way for what he did. He never even said he was sorry to us. He gets to live his life and my son grows up without a father. I know life is unfair but not usually this heartbreakingly unfair. I wish I could stop thinking about how much I hate that driver but I can’t. Only my in-laws understand since they feel the same way. Everyone keeps telling us over and over: “it was an accident’, “his brain isn’t even fully mature”, “let it go because nothing will bring Don back” and so on. I posted on a grief forum how I'll never recover until we get some justice for my husband and they said I should smear the driver's name all over social media and the internet so everyone knows what he did, so it follows him forever, when he tries to get a job or date or anything. Maybe that’s mean but it will make me and my in-laws feel so much better. Is there any reason not to do that?

ANSWER: You say "I'll never recover until we get some justice for my husband."

What would you consider "justice"? How would you define "recover"?

Because all see here is vengeance. And that's neither recovery nor justice. Your solution is just taking the anger you have inside and spreading it as far as the internet can take it -- which we all know is a force you no longer control the moment you unleash it.

And all you're doing is throwing to strangers, like raw meat to wolves, what has always been the proper responsibility of both the justice system and this man's conscience. You're doing this simply because you don't think these two corrective bodies gave you enough. But for one thing, there was never going to be enough, because there never is in the case of an accidental loss of innocent life. It's impossible. There is no eye for this eye -- which itself isn't justice anyway. And, another thing, his conscience may be hard at work on this every day if his life. You don't know that it isn't.

I see every detail of your side of the story, I do, and it's awful -- I hear your grief and sympathize while still adamantly opposing what these grief forum sirens are luring you into. It's terrible and it's as far from healing as I can conceive of at this point.

Life actually is this heartbreakingly unfair. Every damn day.

You may recall former First Lady Laura Bush also did what this 19-year-old driver did, when she was 17. She ran a stop sign and the accident she caused killed a 17-year-old. She said herself she did not reach out to the family at the time to apologize, and was wracked by guilt for years. Her reckoning is one you might want to read about -- when you're ready, but before you go smearing anyone out of certainty of what is just.

My friend Ann Gerhart wrote about her in "The Perfect Wife" in 2005, and Bush herself wrote about it in I think a 2010 memoir.

I am very sorry for your loss. I hope you will -- beg you to -- address the grief, keep going, vs. succumb to the rage.

Non-Beach Blues
Guest Jul 18, 11:13 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,

Next week is my family's annual beach vacation. It is A Thing - my family has been doing this since I was a toddler and I'm in my early 40s now. Not only will my immediate family be there, but so will all of my relatives since they live in the beach town.

I stopped going on this vacation a couple of years ago because my chaotic, alcoholic brother often made it so difficult. Intellectually, I know I made the right choice for my mental health. Emotionally, it's really hard and I spend the week sadly thinking about everything I'm missing. Any advice on how to get through this week every year?

Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Counterprogramming, right? I mean -- you aren't sitting home alone, flipping through old beach week albums, are you?

Actually, there is something to this. You kind of have to go all in on distraction, or all in on your inability to be distracted. So if you have some great other thing you can be doing, so great that it can get you to stop thinking about what you're missing, then book that annually in this timeslot.

If instead your hard feelings about missing the trip will ruin whatever else you plan for the time, then make this your annual Chores of Misery Week -- attic, basement, old files, DMV, photo purge, weeding, bring your worst. Just, suffer. (Good food and music, though.)

Elderly Mom and Animals
Guest Jul 18, 11:28 a.m.
QUESTION: My mom is an animal person. She's always had multiple pets or rescuing some animal. At this point, she has one reptile, two birds, two dogs, and more fish than I can count. She is becoming quite unsteady on her feet using a walker to get around her house. I cook her meals and she uses the microwave to reheat them when I'm not there. I'm a nurse so when I work my 12hr shifts, I just cannot get to her on those days and I don't think the animals are being properly cared for. Her animals are her only joy and quite honestly have always been her primary joy. I worry she isn't properly caring for them and when I raise concerns, she pushes it all aside getting angry and deflecting. My husband and adult kids simply are not animal people and these pets need a lot of care. Also, what happens to all these animals when she passes? I don't want to hurt my mom and I think removing animals might actually kill my mom. Feeling really stuck.

Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Can you/she hire someone come in? If $ is an issue, would someone from the rescue group volunteer to come in 1 or 2x a day? Her continuing to work for the rescue could be valuable enough to the organization to make the tradeoff worth it, as long as a quick check-in is all the animals need to receive proper care. Another option is to talk to the techs at her vet, to see if any are taking on side work, or know someone who is. They may be connected to reputable petsitters.

Meanwhile, the unsteady walking and the dogs could be a hazard. Does your mom have a way to alert you? A life-alert-type button, or a smart watch?

Can't say I love you
Guest Jul 18, 11:40 a.m.
QUESTION: I come from a really dysfunctional family. My parents are at the end of their lives (early 90s; mom has early dementia, dad does not but he has some physical health issues). Im in my late 50s with 4 other siblings. I live nearby my parents, who live in an active retirement community.

My parents were never touchy-feely. And I mean no touching, no hugging, no "I love yous" with me or my siblings. Ever. Honestly, if they ever said it to me, I cannot recall it or it would have been before I was in grade school. They do not touch or hug me to this day (although their method of discipline back in the day was physical hitting up until I was in high school, same for siblings - it could be considered abusive by today's standards). Likewise, I don't touch/hug them. When I see them (pretty often), hellos and goodbyes are simply stated.

Obviously, this has impacted me through adulthood. I'm single, no kids, and have had only a few short relationships.

What do i say/do when the end comes? It would so forced to say I love you. Should I find a therapist now or after they die? So much emotional baggage. Where do i even start?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Oh. Okay. I would take this slowly.

Especially since you don't have to decide anything now about when the end comes for your parents.

And it may simply not come up at all -- the opportunity may not happen, or may slip by. The Hollywood death scene where people gather and say their goodbyes is less of a thing than you may think. If the end does come in deathbed form, then it also often comes with spotty consciousness. I'm spelling all this out mostly to ease your mind, so you don't have to fret about a big farewell pronouncement that your life with your parents hasn't prepared you for.

That said, I hope you will tend to the questions and discomfort you're dealing with for your own reasons. If you're thinking a therapist would be a good idea at some point, then the best point is now! Sure. Air some of the stuff that has bothered you. Set down some of the baggage. If you don't feel like unpacking it all, that's okay -- just set it down for now. One thing at a time.

I also wish I weren't answering this live, because your situation strikes me as one that is so good for fiction -- meaning, I have wisps of memories of novels that really get at where you are, but I can't ... get .. them. And I think the beauty of a novel is the ability to inhabit someone else's life, to achieve comprehension and feelings from an armchair.

I know there are serious readers out there. Can anyone recommend a novel or three that takes a character from an emotionally remote and inexpressive family into connection and awakening? Thank you in advance.

Anyway. These are places to start. Another place to start, quite basically, is aesthetic or therapeutic touch, like a manicure or haircut. It may seem incongruous, but what you describe sounds like fairly extreme detachment from human contact. Maintaining regular appointments is a small thing you can do.

Re: Justice vs Healing
Guest Jul 18, 11:44 a.m.
QUESTION: As a former criminal prosecutor turned civil attorney, I want to assure you that “justice” was served here, however unsatisfying it may feel to you and your family. The state pursued the case and rendered judgement and punishment according to the law. The civil case provided compensatory damages. As a former criminal prosecutor. This is justice. Carolyn is right that what you are describing is not justice, but vengeance. And neither the criminal justice system nor the civil legal system is designed to deliver vengeance or retribution.

Having worked with many families of victims, including of horrific crimes, I have tremendous sympathy for your plight. But Carolyn is right that no amount of suffering that you or others inflict on this young man will ever make you feel whole. And that’s because your feelings exist entirely in your mind and body. The healing you seek - and that you and your family truly need - will not come from the outside. Healing comes from the inside, from processing your own emotions and grief, from learning to cope and move forward with your life as best you can.

I hope you will find your way to a skilled grief counselor or program to begin this work of healing as soon as possible. Consider individual therapy for yourself and also group grief counseling so you can travel this journey with others and feel less alone in the world.

Do this for yourself. But also do this for your son. He has lost his father. I hope he will not also lose all or part of his mother to the grief over this tragedy.

cruel but dishonest
Guest Jul 18, 11:52 a.m.
QUESTION: hi carolyn,

how do you handle a close relative who is unbelievably, openly cruel to you while the remaining family either stays mum or enables it? i think i'd be okay with the terrible treatment (being belittled, demeaned, secret messages, thrown glassware, tangents about how me and my wife make everyone's lives worse, etc etc) but the gaslighting from the rest of the family is really changing me for the worst.

i now feel the need to justify all of my behaviors with fact-based proof, like i'm defending myself in court, and i've withdrawn from most of my friendships because it's hard to trust that i am good for anyone.

i'm in therapy, on meds, but because i work with this person and live 10 minutes away i can't escape.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Why can't you escape? There must be other places to work and live.
UPDATE:
Since I didn't see a follow up with reasons the OP can't leave, I will try to answer without it.
First, always, I will urge you to get away from abuse. To interrogate your reasons you "can't." To work with your therapist to plan your way out.
There are interior approaches too:
-Know your abuser and avoid them as much as possible. Except nothing but abuse from them.
-Expect no help from your family.
-Limit your contact with all of them to what is absolutely necessary for business.
-Keep great records. Receipts for everything.
-Assume even this won’t protect you. Don’t see documentation as saving yourself, see it as doing what you can.
-Know that this is a "them" problem – because good people don’t do this.
-Start rebuilding your friendships.
Take care of you.

Breaking up with a narcissist
Guest Jul 18, 11:56 a.m.
QUESTION: I have come to the conclusion, after 9 years together, that my boyfriend is a narcissist who will never change and never put anyone else’s needs above his own. The last straw was I caught him cheating and he lied about it, then justified his choices as “I can do whatever I want”. I have told him I am done, done, done. He keeps texting and calling and telling me how much he loves me and wants to see a couples counselor. I have experienced the wrath that comes with expressing my feelings about his behavior. I need a strategy to convince him to let me move on. If it matters, he is 50 and I’m 70.

Justice for Accidental Death
Guest Jul 18, 12:06 p.m.
QUESTION: I understand where you are coming from - not fully - but as much as any other person can. 15 years ago my Mom was struck and killed by a hit and run driver while we were walking across the road together. The person who hit her was never identified and thus never "paid" - they may not have even known they hit her.

It's horrible and unfair and there is no way to make sense of it. But I know my mom would not have wanted me to live a life of hate and revenge. She would have wanted me to find a way to live a life of kindness and empathy - to focus on finding joy for myself and others, not putting more anger and hurt into the world. That path will not bring you peace or honor your husband's memory.
Find a way to keep him alive for yourself and your son through remembering all the great moments of his life and letting his last moments go.

Healing Touch
Guest Jul 18, 12:15 p.m.
QUESTION: My family was not touchy feely, no "I love you"s, etc. As a result, I'm not that way either and am somewhat uncomfortable with it. However, many years ago I started getting regular massages. Long ago, when I was single, I was at work and someone brushed by me and I realized that was the first time I had been touched, in any way, in MONTHS. I thought that if I got into a relationship with someone that I would go way too fast because of being so touch hungry. So, I started getting massages, and continue to do so to this day. Ironically, I found getting manicures really uncomfortable because a stranger was holding my hand and looking at me directly and that felt very intimate. But whatever works for you.

Re: mom and pets

QUESTION: "My husband and adult kids simply are not animal people and these pets need a lot of care." Are your husband and adult kids people people? Because this is a people issue, not really an animal issue. Your mom needs help. It doesn't matter if that is making her bed, cooking her food, or feeding her pets. You don't have to be an "animal person" to go over and spend 10 minutes making sure animals have been fed. Reframe the need, and make it about your mom, not the animals.

Mom doesn't want brother's gf on vacations
Guest Jul 18, 12:27 p.m.
QUESTION: My brother's girlfriend of 4 years joins us on all of our family vacations. My mom has been complaining about this since we took her on a big surprise trip last year for a milestone birthday, but she complains to everyone except my brother. He and his gf usually go off on their own once or twice during these trips and Mom takes this personally. She complains the entire time they're gone and blames the gf, insisting she is the one "running the show" and pulling my brother away. She has classic "this girl is taking my baby boy away from me" syndrome.

I know that my brother is the one who needs a break from Mom, but of course I can't tell her this. Plus, sometimes they just want to do things Mom doesn't want to do. This all makes me want to travel with them (Mom specifically) less and less.

Now my brother is planning another surprise trip, and his gf is already involved. She loves to travel and would be very hurt if she wasn't invited. Although neither my brother nor I are married, we're well past the age of our live-in significant others being excluded, and I think Mom needs to accept that (I wonder if she complains about my bf the way she complains about his gf, but he joins us much less often).

I did request that we take equal breaks if we do this next trip and my brother agreed (on top of the complaining, Mom has mobility issues, anxiety, constantly loses things, etc.). I'm inclined to stay out of the rest of it because it's really between them, but since Mom doesn't communicate directly with someone when there's a problem, it's very unlikely she'll talk to him about it. So, I'm left to listen to her complaints, despite repeating, "Talk to Brother!" and leaving the room (she turned to my bf and continued the rant).

What can I do? For the record, I've become very close with the gf and enjoy having her on these trips.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You can do all kinds of things.

You can stop traveling with Mom.

You can stop responding when she complains.

You can say, "I've become very close with the gf and enjoy having her on these trips."

You can say, "Mom, if you complain to me about GF, then I won't respond. If you keep going, then I will leave. If you continue your rant with bf, then he will leave." (Make sure bf leaves -- full empowerment.)

You can start singing "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" every time she starts in.

So the question is, what are you prepared to do?

I feel like Sean Connery in the church in "The Untouchables."

Using the word “like“
Guest Jul 18, 12:34 p.m.
QUESTION: My bright and beautiful granddaughter is working for a corporation and very ambitious to move forward. I see an obstacle to her progress, but I’m afraid to mention it for fear of hurting her in some way . The problem as I see it is that she uses the word “like” several times in every sentence. To me it telegraphs a youngster and I know she is quite mature for her age. Do you think I should tell her?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I see some people as just the worst messengers for personal habit corrections. If the grandparent role in your granddaughter's experience has been one of acceptance, than this could land really badly. And you could be wrong, too, that her tic is holding her back. So I say butt out.

If you've been her mentor and you're corporate yourself, then I'll reconsider.

Babies in the beach house
Guest Jul 18, 12:57 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn - I've rented a beach house with the same five friends for 15 years, and the plans have evolved over time to incorporate partners, pets, work schedules and food/alcohol needs. We added my daughter two summers ago, and this summer another friend and I will both have baby boys. When I sent our traditional "30 days to go" planning email this week, one person responded that having babies in the house "really changes the vibe." She said the child free group had been talking and proposed the families take the house the first half of the week, then the child free group the second half, and we can all hang together on the arrival/departure day. I was really surprised, hurt and angry (the week went alcohol free to support her sobriety, which also "changed the vibe," but were genuinely happy to support her). The other parent friend and I want to respond that we're staying all week because this is our planned and highly anticipated time away, and they're welcome to skip or leave early. My husband thinks the trip will be tense now regardless and we should just agree. What would you do here? The rental is in my name, my family paid extra for a room for the kids, and we're past the cancellation window.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Babies in the beach house totally wreck the vibe. "Change" was being nice. And maybe I can say this only because I was in the no-babies camp before I was in the babies camp myself, in a beach house gathering with the same group annually, as it happens (on point life experience for this one, I must say): but I'm going to ask you to re-think the "really surprised, hurt and angry." All three.

There is no surprise here -- little kids absolutely demolish a "same five friends for 15 years" beach house experience. I love babies, they're magical nubbins. But they cry, need gear, nap on day-trip-killing schedules, get up at the crack of piss, and either go to bed while it's still daylight -- or, worse, they don't. I'm sorry, they're just anathema to a relaxed group hang unless you have a rare super chill one. Toddlers? Forget about it. Both take their parents and parents' attention away constantly, because they're supposed to. And your friends are losing that time with you. So where is the surprise in their noticing the loss and not being super thrilled with paying big bucks for your distraction?

And the hurt and anger -- let's talk about those. Your friends don't hate your kids. This isn't personal. It's just ... it changed, not for the better for them, and it sucks. And this may be one of their few vacation weeks this year, and now they're working it around nap time? Don't hate on them or -- this is so important -- take it personally. They're just telling the truth and saying out loud they don't want one of their few precious weeks off to accommodate poop and crying.

If they need you to return the favor years from now when your kids are grown and theirs are small, it might irk you, too, but maybe less.

You have some of a point with the sobriety, but not all.

If you want to have a constructive convo about this, then drop the surprise/hurt/anger, channel the experience of being babyless on a baby-centered beach week, and own up: "I get it. It is a changed vibe. All I did was add a room and assume that was that, vs think how the group was affected.

"It's way too late for big changes this summer, but we should talk about what would work better for everyone."

I suggest you ask as part of this, "Do you see our tradition continuing for another 15 years, another 30?" Because life is change. Kids are just part of it. And doing the work through these "hard" years can really pay off, but it takes commitment and communication. (And fewer defenses.)

Mother won’t stop asking to include relatives in my wedding ceremony
Guest Jul 18, 1:06 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi, my wedding is coming up this October, and while my parents have been wonderfully supportive and loving in so many ways of me and my fiancé “David” over the past year in the lead up, every few months my Mom will occasionally drop into chats that she hopes I can have her sister, my Aunt “Rachel” as a reader during the ceremony, because Rachel is my Godmother, and Rachel’s son excluded her from his wedding (various reasons, but partly because due to a nasty divorce between Rachel and her now ex-husband) several years ago and Rachel was very hurt by it. At first, my Mom started a year ago with “Oh just a thought” suggestions about what I could add, and eventually it’s escalated to “I want you to have your Aunt read a passage at the wedding, it would mean so much to her and she is your Godmother.” Our wedding is three months away, and I know David and I are going to meet with our officiant in a month or two to discuss what we want our ceremony to look like. Earlier in the planning it was easier to brush it off with saying it’s far away and we haven’t figured out details yet, but that’s going to get harder to do now. While I am keeping my mother on as much of an information diet as possible, I’m dreading the inevitability of her bringing up yet another “Have you found a reading for your Aunt yet” guilt trip, and her freaking out when I say no or if she gets me to waffle.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: K, coupla things.

1. It's not "relatives in my wedding," it's Aunt Rachel.

2. If it's no, then say no! I read the Q once and skimmed it a second time and I'm seeing brush offs and info diets and dread, but I'm not seeing, "Mom, I do not want Aunt Rachel to do a reading." A year ago.

3. If she takes it badly, then you can explain if you want, but you don't have to. It's your mom, though, and weddings are big feelings in tents, and you've run away from her for months. So: "I understand this is really important to you for a bunch of reasons having to do with AR's divorce and her son's wedding. But I hope you can understand my discomfort with the use of my wedding as the vehicle for her makeup ceremony? It just seems off in so many ways. Please let me have this without mixing in other stuff -- even my beloved godmother's stuff." A year ago would have been nice, but now will do.

4. You could also have Aunt Rachel do a reading. Do I disagree with what your mom is doing? 100 percent, with a marzipan dove on top. But it's a wedding, and sometimes a reading can be really nice. It's not like she's asking you to fit in a Sousaphone solo.

5. Either way, just Own It Already. Or don't get married. This is not a typo or brain spasm.

Because being part of a married couple is so hard on a person's identity. You have to remain yourself while making decisions as a unit and often thinking as one. You can become overbearing or vanish without even knowing how you got there. And so your ability to say "no" to Mom about Aunt Rachel is one of the many useful drills and test runs you've been handed leading up to your marriage. You've got an F so far, but there's still plenty of time to pass it. Get to it.

Re: can't say I love you
Guest Jul 18, 1:21 p.m.
QUESTION: I know the questioner seems to feel bad about the no "I love yous" and it has affected their relationships, but I just wanted to mention that not saying I love you in a family does not necessarily equal dysfunction. My parents never said I love you and theirs didn't either, but I love them so much and they love me, we just show it differently. I also know families who say I love you all the time but still have crazy weird fights. If you want to say I love you to them now you can, it might be awkward, but it may also be extremely impactful as you have kept it reserved all this time. And if they were good parents and took care of you they probably feel it is implied.

ANSWER: Your point is well-taken on not equating spoken I-love-yous with love. Thank you.

But about your last sentence -- "their method of discipline back in the day was physical hitting," paired with no hugs, and had impacts on their child into adulthood. I think we can safely rule out "good parents and took care of you."

Tired of LAT
Guest Jul 18, 1:28 p.m.
QUESTION: I’m a 60 year-old who has been divorced twice, and am now in a 4 year long relationship where we are “living alone together” or LAT. The person I’m doing this with is wonderful, amazing, loving, and fun to be with. The problem is we live almost 2 hours apart, and the driving back and forth has become tedious. We’ve discussed moving in together, but every time we do, I get very nervous. I really enjoy living by myself and having my own space and schedule. The idea of giving that up, plus possibly my house, just doesn’t feel exciting. Can you give me some ways to think about this that I can share with my partner, so that I don’t upset them and make them feel like I’m rejecting them?

ANSWER: Why is it on you not to upset your partner? "I really enjoy living by myself and having my own space and schedule. The idea of giving that up, plus possibly my house, just doesn’t feel exciting."

You don't move in just to avoid a tedious drive.

You have two divorces. This is not something to feel bad about, this is something to learn from. Worry about upsetting your own equilibrium. If you have to reject your partner to do that, then reject your partner. Not the right one.

Baby Beach House
Guest Jul 18, 1:37 p.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn is right that babies change the vibe, but I think it's OK for LW to feel surprised, hurt, and angry, though I agree that that's not necessarily the vibe to take back to the friends. This is a really last-minute (surprised) way to drop a pretty big change request--one that more-or-less says "we'd rather not have you at all than have you and your kids" (hurt) and "a bunch of us have been talking together about how you're making our trip unpleasant" (hurt again, and together with all of the earlier stuff, most especially the last minute nature of it, angry).

My dirty lens here is that an annual group trip my family participates in has changed in similar ways over the last several years, though the proportion of families-with-kids has been higher than that in LW's group. There is one couple in particular that seems unhappy with the ways that kid stuff has been a constraint for us folks with kids and has cramped their style in general, and I am really sympathetic about that--to be honest, I was ready when we first had our son to have the broader group declare the trip a kid-free zone, which would have been fine--but also we have worked really really hard on this trip to minimize the impact of our kids and it's been tough to get the impression that our friends don't see our work--they just seem to be always thinking we should do more in some nebulous way (which, to be honest, doesn't really feel possible for us).

I will say, finally and for what this is worth, our trip (which admittedly is bigger than LW's) has had some success in recent years getting two houses and having one house be a kid house and the other adults-only. Those who don't like the kid-centric trip seem to appreciate having a place to retreat, and those of us with kids have liked being in a house where people are of course trying to be considerate, but our housemates are more accustomed to and understanding of early wakeups and bedtimes, middle-of-the-night challenges, conversational discretion in the hot tub, etc.

ANSWER: Two houses is a great freaking idea. I love this.

And you're right at separating out the specific anger at the delay and delivery.

The OP's best approach at this late date is really, "Hey, SOONER, and to our faces next time, ffs." Make the point that now everyone's stuck with either a weird half-week or nothing.

Unless you all talk it out like everyone needed to a long time ago -- which, really, everyone owns to some extent. Communicate on how to make this one go better. None of this [whisper whisper] bomb drop, or assumption that everyone's cool with everything, or scorekeeping, or whatever other dysfunction piled up here. Kind of like the fridge on the last day of one of these things 😑

Re: Using the word "like"
Guest Jul 18, 1:41 p.m.
QUESTION: To the author of the question about the work "like" in professional settings: Sorry, no.

I'm in a professional, high-consequence environment. I'm 50. Many of the "youngsters" have these habits that people like to associate with lack of maturity or sophistication. But when I filter out the habit and listen to what they're saying, it's easy to see that they Know. Their. Stuff.

It's time for people who judge on superficial qualities to get out of the way of people who are getting work done. People who can't see a colleague's expertise and knowledge because they're distracted by a verbal tick need to work on their inability to focus!

QUESTION: There is no way to make someone feel like you are not rejecting them, if you are, in fact, rejecting them. If you did manage to do so, you are not doing them any favors, since you would only be perpetuating a lie. You owe yourself - and your partner - the truth, wherever that leads.

QUESTION: One of my favorite writers, Robert B. Parker, and his wife lived in the same house, but on separate floors, with a third floor as a joint space - admittedly a higher-end option. Another option might be for one of you to move closer to the other, but still maintain separate residences (and schedules). There’s no one way to live.

I'm posting this because I endorse the idea of living how we want to, however it works. Bonus points for not explaining it to anyone.

Adult Friend Makin
Guest Jul 18, 2:03 p.m.
QUESTION: Totally random. When adults talk about being lonely everyone suggests volunteering. I have always thought it was a stupid idea. I would love to hear some other points of view in the comments.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: How is this random? It's what we do here.

Here's the part that is not stupid. The basic, known, as-proven-as-can-be recipe for adult-friend-makin is this:

1. Interact with a blend of new people.

2. Do so on a regular basis with some frequency. (Once a year will probably not help you much.)

3. Have some purpose that brings you together. This can serve as conversation prompt (icebreaker for the shy especially) and common-interest filter.

This is optional but ideal:

4. Have some project that requires you to work together. This allows you to be parallel and not talk, or talk about what you're doing, or go for weeks observing how you contribute to a community vs. going blah-blah-blah about whatever.

So. These 3-4 elements can fit into a lot of different scenarios. ONE of those scenarios is volunteer work. But it's hardly the only one. That's why it's included so much. But any time this topic comes up, people usually throw out a whole list of ideas because it has to be something you enjoy. You, personally, would be stupid to try to make friends volunteering. I feel pretty good about that.

Also, these things are not going to do all the social work for us -- at some point, the people trying to make friends will have to take a leap and say, "Hey, do you want to go to dinner sometime?" or otherwise take a chance of face-planting. It's just how it is.

For can’t say I love you
Guest Jul 18, 2:16 p.m.
QUESTION: Elizabeth Berg’s “Durable Goods” has always stuck with me, for its portrait of a young girl who has lost her mother and whose father is “increasingly distant,” and “often violent” - and especially for these lines, near the end: “He can only go so far in a good direction. Then something happens. He is all apart broken. For a moment I see him as someone other than my father, and he seems so curious to me, and sad, like an animal wrongly tied up. *Then he is my father again and I see that he is only what I was given first. There are other places to look for things. I lean back against the seat, close my eyes.*”
((Emphasis added). That kind of clarity and acceptance, that dual vision, coupled with hope, is perhaps what we all could use, not just with our parents - but maybe especially with our parents.

Re: Still seeking justice
Guest Jul 18, 2:19 p.m.
QUESTION: Speaking to what Carolyn said about how life is always this heartbreakingly unfair, I know how this kind of tragedy haunts a family. My grandmother’s first husband was killed in a highway collision when my aunt was a newborn. My grandmother was about 20, had no job, and had an infant to care for in the wake of the loss. My mother was born about 10 years after the accident, and her childhood was marked by an extremely unstable home life. I know that grief is something that never truly leaves us, it is scar on us for the rest of our lives. I’m sure you know that vengeance won’t bring him back, but it won’t set things right either. I don’t say this to be cruel, I only say this because in the midst of all this heartbreak is your son. Your son is a part of your husband that is going to live on. Yes, that 19 year old has his whole life ahead of him, but so does your son. Which of those lives you give your attention to is going to affect your son more than it will ever affect that 19 year old kid.
I don’t know the name of my aunt’s late father, I don’t know how the case was resolved in courts or in the court of public opinion. All I know is the generational impact this tragedy has passed onto me. I know that my aunt grew up with a despondent, emotionally unavailable mother. I know that my mother grew up in the explosive conflict between my aunt and my grandmother when the system reached its limits.
Your son doesn’t need vengeance, he needs you. Your in-laws may share your rage, but they don’t share your responsibility. They lost their son, but you haven’t lost yours.

Re Mom and Pets
Guest Jul 18, 2:24 p.m.
QUESTION: This seems larger than caring for the pets. Your mom needs a regular check in with someone who is a caregiver, either professionally or as a caring person. It is hard for our elders to admit this sometimes, or to relinquish responsibility for things they have done for themselves. But, for safety's sake, you might be at the point of lining up scheduled care for your mom that includes helping her care for her pets.

For Non-Beach Blues
Guest Jul 18, 2:54 p.m.
QUESTION: I come from a family of alcoholics. Just a thought -- the mornings and early afternoons were usually not too bad before the serious drinking started, so maybe if you don't want to miss out completely, book yourself a place not too far away, and join the family for breakfast and maybe even lunch every day. Then when your brother starts drinking it's time to say your goodbyes and you spend the rest of the day by yourself, enjoying life, the beach and avoiding his chaos.

It was always abuse
Guest Jul 18, 3:05 p.m.
QUESTION: To the person who said their parents’ hitting would be abuse by today’s standards - it was always abuse. It was never ok. Your parents always had the option to start doing better. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized how much “by today’s standards” is a canard. There were things in my family that were extremely not ok (my brother bullying well past the point of regular sibling conflict, for example). I used to think it was a function of 1980s/90s standards compared to now. With life experience I have realized there were no “standards” in 1992 that said choking your little sister is ok. My parents were asleep on the job at best. People my grew up in homes where that would never have been tolerated. It was never ok in your home, either, and you deserved much better. Do what you have to do to take care of yourself. I personally found Adult Children of Alcoholics groups very helpful for a while when I first started processing all this. People from all manner of family dysfunction use those support groups - you don’t have to come from an alcoholic home to participate. It’s free and more accessible than therapy for many. I think you also have a lot of stories to tell a therapist, when you’re ready.

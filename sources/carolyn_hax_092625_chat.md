In-laws made us feel unwelcome
Guest Sep 26, 11:03 a.m.
QUESTION: We just came back from a visit to my in-laws (FiL and StepMiL) and I don’t know what to make of it. If they were trying to make us feel unwelcome then mission accomplished. They relocated a year ago and have been bugging us to visit. Between one thing and another, we were only able to commit this month. It’s a 4-hour trip so we both took a half-day Friday and drove straight through since our 3 yo son slept most of the way. When we arrived on Friday at 6 pm they said they assumed we’d already eaten and hadn’t prepared anything. After we said we hadn’t had dinner and had rushed lunch they put out 3 slices of lunch meat, 6 slices of bread, some mustard, and a snack size pack of chips. They are not hard up for money and there was more lunch meat and bread in the packages as well as more bags of chips but that’s all they put out for all of us. I asked for some of the fruit I'd seen in the crisper and StepMiL said she was saving it for a cobbler on Sunday. For breakfast the next day, they said they usually have coffee and little sugar wafer cookies and that’s what they offered us. I asked about cereal since I’d seen some in the pantry but my FiL said they didn’t have “enough milk” though there was a quart container in their fridge. My son was hungry, so I went out for take-out for both of us. My wife made do with cookies and coffee. Lunch was the same meager sandwiches. My wife offered to fix dinner since they had plenty of food in the fridge and freezer. They accepted the offer and that was the only full meal we had that weekend, other than us taking them out for lunch on Sunday. The cobbler never appeared.
I don’t think it’s an age thing since my parents, and my MiL and her husband practically shower us with food when we visit them and they’re all the same age (late 60s). I asked my wife why they acted like that and she said she didn’t know but we’re never visiting again. I can’t shake the feeling that they wanted us to feel unwelcome and unless I can get an explanation, I’m not going to have a good feeling towards them ever again. Is it okay to ask my FiL what was up with the lousy hosting?

ANSWER: I'd call that more than unwelcome -- that's downright weird.

A couple of things. First, maybe unrelated, you can't draw conclusions on "an age thing" just using a few others in the age cohort the way you did. There could be health-related problems in your in-laws' home that have an age component, and that could have been a contributor to your weird weekend (so many qualifiers there ...) -- and whether your parents or other in-laws feed you is immaterial. Likewise, you may think you know their $ situation but you do not know.

Second, weirdness to that degree is well worth a follow up, so I'm with you there -- but I would step back a bit from seeing it through such a personal lens, for now. Where you see, "They wanted us to feel unwelcome," try, "That was bizarre behavior that doesn't track at all with bugging us to visit." You have the facts of the severe food withholding and control. Wait until you have more information before you draw any conclusions about their motivations.

Third, your wife is with you on this. In most cases, the immediate family member is in a better position to communicate on weirdness. If she's willing, then she might get better answers. Plan the questions beforehand, using your past experience with them as a starting point: "I loved seeing you, but noticed things were very different on this visit," she can say. And then give specific examples -- one slice of lunch meat for dinner? Then, "I'm concerned."

This does seem to need eyes on it, I'm sorry. In a way I hope they were just mad at you (maybe for taking a whole year to get there?) and being shockingly childish about it, because then it's not an emergency; you can just peace out and not visit again.

two thoughts for today's husband who doesn't want to move back
Guest Sep 26, 11:26 a.m.
QUESTION: As somebody who lived this (my spouse and I alternated: best place for me, best place for her, then compromise city that wasn't perfect for either but above average for both and our young kid), two additions to Carolyn's advice.

While moving back and enabling her pursuit of her career is clearly the right answer, keep in mind the old home won't be like it was. You have a kid now, and so the questions of where to live and lifestyle and work/life balance, will have to consider the kid's needs. That means your partner's effort to resume her career is going to have more compromises (can't stay late in the lab because tonight is kid's talent show, etc.) There will likely be nights when she says "this isn't how I thought it would be" and your reaction better be, "OK, so how do we ensure you succeed?", and not "Oh, maybe we should go back to my happy place and you can just teach"!

To that, point consider solo counseling for you (if you prefer, a good job coach can work too) during the first year after the move, so you can work through your emotions and your loss (leaving a great job!). You're going to be balancing a job change (hard), trying to support your wife as she reboots her career (harder) and parenting (hardest?). You need to present to be a great parent, to support your partner in her tough moments, and to succeed in your new job, without carrying emotional baggage from the move/change. Oh yes -- and being a great parent is #1 -- if you and your partner don't have to worry about whether the kid is thriving, the edges of the other issues get less sharp.

Go Ask Your Dad
Guest Sep 26, 11:34 a.m.
QUESTION: Before we were married, my husband agreed to have two kids and at least one dog. Soon after we got married, I quickly learned he only wanted one and no pets ever. Since it was a two yeses/one no situation, I had to go along.

The problem is when our daughter wants to know why she doesn't have a sibling or a dog. I've never told my daughter about my husband's bait and switch, and I don't think it's my responsibility to explain my husband's decisions. He's the one who pulled out the rug underneath me.

My husband thinks we need a united front on these two decisions, which is hilarious because he contradicts me in front of our child all the time. I say he made both of these decisions unilaterally so he needs to defend and explain it, not me. Why would I defend something I don't agree with for the sake of martial harmony just so he doesn't look like the Bad Guy?

What do we do?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: "We" -- you -- need to own your decision to stay with your husband once you learned about his (apparent) deception. Or you need to be true to yourself and make a different one.

I say apparent because people do change their minds, and they're allowed to. Conversations about x kids and y pets before marrying are essential, absolutely, for what they reveal about visions for the kind of life we want. I'm not minimizing that. People who say they want a stampede of life through the house will offer a different experience from the ones who say "... ehhhh no pets, maybe a child, but I have reservations about that and we need to talk about it." Both also are absolutely valid ways to go through life.

So what matters is the transparency -- and that means, as always, the main character here is character. More accurately, the integrity of the person you're weighing as a potential life partner. That tells you how much you can count on what they promise. It's not about the number of kids or pets, per se, because to treat that as a certainty is to deny how much of a say reality gets. All kinds of stuff can change, go wrong, pleasantly surprise you. (Hello, multiples.)

So -- back to your situation. You "quickly learned" his true preferences. Are you certain he did not come about that change of heart honestly? You say you were baited and switched -- which matters, because it is a towering plate of horse brownies that you "had to go along." Unless you live where divorce is illegal, you chose to go along.

If you chose to go along knowing your husband deceived you, then you -- and your dogless only child, unfortunately -- are lying in the beds you and your husband made. It's not all on him. He lied, but you stayed married to bad character, and you have nursed your resentment right up to posting this question. That is going to wear you down -- on top of the other predictable outcomes of eventually rotting out your marriage from the inside and deeply confusing your kid.

Please, get some counseling. Just you. Say out loud the foundational problem: "Shortly after we married, I discovered my husband lied to me about something huge -- and I thought I could get past it, so I stayed. But the anger is inside me every. day."

If I've called this wrong, then I'm sorry. But it's what I feel here throughout. And I don't see any answer to the, "What do I say to our kid?" question really mattering until you deal with the rage in the room.

Emotionally numb?
Guest Sep 26, 11:53 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi! Love your column. I've noticed myself feeling emotionally really numb to the array of things happening in the world. our nation, etc. Almost like my emotional center said, "nope, can't take any more." Is this something others are feeling? (or not-feeling?)
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Hi! Thank you.

I think somewhere between a squillion and a crap ton of people are feeling this, yes. Scientifically speaking.

It's confusing, too, because it's both protective and unnerving at the same time. Your emotional center is taking a moment to withdraw from the overwhelm, reasonably, but overall it feels weird and wrong.

[Here's the usual disclaimer that I am not a mental health professional of any kind, and that seeing one of the licensed kind can be a real benefit when things feel haywire. If you're asking, "Should I see someone?" then my answer is, why wouldn't you? It's not a 60-month contract.]

Butanyway. Something to try for the numbness -- or just the things-happening-in-the-world-ness, numb from it or not -- is beauty. Collectively experienced, if possible, like a concert or other performance, or a walk with someone at sunset, or an art exhibit. Photo albums of people you love can be healing, too -- total waterworks here if they hit me at the right moment. Or creating art. Movement helps so much; there is a proven link between physical activity and the ability to sort our feelings. What unlocks your feelings is such a personal thing, so I'll leave you to it.

I offer for your consideration, Ned's World.

Stingy In-laws
Guest Sep 26, 11:54 a.m.
QUESTION: I agree it deserves a follow-up if it's out of character for them, but I can completely see (in fact have seen) my in laws do this and they are just selfish and clueless. My MIL doesn't eat much food and my FIL is stingy and has no clue how to welcome or host anyone. When he's hassling us to visit, it's to serve his own interest of having my husband perform household chores for him and to check his ego box of "my kids and grandkids like me" (not true, unfortunately for him).) It has nothing to do with welcoming his kids and grandkids and making them comfortable. We avoid visiting and bring our own supplies when we do.

How do I move on?
Guest Sep 26, 12:14 p.m.
QUESTION: I really need to dress more professionally, so when I came into a small inheritance this summer, I decided to treat myself to a pricy online stylist. I hated it and my wardrobe isn’t any better, plus now I feel worse about my body and clothes. I’d like to move on, but I find myself dwelling on it—not only the money, but also I feel so foolish to have gotten such high hopes about this experience. I’m angry at myself and now buying clothes just seems so much harder. I hate that I feel so powerless and bad at clothes, but I really do need better work clothing for my job (just got a promotion, btw, so I must be doing something right). How can I stop this negativity towards myself and put this behind me? It seems like such a stupid problem with everything else going on.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whoa, whoa. Being mean to yourself is not a stupid problem because you live with you 24-7 -- and never feeling good in your body and clothes is not a stupid problem because you're in those 24-7. So breathe. Be kind. Let yourself be validly problemed.

You had the right idea with calling in reinforcements -- it just sounds as if you need a real in-person person helping you, not an online stylist. Not just anyone, either, but one you can trust on a bunch of levels. Mainly it needs to be someone you feel you can say no to, so you don't succumb to sales pressure and buy things that don't genuinely feel great. But you also need to trust this person's eye for style, and suitability to your body and environment.

I wish I knew where to send you for this unicorn, but it's not an off-the-shelf hiring situation. It depends on the stores in your area, whether they offer this service or whether you can hire someone independently as a consultant. Or maybe it's an acquaintance with fabulous taste, who knows. Even then, when you find someone, don't go all-in. Get a few things and see how right they are for you, then if you're pleased, go back for more.

Meanwhile, take the stuff you bought that you don't like and list it on resale sites (if you have the time and the give-a-damn) or heave it into a donation bin and be done with it. Purge the regrets from your closet.

In other words, on both fronts, put this behind you by giving yourself a 100 percent do-over. You have the money, and -- "with everything else going on" -- it's just clothes, right? So instead of using that truth to shame yourself, use it to give yourself a break.

Visit to InLaws
Guest Sep 26, 12:25 p.m.
QUESTION: I’m also concerned about this, but what strikes me is the apparent total reliance on things that didn’t require cooking. Unless this is the way the in-laws have always eaten? I’ve had several older relatives who have really lost the ability to prepare food - two because of an inability to navigate the kitchen and to stand for any length of time, and three because of dementia. One who technically still could have cooked just developed a tendency to forget that she should cook - or even eat regularly. In every case symptoms it seems like we should have seen earlier were an over- reliance on food that didn’t require any preparation (packaged chips, breakfast bars or cookies, sometimes fruit or cold cuts) and claims to have plans to prepare food (like the cobbler) that never materialized. Maybe one of the older couple in this case used to prepare all the food, and no longer can, and this is their partner’s way of compensating? It’s possible that a detailed conversation about what and how and when the in-laws are managing to feed themselves when nobody else is around is a good idea.

Just a PSA: My queue is filled with tales of parents who have gotten older and, when hosting, started serving one cracker for a family of 12. So I think we can mark it down as a Thing That Happens. Of course it comes with other adjustments, such as bringing one's own food on visits, keeping an eye on whether they're eating when no one's around, whether it's time for someone else to host, etc. I think that covers it. Thanks everyone.

QUESTION: You are not alone by any stretch. At the risk of being put on the ENEMIES LIST for advocating science, I'll suggest reading this article from Scientific American a few months ago. It addresses what happens in the brain and offers some helpful coping.

Also, please do be aware that anxiety and depression can go hand in hand even though they are sort of opposite sides of the same coin (described to me once by a person with a long history of coping with both a "I am worried and care about all the things all the time in an endless spiraling loop (clinical anxiety) and I really don't care about anything at all ever (clinical depression)."

Dogs=Kids?
Guest Sep 26, 1:04 p.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn, Thank you for your column and wisdom. I have several dogs and several children. Someone close to me has a dog but no children. They repeatedly claim that having dogs is "just like having kids". This seems so out of touch that it is not worth rebutting and yet it is driving me crazy. Indeed there is a responsibility for both as vulnerable beings but help me out here. What to say to them or how to place this so it doesn't keep rubbing me wrong? TIA.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I see the wisdom of letting it go as beneath serious notice -- the reasoning behind it is, at least. When you can crate children for six hours or board them for weeks when you travel, then maybe we can talk seriously about the comparison.

But someone who feels the need to assert this repeatedly is, you would think, working on some kind of knot inside emotionally. It's clearly front-of-mind. In a person close to you, that is worth sincere notice -- the thoughtful, non-defensive kind -- next time they make this claim. "That seems to be on your mind a lot." You can stop there to see how they fill the silence. Or serve it up: "Anything you want to talk about?"

Could be a few things -- weighing having kids, sad about not having kids, tired of someone's pressure campaign to have kids, tired of being treated as less-than for not having kids (never hurts to check yourself for ways you might unwittingly contribute).

Unfortunately, if it's nothing and this person is just super dog-smitten and a tad myopic, or this is their conversational tic, they're probably not going to recognize the secondary message, "OMG you will not shut up about this."

But if you've ruled out the possibility that you're reacting defensively to a person who's in pain, then I don't see why two people who are close can't have a real conversation about it.

Friend back with abuser
Guest Sep 26, 1:05 p.m.
QUESTION: My friend is back with her abuser (pretty unstable dude with an alcohol issue), and now she's cutting people off a LOT. She cut off her very best friend for telling her to leave the abuser, and now she's saying that she "might" cut me off "in a few days" over a trivial political disagreement. How do I resolve this with her, and, how do I stop feeling like s--- about it? Thanks.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: 1. You don't "resolve this with her." Your friend is pretty unstable too, it seems? So your role is not to be the savior or fixer, but instead the safe place for her to go when she decides she's ready to stabilize.

2. I don't know that you're supposed to feel okay when someone you care about is self-destructing. It's awful, scary, sad.

Maddening sometimes, too, because you look at her choices and think "Omg how can you possibly not see a disaster coming here? And why do I seem to care more about you than you do!?"

It's also hard to know when to get involved and when not to. It's easy from the keyboard to say, "She has to decide when she's ready to accept help," blah blah blah (yes, I'm looking at me), but when you're a witness, it's hard to convey just how many times you ask yourself whether you'll forever regret not doing X if Y happens. It's a kind of torture.

Still. The answer is, and can only be, to make sure your friend knows you will pick up your phone 24-7 or darn close to it, and you will get her, no questions asked. This tells her she is worthwhile, and you care, and she has a place to go for help.

Re: Response to Ask Dad
Guest Sep 26, 1:14 p.m.
QUESTION: You don't even need the husband to have done a bait-and-switch to ask yourself if you're right together. I was married to a man who didn't want a second child (we had a second--a legit accident) or pets. I convinced myself it was okay because he was such a good person and we were compatible in other ways.

But it wasn't just about the kid and pets. It was about him wanting most of my attention. It was about him not tolerating a relaxed and sometimes chaotic family life. It was about his difficulty engaging with others. It was about his preference to spend money on his hobbies rather than on living things. I'm not saying those things are wrong. I'm saying they didn't, ultimately, fit my priorities.

So now I'm married to someone else, and we have a blended family and 5 rescue pets and are very involved with our community. The warning signal, way back when, was that I couldn't imagine a life without a pet and he couldn't tolerate the idea of a life with one. And it was a total tip-of-the-iceberg situation that took years to become apparent.

UPDATE - Husband and yard

QUESTION: Hello Carolyn!!!

I wrote you a while back about my husband’s layoff and strange obsession with the yard. You gave me lots to consider, and thanks to your input I approached him with curiosity and empathy, instead of accusing him.

You were absolutely spot-on with your assessment that he isn’t exactly neurotypical. Apparently, he didn’t bother telling me he was involved in a whistleblower case!! That was why he was gone for long stretches of time.

I can’t get into details (ongoing court case) but suffice to say I am so, SO proud of my husband for doing the right thing, even if he could have spared me a lot of stress by just talking about it…

QUESTION: Not to overreact to your post, but treating yourself with kindness is imperative not only with respect to wardrobe mistakes, but mistakes in general - I guess I just saw the “I must be doing something right,” in describing your promotion, as suggesting a bit of anxiety and perfectionism that might carry over into the workplace, not just your wardrobe, and it’s good to be aware of that as well. You are not your clothes, you are not your wardrobe - not that either is unimportant, just that they’re not the be-all and end-all, and mistakes are inevitable. And congratulations on your promotion!

dogs and kids from someone who didn't end up having kids
Guest Sep 26, 1:45 p.m.
QUESTION: I never had kids, which was not what I imagined. I actually imagined having four kids! I did end up having step kids, who were a little older when I came along, and I have had dogs. I have totally had the impulse to relate to someone with kids about how I take care of my dog, and most of the time have never blurted it out loud. I think what could be in play is that you can feel so isolated from the world being someone who doesn't have kids. There is that whole, "You just don't understand -love - -commitment- - fear- etc" until you've had a child sentiment. And I know I don't understand. But I do kind of, as a feeling human being, and someone who has informally mentored lots of kids, and stepmothered two kids, and yes, raised puppies. I guess what I am saying is try to be generous that your friend may be wanting to feel included, that they are not some non-contributing, non-sacrificing member of society because they didn't have that experience.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Thanks for your message, it's on point and refreshing.

The one you cited really gets under my skin: "There is that whole, 'You just don't understand -love - -commitment- - fear- etc until you've had a child' sentiment." There is a huge difference between the whole having-dogs vs having-kids comparison, which is concrete, to the "you don't know love/commitment/fear" extensions of that reasoning, which are so abstract, individualized and totally unfounded.

To be clear, the whole comparison of experience thing is suspect to begin with. It's so rarely necessary to point out to people what they "just don't understand." If we're about to say that, we really really need to ask ourselves if this is about advancing the cause of greater understanding or puffing up ourselves.

But in the rare cases when someone does need to say something, the whole area of what someone feels is not a valid basis for comparison, because no one can possibly know that - vs. has actually done, facts only, which can be compared.

Fence guy update
Guest Sep 26, 1:59 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi, I'm the guy whose neighbor kids keep jumping our fence. First off, I don't know why so man y people thought my dog is the problem and not the trespassing. Our dog is a rescue who wants nothing more than to chill in her yard and doesn't even like to leave it for walks. She deserves her peaceful backyard so we're gong ahead with a 6 foot stockade fence. Thanks for taking my question

ANSWER: You're welcome, glad you wrote back with an update.

The dog vs. kids isn't a value judgment, it's a reality judgment. Kids shouldn't be in your yard. That's simple. I agree with you. Dog shouldn't be an issue. Also simple. I can even add the parenting layer: Parents should keep their kids out of your yard. Of course.

But then you factor reality into it. Kids don't have fully developed forebrains. Parents don't hover over their kids 24-7. The kids might even listen to their parents and stop jumping your fence -- yay! -- but then they have a friend over who doesn't know the rules, and jumps the fence. What I'm saying is, there are so many things you can't control about the neighbors, tweens, that side of the fence.

A dog, meanwhile, is ... well, if you've been here before, you know how I feel about dogs. But if anything goes wrong, ask cops, animal control, insurers -- there's a not-zero chance it'll be the dog's fault. Especially a big dog. Plus, you can't tell your dog the rules.

That's the long answer about my answer. The short answer is, "should" is a lousy planning strategy.

A good planning strategy is to look at what is likely to happen, then what you don't want to happen, then what forms of prevention are in your control.

Do you want the answer you want, or an answer that can work.

QUESTION: My husband picked a stupid fight with me yesterday and I’m not sure how to move on. I’m 39 weeks pregnant and have had a cold all week, but I was making dinner for us when he got home late from a work happy hour. He started criticizing how I chop garlic, which he has brought up recently and I’ve told him to drop it. He would not let it go last night until I lost my temper and screamed at him that he’d be sleeping somewhere else if he didn’t shut up. I said that unless it’s a safety issue (it’s not), he shouldn’t be telling another autonomous adult how to cook especially since he has no culinary training. He finally let it go after I yelled at him and made him go to the bedroom so I could cool off while I finished cooking. But we never fight like this so I’m left wondering what do I do now?

ANSWER: You go back to him and say okay wt[h] was that? Because, whatever it was, it was not about garlic, and you and he need to figure that out here and now.

I'm not saying this happened here, but some people actually do pick fights when they're anxious -- it's a way of seeking release. It's also super immature, obviously. Like, find your own way to process instead of getting all up in my grill.

Now, you, presumably not one to scream? have your own pent up stress at the moment. It could just be a one-off for both of you.

But it's something to consider here. If this is in any way a pattern, then seeing it before anyone reacts can really help. Ideally the person will get some, ah, counseling to learn better stress management, but if you see the nitpicking for what it is, then you can say, "Nope what's really bugging you?" and sometimes get from A to B without the detour into the proxy argument.

Oh, and small fix: "I said that unless it’s a safety issue (it’s not), he shouldn’t be telling another autonomous adult how to cook especially since he is having dinner made for him by an enormously pregnant person while he was at happy hour."

To: dogs and kids from someone who didn't end up having kids

QUESTION: As a parent of human children who has no pets, I would love to hear your experience of parenting a dog! Fine, maybe there are technical differences in the parenting experiences (e.g. dogs are less likely to make fun of your outfit), but love is love is love. It's great to hear about love in all forms. I hope you feel more free to blurt it out loud :)

QUESTION: “Happy hour” could also have contributed to raising anxieties/lowering barriers to expressing them.

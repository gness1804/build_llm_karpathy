QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, Happy Halloween!

There is a ring of moms in my neighborhood, we've all become friends as many of us are staying home with our young children. One mom, "Paige," loves to make treats for the kids, give them all little gifts (for example she left them all a "boo basket" last night that they found this morning upon waking up), and invite people to send their kids over for a couple hours if we have an errand to run. It is all so lovely and kind, and yet she NEVER lets anyone reciprocate. I have invited her countless times to let me watch her daughter while she steps out (as a bonus, this would help entertain my kids, who love playing with hers), but she always says no even if I know she does not have an alternative. There is no real space for anyone else to do things like the boo baskets because she always does it so well and so early that we can't really compete.

Is it ok that some people are just givers who never want to take? (But, I don't want it to be thought that my family takes and doesn't give!)

ANSWER: There may be no space to give back, I've definitely seen this -- but is there no space for conversation, either? One-on-one with Paige: "You do so much for the rest of us -- always so kind and thoughtful. I am not comfortable, though, with how lopsided things have become. I have never been a 'taker.' If you won't let me reciprocate in kind by watching your daughter, then will you at least name something I can do to put the accounts more in balance?"

She may still rebuff you, but at least then you will be on the record with your discomfort with taking advantage. Not to get too alarmist or put ideas in your head, but a mom who always hosts and never ever ever lets other parents reciprocate may have had a bad experience herself as a child in another's care and this may be her way of being vigilant without denying her kid a full community social life. Just ... I don't know. There are plenty of other possible explanations but it rang a bell, let's say.

The second thing this conversation accomplishes -- again, assuming Paige doesn't respond with some concrete suggestion for you -- is to free you from any expectation that she will say yes to balance. Now you can take it upon yourself to do something nice for Paige on your own. Pay attention, see where she shops for treats or how she decorates or what she does for fun or whatever, and buy her gift cards periodically and generally spoil her a little. Presumably she won't give things back?

QUESTION: I think if you had come out and said that you were going to change up your production commitment. We would all understand. But the sudden cut of the cartoons and daily columns was a bit abrupt, hence why some people want to know why they can't see you as usual. In the Post we got used to yours being the only reliable column to appear in the Style section. Now not so much. I've always loved your snark and honesty and understood why you went from 2-3 questions daily to one but I know it had to be a huge burden to do daily. So go ahead and dial it back but admit to it. I retired so can you.

ANSWER: I did! I came right out and said it. In the chat right before it happened, and then there was a notice on the columns that published that week.

I suggested I film myself doing an interpretive dance, but that was voted down. Ned was the decisive vote, brindly little twit.

(I really, really don't understand any of this, and am not retiring, as the announcement spelled out. And the 2-3 questions to 1 thing? Um. That was basic evolution. Every advice column out there does quick hits, so I decided to go the other way -- but not in some announcement-worthy moment of discovery, but gradually.)

--Mystified at My Desk
Husband's therapist seems to want him to cheat.
QUESTION: Several months ago I found some old messages my husband had sent to young women on an "arrangements" website. It was apparent he never followed through, but I was devastated. After lots of tears and pleading from him, I agreed to stay with him, but only if he agreed to therapy.

The problem is, his therapist, a guy, has emboldened him. Before, he was emphatic that he was in the wrong, that it was a moment of weakness, and that it would never happen again. But now, he's almost indignant, saying our sex drive used to be the same but now mine is much lower, and that I have a responsibility to tend to his needs, one way or the other. He's pushing me to have sex (when he knows I'm less interested), to take libido-enhancing drugs (which he knows I'm against), and even that I should agree to let him be fill his needs with these "arrangements" since his love for me has not changed (using marital money and exposing me to disease).

The worst part is that he's weaponizing his therapist against me. All this pushing is at his therapist's behest, and when I push back, and tell him to stop violating my boundaries, I'm met with "but my therapist said X" and then he won't budge. Someone wrote on chat a few months ago about a spouse using their therapist as a marital appeals court, and that's what it feels like.

Truthfully I want him to stop seeing this therapist who is putting all these marriage-ending ideas in his head, and to stick with his first instincts -- that he screwed up and won't do it again. But I'm the one who insisted on therapy so I don't know how I do this. Advice?

ANSWER: I can see why you want the therapist off the scene. Your husband's "first instincts" response sounded much more in your favor -- mainly because it let you believe this would all go away and you could go back to the marriage you thought you had before your awful discovery.

Thing is, that whole "my bad" and "I'll never do it again" reaction is a panic response from someone who doesn't want to break anything. It's scary to think it might all be over in an instant. So people, when caught, tend to do what your husband did and try desperately, reflexively to hold the status quo together. This doesn't make the underlying stuff go away.

I (and you) don't know that the therapist is saying to your husband. But I have a pretty good idea, if he's doing his job, that he's getting at the unhappiness and frustration that led your husband to sneak around on websites. And urging your husband to talk to you instead. Wouldn't that make sense, when you see it spelled out that way?

The therapist could be guiding your husband (not advising, remember, that's not what they do) to say out loud how unhappy he is that you decided unilaterally without conversation or remediation effort that sex would dwindle to near nothingness, and that he would have no recourse because you were also deciding unilaterally that it was monogamy or bust -- again without conversation.

This is, arguably, a fair beef -- not the unilateral decision on sex, because that is what it is (the alternative being rape), but the "without conversation." I say arguably because two people can differ on what "no" conversation or effort means.

It's also possible your husband came home from this work and spun it as "My therapist says you owe me X." You don't know how well he's representing the therapy. And no means no regardless, once conversation is had -- but it's discussion of options and recourse between you.

So, two possible ways out of this blind alley. One is to see if your husband (and the therapist) will agree to have you join him for a session. The other is to enter couples counseling in addition to your husband's individual. Pretty common configuration. You could also do both, sequentially. But expecting to shoo away the problem with the therapist is not realistic. I'm sorry.

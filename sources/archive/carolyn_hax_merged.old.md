Hear the ghost story of Mrs. Kyle, twice buried but alive in local lore

Column | A 6-year research project found a surprisingly simple route to happiness

Boo.

Spooky season special, a Post ghost story! Two ghost stories, in fact. I mean come on.

Also, a desperation season special (which I meant to post last week but forgot). It seemed on point for this group: "a sort of happiness hack for our chaotic times." It's from Milbank's pivot to peacing out, and his column is worth a follow -- it's aimed right at the screaming part of our brains.

Neighborhood mom gives but never takes
Guest11:05 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, Happy Halloween!

There is a ring of moms in my neighborhood, we've all become friends as many of us are staying home with our young children. One mom, "Paige," loves to make treats for the kids, give them all little gifts (for example she left them all a "boo basket" last night that they found this morning upon waking up), and invite people to send their kids over for a couple hours if we have an errand to run. It is all so lovely and kind, and yet she NEVER lets anyone reciprocate. I have invited her countless times to let me watch her daughter while she steps out (as a bonus, this would help entertain my kids, who love playing with hers), but she always says no even if I know she does not have an alternative. There is no real space for anyone else to do things like the boo baskets because she always does it so well and so early that we can't really compete.

Is it ok that some people are just givers who never want to take? (But, I don't want it to be thought that my family takes and doesn't give!)

ANSWER: There may be no space to give back, I've definitely seen this -- but is there no space for conversation, either? One-on-one with Paige: "You do so much for the rest of us -- always so kind and thoughtful. I am not comfortable, though, with how lopsided things have become. I have never been a 'taker.' If you won't let me reciprocate in kind by watching your daughter, then will you at least name something I can do to put the accounts more in balance?"

She may still rebuff you, but at least then you will be on the record with your discomfort with taking advantage. Not to get too alarmist or put ideas in your head, but a mom who always hosts and never ever ever lets other parents reciprocate may have had a bad experience herself as a child in another's care and this may be her way of being vigilant without denying her kid a full community social life. Just ... I don't know. There are plenty of other possible explanations but it rang a bell, let's say.

The second thing this conversation accomplishes -- again, assuming Paige doesn't respond with some concrete suggestion for you -- is to free you from any expectation that she will say yes to balance. Now you can take it upon yourself to do something nice for Paige on your own. Pay attention, see where she shops for treats or how she decorates or what she does for fun or whatever, and buy her gift cards periodically and generally spoil her a little. Presumably she won't give things back?

Wait, there's more to my intro that I forgot ... I will be off next Friday for more routine maintenance. Back the Friday after as usual.

Sorry I was a couple of minutes late today, too, I get stuck in pre-reading sometimes, even when I set alarms. Please accept this Ned as a gesture of healing. (Can you see where the ball is, off frame?)

Your column
Guest11:27 a.m.
QUESTION: I think if you had come out and said that you were going to change up your production commitment. We would all understand. But the sudden cut of the cartoons and daily columns was a bit abrupt, hence why some people want to know why they can't see you as usual. In the Post we got used to yours being the only reliable column to appear in the Style section. Now not so much. I've always loved your snark and honesty and understood why you went from 2-3 questions daily to one but I know it had to be a huge burden to do daily. So go ahead and dial it back but admit to it. I retired so can you.

ANSWER: I did! I came right out and said it. In the chat right before it happened, and then there was a notice on the columns that published that week.

I suggested I film myself doing an interpretive dance, but that was voted down. Ned was the decisive vote, brindly little twit.

(I really, really don't understand any of this, and am not retiring, as the announcement spelled out. And the 2-3 questions to 1 thing? Um. That was basic evolution. Every advice column out there does quick hits, so I decided to go the other way -- but not in some announcement-worthy moment of discovery, but gradually.)

Husband's therapist seems to want him to cheat.
Guest11:35 a.m.
QUESTION: Several months ago I found some old messages my husband had sent to young women on an "arrangements" website. It was apparent he never followed through, but I was devastated. After lots of tears and pleading from him, I agreed to stay with him, but only if he agreed to therapy.

The problem is, his therapist, a guy, has emboldened him. Before, he was emphatic that he was in the wrong, that it was a moment of weakness, and that it would never happen again. But now, he's almost indignant, saying our sex drive used to be the same but now mine is much lower, and that I have a responsibility to tend to his needs, one way or the other. He's pushing me to have sex (when he knows I'm less interested), to take libido-enhancing drugs (which he knows I'm against), and even that I should agree to let him be fill his needs with these "arrangements" since his love for me has not changed (using marital money and exposing me to disease).

The worst part is that he's weaponizing his therapist against me. All this pushing is at his therapist's behest, and when I push back, and tell him to stop violating my boundaries, I'm met with "but my therapist said X" and then he won't budge. Someone wrote on chat a few months ago about a spouse using their therapist as a marital appeals court, and that's what it feels like.

Truthfully I want him to stop seeing this therapist who is putting all these marriage-ending ideas in his head, and to stick with his first instincts -- that he screwed up and won't do it again. But I'm the one who insisted on therapy so I don't know how I do this. Advice?

ANSWER: I can see why you want the therapist off the scene. Your husband's "first instincts" response sounded much more in your favor -- mainly because it let you believe this would all go away and you could go back to the marriage you thought you had before your awful discovery.

Thing is, that whole "my bad" and "I'll never do it again" reaction is a panic response from someone who doesn't want to break anything. It's scary to think it might all be over in an instant. So people, when caught, tend to do what your husband did and try desperately, reflexively to hold the status quo together. This doesn't make the underlying stuff go away.

I (and you) don't know that the therapist is saying to your husband. But I have a pretty good idea, if he's doing his job, that he's getting at the unhappiness and frustration that led your husband to sneak around on websites. And urging your husband to talk to you instead. Wouldn't that make sense, when you see it spelled out that way?

The therapist could be guiding your husband (not advising, remember, that's not what they do) to say out loud how unhappy he is that you decided unilaterally without conversation or remediation effort that sex would dwindle to near nothingness, and that he would have no recourse because you were also deciding unilaterally that it was monogamy or bust -- again without conversation.

This is, arguably, a fair beef -- not the unilateral decision on sex, because that is what it is (the alternative being rape), but the "without conversation." I say arguably because two people can differ on what "no" conversation or effort means.

It's also possible your husband came home from this work and spun it as "My therapist says you owe me X." You don't know how well he's representing the therapy. And no means no regardless, once conversation is had -- but it's discussion of options and recourse between you.

So, two possible ways out of this blind alley. One is to see if your husband (and the therapist) will agree to have you join him for a session. The other is to enter couples counseling in addition to your husband's individual. Pretty common configuration. You could also do both, sequentially. But expecting to shoo away the problem with the therapist is not realistic. I'm sorry.

Needing a break doesn't mean I don't care
Guest11:57 a.m.
QUESTION: Hello. I’m having a difficult time conversing with my teenager (age 17) about politics and world events. We’re mostly on the same page as far as values and concerns. The difficulty lies in my needing time away from all the doom scrolling and negative energy. He wants to talk about politics and what is wrong in the world all the time. I do not. We do have lots of conversations about these topics, but I cannot handle it 24/7. When I say I don't feel up to continuing a conversation, he says “well I can’t just ignore that this stuff is happening.” When I try to talk about something positive, his response is to find the negative. It’s like we live in a Debbie Downer episode.

I’ve explained that needing time away from negative news doesn’t mean I’m ignoring it, don’t agree with him, don’t think it’s real, or don’t care about it. We’ve talked about focusing on what you can do now, rather than spending all your time agonizing about an uncertain future. We’ve talked about finding pleasure in small things, which will invariably turn into a conversation about something negative about that nice thing. (Like, I say the flowers in the garden look so pretty right now and he says, not for long with how we’re ruining the environment). It’s not like I don’t think about these issues, but I find value in spending time appreciating things just to appreciate them regardless of where we’re headed as a society.

Some background in case it helps – my child does suffer from anxiety and depression (as do I) and is already on medication and in therapy (as am I). He is also on the spectrum and tends to obsess over topics.

I wish I could help him see the value in turning off the negativity, and that doing so doesn't mean you don't care. I don’t know how to do that beyond what I’m already doing, but I would love some suggestions. As I'm writing this I'm also realizing that I am sad because it seems like my child doesn't respect me or see that I do really care about this stuff. I'm not sure there's an answer for that part.

ANSWER: All the elements of this -- the over-talking, the doom looping, the anxiety and depression, the parenting challenge -- all point to relief in the form of a concrete action framework.

For example, your kid needs things he can do right now, vs. talking about focusing on things he can do now. Canvassing/phone banking if he's into politics, omg food banks need everything -- any community organizing or volunteering. But apolitical works too, like an animal shelter.

You and your kid would get along better if you were doing this productive thing together, including talking about it for specific organizational purposes, instead of talking generally about all the problems.

Your correct diagnosis of negativity exhaustion, and your prescription of "talk about something positive," would land more effectively if it were part of a cycle of effectiveness: You will do your Productive Thing better if you take this rest period to restore your productivity. This is where your kid is right now. Bonus, this is also correct -- the most productive people are the ones who rest. So you won't be trying to sell flowers to your kid in the vacuum of pleasestoptalkingIneedflowers!!! anymore, which obviously doesn't resonate with him. You can even incorporate two other truths: Beauty and peace are what you're fighting the negativity for, right? So it makes sense to devote time to appreciating those, too. And, you can also actively cultivate them. The values don't promote themselves. Plant and nurture, literally and figuratively.

Do, though, take the "it seems like my child doesn't respect me" out of it. He's 17, there's a good, developmental chance he's actively hating you right now. He's just doing his job, though, of differentiating himself from you, and the more personally you take it, the harder you make it for him. Just love him and trust he loves you through all the aaaaaaarghggggghhhh (wait -- can you mentally conjure the Tasmanian Devil cartoon sound? Imagine that's his psyche till 18-ish. It helps.)

Husband’s therapist
Guest12:00 p.m.
QUESTION: It could be that the therapist is encouraging the husband to be more upfront about his sexual needs, and Husband is taking it the extra step (all on his own), after being validated that his feelings and needs exist, to assuming ergo he is entitled to having things “his way”. The therapist may only be encouraging him to start the conversation. If the husband is going from that “point A” zooming past discussion to his own “Point Z” of feeling allowed to bully and gaslight to get what he wants, I see many many red flags a-waving that have more to do with the husband than the therapist.

Re: Neighborhood mom gives but never takes
Guest12:05 p.m.
QUESTION: If you and Paige are part of a group of friends, surely the lot of you have gone to get coffee at some point, correct? If not, try suggesting that. Once you know Paige's specific order of coffee/tea/whatever, occasionally get one for her and drop it off at her house. This works best if it's on a random afternoon, FYI. And on the off chance that Paige ever has an extreme emergency and asks if she can take you up on the child care offer, do that if at all possible -- life is full of the unexpected. On a side note, both you and Paige sound delightful -- thanks for making the world a kinder place.

ANSWER: Into 2/3 and 1/3, unless one of the parties wants to treat everyone, and I'm answering this incredibly obvious question only because I hear there are still people out there who try to stick the single with half because it's "easier," and NO, people do not get to make their crappy arithmetic skills anyone else's problem. Which includes forcing the single person into the awkward "nope" position.

Was that the question?

Therapy as a condition
Guest12:17 p.m.
QUESTION: I once made therapy a condition of staying with a partner. The partner did get into therapy (desperately didn't want to have to leave our home), but did it for my reasons not theirs. Of course it didn't go the way I hoped. The person has to be in therapy for their own reasons, not on someone else's orders. My then-partner tried and did make a little progress but not with the issues that had led me to set that condition. Later (after we broke up), my ex started therapy for other reasons--their own reasons--and made much more progress over a period of a few years. I learned a lot of lessons from that relationship and breakup in terms of what is mine and what is the other person's. I would never ever set that condition again.

Needing a break doesn't mean I don't care
Guest12:17 p.m.
QUESTION: Advice I give to everyone: pick your lane. Pick your movement or issue and focus your time, energy, attention, money there. Trust that the people in the other movements are doing their work in their lane just like you're doing work in yours. They will tap you in when they need you; you will tap them in when you need them. One of us can't solve every problem -- and if we spend all our time trying to solve everything, we'll be too burnt out to solve anything. Also rest and joy are resistance :)

Re: husband’s therapist
Guest12:28 p.m.
QUESTION: What Carolyn said, but I’d also ask yourself this - what, if anything, are you willing to do to address your husband’s unhappiness with the state of your sex life, including, as Carolyn suggests, sitting down to talk to him about it? Or talking to a therapist or other medical professional to see what possibilities are out there to improve things for both of you? I’d also question your assumption that the therapist is putting ideas in your husband’s head - clearly, he’s been unhappy about the state of your marriage for some time, and your response - at least as detailed here - is for him to bury that unhappiness somewhere, and never talk about it - and for both of you to continue to do nothing constructive to address it.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Right, thanks. It is really easy to vilify someone who is doing and saying all the sketchy stuff this husband is doing -- and, in fairness, the extent of the sketchiness may be more than the marriage can or should withstand. But that doesn't change the fact of the mutual responsibility in a marriage to hear each other out and respect each other's needs and feelings -- even as each of you retains full veto power over your individual actions. All his wrongness doesn't make it a valid option to, like you said, "bury that unhappiness somewhere, and never talk about it."

For what it's worth, I'm loving the videos (and I usually hate video format.)

Thank you, glad you like the video.

Since I'm here, I'll knock out some other business, too:

We're in planning stages on a couple of projects, so, feel free to write in what you'd like to see. New cartoons won't come back (thank you for missing them, I am glad they made a difference) but you all have been such a big part of what I do that I'd love to hear from you.

Where is the line?
Guest12:59 p.m.
QUESTION: Where is the line between a reasonable ask of a partner and asking them to change who they are?

I'm not talking about abuse - I'm talking about (for example), a complete one-sided overhaul of a communication style that otherwise works in other areas of their life (both personally and professionally).

I've been struggling with this for over a year - both in and out of therapy - and still don't feel like I have a good answer for this. I feel like my spouse married a direct, confident, assertive, gets-stuff-done person and then seems to resent the fact that their spouse is direct, confident, assertive, and gets-stuff-done.

I also recognize that it can be a lot to be with a person like me, and that there's (always) room for me to improve as a person and inject more thoughtfulness into my communication. I think I've gotten a lot better at asking questions and reigning in places where assertiveness could veer into steamrolling.

But I also don't think that change in communication can be one sided, and he resists my (and our couples therapist's) ongoing point that we need to meet in the middle on communication changes because there's two of us involved.

Any insight on the line between reasonable behavior modification vs change who you fundamentally are would be appreciated. I'm willing to - and have - done the former, but I'm not willing to do the later, and I'm starting to suspect that's where we're stuck.

And I am so, so, tired and have even less energy than normal to navigate this given *gestures vaguely.*
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Hard to answer, because such a line is personal, of course.

But i think there is a fair way to look at it generally that takes into account different personalities.

Being human has two types of "work." There's the work of life management, such as chores and a job and keeping cars safe and registered. Then there's the work of self-management, which includes hygiene, emotional regulation, social awareness. Oversimplified, but I'm too slow as it is.

When you're with someone, you need to manage your workload in both. Hold up your share of the chores and other life management, and not let the self-management slide.

Good so far.

To my mind, a couple isn't working when being in it demands too much work in either category. Now, their life work might just be crazy -- young kids, etc. -- and as long as they're sharing it and both equally flat out exhausted with "too much" work, then okay. That's temporary and they can get through it, and true sharing means they're a good pair. It's lopsidedness that will doom them -- when one is doing everything and the other says "You wanted kids I didn't!" or whatever.

That is also true of self-management work. If you're kind of a mess and your partner asks you to get some help, and you're in therapy and it's hard, but you're learning healthier ways, then your self-management work will go up for a bit but ultimately go down as you get healthier. That's a good thing.

If instead you're being asked by your partner to, basically, suppress yourself into a little box (because you're "loud" or whatever), then you're going to work yourself to exhaustion on the self-management side, trying to be someone you're not.

That, to me, is the line: when being with someone doesn't make your life better, but instead drains or exhausts you (in a chore sense or self-management sense), with no prospect of improvement.

Hope that helps.

Bad Wife?
Guest1:18 p.m.
QUESTION: Women in my family have the luck of going grey in their late 30's. I'm 41 and just about completely grey. Our kids are 10 and 8. My husband is asking me to dye my hair as most of the women in my family do, but I really am resisting. Its expensive, time consuming, and I don't like the chemicals (no shade to women who dye....just not me). My husband does have social anxiety and since we met in college, there are things I do to help both of us in public - I'm aware he needs to sit at the end of a row or table, know where two exits are at all times, and will review party list of names/jobs/relationships before we go out. If a place is too loud/crowded, we leave or I plan to go alone. He's saying that doesn't like the grey because of what people think - they could think I'm the kids' grandmother or that I am older than I am. He is asking me to consider dying my hair - for him. He sees it as another small thing to do to make him comfortable. He has even said good partners, good wives do things for one another and he has asked me to "strongly consider" dying my hair. He says that he thinks once I'm in my 50's everyone else will have grey. Great - so I'm looking at 15yrs of dying my hair? I'm I a bad wife for not doing it? An uncaring person if this really could help him feel more comfortable socially and ease outings?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yeah no. Sorry husband. Feeling better with multiple exits is not the same as "I need my wife to look a certain version of hot." But you can tell him I said nice try 🙄

Plus, if we're going to address the anxiety here seriously, making him comfortable is not the answer. His facing your gray and getting used to it is the winner. Anxiety is fear of something that isn't happening. Accommodating an anxiety = feeding a fear of something that isn't happening. Meaning, feeding an irrational fear.

Meaning, if he is not in treatment first, and then coming up with evidence-based solutions second, then I'm side-eyeing the effectiveness of the lot of it.

Here are my biases:

1. I think pretty gray hair looks just as pretty as any other color hair.

2. Hair dye maintenance is a colossal butt pain.

3. I think fewer dye jobs in real life are pretty or persuasive than we want (a direct extension of 2, so I feel bad saying 3, since it's really just that people have other priorities for their time and $ than to get perfect gray cover, so good for them, and they certainly don't need me critiquing the results).

Anxiety fact-check is readily available. Making his world smaller-easier is exactly counter to the recommended approach.

QUESTION: Perhaps spend some time asking your partner what they love and originally loved about you, including these aspects of your personality, to remind them that these were once desirable traits that they chose. And then focus on 1-3 things that you do that really do come off as overbearing or rude or offend them, promise to focus on those alone. But ask them to determine how to get back to loving you as you are.

QUESTION: I am also direct, assertive, etc. I had to learn to be diplomatic and kind, as well. Is that the issue? Assertive people can have trouble making room for others. Other people's opinions are just as valid and need space, just like our opinions do. Remember kindness and diplomacy if that's what is at the heart of your spouse's issue.

Or she could feel like she's been given gifts due to life circumstances (family money or whatever else she feels super grateful for) and she feels like giving back in other ways to people who haven't had all those same advantages is a way of showing gratitude to the universe for what she was given. Lots of options, most of them not nefarious. I think the conversation with her is the best approach.

QUESTION: I'm a professional woman who genuinely enjoys getting dressed. If they comment on my appearance, most people are kind, but occasionally, someone will make a very snide remark along the lines of "you poor thing in the morning", meaning they assume I take forever to get ready. One, I don't, and two, that's none of their business! Oddly enough, the people (mostly women) who say such things also tend to be well-dressed. I guess they think it's a competition, which I find distasteful. How would you respond to such remarks?

QUESTION: Why do I feel bad about myself all the time? I feel regret for things in my past, take things personally, obsess on what I may have said wrong, etc. I’m an accomplished person now retired and hate perseverating like this.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Please make an appointment to see your primary care person, then follow the breadcrumbs from there. There is no need to resign yourself to suffering and then tough this out as if it can only be about personal failings. Perseveration can be a symptom of a medical issue -- or something else, but the medical issue has the lowest barrier to entry as far as exploring causes, plus it's the logical starting point for that kind of detective work.

Meantime, as your health permits, consider also adding physical activity and mind-consuming activities. Busy is good. If you're moving forward on the two paths -- pursuing diagnosis plus keeping occupied with purpose -- you might find some quick relief.

That may help here but it wasn't until I got divorced and really needed my friends (and acquaintances, and professionals and strangers!) that I realized that my giving was self-protective. Once I had to let people do things for me, I realized the joy I had been denying them for years. Paige may think her value is in giving and it can be very hard to let that go. You may have very little influence here, even if you are honest with her.

Gray hair
Guest1:44 p.m.
QUESTION: I also come from a family where the women go gray early (starting in high school). Over the years, I saw all sorts of responses to and judgments made about individual decisions, and I guess it comes down to this, for me - do what’s right for you, period. You don’t owe anybody, including your husband, any explanation for what you decide to do with your own hair - and his extreme anxiety about what people might think is something he needs to address in his own, not through trying to control your choices.

Husband’s Therapist
Guest1:52 p.m.
QUESTION: As a retired therapist of 30 some years, I think it’s interesting that Husband uses the phrase, “My therapist says I should…”. That’s really no different than “My dad says, “ or “My boss” says or anyone in a power position says I should do this thing. It just seems to indicate that the client is still uncertain about the new change that is being requested, and needs to refer back to someone with “ credibility.” And I agree with the advice to suggest you attend a session. We therapists only know what is presented in the room, not necessarily “objective” reality. And, while it may seem counterintuitive, our stance can also be misrepresented to family/friends if the client has a different agenda than what we are aware of. Just saying.

where is the line/communication style
Guest1:55 p.m.
QUESTION: At the start of relationships, we are attracted to people who have qualities we lack. We think: Chemistry! Gratitude! You complete me! Then, in the long-term and day-by-day, enthusiasm for difference vanishes. If you aren't careful, you start to try to turn the partner into someone more like you. We all tend to do this. But the secret of long love (which is amazing, btw) is not to. He needs to modify his expectation of change. You are who you are. Your love for him won't last unless he accepts you as you are, even when your approach to life at times grates. You're getting close to your bottom line. Stare at it awhile, because he will have to give up on this project or you will have to leave. You've done what you can. The next move is his.

re: husband's therapist
Guest2:00 p.m.
QUESTION: I'm a bit disturbed at all of the responses putting the blame on the wife whose libido is lower than it used to be. That happens with age, injuries, illness, menopause, stress, etc. Mine is considerably lower thanks to all of those, and I know it frustrates my husband. I make an effort even though I could go months without sex and not care.

But in NO WAY would he look to cheat, then gaslight me and misrepresent a therapist saying the things the writer's husband is saying. He has integrity and emotional intelligence, and is not an immature, entitled jerk like this woman's husband is. She doesn't need a therapist. She needs a divorce attorney.

Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: I didn't see anyone blaming the wife for a low(er) libido. Or anyone letting the husband off the hook for poor behaviors.

Any discussion of the wife's side of the ledger was about a responsibility to communicate about things and to consider both their needs with respect vs. expect problems just to go away. To call that "blame" is a terrible misread.

Husband's therapist
Guest2:14 p.m.
QUESTION: Original poster here. Thank you for the feedback. To clarify, I agree that my husband now shares these thoughts on some level, but it's more that he's been convinced than that this is my husband's true self coming out. He's channeling his therapist, prefacing with words like "My therapist said I should explain that..." and "My therapist said you would probably respond that way..." Even the choice of words seems rehearsed. I know my husband and this is NOT the way he thinks or what he sounds like.

His therapist is in a non-monogamous relationship himself, has his own blog, and seems to be some sort of advocate of it.

I've suggested couple's therapy (which my therapist suggested too), but my husband is not interested, as he's VERY happy with the advice he's getting. Apparently his therapist did offer to talk to me in a joint session or to my therapist, but honestly I don't want to since I think the therapist's values are just so different from mine, and I don't want to join whatever cult he has going. I suppose I could let him talk to my therapist, if you think I should... but at that point, doesn't it seem like we're just handing over control of our marriage over to our therapists instead of actually having it ourselves?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Run it by your therapist before you do it, certainly, but I don't see how your going to one session and hearing it from the guy directly means you "join whatever cult he has going." To me, it would mean you confirm for yourself, firsthand, what you suspect is happening.

The whole blog thing, too -- I assume you've talked to your therapist about the ethics of what's going on?

Maybe you don't need confirmation. If your husband believes what his therapist is advocating and is "VERY happy with the advice he's getting," and if you don't even want to be in the room with it, then you're at a crossroads with your marriage, no?

I want that for you, for the two of you to have "control of our marriage," but if your husband won't cooperate, that's not something you can will yourself to have on your own.

QUESTION: Interesting and important additional details in the update from the OP - but why turn down the offers from husband’s therapist? The “control” issue here seems to be something of a distraction, if not an avoidance technique - why not get all the information you can get, and all the help you can get, to solve this problem in your marriage? And to address your husband’s dissatisfaction with the state of things, even as you both explore ways to deal with it, in ways that are comfortable for you both? At this point, what do you have to lose?

Is it possible to be a happy working mom?
Guest Oct 24, 11:08 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, here goes. Is it possible to be a happy mom who works a 9-to-5 job?

I always assumed I would stay home with my kids, at least during the early years. That is how I was raised—my mom was home throughout our entire childhoods and eventually (when my youngest sibling was 18) went to go work as an in-home aide. On reflection, she really disliked working as an aide and often made comments about wishing she had other options. Those comments were in my head as I sought out my first adult jobs. I work in HR at a midsize company and my work is predictable but challenging.

My husband and I are expecting our first baby in March and I'm starting to plan for parental leave and beyond. I am finding that, despite my original plans, I don't want to leave my job. It also doesn't make sense right now, because I bring in roughly 60% of our family's income (my husband is a schoolteacher).

Most of my friends either don't have kids yet or are stay-at-home moms. I don't have a great model for what working motherhood works like except in my coworkers, who seem frazzled and complain about their kids all the time. Obviously it's because mine is still in utero, but I can't imagine complaining that bitterly about my baby and assume it has to do with the competing demands of their lives.

I guess my overall question is whether there are working moms who are fulfilled the way stay-at-home moms are, or whether I'm letting money make a decision for me that should be moral/emotional?

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist

ANSWER: I have so many answers fighting to get out, they're all jammed into each other. I'm just going to pull them out one at a time and probably get the order all wrong.

First, I suggest you talk to your co-workers vs. observe them. Not in a judging way, either -- do not , do not come at them with, "I can't imagine complaining that bitterly about my baby." Because defenses will go up so fast they may knock you backward. If you approach in an "obviously there's some exaggeration here but you're scaring me" way, and, "I'd love to hear some good stuff," then you have a much better chance at truth. There could be an enormous gap between what they're blurting out in moments of exasperation and what they deeply feel.

Second, as long as we're doing the "most of my friends" thing -- most of my friends (vast majority) worked while they were actively rearing their kids. And not only were most of them also happy, the relatively few unhappinesses were often not related to the combination of working outside the home and being parents. So, that it might not be "possible" is astonishing to me, really. In the way that it would be astonishing to ask, "Is is possible to be a happy breather of air?"

Yes, it's challenging. Time is an issue. But being home is challenging for different reasons. Working outside the home or not isn't what makes or breaks a household. The trick is to choose what is right for your specific circumstances -- you and your partner, if you have one, and your kids, and your finances, and so on.

So, third item. If I were to construct an is-it-possible-to-be-happy scenario, I might use this phrasing: Is it possible to be happy with an "I had always assumed ___" outlook on life? Because to me, the building blocks for a satisfying life aren't in this choice or that choice or the other demographic. They're here: in openness to making a joyful, meaningful life of what comes.

You're a few steps into that with your epiphany that you don't want to leave your job. Despite what you "had always assumed," the life course you're on has its own ideas.

So, keep going with that. Keep challenging your assumptions with reality. Your husband, for example, as a teacher, might have a schedule that aligns well enough with your child(ren)'s over the years to tame some of the frazzle. You may be able to hire help or organize better around some of the stress. You may find that "venting" is not your parent-bonding language; no judgment.

In the doghouse
Guest Oct 24, 11:18 a.m.
QUESTION: My brother and sister-in-law have been using me as their dog-sitter since we moved close to each other about ten years ago. I never ask them to reciprocate, since one of my dogs can be a little destructive when unsupervised; I put my dogs in a kennel when I travel.

Their dog (we’ll call him Sid) is a bit of a hassle. I take care of him in my house. Sid is quite a bit older than my two dogs, so every walk turns into two—a long one for mine and a short one (distance-wise, but almost as long time-wise since he walks so slowly) for Sid. Sid needs five pills daily, eye drops, ears cleaned, teeth brushed—is not terribly cooperative for any of it.

They’ve stopped giving me food for him, since my dogs eat the same kibble, but it’s expensive (about $45 per week per dog).

They’ve even asked me to drop him off when they get home, since they’re so exhausted from their travels.

It used to be they would take me out to dinner for a thank-you, buy me a souvenir if it was a pleasure trip, etc., but even that seems to have stopped in the last couple of years.

I have confronted them on occasion regarding one thing or another. The first time they didn’t give me food, they said, “it’s just for the weekend.” The next time: “we have more at our house; you can come get some if you need it” (it’s a 20-minute drive each way). Once we went out to dinner together just after I had cared for Sid for several days, which I thought was my thank-you dinner. When they asked me to split the check, I “joked” that taking care of Sid for the weekend didn’t pay as well as it used to. They did not say, “oh, right, never mind then,” but collected their $60 (kennels in our area cost $40-$65 per night).

We’re all rather well-off, and on the one hand, it feels churlish to insist on them buying me dinner and gifts, or to refuse to pay for Sid’s food. But on the other hand, I feel I’m being taken completely for granted. Rather than a close relative who’s taking care of their dog for free, they’re treating me like some sort of expensive concierge pet-sitting service, or as if they’re doing me a huge favor when I take care of Sid, rather than the other way around.

They know I’m not going to refuse to take care of Sid when they need me to; I wouldn’t do that to Sid (he’s never been in a kennel in his life, and can’t start at his age). So how do I address this?

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist

ANSWER: Draw lines where you hold the pen. Never, for example, drop off Sid for them. I mean really. I expect that will mean you have him an extra day, which will then mean more work than the drive would have been, but if the point is to make a point, then that will make your point.

QUESTION: It isn't a choice between you being taken advantage of or sending poor Sid to a kennel. Talk with brother and SIL, tell them you are no longer available, and encourage them to find a paid dog-sitter; surely in this economy, there is someone in your area who is qualified, capable, compassionate and in need of money.

Partner OCD / State of Our House
Guest Oct 24, 11:50 a.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,

This is my second time writing in. I wrote over the summer about my husband’s OCD (I was “Walking on Eggshells”).

My husband has a high-stress job, and together we’re raising four kids in a busy, blended household. He’s a wonderful man and deeply committed to our family, but he has strong OCD tendencies — his way of controlling what he can when everything else feels chaotic.

Here’s the hard part: when he’s on his way home from work or a trip, I can feel my body tense. I rush to clean the counters, vacuum, put away dishes, make sure no toys are out — all before he walks through the door. If anything is out of place (a cup in the sink, a blanket on the couch, a toy in the driveway), he immediately starts straightening and cleaning, often before saying hello.

By nature, I’m more relaxed about clutter, but over time I’ve come his way because I know how important order is to him. We’re both tidy now, but I feel like I’m living under constant pressure to keep things perfect so he doesn’t spiral into cleaning mode. It’s exhausting, and I hate that I sometimes dread his return because of the energy shift it brings.

For a while, we even had cleaners come every other week, but that ended up creating more stress than relief — if a plant was moved half an inch or a picture frame slightly askew, it really bothered him. I managed them, and eventually it became more work than it was worth.

I also worry about what this teaches our kids — that a toy on the floor or crumbs under a chair are somehow “wrong.”

We’ve talked about it many times, but not much changes. He refuses counseling, saying he’ll “work on it,” but I don’t see real progress. Medicine isn’t something he’s willing to consider either. I love him and want to be understanding, but this dynamic feels heavy and unsustainable.

How can I support him without losing my peace — or turning our home into a stress zone for everyone else?

Signed,
Walking on Eggshells (and Crumbs)

ANSWER: Obv you can't make him go. But you can present to him this breakdown of the unmet terms of the deal, and that the result is his untreated anxiety is affecting the entire family. This can't be what he wants -- can it? Ask him. Acknowledge that it's a hard threshold to cross for anyone, and you're sympathetic. But this stress is hard too and the alternatives only get harder.

You may have to initiate those alternatives -- separation for the kids' sake -- but that is many steps away and I hope wont' be necessary, once you make it clear that his getting help is not negotiable now that his anxiety is affecting all and his self-help plan is stalled.

Not wild about my daughter’s fiancé
Guest Oct 24, 11:51 a.m.
QUESTION: Oldest daughter is engaged to a young man; they have been dating three years. She is an accomplished professional with degrees to match, and he hasn’t come close to finishing undergrad and works as a grocery manager for a chain store. They are worlds apart (suburb vs. country living). He seems a bit on the spectrum and he takes everything personally. Both see therapists. Talking to him is difficult and we haven’t conversed in over a year. He wanted my blessings to marry my daughter via a phone call. He thinks my nose is out of joint.My husband and I are concerned with red flags that she will settle on this person and they are so disparately worlds apart that it is scary to see how she might be left holding the bag. She still lives at home but pays rent. Her therapist hasn’t nudged her to grow and evolve like a person her age should….she is socially awkward and doesn’t seem to want to do much beyond work, home and visiting her boyfriend. She wants to buy a house; we have suggested she rent and be I. Her own for awhile. i don’t have tough conversations anymore because it ends up in a screaming match.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist

ANSWER: By the end, you're admitting (I don't think that's too strong a word) that your daughter has serious challenges of her own ... but kind of blaming her therapist for them. And having screaming matches with your kid about how you think she should be living her life.

I want you to reread because maybe then you'll see all the finger pointing, all the things you think everyone else is doing wrong. With their lives -- not yours.

Then I hope you will see that as your cue to excuse yourself from this picture. Talk to your own therapist if that will help you with the difficult feelings. Yes, it's hard to watch people make choices that you think will make their lives harder. But they're not your choices to make. Not anymore.

And the more you try to impose your will on your kid, the more urgent you make it for her to push back against you. And the worst decisions we make (collective "we") are always the pushes back against a smothering authority.

Give her the space any adult deserves. Give her the trust you would have wanted to have at her age -- even if you don't think she's ready for it yet, or has earned it. Sometimes you have to put it there because it's (past) time, and let them figure it out.

Re Happy Working Mom
Guest Oct 24, 11:52 a.m.
QUESTION: The thing that struck me is that you work in HR, so consider that you are probably more likely to hear complaints than other professions and I don't even mean in a professional capacity. I'm a former therapist and either because people know my training or it's part of personality type that seems like a kind, nonjudgmental ear I am the person people want to vent their spleens to. I have to establish boundaries, but I know perfectly lovely, happy people who have tried to share every frustration with me while others in their lives don't hear a single complaint. This may be going on here. So don't assume that these people are miserable parents constantly complaining. You might just seem like a friendly outlet that will let them vent for short bursts.

ANSWER: "What if this is a way for him to self-soothe after the stress of his workday? Talk about this, and ask if it would help if you let him clean when he gets home instead of rushing to do it all before he arrives."

That plus this: I still think counseling remains a nonnegotiable if the stress is bleeding into the family beyond just one straightening up session per day. I won't get into the particulars, but I have run across the straightening thing as an anxiety outlet where it is a bottomless pit of fussing.

Former gym rat

QUESTION: Prior to the pandemic, I was a huge gym rat and used to work out all the time. I got out of it when the gym closed and never went back. But my husband will. not. let. it. go. He keeps nagging me. (I have not gained weight, changed size or anything else.) I have used "Not happening. Next question." and he has now stooped to trying to embarrass me about this by mentioning it in front of friends who are all "But you LOVED to work out!" Yeah, and now I don't. Ugh.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist

ANSWER: Or, simpler, just leave. The room, party, restaurant, bar, whatever. Evening over.

Time to have this out with him I guess:

"What is it going to take for this to stop? Do I have to ask you something over and over, even though I have the answer, until you break? Do I have to embarrass you in front of our friends? Do I have to say out loud to you, 'Yes, I KNOW you liked me better when I was a gym rat, I KNOW you are really bugged that I don't go any more, but I am still not going back' -- will that do it? What? Please tell me so I can be free of this b-------."

The weight/size thing is a red herring. Even if you did change some, this is a one "back-off" issue. You get to manage yourself as you see fit.

Where a spouse gets to express concern is in engagement-with-life management, and even then, it's both nuanced and about you (you-indiv and you as a couple). Meaning, this I-want-so-I-embarrass-you crap would never fly.

For the working mom question
Guest Oct 24, 12:17 p.m.
QUESTION: One thing that I kept hearing when I was pregnant, and that I frankly found very annoying at the time, but which was totally true is that you really won’t know how you feel about staying home versus working until you actually have a child on your lap that you’re taking care of. I agree with all of Carolyn suggestions about preparing and having conversations, but ultimately towards the end of your parental leave, you will either be feeling like yes I’m ready to go back, or no I can never imagine being away from this baby, or maybe a combination of both I found out that more than anything informed next steps .

Congratulations to you and your husband. I hope you find an arrangement that works for your family.

Birthday Husband
Guest Oct 24, 12:25 p.m.
QUESTION: I'm the letter writer with the birthday wife who is out of the birthday business. Thanks for taking my letter. It was good to read your response and Haxers. You were dead right that my wife wouldn't believe me that I was not planning anything. It all blew up when my wife kept asking her best friend about the plans. Her best friend reached out to me and I told her I was out of the birthday business. She blew up after talking to her sister. The kids were at daycare (tip the hat to you for thinking of safety). She wanted me to leave and called the police to get me to leave. My wife is still screaming mad but staying at her folks' house. I didn't see this being the spark that could end my marriage but I'm seeing everything from a different perspective now and more certain than ever that this was the right decision for me to take.

QUESTION: Maybe the husband can see that she's less happy? And he's dealing with it all wrong by continuing to suggest she go back to the thing he knew used to make her happy. If they can't get to the root cause of this, maybe a few sessions of joint counseling might help.

Upcoming Holidays
Guest Oct 24, 12:54 p.m.
QUESTION: Hello, is it okay to entertain my difficult sibling and difficult remaining parent on the Holiday Eves (Thanksgiving Eve and Christmas Eve) instead of on the actual holiday? I’ve been cooking and entertaining them for over 35 years on the actual holidays, and I now want to enjoy the actual holiday days alone with our godchildren. I’m no spring chicken and who knows how much time and good health I have remaining to do what my spouse and I want. But the guilt from my small FOO is debilitating. They say “you’re shutting us out” and they don’t like me having them over on the “Eves”. They want to be entertained on the actual holidays. Oh, and I do all the work. Can you help me ??

Wah wah wah, I want to be entertainnnnnnnned!!! I'm going to try that with my kids :)

(If you and your godchildren have the ability to travel, then it might be time to start planning some lovely holidays in resort places. Ahh.)

QUESTION: I am the mismatched partner of a man I have been with for 28 years. His mother's early dislike and disapproval with me spread to his sister (she has since apologized) and nearly throttled the joy of our early relationship. I don't want her in my life and neither does her son. You are hurtling toward this and still have time to stop it.

Re: SAHM happiness
Guest Oct 24, 1:11 p.m.
QUESTION: I’m maybe over rotating but this phrasing was triggering: that this decision should be “MORAL”/emotional. It feeds into the mommy wars and it’s just so destructive to think that any choice (working, not working, part time working) has inherently higher MORAL value. They are both valid, good choices.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist

ANSWER: 2. I think we can make moral calculations without Princess Bride-rolling down the slope into judging everyone else. (I am a cockeyed optimist, what can I say.) One family might decide it's morally imperative to have Mother home -- and yes, that has bad mommy war history. But one might also see moral value in having Dad home, to show that role model -- especially for a baby boy? Or for a girl? (Discuss.) One might see moral weight in having both parents contribute paid work. Etc. It's all on the table, I think -- when it can be of course. Practical considerations often make the rest of it moot.

Feeling Unprotected and Losing Trust in My Marriage
Guest Oct 17, 11:02 a.m.
QUESTION: I’ve been married for two years (together for four), and while my husband is a great person in many ways, the biggest strain on our relationship has been his family. They’ve consistently disrespected me, and despite my husband saying he understands, he rarely takes firm action. He tends to avoid conflict and often gives in to their requests—especially financial ones—which has made me feel unprotected and unseen.

We tried couples therapy, but it didn’t help much, because I don’t think the counselor was a good fit. I’ve communicated my boundaries repeatedly, yet he continues to prioritize keeping the peace with his family over my comfort. Recently, I suggested opening a joint account to rebuild trust and create transparency, but he refused, saying he didn’t want “little fights about purchases.” But when I asked if I could have the passwords to his accounts and he said that was fine.

I’m exhausted from being the only one fighting for our marriage. I still care about him, but I’m starting to wonder if we’re simply incompatible—if I’m holding on out of love or fear of leaving. I want peace and emotional safety, but I don’t know if I can have that here anymore.

What would you do in my situation? Can a marriage survive when one partner won’t fully protect you from their family? Do I need to be stronger? I’m afraid of the dynamic if we have a child.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whoo. I'm uncomfortable answering a question with the central conflict presented in such vague terms. Your husband's family is hitting him up for cash, I take it? Is he giving it to them without running it by you first? Is it $5, $500, $5,000? I can see different answers at the extremes. Plus, I can see "counselor wasn't a good fit" = counselor wasn't good, or counselor wasn't agreeing with you.

However, I can answer part of your, "What would you do in my situation?" especially from my perch in my late 50s: I wouldn't go into anything serious with someone conflict averse. Not a large purchase, not a child, not a business deal, maybe not even plans on Saturday night -- nothing where our interests were combined and I had to count on this person to stand up for those interests. Because I know now that I couldn't.

So, if you are confident that your husband is beholden to his family, and that you are the one he's comfortable disappointing, then you need to say that to him now.

Friend back with abuser - update
Guest Oct 17, 11:16 a.m.
QUESTION: Original poster of last week's chat question here. My friend was being nicer...but she g ot kicked out from her main friendgroup and now she's being isolated, cold, and distant. I'm trying to be a safe presence like everybody said, but it's getting more and more challenging as she now just ghosts people. Not sure how to handle it:(thank you all for supporting me last time.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You're welcome.

I am not going back to the transcript to check details, so this will be a general answer:

You handle it by making regular check-ins with the expectation that you will not get regular-friend reciprocation out of it. Meaning, she will ghost you, or take a kind of rudely long time to respond, or respond defensively, or respond right away by leaning on you hard as if you've talked every day for years when in fact this is the first time she's reached out in months. Because, think of it this way, all her emotional dials and gauges are in their red "unhealthy" zones or else she wouldn't be where she is.

What you're offering isn't a reciprocal friendship (yet) -- it's an escape plan. When she's ready for it. And for it to be effective, what she needs is to get accustomed enough to your presence to think of you when she's in a full cortisol event.

This is the role a person signs up for, if they want to help a loved one get out of an abusive relationship who is still in the cycle of going back and telling themselves no really, it will be different this time.

Should I fake grief I'm not feeling
Guest Oct 17, 11:41 a.m.
QUESTION: My father died 2 weeks ago very suddenly and unexpectedly. I’m not actually grieving since we’d been estranged for the past 3 years. My entire childhood he was either neglectful or emotionally abusive. In plain language he either ignored me or let me know what a disappointment I was to him since I wasn’t outgoing or popular. I was 12 when my mom found out he was cheating because he got his girlfriend pregnant. He moved out of the state with his new wife and didn’t bother visiting me or letting me visit him for the next 5 years. When I finally was allowed to visit him and his new family I couldn’t believe how affectionate and involved he was with my half-sister. When she was 10, the difference in the way he treated her and me at that age was so stark, I had to I talk to him about it. He told me that he was able to love my sister unconditionally, like he never could with me. It was devastating to hear but he blamed it on his “stage of life” and said I shouldn’t take it personally. How do you not take that personally? That was it for me, I stopped seeing or communicating with him. He either didn’t notice or didn’t care. I stayed in contact with my sister by sending birthday/Christmas gifts, texting, Facetime, and on Instagram. Since our dad died, my sister has been calling/texting me nonstop, wanting to pour out her grief on someone who “understands”. Her parents separated last year (infidelity again) so her mother isn’t exactly heartbroken. I love my sister but I can’t possibly share in her grief even a little bit. The only grief I’m feeling is for the father I never had. Especially since I found out that my father told my sister that my mom was to blame for our recent estrangement. That lie would be funny if it weren't infuriating since my mom never even thinks or talks about him. Do I need to fake grief I’m not feeling for my sister’s sake?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yikes.

No, you do not have to fake grief you do not feel, to comfort the sister you do not identify with.

I do appreciate that you're considering it. It is a kindness toward her that shows the true extent of your grace. Clearly she is not to blame for any harm your father did to you. But still, so many people struggle to separate their difficult feelings so effectively. Many wouldn't even know their sister in this situation, much less be in regular touch, having reached a "Just can't" point with it all.

So if anyone can thread the needle, I'm thinking you can -- of letting her know you feel for her in her grief, and understand in the sense of knowing what she has lost, but not in the sense of having had the same father she did.

From there, you can offer her whatever you're willing. There's lots of range there, 0 to full gusher, and it's entirely up to you. The zero is to ask her kindly to direct her grief to another source of support, "since I'm going through my own process right now"; or saying you can listen as long as it's understood that the two of you are not in the same place; or you can set a time to check in once a week, or whatever. It really is your call.

I am sorry for your loss in your childhood.

QUESTION: Why has Nick been switched (downgraded??) to an illustration, rather than a cartoon? His cartoon were great!

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: No no no, absolutely NOT downgraded.

The illustrations are gorgeous and more work for Nick.

The cartoons were more work for me. I co-wrote them. That plus the seven-day column schedule (with chat) meant I never had room to do anything but that and the seven daily columns (with chat).

Taking the cartoon lines off my writing schedule, and two of the adapted columns, means I can now breathe and think a little about new things to do. Which will come, but it won't be instantaneous because my schedule has been so opened for all of two weeks at this point (and I spent them catching up on some appointments).

Thank you for asking. But please -- do not think for a moment that Nick is seen as anything but valuable here. He also edits my first drafts.

Grandparent name vs stubborn toddlers
Guest Oct 17, 12:17 p.m.
QUESTION: Before the birth of our eldest (now 4, first grandchild on both sides) we had asked all grandparents what they wanted to be called. My FIL chose “Grandaddy”, and our 4 year old went with it. A few months ago our second, now 2, started calling him “Grandy”. Assuming that she would grow out of it eventually, we didn’t make a big deal out of it, just continued using his preferred when we spoke of/to him. But, our 4 yo has started using the shortened name, too. We know it bothers him, so how should we handle it?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: 1. He can correct your 4-year-old, if it bothers him. "I prefer you call me Grandaddy, thank you. Like you used to. Your [brother/sister] can't pronounce it yet, which is why Grandy is okay." You also keep referring to him as Grandaddy, to him and about him to both of your children, out of respect to your FIL, but it is not your job to correct your child on this.

2. Is he always this much of a tool? There is no gift more precious on earth than a grandchild's spontaneous naming. Smh.

Reply to: "Feeling Unprotected and Losing Trust in My Marriage"
Guest Oct 17, 12:26 p.m.
QUESTION: Regarding money and accounts, it would be helpful to know if you both have your own careers / incomes and/or if one or both of you have your own money from before the relationship started.

However, for almost 50 years spanning three major relationships, my rule has always been: "There are three types of money: My money, your money, and our money. We have frank conversations regarding how much money is needed to run the family, pay the mortgage, etc., and where that money is going to come from. And that balance can and probably will change over time. However, once we have a current agreement, we have three bank accounts: Mine, Yours, and Ours. As long as the 'Ours' account is properly and fairly funded, what happens with the money in 'My' account and 'Your' account is only the concern of that individual. I am not entitled to make judgments about your spending and you are not entitled to make judgments about my spending. However, for emergency and life-event situations, we do always make sure to share logins/passwords on the accounts."

Lastly if you don't think the therapist was a good fit, find a different one, even if your husband won't participate (but I think he probably will). And if the next one also does not seem like a good fit, in consultation with your husband if he is participating, find yet another therapist. Keep looking until you get it right. Though it may not be or feel "fair", you are going to have to drive this train.

Wishing you the best!

Not fake grief
Guest Oct 17, 12:32 p.m.
QUESTION: Even in intact families, the loss of a parent can hit differently - each child’s relationship with each parent can be so different. Your grief, over the father you never had, is real grief, just as real as hers is; I think it’s important for you to acknowledge that and honor it, just as you can honor and acknowledge your sister’s grief. As Carolyn suggests, I think that is the needle you can thread - acknowledge that you’re both grieving, but for different reasons, since you had very different relationships with your father, without necessarily going into any detail. From what I can tell, your sister is a teen or a preteen; is there any chance you can encourage her to reach out to a school counselor, who might direct her to a support group, closer to her area (I’m gathering you don’t live close to her). It sounds like she might need day-to-day support, perhaps individual counseling, but I don’t know if you’d feel comfortable suggesting the latter.

Bungee Jumper Dad to Be
Guest Oct 17, 12:48 p.m.
QUESTION: As I read this week's question from a very pregnant woman so furious at her husband, I thought back to when I was pregnant and how mad I got at my husband when he didn't make it to a doctors appointment with me. In fairness, he was super supportive and went to like 90% of the appointments. So why was I so mad? Probably because it showed that at the end of the day, he could walk away (have the beer, eat the sushi etc etc) and I couldn't. So maybe that's the root of at least some of her anger - he can tap out, go on the wild trip, act like there's no baby coming and she.. just can't. The biology isn't fair on this one.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Right, it's not. That cuts both ways, of course. The feeling of being pregnant is just astonishing intimacy with ... life, really, but specifically with the coming new member of the family. It absolutely comes at a cost, just as that freedom to bungee jump comes at a cost.

Comfort with the tradeoffs is why a lot of fits of anger don't happen, at missed appointments or with ridiculous last hurrahs or whatever.

When they do happen, they're not necessarily bad or wrong. They've just got lots of possible explanations -- because there's so much complexity to this stage of life, so much change, and responsibility, so much riding on another person, so much anxiety swirling around in there. Plus, like I said, some hormones adding rocket fuel to it all. So which one is the root of the anger? Any one of them could do it, depending on the couple's history.

Anger is a tap on the shoulder that there's something unexplored or unexpressed that might need some attention. Certainly some walking off, first, to get enough feelings out of the way to figure out what it is.

Recovering after fiancé cheats.
Guest Oct 17, 1:25 p.m.
QUESTION: My fiancé of three years cheated on me and immediately pleaded depression, anxiety, and disassociation. She started therapy and said that she was losing herself in our relationship and needed to work on herself, so we're essentially are broken-up while she does this work. I continue to support her (she is in school with no resources to continue if I don't) as I committed to doing. It's been three months now and she has been consistent in saying that she can't be in a relationship with anyone until she learns to love herself.

I've had a long journey through therapy and cheated myself under similar circumstances in a prior relationship, so I have more understanding than most and I also believe that people can change and learn if they are open with themselves.

But, I feel like she avoiding dealing with the hurt and trauma that she caused me and I don't know how to call this out while being supportive of her process. She's said the expected "I'm sorry for causing you pain by my actions", but we have not done any work on taking accountability, owning decisions, or figuring out where things fell apart that led to the cheating. As each day goes by, I feel like she's "getting away with it" under the guise of doing the work on herself.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: If you are broken up, then she did not get away with it. The consequence was losing you. You are merely honoring a prior commitment toward her schooling (the rest of which I will leave to the lawyers, though I have to think you have other options there if you want them).

If you are merely apart while she goes through school and counseling, with the understanding that you are still engaged, then you are not broken up. In that case, I see your point of her not really having consequences.

That's just the surface-y stuff. I mention it, though, because it seems really mushy, and mushiness always makes things worse. You're looking to her to figure out where you stand, and she seems to be telling you in multiple ways that she can't even figure out who she is. So my suggestion there is to treat yourself as someone who is broken up. It's cleaner, it makes sense (her getting lost to you doesn't sound promising regardless), it's Square 1.

Meanwhile, tho, you're leaving out the inner stuff completely: conscience. Feeling utterly regretful/bad/shamed/worthless/contemptible, just a sampling off the cheaters-who-don't-love-themselves menu, is not my idea of "getting away with" anything, so if she feels terrible, then she's paying dearly for "the hurt and trauma that she caused" you.

She's not saying it to you, maybe, but, back to the beginning: Taking her at her word, her issue was a feeling of self-erasure around you. That, to me, is a person who needs to feel a lot stronger before she's coming to you with anything. Certainly more than a few months.

Meanwhile 2, your inner stuff. If you two indeed are broken up, then your "figuring out where things fell apart" process is yours to do now on your time. Stop looking to her fix it, or you. Anyway, broken up officially or not, she's "consistent" in telling you: She can't. So stop asking. You were betrayed, yes. But whether she "owes" you is immaterial.

Your topic line is "Recovering after fiancee cheats." Recovering is about you, not her. Keep that in mind so you don't lose your focus. Step back, stop looking to be made whole, work (again) on you.

QUESTION: "She's said the expected "I'm sorry for causing you pain by my actions", but we have not done any work on taking accountability, owning decisions, or figuring out where things fell apart that led to the cheating."

She's in therapy to figure this out for herself, so that she even has this information or can perform these actions.

Why are you expecting anything to happen until she has been able to get a lot further in individual therapy to be able to discuss it with you without losing herself in the conversation which has apparently been part of the problem all along?

ANSWER: Oh no there's definitely a plan. It's just not all going to be visible or available immediately. (Except for the video. That's the earliest stuff.) Because things take time and teamwork.

Anyway. Here's Ned, thinking about his weekend. Not sure if there's a rabbit out there or he's a First Amendment kind of dog. Either way, I can promise you he'll blend right in.

Have a great one, out of spite if that's what it takes, and I'll type to you here next week. Thanks so much for stopping by.

Disaster surprise birthday party on the horizon
Guest Oct 17, 1:59 p.m.
QUESTION: My brother has organized an ill-advised surprise party for my father's 75th birthday. Our father is a complete introvert and also very exacting. He likes things to be a certain way, and gets tense and angry if everything is not perfectly to his taste. He hates loud places and large groups of people. Unfortunately, he's always used excessive alcohol to handle social engagements and gets belligerent when drunk. Because of all of this, I was surprised when my brother, "James" told me that he'd planned a surprise birthday party of 30 guests for my dad at a new restaurant. The guest list includes the following extremely awkward confirmed attendees: our aunt (dad's semi-estranged sister) who is an overbearing religious fanatic none of us can stand; our mother (dad's ex-wife) who is resented by our dad and hated by our aforementioned aunt because of the divorce; and a number of neighbors who our dad has been feuding with off and on for the last 20 years. I asked my mom why she was going along with this and she said James called in a big favor she owed him and she felt like she couldn’t say no, so he’s pulling out all the stops to make this happen. I don't know how James could possibly think this is a good idea, except that he has a huge ego and believes this will be some fairy tale reunion where everyone will suddenly make nice. I don't mean that James is a bad guy but he has a tendency to steamroll over people and do things "for their own good." Every argument I've made against this party has prompted him to lecture me and act like he knows so much better because he's 7 years older than me. It's true that my Dad can be difficult but I don't want him to feel ambushed on his birthday. If James keeps refusing to cancel should I warn my dad? Or do I just kick back with a glass of wine and watch the drama unfold?

ANSWER: I can't go without answering this one. It's from a past chat and I resubmitted it myself when I saw it in the outtakes, because, wow. (Almost missed it again.)

You have tried to stop James.

Now, this is not for you to fix. I don't know what your brother is doing, either, but it's not your business.

I would suggest, though, that you stay in driving condition in case your dad wants or needs to leave on short notice.

(I hope I'm not too late -- sorry I missed the Q the first time.)

In-law correcting grandkids
Guest Oct 3, 11:05 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn & Nuts! I have an in-law question. I will preface by saying my MIL and I do not get along nor see eye-to-eye. I avoid her but my husband and small children (1 & 4) go to visit his parents when I'm travelling for work. Everyone wins. On the rare occasion I do visit with them, how do I handle my MIL correcting my children? I'm trying to understand the different balance of "my house, my rules" with "my children, my decision". For example, she wants the 4 yo to sit at the table to eat his whole dinner and not leave until everyone is finished, asked to be excused, etc. In theory, I agree and we are working to instil manners (please tell me boys eventually chew with their mouth closed without constant reminders!) but he's 4 and sitting longer than 10 minutes while adults talk is boring. It also grates me to have her correcting my children when it's not her job. Should I tell my children that Grandma has different rules at her house and to listen to her or should I push back when she corrects my children? She is not the type of person one can have a rational conversation with, so it's either stay quiet or push back in the moment.

ANSWER: I need a bomb suit to take apart this question.

First, please let go of the idea that no one else can correct your kids but you. Parents who give stinkeye to anyone who dares say "no" to their preciouses have always bugged me. You and your husband are the top of the discipline chain, yes, and therefore you get the last word. However, the "village" concept is a good and necessary one that absolutely falls apart if you refuse to empower the village to tell your kid "no" sometimes.

I (really really) get how hard it is to grant that power to someone you don't like or trust. But it is worth it to take the deep breaths and make yourself apply an across the board standard of village access. Meaning, the village can correct your kid, even villagers you loathe, as long as the correction itself is not actively harmful -- because the institution of the village is worth supporting. And yes, that includes telling your kids (and reminding often) that rules in Place A are different from rules in Place B. That's just life. Home to home, school to home, etc. There's nuance to who's in charge, but you'll get there over time.

There are also definitely times to step in and protect your kid from people who undermine your childrearing methods or who push really bad, unhealthy or outdated methods themselves. The actively-harmful exception. Your MIL has one that I see immediately -- the "eat his whole dinner" thing is a resounding NOPE, I don't care whose table it is. Insisting kids push food down past their satiety point is just so ridiculously moronic and unhealthy that it has to be a hill you die on. Food issues are notoriously hard to "uninstall" once they're in there (since you can't just quit food) so make sure your husband is extra super crystal clear on this too. No clean plate BS ever. Omg.

I am once again reminded how hard it is to type when I'm flapping my arms in exasperation.

BTW, sounds like your kids will quickly find MIL visits stultifying, which means you're going to win this one. Don't overplay your hand.

Suicidal teen
Guest Oct 3, 11:31 a.m.
QUESTION: My husband and I recently discovered that our young teen is depressed and has contemplated suicide. I found out by going through their phone after noticing they seemed “off” and didn’t want to talk to me. Teen feels betrayed and angry that I went through their phone. We took them to their pediatrician for an evaluation, and teen refused to talk at all or to consider an antidepressant or nonmedical interventions. We went to a therapist twice and teen refused to speak at all. I have tried drawing teen out, waiting patiently, explaining how suicide cannot be undone and we will get through this together, they are not alone…but nothing seems to get through. Teen did confirm that there was no event that triggered this. They’re just sad. They did say talking to their friends helps. But I don’t know what to do. I’m barely sleeping and every time teen is out of sight I’m wondering if they’re ok. I asked if they’d see a different therapist and got completely shut down. I am at a loss and don’t know how we continue in this liminal space where teen is suffering but refusing help.

My husband and I spend time with our teen, doing what they enjoy but also luring them outside for walks. It’s met with a lot of resistance but we’re trying.

Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Raising kids is a scary business -- you know that famous description, it's like having your heart out walking around in someone else's body? -- and what you describe here is just peak terrifying. I am so sorry all of you are going through this. The combination of the pain you're in, the fear and the sense of helplessness would keep anyone up at night.

Since your teen refuses to talk to a therapist, it's all the more imperative that you and your husband work with one, asap. One who has the training and experience to work with troubled adolescents. This is where you get your guidance to work with your kid. I would advise you to get this counsel even if your teen had agreed to talk to someone. Being a parent ends up being about 99 percent winging it on the fly, but there are times when you really need professional instructions, and this is one of them.

Something else that will be a therapist question but that I want to plant in your mind upfront: The phone is a problem. I know I don't know this, but I know. The link between it and depression and teens is established, for one -- and you say "young" teen, which means an extra degree of vulnerability. Talking to their friends helps because that is human. That is what we are more prepared to handle. I note this as a therapist question because I don't want to send you barreling in after their phone on the strength of my warning here. Proceed with licensed guidance. But until you get there, yes to the spending time together, on other things, outside, etc., off the digital feed.

Also -- get eyes on in school. This comes with a risk of ticking off your kid for saying too much, so you always have to weigh that against the value of more awareness. But a cautious talk with the counselor at school (ergo confidential) can be your starting point.

AITA?
Guest Oct 3, 11:51 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi, Carolyn! I recently made a spur of the moment plan to travel with a friend to Europe for an event taking place next summer. Tickets to the event, as well as travel, aren't cheap, but I can afford it and know that it will be fun. My husband was present when my friend I made these plans and immediately purchased the tickets. Later, he told me that he was hurt that I made plans for a big trip when he and I had discussed planning a big trip, as well, although we hadn't finalized our destination or time frame. I told him that the plans with my friend do not preclude or replace our plans together. At that point, he balked at the cost, saying that if I had enough money to make spontaneous plans for a pricey trip, he wished I'd put them toward a loan we took out last year for home improvements. I admit, I'm not as fiscally responsible as I'd like to be, and told him that I see his point. I am going to move some funds around so that we can pay off this debt together in the near future. Still, I think what stung him is that I do have the resources to be able to make spontaneous plans for a trip like this, although I don't do it often. We've been married for a little over a year, living together for almost 10 years, and have come up with system for managing our joint income and expenses that works for us. I typically pay from my personal account for any non-essential splurges that I want for myself. He knows that my income and investments are more than his own, due to many factors, but mostly because he raised and put two children through college, as well as suffered through an expensive divorce. I don't want to "flaunt" my ability to spend more freely than he does, but I also want to be able to do the things that I can reasonably afford even when they don't involve him. We discussed the issue the same night and he is not harboring a grudge, but what is a better way to handle this in the future?

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: If he knows all about the separate splurge account, including how much is in it, and is/has always been okay with it on principle, then I don't see the issue here. It also seems as if he knew it was there when you took out the loan, so I'm a little confused on that -- are you too spendy or did you agree to keep your separate splurge money no matter what? Maybe you and he need some better communication there.

But as for the emotional side of it: His feelings were hurt, he spoke up, you talked about it, you both figured out that your trip was just the manifestation in real time of what the splurge account allows, and now there's nothing to see here. Sure, maybe having the plans happen in front of him wasn't ideal, but spontaneity is pretty great, too, and he could also have spoken up, or tugged you gently aside to say "Hey, does this affect our trip?" and you could have assured him then that it didn't.

Even in a good relationship, it doesn't seem realistic that you'd never have hurt feelings ever. More likely, when mature people do feel hurt: 1. They're going to be able to talk about it. 2. They're going to find out it was a misunderstanding. 3. Or they're going to be able to admit/forgive mistakes. 4. Or find a way to accept each other's differences.

No one needs to be TA.

For suicidal teen
Guest Oct 3, 11:55 a.m.
QUESTION: I am so sorry you are going through this. I had friends who went through the heartbreak of a suicidal teen and if I could also suggest a qualified therapist for you and your spouse as well. This is a terrifying time and having someone with whom you can speak can help YOU as well as you navigate. Please know that what you wrote here sounds like you are doing a good job and that good, loving care remains whatever the outcome of your teen's depression is (as tough as that may be to acknowledge.) We are so hoping your teen finds a way out of this.

ANSWER: I am posting this because my advice was for them to talk to a therapist themselves -- so, it's the exact same advice? I want to make sure mine wasn't unclear.

I realize I noted the adolescent experience credentials of the person they see, but that was so they would understand the parents' situation. My intent was for the therapist to be for the parents. Thank you for writing in.

Re: Suicidal teen
Guest Oct 3, 12:05 p.m.
QUESTION: I also have teens with mental health struggles, and you're right - it's terrifying. And I know that it continues to be terrifying because when my best friend was going through a tough time last year, her mom called me to ask if I thought she was going to be ok. (We are in our mid-40s.)
That same best friend was hauled off to counseling in her early teens, and she has said that she felt terrible about it because she felt like her parents were trying to "fix" her because she was the different one in the family. So I'd say that's the small piece of wisdom that I've used from her struggles in dealing with my own kids - make it clear that you're not trying to fix them or make them different. That you just want them to be comfortable in themselves.
Good luck - and don't forget you're not alone.

Re: suicidal teen

QUESTION: I think it's important to normalize therapy and treatment for mental health issues for teens. Hey, kid, if you broke your arm or got the flu, we would take you to the doctor for the appropriate treatment. This is no different and there's no shame in feeling sad--but also no need to stay so sad when there are things that might help.

Advice Columnist
ANSWER: These are all true, and I've been at this same message for almost 30 years, and it's a great point to make with kids from the youngest ages (please!), though if you get to it late then it's still a great message -- but. If a person, even a kid-person, refuses to talk to a therapist, there is not a whole lot that other people can do to make them. And such accurate and well-meaning encouragement as you suggest, to someone who has dug in, can backfire.

There can be an involuntary commitment for someone who is at risk of harming self or others, but that's about it.

This is a major contributor to the sense of helplessness.

For parent of suicidal teen
Guest Oct 3, 12:22 p.m.
QUESTION: My son, now mid-20s, went through two terrifying, suicidal years in his late teens. One thing that helped both of us was NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness). I know they have chapters all over the country. He attended a support group for people going through severe depression, and it helped him immensely. And I attended the support group for parents, and I was relieved to know that what I was feeling and experiencing was not unique to me. Best of luck to you both; I would not wish this experience on anyone.

Follow-up about lousy hosting
Guest Oct 3, 12:29 p.m.
QUESTION: My wife did as you suggested and talked to her dad. I was right that we were unwelcome - or at least that they were mad about something. Their first issue was that our hostess gifts ($40 bottle of wine plus a flower arrangement) came from the grocery store! Biggest issue was that step-mom-in-law was annoyed that we showed up on Friday night expecting dinner. Also, I should have somehow known to bring back breakfast for them too on Saturday and Sunday, even though they told us they only ever had coffee and those cookies.
What a crock. The wine and flowers are the same no matter where it came from. And when we host them (3 times since they moved!) we not only have dinner ready for them on Friday night but appetizers and drinks too. Her dad's excuse is that it's different because "there are only two of them and three of us". Right.
I am 99% sure this is not a money issue since they spent the weekend talking about their recent purchases - a boat, fancy patio furniture and a newly landscaped patio to put it on. Also, there was plenty of fresh food in the house - they just weren't sharing it with us.
My wife and I decided in future we will get an Airb&b when we visit them and provide all our own meals. Since they live in an expensive resort area this will limit our ability to visit. Oh well.

ANSWER: Whew, yeah, that's what petty scorekeeping will get you -- guests determined to find every reason necessary never to come back. The stepmom-in-law sounds like a real charmer.

This flirts with a bunch of faerie tale stereotypes, so I type it at my own risk, but I wonder whether this played out exactly how she wanted it to -- with you as the bad guys on some made-up charge and thinking twice before crossing the Evil Stepmother's threshold again. If her husband is a pushover or dependent on her, then she wins, pesky stepkid and family are out of the picture. (Don't eat any apples, spin wool or befriend their mice just in case.)

This doesn't have to be so cartoonishly villainous, either. One or more of the elements in all of last week's speculation could still be involved.

And, too, you could be taking the exact wrong message from the boat and patio -- ie, now they're up to their face holes in debt -- but I think that's a long shot explanation. As expensive as food is, they could have literally fed you beans. That's what kindhearted broke people do.

Thanks for the update. I'm sorry you just had a firsthand reminder of how much people can suck.

Sibling’s shows of grief drag me into uncomfortable spot
Guest Oct 3, 12:34 p.m.
QUESTION: Sibling has a podcast and instagram presence that appears to be geared toward creating a name for themself and developing a clientele for coaching/empowerment/creativity consulting services. It is a side project of theirs, and since our parent passed away 2 1/2 years ago, there has been a marked turn toward including grief related content and “celebrations” of parent.

The content comes across to me as an attempt to monetize our parent, photos of our parent and other family members (including me and my kids) and photos of our parent’s art. This includes links to a clothing site where people can buy items printed with sibling’s collages that incorporate photos of parent and parent art.

We don’t have a great relationship, and that goes back many years. I’ve tried asking to go to family counseling, sibling hasn’t been willing.

Every time I see one of these posts, I get deeply uncomfortable. Do I have any standing to ask them to stop? How would I go about it without setting off a new round of fire (sib is reactive and can be nasty)?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You don't have standing to ask them to stop podcasting, posting or talking about grief or your parent, no. It's their business, you don't have to like it. Parent's art, depends on who owns it, I would think.

But you absolutely have standing to ask sib to stop using images of you and your kids. Since sib is reactive and nasty (sorry, I think we've all more than had it with that combination), I'd talk with a lawyer first to find out what recourse i have. Then, with that in my pocket, I'd talk to sibling myself, and go to my the legal Plan B only if I had to and still wanted to.

Once I was sure about the photos, I'd unfollow this sib's venture entirely after that. I can't see why you'd pay attention to something nonessential that upsets you. Hit "unfollow" and it stops, magic.

Grumpy Unpaid Non-furloughed Fed

QUESTION: We are once again in the thick of fall sports season. My kids are finally old enough that when they aren’t on the field, they watch, hang out with friends, and I can relax, actually watch the games, chat with parent friends, and decompress a bit from work, shuttling kids around, cooking, laundry, etc. my in-laws recently relocated closer to us, and they want to go to the games, virtually all of them. Due to some mild cognitive changes in my MIL and my FIL never having managed these sorts of things, they need support. They are always cold but never dress warmly enough, even with reminders. They need chairs and water and snacks, which they can’t carry. It feels like packing for toddlers again. I like them as people and have a good, if not extraordinarily close, relationship with them. But did I clarify: all the games? My husband does some assistant coaching and team managing so generally isn’t the point person for this. When I’ve mildly suggested skipping a cooler evening game, they won’t hear of it: they have the link to the schedule and just show up. My husband says just don’t bring all the things, and let them adjust their attendance accordingly. I can’t watch them shiver and end up giving them my jacket, water, whatever. Can I set a limit on the number of games per weekend, or a minimum temperature, and tell them that’s it? Or do I just accept this is the highlight of their social week and keep hauling all the stuff, setting it up, etc.?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I just big-sighed this one. On the one hand, it's small stuff, it's the grandparents, it's tough to be lonely/old/slipping, it's a kindness you'll want from your kids or their partners someday. On the other hand -- really? It's all on you? You can't be hands-free for one freaking game? I do feel for you on the idea of gazing at the calendar at that mythical day when you are in charge of no one's care, then it suddenly flips forward years and years and you can't stop it 😱

So here's what I've got.

1. Your kids are old enough to chip in toward their grandparents' comfort, no? Isn't this a lesson in care, kindness, intergenerational understanding? Not every game, but one shift on a rotating schedule, a kid or kids can do the setup.

2. If your husband can't step out to help get them set up for one day of a rotation himself (can he?), then he can get involved in the stocking of supplies in 3.

3. The needs are predictable enough to pack most or all supplies in a car and leave them there. Yours, theirs, your husband's? And can you put the chairs, blankets, bags of snacks in a cart or wagon. There you go. I say if you have money to throw at the problem (it's not a ton), then start chucking.

4. The limit is fine, too. Number of games or minimum temp, fine -- but is that really up to you? I would think they could just go regardless.

For parent of suicidal teen
Guest Oct 3, 1:20 p.m.
QUESTION: I was that kid, exactly. Years later my mother told me she took me to see someone because I had stopped talking. They shuffled me around to well-dressed people sitting behind large desks, and I refused to talk with them too. Silence.

Eventually I told my mother I thought it wasn’t helping. She said ok, then we’ll stop. I remember clearly thinking the time, no, you’re supposed to say let’s try something else but I couldn’t get myself to say that.

At the clinic I remember being walked past art therapy rooms and thinking ‘that looks interesting’ but no one ever noticed my head turn as we walked by and I was never invited in.

So maybe if the kid won’t talk, try something that doesn’t require talking and maybe talking will happen eventually. Face-to-face in an office, sitting in a straight-back chair while someone stares at you and commands you to speak wasn’t helpful.

Maybe letting the kid know that it’s not that there’s anything wrong with them. They’re learning how the world works and trying to figure out where they fit into it. Maybe it’s that there are things wrong with the world (there are!) and kid is trying to figure how to live with that.

Some sincere, credible assurance of as much confidentiality would be helpful. A kid who won’t talk to parents isn’t going to talk to a therapist who is just going to report back to the parents.

Not at all to suggest that this is this kid’s issue, but I’m trans. After decades of depression and feeling suicidal I finally dealt with that, blew my cover, changed my name and a few other things. It’s been more than 15 years since I last felt suicidal.

Suicidal Teen
Guest Oct 3, 1:24 p.m.
QUESTION: Child psychologist here. Therapy is important- keep looking for the right fit. Don't forget group therapy options, becauee teens in particular are motivated by peer connection. In the meantime, leverage all the social relationships you can, because social supports are a major protective factor. Are there aunt/uncles/family friends who can send notes/go on outings? Encourage your village to reach out and nurture those connections (while maintaining your kid's privacy). Also, ask for a meeting at their school and talk about who their safe adults are. Your school social worker can be a great resource.

Re: suicidal teen
Guest Oct 3, 1:27 p.m.
QUESTION: The parent OP didn’t mention whether they apologized for going through their child’s personal device…reading their diary. It’s a pretty serious boundary violation that the teen might be responding to by leveraging the power they have; to stay silent when expected to talk to experts. Also, as a person who has dealt with/is dealing with depression, it can be particularly hard to talk about in front of one’s parents, if OP means that they attended appointments with their teen. By definition, my parents want me to be alive; how can I tell them I could take it or leave it, or would like it to be over or have a plan? I’d be so acutely aware of my parent’s distress that I couldn’t tell the truth.

Food and Personality Sensitivity
Guest Oct 3, 1:37 p.m.
QUESTION: I have a friend who's diet is restricted to gluten-free products. I just had her over as part of a large group for dinner. A couple of other people were bringing desserts and bread. I requested gluten-free, if possible. As a back-up, I made sure to buy a bakery fresh gluten-free dessert and store-bought gluten-free bread just for her. It turns out we needed both. Not only wasn't she grateful that I went to the trouble to accommodate her diet, she was outraged that she was singled out from everyone. She said the whole meal should have been gluten-free and no one would have said a peep. She told me that all of her friends now know that she has a gluten sensitivity and she's embarrassed by this. She won't even speak to me about this anymore. My husband says I should apologize and promise to never do anything like that again. He said I should also ask her what I can do to make it up to her (take her out for an expensive dinner, free babysitting for a few months?). I don't see that I did anything wrong and I really don't like the idea of apologizing to someone when I went out of my way to include her. Thoughts?

ANSWER: "Outraged"? That hits me as a lot.

I also don't see what's even remotely embarrassing about a food sensitivity or limitation. (I have firsthand experience, so.) But she can have her feelings.

I do agree with the apology, though, no matter what -- in writing, since she won't talk to you about it. "I am sorry I made you uncomfortable. That was the exact opposite of my intent -- I was trying to make sure you felt welcome, and obviously that backfired. Next time I will run my plans by you first.

"Please do allow me a next time. We'd love to host you again soon."

That's all the makeup you owe; no need to lay burnt offerings at her feet for having the nerve to buy her a special dessert ffs.

last week follow up
Guest Oct 3, 1:40 p.m.
QUESTION: I wrote last week about the dog=kids question. I was purposely vague which prompte d many readers to fill in the holes. To clarify: the person who insists raising their dog is just like raising a kid isn't a friend but a relative: a middle aged gay male. I feel pretty confident in saying that it's not my constant talk about my kids that prompts this behavior as this relative is a conversational monopolizer so I hardly get to say anything at all. I wouldn't have bothered writing back but the mom who wrote in about their suicidal child is heart-breaking and I guess to my point. There are so many worries we parents have. Will my child harm themselves? Will they grow up to be a school shooter, a psychopath or any number of destructive things? That kind of responsibility is just not part of owning my sweet canines.

ANSWER: So ... huh. Okay. First, small thing, I already agreed with you that the dogs/kids comparison didn't work. But I do want to add, now that you put it the way you do here, there are so many worries a pet-parent might have that a typical child-parent wouldn't. Like, getting loose in traffic or fear biting, or not being able to say what hurts, or knowing when it's time (or when you jumped too soon or took too long) to euthanize. Plus a dog will never learn to feed itself or let itself out. So I think we did better just not comparing.

Second, big thing: You left out the fact. Had I known "this relative is a conversational monopolizer," I would have been able to talk about a broken clue receptor. That's the issue. Has nothing to do with dogs, kids, hurt feelings or broken dreams or whatever else. He's not reading the room, he's just filling it -- so of course all kinds of dubious stuff comes out, Stop overthinking it; that just sends it on a journey through your own sensitivities.

My wife's therapist is driving us to divorce
Guest Oct 3, 2:08 p.m.
QUESTION: This is a weird question, but I could use some help in how to deal with my wife's reliance on her therapist.

We've been married eleven years and have always been able to work through our disagreements with candid communication, compromise and empathy. Last year, she lost her mother, and decided to start seeing a therapist to help her work through the trauma, which I supported.

But since then, she's started talking about our occasional marital disagreements with her therapist, and the therapist always seems to have a strong opinion about how it should be resolved -- almost always in her favor. So now, when we have our disagreements (which she usually brings up right after her sessions), and we start what used to be our period of communication/compromise, she says "But my therapist says...", and then she becomes totally inflexible, treating it like it's some sort of binding appellate court ruling.

I almost always disagree with the therapist, who's only getting a once-sided viewpoint and a small slice of the big picture. But my wife won't budge, so now, for the first time in our marriage, we've had a series of blow-ups due to her unwillingness to budge from whatever her therapist told her to do. (I'm sure she'd say I'm the stubborn one, unwilling to acquiesce to what her "neutral" therapist says.)

At one point I asked to talk to her therapist to at least hear my point of view before rendering her judgment, but the therapist says we'll need a different therapist if we want joint sessions, and recommended her friend. But I've resisted as these therapists are really expensive, and I don't feel like I should cede control of my marriage to them.

It reached a head where she wouldn't budge on something important to me (my hour of zoning out with a video game when I get home from work to decompress), and I asked to separate. She bawled and said we could work it out, but then the next day, after her therapy, she told me I was "gaslighting" her and that I should go if I can't "respect her boundaries," like she was reciting lines in a play.

I feel like I could save our marriage if I could free my wife from her therapist's clutches, but I also don't want to disrespect what my wife says, e.g. that the therapist is just helping her "find her voice." What do I do?

ANSWER: "I've resisted [joint sessions] as these therapists are really expensive, and I don't feel like I should cede control of my marriage to them."

But you asked to separate. So, to me that says you will end your marriage rather than "cede control" of it, and pay for two homes full time rather than one hour per week of a "really expensive" professional's time.

Meanwhile, you don't know whether you "disagree with the therapist," because you are not in the room. You are hearing it from your wife afterward. You also don't know how your wife represents your arguments to her therapist. Her "one-sided viewpoint" could be pretty accurate. You're assuming she skews it to her advantage.

None of this adds up to a credible argument against therapy or this therapist. It's a lot of conjecture and nonworking math.

What it does add up to is this: You feel like your life was better, and your marriage was better for you, before your wife got therapy -- and you're angry. You want the changes reversed. And you really don't want to go to the place that you blame for breaking everything to try to fix it.

Fair assessment?

If so, then here's my response to it:

-If you want to hear how your wife represents you and your marriage in therapy;

-And hear what a trained therapist says about that;

-And to make sure your side of the story gets heard;

-And spend hourly dollars vs monthly rent;

-And try to "save our marriage" and "free my wife from her therapist's clutches" vs walk away from it;

... Then you have been offered that chance in joint sessions with another therapist. Find out for yourself what the conversation is about and join it, instead of railing about what you think they're saying about you.

It takes guts to get in there, open your mind and really listen. But if your wife wanted things to be the way they were before, then they would be. For whatever reason, what worked for you so well wasn't working as well for her, and that's not a therapist's fault. A significant death and grieving can be an eye-opening experience -- emotionally transformative. The therapist may be correlation, not causation.

Listening is the first step toward figuring out whether both of you can be happier on the other side of this.

Wife's therapist
Guest Oct 3, 2:27 p.m.
QUESTION: Your wife's therapist is correct: She is an individual therapist, not a marriage counselor. If you want your voice to be heard within the context of your marriage in therapy, you need to go to a marriage counselor.

It is not at all uncommon for each person in the marriage to work with their own individual counselor and a marriage counselor in order to figure out how to support each individual within the marriage best.

If you don't like what's happening in her therapy, that doesn't mean the solution is to get rid of her therapist.

I'm the tattoo person!
Guest Oct 3, 2:43 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi, Carolyn - I don't know if I am more thrilled or terrified that my question was opened up to so many readers, but thank you! To reassure everyone, I am not afraid of my husband and feel completely safe. And, to the respondent who asked why I love them if I can't see them - I can see them whenever I want! I just have to pull my hair back. The public just can't see them.
I am extremely rejection-sensitive and have been my whole life. My biggest fear/dread is disappointing someone. I spent most of my life making sure what I did/said/wore would be approved before trying it out, and still do often. The reason I told my husband I was going to get my first tattoo unless he forbid it was that I decided I wanted it Enough to live with any related disappointment, as long as it wasn't a marriage deal-breaker. (It wouldn't have been one for me if the roles were reversed, but I am the rejection-sensitive one and he is not.)
Now, while he knows they are there, he can't see them. This is why I was stressing about adding one where it CAN be seen by anyone if I am wearing shorts or loafers. I would instead do another hidden one with less fear, but my hair is only so long.
My husband hates tattoos because they are Permanent-with-a-capital-P. You don't like your haircut? Grow it out. Don't like your job? Get a new one. But, decide you don't like your tattoo? It's going to stay there. And, as people get older and their skin loses elasticity, it's not going to look as great as that first month. But, you can't fix it or take it off. The other reason he hates them is he is an introverted navy polos and khakis kind of guy. So, he is uncomfortable doing things that call attention to oneself. And you can't take off a tattoo for a special occasion like an office party or a wedding to avoid conversation.
I hope this is helpful. I still really want it and think I am going to ask the artist if it could be done without an outline, so it isn't quite as noticeable from a distance. Thank you so much again.

What's wring with being happy?
Guest Oct 3, 2:59 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn! Lately I've noticed a lot of my friends are really down about the state of the world. I totally understand and don't judge. However, I think I'm pretty good at judging the size of my hands, and exactly how much of the world's pain I'm able to hold in them, and *spoiler alert* it's not much. Therefore, I do my best to be a good person, and accept the rest as not within my control. It works for me and I'm pretty happy.

However, this seems to really rub people the wrong way. There are quite a few friends and acquaintances I know who seem to think if you're not consumed with hatred and rage and fighting and screaming, that you're not a good person and you're not "doing enough."

I'm not really sure what, exactly, I'm expected to do to make our dear president start acting with some sense, but until I have that answer, I'm not going to make myself miserable over it. Also, hating anyone (even "fascists") is against my religion, and I don't think it helps anything, and I simply won't do it.

My question is how to talk about this? Sometimes my friends make comments that I'm "burying my head in the sand," or they'll say "you can't look at what's happening and not be upset." It feels like I'm failing some litmus test simply for taking care of my emotional wellbeing. I read the news. I'm perfectly aware of what's happening in the world. I just refuse to be consumed by it. Do you have any suggestions about how to handle the people who believe that misery is a moral imperative?

ANSWER: Reasons to be happy:

-It's an act of defiance I: "You can't break me"
-It's an act of defiance II: Say of your opponents, "Look at these clowns" (this entire concept via tuba). To sulk is to concede how big and powerful they are. Come on -- look at these clowns. Grab your tuba.
-It's an act of defiance III: You can't lose sight of what you're fighting to preserve.
-It's necessary. You can't be effective if you don't rest. Joy breaks are restorative.
-The happy warriors, merry band concept. You have to do the work anyway, might as well play good music and dance.
-No one will join your cause if you're miserable to be around.

That's it for now -- I have to run, this caught my eye as I was closing the window. Lmk if this moves any of your friends.

Roommate's eating disorder is disruptive
Guest Oct 3, 3:11 p.m.
QUESTION: I share a relatively small townhouse with 2 roommates. We’ve been roommates for almost 2 years and everything was going fine until recently. My one roommate Patty and I are longtime friends and the third is Linda - a friend of Patty’s sister who moved in when Patty’s sister got married. Linda works from home. She has issues with food which she assured us, after years of therapy, were under control. She explained that due to her eating disorder she needs to prepare and eat her food alone. Okay, we could accommodate that. But it’s gotten to be a burden, especially on weekends and other days off. At first she needed 30 minutes of private kitchen time twice a day, plus about 15 minutes to eat her lunch. She used to prep her lunch and breakfast at the same time and be out of the way before we got downstairs in the morning. Now for vague reasons that’s no longer possible and she wants the kitchen to herself for at least 90 minutes at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We’re not “allowed” to go into the kitchen/dining area while she is prepping or eating. Last month she upped the ante by requesting that we not even use the living room since it’s within sight of the kitchen. That means she wants us to head directly upstairs to our bedrooms when we get home from work until she texts us that she’s done with dinner. That isn’t possible, same with avoiding the kitchen when we’re trying to get ready for work. When we interrupt her, Linda gets upset to the point of crying and throwing her food away uneaten. She will not eat in her room or anywhere but the kitchen/dining area because she insists that’s “disgusting” and she’d rather go without. Last week Patty asked her to contact her therapist but Linda screamed at us that her ED is under control if we’d accommodate her “simple rule”. This has become a daily problem and even though we’re very sympathetic, we’re paying to live here and want to be able to access the kitchen and living room when we want to. What can we do?

In-laws made us feel unwelcome
Guest Sep 26, 11:03 a.m.
QUESTION: We just came back from a visit to my in-laws (FiL and StepMiL) and I don’t know what to make of it. If they were trying to make us feel unwelcome then mission accomplished. They relocated a year ago and have been bugging us to visit. Between one thing and another, we were only able to commit this month. It’s a 4-hour trip so we both took a half-day Friday and drove straight through since our 3 yo son slept most of the way. When we arrived on Friday at 6 pm they said they assumed we’d already eaten and hadn’t prepared anything. After we said we hadn’t had dinner and had rushed lunch they put out 3 slices of lunch meat, 6 slices of bread, some mustard, and a snack size pack of chips. They are not hard up for money and there was more lunch meat and bread in the packages as well as more bags of chips but that’s all they put out for all of us. I asked for some of the fruit I'd seen in the crisper and StepMiL said she was saving it for a cobbler on Sunday. For breakfast the next day, they said they usually have coffee and little sugar wafer cookies and that’s what they offered us. I asked about cereal since I’d seen some in the pantry but my FiL said they didn’t have “enough milk” though there was a quart container in their fridge. My son was hungry, so I went out for take-out for both of us. My wife made do with cookies and coffee. Lunch was the same meager sandwiches. My wife offered to fix dinner since they had plenty of food in the fridge and freezer. They accepted the offer and that was the only full meal we had that weekend, other than us taking them out for lunch on Sunday. The cobbler never appeared.
I don’t think it’s an age thing since my parents, and my MiL and her husband practically shower us with food when we visit them and they’re all the same age (late 60s). I asked my wife why they acted like that and she said she didn’t know but we’re never visiting again. I can’t shake the feeling that they wanted us to feel unwelcome and unless I can get an explanation, I’m not going to have a good feeling towards them ever again. Is it okay to ask my FiL what was up with the lousy hosting?

Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'd call that more than unwelcome -- that's downright weird.

A couple of things. First, maybe unrelated, you can't draw conclusions on "an age thing" just using a few others in the age cohort the way you did. There could be health-related problems in your in-laws' home that have an age component, and that could have been a contributor to your weird weekend (so many qualifiers there ...) -- and whether your parents or other in-laws feed you is immaterial. Likewise, you may think you know their $ situation but you do not know.

Second, weirdness to that degree is well worth a follow up, so I'm with you there -- but I would step back a bit from seeing it through such a personal lens, for now. Where you see, "They wanted us to feel unwelcome," try, "That was bizarre behavior that doesn't track at all with bugging us to visit." You have the facts of the severe food withholding and control. Wait until you have more information before you draw any conclusions about their motivations.

Third, your wife is with you on this. In most cases, the immediate family member is in a better position to communicate on weirdness. If she's willing, then she might get better answers. Plan the questions beforehand, using your past experience with them as a starting point: "I loved seeing you, but noticed things were very different on this visit," she can say. And then give specific examples -- one slice of lunch meat for dinner? Then, "I'm concerned."

This does seem to need eyes on it, I'm sorry. In a way I hope they were just mad at you (maybe for taking a whole year to get there?) and being shockingly childish about it, because then it's not an emergency; you can just peace out and not visit again.

two thoughts for today's husband who doesn't want to move back
Guest Sep 26, 11:26 a.m.
QUESTION: As somebody who lived this (my spouse and I alternated: best place for me, best place for her, then compromise city that wasn't perfect for either but above average for both and our young kid), two additions to Carolyn's advice.

While moving back and enabling her pursuit of her career is clearly the right answer, keep in mind the old home won't be like it was. You have a kid now, and so the questions of where to live and lifestyle and work/life balance, will have to consider the kid's needs. That means your partner's effort to resume her career is going to have more compromises (can't stay late in the lab because tonight is kid's talent show, etc.) There will likely be nights when she says "this isn't how I thought it would be" and your reaction better be, "OK, so how do we ensure you succeed?", and not "Oh, maybe we should go back to my happy place and you can just teach"!

To that, point consider solo counseling for you (if you prefer, a good job coach can work too) during the first year after the move, so you can work through your emotions and your loss (leaving a great job!). You're going to be balancing a job change (hard), trying to support your wife as she reboots her career (harder) and parenting (hardest?). You need to present to be a great parent, to support your partner in her tough moments, and to succeed in your new job, without carrying emotional baggage from the move/change. Oh yes -- and being a great parent is #1 -- if you and your partner don't have to worry about whether the kid is thriving, the edges of the other issues get less sharp.

Go Ask Your Dad
Guest Sep 26, 11:34 a.m.
QUESTION: Before we were married, my husband agreed to have two kids and at least one dog. Soon after we got married, I quickly learned he only wanted one and no pets ever. Since it was a two yeses/one no situation, I had to go along.

The problem is when our daughter wants to know why she doesn't have a sibling or a dog. I've never told my daughter about my husband's bait and switch, and I don't think it's my responsibility to explain my husband's decisions. He's the one who pulled out the rug underneath me.

My husband thinks we need a united front on these two decisions, which is hilarious because he contradicts me in front of our child all the time. I say he made both of these decisions unilaterally so he needs to defend and explain it, not me. Why would I defend something I don't agree with for the sake of martial harmony just so he doesn't look like the Bad Guy?

What do we do?

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: "We" -- you -- need to own your decision to stay with your husband once you learned about his (apparent) deception. Or you need to be true to yourself and make a different one.

I say apparent because people do change their minds, and they're allowed to. Conversations about x kids and y pets before marrying are essential, absolutely, for what they reveal about visions for the kind of life we want. I'm not minimizing that. People who say they want a stampede of life through the house will offer a different experience from the ones who say "... ehhhh no pets, maybe a child, but I have reservations about that and we need to talk about it." Both also are absolutely valid ways to go through life.

So what matters is the transparency -- and that means, as always, the main character here is character. More accurately, the integrity of the person you're weighing as a potential life partner. That tells you how much you can count on what they promise. It's not about the number of kids or pets, per se, because to treat that as a certainty is to deny how much of a say reality gets. All kinds of stuff can change, go wrong, pleasantly surprise you. (Hello, multiples.)

So -- back to your situation. You "quickly learned" his true preferences. Are you certain he did not come about that change of heart honestly? You say you were baited and switched -- which matters, because it is a towering plate of horse brownies that you "had to go along." Unless you live where divorce is illegal, you chose to go along.

If you chose to go along knowing your husband deceived you, then you -- and your dogless only child, unfortunately -- are lying in the beds you and your husband made. It's not all on him. He lied, but you stayed married to bad character, and you have nursed your resentment right up to posting this question. That is going to wear you down -- on top of the other predictable outcomes of eventually rotting out your marriage from the inside and deeply confusing your kid.

Please, get some counseling. Just you. Say out loud the foundational problem: "Shortly after we married, I discovered my husband lied to me about something huge -- and I thought I could get past it, so I stayed. But the anger is inside me every. day."

If I've called this wrong, then I'm sorry. But it's what I feel here throughout. And I don't see any answer to the, "What do I say to our kid?" question really mattering until you deal with the rage in the room.

Emotionally numb?
Guest Sep 26, 11:53 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi! Love your column. I've noticed myself feeling emotionally really numb to the array of things happening in the world. our nation, etc. Almost like my emotional center said, "nope, can't take any more." Is this something others are feeling? (or not-feeling?)
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Hi! Thank you.

I think somewhere between a squillion and a crap ton of people are feeling this, yes. Scientifically speaking.

It's confusing, too, because it's both protective and unnerving at the same time. Your emotional center is taking a moment to withdraw from the overwhelm, reasonably, but overall it feels weird and wrong.

[Here's the usual disclaimer that I am not a mental health professional of any kind, and that seeing one of the licensed kind can be a real benefit when things feel haywire. If you're asking, "Should I see someone?" then my answer is, why wouldn't you? It's not a 60-month contract.]

Butanyway. Something to try for the numbness -- or just the things-happening-in-the-world-ness, numb from it or not -- is beauty. Collectively experienced, if possible, like a concert or other performance, or a walk with someone at sunset, or an art exhibit. Photo albums of people you love can be healing, too -- total waterworks here if they hit me at the right moment. Or creating art. Movement helps so much; there is a proven link between physical activity and the ability to sort our feelings. What unlocks your feelings is such a personal thing, so I'll leave you to it.

I offer for your consideration, Ned's World.

Stingy In-laws
Guest Sep 26, 11:54 a.m.
QUESTION: I agree it deserves a follow-up if it's out of character for them, but I can completely see (in fact have seen) my in laws do this and they are just selfish and clueless. My MIL doesn't eat much food and my FIL is stingy and has no clue how to welcome or host anyone. When he's hassling us to visit, it's to serve his own interest of having my husband perform household chores for him and to check his ego box of "my kids and grandkids like me" (not true, unfortunately for him).) It has nothing to do with welcoming his kids and grandkids and making them comfortable. We avoid visiting and bring our own supplies when we do.

How do I move on?
Guest Sep 26, 12:14 p.m.
QUESTION: I really need to dress more professionally, so when I came into a small inheritance this summer, I decided to treat myself to a pricy online stylist. I hated it and my wardrobe isn’t any better, plus now I feel worse about my body and clothes. I’d like to move on, but I find myself dwelling on it—not only the money, but also I feel so foolish to have gotten such high hopes about this experience. I’m angry at myself and now buying clothes just seems so much harder. I hate that I feel so powerless and bad at clothes, but I really do need better work clothing for my job (just got a promotion, btw, so I must be doing something right). How can I stop this negativity towards myself and put this behind me? It seems like such a stupid problem with everything else going on.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whoa, whoa. Being mean to yourself is not a stupid problem because you live with you 24-7 -- and never feeling good in your body and clothes is not a stupid problem because you're in those 24-7. So breathe. Be kind. Let yourself be validly problemed.

You had the right idea with calling in reinforcements -- it just sounds as if you need a real in-person person helping you, not an online stylist. Not just anyone, either, but one you can trust on a bunch of levels. Mainly it needs to be someone you feel you can say no to, so you don't succumb to sales pressure and buy things that don't genuinely feel great. But you also need to trust this person's eye for style, and suitability to your body and environment.

I wish I knew where to send you for this unicorn, but it's not an off-the-shelf hiring situation. It depends on the stores in your area, whether they offer this service or whether you can hire someone independently as a consultant. Or maybe it's an acquaintance with fabulous taste, who knows. Even then, when you find someone, don't go all-in. Get a few things and see how right they are for you, then if you're pleased, go back for more.

Meanwhile, take the stuff you bought that you don't like and list it on resale sites (if you have the time and the give-a-damn) or heave it into a donation bin and be done with it. Purge the regrets from your closet.

In other words, on both fronts, put this behind you by giving yourself a 100 percent do-over. You have the money, and -- "with everything else going on" -- it's just clothes, right? So instead of using that truth to shame yourself, use it to give yourself a break.

Visit to InLaws
Guest Sep 26, 12:25 p.m.
QUESTION: I’m also concerned about this, but what strikes me is the apparent total reliance on things that didn’t require cooking. Unless this is the way the in-laws have always eaten? I’ve had several older relatives who have really lost the ability to prepare food - two because of an inability to navigate the kitchen and to stand for any length of time, and three because of dementia. One who technically still could have cooked just developed a tendency to forget that she should cook - or even eat regularly. In every case symptoms it seems like we should have seen earlier were an over- reliance on food that didn’t require any preparation (packaged chips, breakfast bars or cookies, sometimes fruit or cold cuts) and claims to have plans to prepare food (like the cobbler) that never materialized. Maybe one of the older couple in this case used to prepare all the food, and no longer can, and this is their partner’s way of compensating? It’s possible that a detailed conversation about what and how and when the in-laws are managing to feed themselves when nobody else is around is a good idea.

Just a PSA: My queue is filled with tales of parents who have gotten older and, when hosting, started serving one cracker for a family of 12. So I think we can mark it down as a Thing That Happens. Of course it comes with other adjustments, such as bringing one's own food on visits, keeping an eye on whether they're eating when no one's around, whether it's time for someone else to host, etc. I think that covers it.

Guest Sep 26, 12:47 p.m.
QUESTION: You are not alone by any stretch. At the risk of being put on the ENEMIES LIST for advocating science, I'll suggest reading this article from Scientific American a few months ago. It addresses what happens in the brain and offers some helpful coping.

Also, please do be aware that anxiety and depression can go hand in hand even though they are sort of opposite sides of the same coin (described to me once by a person with a long history of coping with both a "I am worried and care about all the things all the time in an endless spiraling loop (clinical anxiety) and I really don't care about anything at all ever (clinical depression)."

Dogs=Kids?
Guest Sep 26, 1:04 p.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn, Thank you for your column and wisdom. I have several dogs and several children. Someone close to me has a dog but no children. They repeatedly claim that having dogs is "just like having kids". This seems so out of touch that it is not worth rebutting and yet it is driving me crazy. Indeed there is a responsibility for both as vulnerable beings but help me out here. What to say to them or how to place this so it doesn't keep rubbing me wrong? TIA.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I see the wisdom of letting it go as beneath serious notice -- the reasoning behind it is, at least. When you can crate children for six hours or board them for weeks when you travel, then maybe we can talk seriously about the comparison.

But someone who feels the need to assert this repeatedly is, you would think, working on some kind of knot inside emotionally. It's clearly front-of-mind. In a person close to you, that is worth sincere notice -- the thoughtful, non-defensive kind -- next time they make this claim. "That seems to be on your mind a lot." You can stop there to see how they fill the silence. Or serve it up: "Anything you want to talk about?"

Could be a few things -- weighing having kids, sad about not having kids, tired of someone's pressure campaign to have kids, tired of being treated as less-than for not having kids (never hurts to check yourself for ways you might unwittingly contribute).

Unfortunately, if it's nothing and this person is just super dog-smitten and a tad myopic, or this is their conversational tic, they're probably not going to recognize the secondary message, "OMG you will not shut up about this."

But if you've ruled out the possibility that you're reacting defensively to a person who's in pain, then I don't see why two people who are close can't have a real conversation about it.

Friend back with abuser
Guest Sep 26, 1:05 p.m.
QUESTION: My friend is back with her abuser (pretty unstable dude with an alcohol issue), and now she's cutting people off a LOT. She cut off her very best friend for telling her to leave the abuser, and now she's saying that she "might" cut me off "in a few days" over a trivial political disagreement. How do I resolve this with her, and, how do I stop feeling like s--- about it? Thanks.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: 1. You don't "resolve this with her." Your friend is pretty unstable too, it seems? So your role is not to be the savior or fixer, but instead the safe place for her to go when she decides she's ready to stabilize.

2. I don't know that you're supposed to feel okay when someone you care about is self-destructing. It's awful, scary, sad.

Maddening sometimes, too, because you look at her choices and think "Omg how can you possibly not see a disaster coming here? And why do I seem to care more about you than you do!?"

It's also hard to know when to get involved and when not to. It's easy from the keyboard to say, "She has to decide when she's ready to accept help," blah blah blah (yes, I'm looking at me), but when you're a witness, it's hard to convey just how many times you ask yourself whether you'll forever regret not doing X if Y happens. It's a kind of torture.

Still. The answer is, and can only be, to make sure your friend knows you will pick up your phone 24-7 or darn close to it, and you will get her, no questions asked. This tells her she is worthwhile, and you care, and she has a place to go for help.

QUESTION: I don’t know if this will help or not, but I found it easiest to think of my work clothes kind of like a uniform, as it were - I found combinations that felt comfortable and professional, by brands that fit me well, and just kind of changed either colors or accessories to mix it up. For the most part, clothes in a professional setting are just background, or camouflage, if you will, leaving you free to focus on your job - takes some of the pressure off.

Re: Response to Ask Dad
Guest Sep 26, 1:14 p.m.
QUESTION: You don't even need the husband to have done a bait-and-switch to ask yourself if you're right together. I was married to a man who didn't want a second child (we had a second--a legit accident) or pets. I convinced myself it was okay because he was such a good person and we were compatible in other ways.

But it wasn't just about the kid and pets. It was about him wanting most of my attention. It was about him not tolerating a relaxed and sometimes chaotic family life. It was about his difficulty engaging with others. It was about his preference to spend money on his hobbies rather than on living things. I'm not saying those things are wrong. I'm saying they didn't, ultimately, fit my priorities.

So now I'm married to someone else, and we have a blended family and 5 rescue pets and are very involved with our community. The warning signal, way back when, was that I couldn't imagine a life without a pet and he couldn't tolerate the idea of a life with one. And it was a total tip-of-the-iceberg situation that took years to become apparent.

UPDATE - Husband and yard

QUESTION: Hello Carolyn!!!

I wrote you a while back about my husband’s layoff and strange obsession with the yard. You gave me lots to consider, and thanks to your input I approached him with curiosity and empathy, instead of accusing him.

You were absolutely spot-on with your assessment that he isn’t exactly neurotypical. Apparently, he didn’t bother telling me he was involved in a whistleblower case!! That was why he was gone for long stretches of time.

I can’t get into details (ongoing court case) but suffice to say I am so, SO proud of my husband for doing the right thing, even if he could have spared me a lot of stress by just talking about it…

QUESTION: Not to overreact to your post, but treating yourself with kindness is imperative not only with respect to wardrobe mistakes, but mistakes in general - I guess I just saw the “I must be doing something right,” in describing your promotion, as suggesting a bit of anxiety and perfectionism that might carry over into the workplace, not just your wardrobe, and it’s good to be aware of that as well.

dogs and kids from someone who didn't end up having kids
Guest Sep 26, 1:45 p.m.
QUESTION: I never had kids, which was not what I imagined. I actually imagined having four kids! I did end up having step kids, who were a little older when I came along, and I have had dogs. I have totally had the impulse to relate to someone with kids about how I take care of my dog, and most of the time have never blurted it out loud. I think what could be in play is that you can feel so isolated from the world being someone who doesn't have kids. There is that whole, "You just don't understand -love - -commitment- - fear- etc" until you've had a child sentiment. And I know I don't understand. But I do kind of, as a feeling human being, and someone who has informally mentored lots of kids, and stepmothered two kids, and yes, raised puppies. I guess what I am saying is try to be generous that your friend may be wanting to feel included, that they are not some non-contributing, non-sacrificing member of society because they didn't have that experience.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Thanks for your message, it's on point and refreshing.

The one you cited really gets under my skin: "There is that whole, 'You just don't understand -love - -commitment- - fear- etc until you've had a child' sentiment." There is a huge difference between the whole having-dogs vs having-kids comparison, which is concrete, to the "you don't know love/commitment/fear" extensions of that reasoning, which are so abstract, individualized and totally unfounded.

To be clear, the whole comparison of experience thing is suspect to begin with. It's so rarely necessary to point out to people what they "just don't understand." If we're about to say that, we really really need to ask ourselves if this is about advancing the cause of greater understanding or puffing up ourselves.

But in the rare cases when someone does need to say something, the whole area of what someone feels is not a valid basis for comparison, because no one can possibly know that - vs. has actually done, facts only, which can be compared.

Fence guy update

QUESTION: Hi, I'm the guy whose neighbor kids keep jumping our fence. First off, I don't know why so man y people thought my dog is the problem and not the trespassing. Our dog is a rescue who wants nothing more than to chill in her yard and doesn't even like to leave it for walks. She deserves her peaceful backyard so we're gong ahead with a 6 foot stockade fence. Thanks for taking my question
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You're welcome, glad you wrote back with an update.

The dog vs. kids isn't a value judgment, it's a reality judgment. Kids shouldn't be in your yard. That's simple. I agree with you. Dog shouldn't be an issue. Also simple. I can even add the parenting layer: Parents should keep their kids out of your yard. Of course.

But then you factor reality into it. Kids don't have fully developed forebrains. Parents don't hover over their kids 24-7. The kids might even listen to their parents and stop jumping your fence -- yay! -- but then they have a friend over who doesn't know the rules, and jumps the fence. What I'm saying is, there are so many things you can't control about the neighbors, tweens, that side of the fence.

A dog, meanwhile, is ... well, if you've been here before, you know how I feel about dogs. But if anything goes wrong, ask cops, animal control, insurers -- there's a not-zero chance it'll be the dog's fault. Especially a big dog. Plus, you can't tell your dog the rules.

That's the long answer about my answer. The short answer is, "should" is a lousy planning strategy.

A good planning strategy is to look at what is likely to happen, then what you don't want to happen, then what forms of prevention are in your control.

Do you want the answer you want, or an answer that can work.

Moving on from fight
Guest Sep 26, 2:15 p.m.
QUESTION: My husband picked a stupid fight with me yesterday and I’m not sure how to move on. I’m 39 weeks pregnant and have had a cold all week, but I was making dinner for us when he got home late from a work happy hour. He started criticizing how I chop garlic, which he has brought up recently and I’ve told him to drop it. He would not let it go last night until I lost my temper and screamed at him that he’d be sleeping somewhere else if he didn’t shut up. I said that unless it’s a safety issue (it’s not), he shouldn’t be telling another autonomous adult how to cook especially since he has no culinary training. He finally let it go after I yelled at him and made him go to the bedroom so I could cool off while I finished cooking. But we never fight like this so I’m left wondering what do I do now?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You go back to him and say okay wt[h] was that? Because, whatever it was, it was not about garlic, and you and he need to figure that out here and now.

I'm not saying this happened here, but some people actually do pick fights when they're anxious -- it's a way of seeking release. It's also super immature, obviously. Like, find your own way to process instead of getting all up in my grill.

Now, you, presumably not one to scream? have your own pent up stress at the moment. It could just be a one-off for both of you.

But it's something to consider here. If this is in any way a pattern, then seeing it before anyone reacts can really help. Ideally the person will get some, ah, counseling to learn better stress management, but if you see the nitpicking for what it is, then you can say, "Nope what's really bugging you?" and sometimes get from A to B without the detour into the proxy argument.

Oh, and small fix: "I said that unless it’s a safety issue (it’s not), he shouldn’t be telling another autonomous adult how to cook especially since he is having dinner made for him by an enormously pregnant person while he was at happy hour."

how do people move on so fast?
Guest Sep 19, 11:05 a.m.
QUESTION: I recently found out that my ex-boyfriend has a new girlfriend. We were together for a year, which I know is not long in the grand scheme of things, but it was a really important, special, and impactful relationship to me. And to him, from everything he told me and what we shared while together (which I do not doubt that he was lying about or misrepresenting). It's only been a few months and I cannot imagine meeting or becoming involved with a new person. Most days I am still so sad. But it seems he met this new person a month or two after we broke up, and pictures of them together are already all over his social media. (A friend told me this because she thought I already knew, which I didn't -- I've removed and haven't looked at any of his social media since breaking up, because I knew it would make me too sad.) I know logically that him being with a new person can't make what our relationship was any less special to me, but it just hurts. How do people manage to move on so fast? We're in our mid/late 30s, in case it matters.

-How any two people feel about each other is different (you may have been a 10 to his 5 in this particular relationship).

-How any two people break up is different. Some people do all the mental/emotional work of breaking up while they're still with someone, and the breakup just makes it official. Others start that clock upon breakup.

-How any two people recover from a breakup is different (maybe you were equals in capacity and attachment, but you recover through mourning and he through reattachment).

-How any two people present themselves is different. He could be more upset than you are, for all you know. It's social media, not truth serum.

-What any two people create in combination is different. What you had with this guy was impactful, special to you, that's important -- for some happy memories and for what it taught you about yourself and what you're looking for in a partner. Painful as it is, maybe this is a useful look now at some differences too big to reconcile.

Or it's just a setback as you're trying to get over him. Either way, he wasn't the guy. It's okay if you're not able to draw more from it all than that.

SIL wants my parents to be surrogate grandparents
Guest Sep 19, 11:18 a.m.
QUESTION: We live in the same town as my parents, and they are amazing grandparents to my two kids! We see them weekly and my parents occasionally take our kids on excursions to the park, movies, etc. Two years ago, my SIL (husband's sister) and her family moved to our town as well. This is also great, we get along well and see them almost weekly for dinner, etc. A few times, mostly at our kids' birthdays, my parents and SIL's family have been together at our house. My parents interact great with SIL's two young kids (now 1 and 3). The 3 yo even calls them "Grammy and Grampy" because that's how our kids refer to them, which I think is adorable. But it's now causing an issue. SIL/my husband's parents live a few hours away, and don't travel much due to mobility issues. SIL's whole family has been no-contact with her husbands' parents for years (just for context... I agree with their reasons, not that my opinion matters). My SIL recently started talking about how nice it would be for her kids to have a routine grandparent connection and she would like for us to include her kids on outings my kids take with my parents. I feel... weird about this, like it's cutting into my kids' bond with my parents. But I asked my parents, and they said they had no interest in a closer relationship with SIL's kids. Unfortunately my SIL did not take this well. I think she's working through some grief about the lack of grandparents and now she's lashing out at me for "selfishly" keeping my parents "to myself." So... advice on handling this in a way that doesn't destroy a relationship I hope can be close again?

ANSWER: Wherrrrrrre is your husband in this? Where. Seriously.

This was up to your parents, and they said no. So there you go.

I do feel for your SIL. If I were in your place, I'm not sure how I'd feel -- because it would depend on all the variables, like my parents' natures and their health, my relationships with them, theirs with my kids, my kids' relationships with the other kids and the SIL and husband, mine with the SIL and the husband, husband with everyone, all that. If everyone got along, then I hope I'd be in a more-the-merrier frame of mind. But I could easily see being more circumspect.

That's why the SIL took responsibility for not flipping out if she didn't like the answer. That to me was the prerequisite to such a delicate request.

Because if the parents weren't game for any reason, then she was forcing you to be their bouncer, and that role was always going to suck. "No, your babies are not on the list to be their grandbabies. Step aside."

Which brings me to my opening query. I would want my husband to absorb any lashing-out from his sister on the family's behalf. It's the right thing to do.

Worried abut litigious neighbors
Guest Sep 19, 11:37 a.m.
QUESTION: We’re starting to have problems with our next-door neighbors. I don't want to be enemies, but I also don’t want to lose a bunch of money because they decided to sue us. My wife and I have lived here since last January and the neighbors on one side have two tween boys. Recently I saw the older boy jump our fence to retrieve his ball. I was worried because even though he was the one trespassing into our yard, the fence is rickety, we have a large dog and a lot of uneven spots (we did what we could this summer but the yard still needs a lot of work). The father of those boys is a lawyer and I know if one of them gets hurt, they’ll sue us for every penny we’ve got. I told the boy to stay out of our yard, to ring the bell and ask for the ball when that happens. He said he would but I’ve caught him and his brother both in our yard since then. I went and talked to their father, but didn't get anywhere. He didn't take me seriously and told me that I was overreacting, that kids will jump fences and it’s no big deal. I felt like he was patronizing me so I snapped and told him that he better not let his kids trespass in my yard again otherwise I would call the police to start a paper trail. I’ve put up no trespassing signs but we can’t afford a new fence and I’m losing sleep over this. My wife thinks I’m overacting but my parents got sued by a neighbor when I was young. Their kid was playing with my older brother, tripped over a ladder in our yard and hit his head on a retaining wall. My parents had to pay all of the hospital bills and their insurance went through the roof. So I know how badly these things can go. Should I try to talk to my neighbor again or just take out a loan and put up a bigger, jump-proof fence? My wife is against going into debt but says she’ll go along with it if it’ll give me some peace of mind.

ANSWER: Whoa, wait a minute. You "know" you'll get sued because your neighbor is a lawyer? You "snapped" just because you "felt like he was patronizing me"?

It sounds to me as if your next-door neighbors are starting to have problems with you -- based on your assumptions about them that you've cast into hardened certainties based on a bad experience you witnessed as a child. Whew.

I am not an insurance expert or a lawyer, obvy, and this brings in both areas of expertise. But I am comfortable calling it when I see someone creating a problem they're blaming on someone else.

Is it great that the tweens are in your yard, no. But the parents can't possibly supervise their kids 24-7. That is unrealistic. You, however, can recognize when you're letting past results cloud current judgment.

And you can also recognize when you're worried about the wrong problem. You have a large dog and a rickety fence. That tells me you -- not the boys -- are your own reason to borrow money for a big, sound new fence. And to approach the neighbors with a peace offering and an apology for starting off on such an aggressive note. And looking into an umbrella policy if you're going to lose sleep over stuff like this to the point you can't be civil.

Moving Away/Left Behind
Guest Sep 19, 11:46 a.m.
QUESTION: My bestie — my daily ride or die! — is working hard on moving their family to Europe. Like, selling property, getting background checks, hiring lawyers, seriously trying to leave. And while they're excited and want me to be excited for them, I'm really struggling. I'm, frankly, devastated. I can't leave for a billion reasons (primarily, kids and husband are not on board with exploring this). How do I navigate faking excitement for them while my heart is breaking at being left behind?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Have you told the truth yet about your devastation?

It happens all the time that friends' new relationships, promotions, moves, births -- obvious additions to their lives -- turn out to be subtractions from ours, of their time or presence or attention. At some point we have to find a way to be happy for them, or else we're just peevish and self-absorbed and not very good friends.

But it's hard to get to that point in a genuine, good-for-the-friendship way without some sort of honest reckoning with the loss. Like, be peevish for your moment. "I know I am supposed to be happy for you, but I need to say out loud first that I am devastated by this. I want you around every day/week like always and my heart is breaking at being left behind." You can even say right afterward that you appreciate the chance to say this, will be on message with your excitement and support from now on, and have some thoughts about the decor for their guest suite.

If you have already aired your grief to your friend, then openness about your struggle can still work and be a fair part of close friendship, as long as you're not expecting her to fix this for you. Something like: "I'm still excited for you, I'm just having some breakthrough grief today for me." Good friends have their own sense of the right mix for them, but in general too much dumping and too much faking both can be a strain.

surrogate grandparent OP
Guest Sep 19, 11:56 a.m.
QUESTION: OMG thanks for answering my question! My SIL and I actually have (or had...) a very close relationship. We chat and meet up independently of husband, and I consider her a close friend. So it seems weird to offload this to my husband, like "whoa, this relationship got too hard for me, I'm out!" As for the dynamics... her kids are 1 and 3. Mine are 7 and 10. Both my kids love their cousins and are very sweet with them but doing the same activities is hard, given the age differences, and I think they treasure those outings where it's just the two of them. But I WANT to be in the "more the merrier camp" which is why I think I'm struggling with this... I do feel guilty, like I'm depriving my niblings of something the kids have. I think if I pushed, my parents would come around. But I don't want to push! My instinct is to just wait this out, it's out of character for my SIL so maybe she's just going through a rough patch. But it has me dreading our weekly get-together this weekend. Last time she started crying over it and I felt awful.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ah, this helps a lot, thank you.

Definitely sounds like SIL's whole campaign for surrogate grandparents is a proxy for a bigger something-else. Certainly the big feelings about it.

As for pushing your parents, agreed, not the move, for a bunch of reasons. Here's a capsule: So your SIL is going to start calling your parents and bring her kids over without any of the rest of you there? I get the general surrogate grandparent idea, but definitely makes sense to give it more time to happen organically.

But a little push to your SIL might be the right one, this weekend. A gentle, "Hey -- I hope you don't mind my asking. What's really going on?"

Re: avoiding the litigious
Guest Sep 19, 11:59 a.m.
QUESTION: As a non-litigious ex-lawyer (there are more of us than you might think), I’d also point out that with a rickety fence and a large dog, you’re running risks from the litigious general public, not just your immediate neighbors. Even though he believed that “something there is that doesn’t love a wall,” and that we should be careful to know what we’re “walling in or walling out,” I think even Frost would agree that this is an occasion where “good fences make good neighbors.”

surrogate grandparents
Guest Sep 19, 12:15 p.m.

So much hatred
Guest Sep 19, 12:36 p.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn I'm not sure how to cope anymore. My husband and I have been married 20 yrs with no kids. In the beginning our marriage was fine. About 10 yrs ago his mom died and mine died 9 yrs ago. It was a hard time but we got through it. We've since relocated to be near family and life got better. His attitude started to improve. He came off his depression meds.

Lately though he has so much hatred for everything and everyone. He gets so angry for little things now and things he can't control (the firing of Kimmel for example). He's become lazy at home - never helping out with chores and never picking up after himself. For the past 11 months we have not slept in the same bed (he always has an excuse - not tired, needs to listen to podcast, dog took up the bed etc). And don't get me started on the romance - it isn't there.

He's clearly going through depression issues but I don't know how to help. I've suggested counseling and he doesn't follow through, I've suggested a therapist and he doesn't follow through. I've even tried to get him to see just a primary care but nope.

What, if anything, can I do at this point? Last night I put on a netflix show but he keeps his head in the phone and when I asked him a question he literally told me to "F off". Obviously I wouldn't take it so I left the room. He'll try and talk to me today when he comes home from work but never apologizes for his words which quite honestly hurt.

I am seeing a therapist but how can I help someone who is refusing to get help?

I'm feeling lonely in my own marriage.

ANSWER: You don't have to live like this.

Don't just believe it -- know it. It is your baseline.

It does sound as if his depression is back with a vengeance, yes, and so medical intervention will be the answer. It also sounds as if you will need to be more forceful in your "suggest[ing]" that he get professional help. This is still going to fall short of so-called making him get treatment, which we all know isn't a thing.

But you, in the meantime, don't have to live in this reaction place to his misery and mistreatment.

You can make any one of a series of decisions on a scale of disengagement from his misery. Just to use the sleeping apart example: You cite 11 months of his excuses. That means you keep trying, right? You could instead choose to formalize the new sleeping arrangement and make your room the retreat you want it to be.

This may hit you all wrong, and I can understand that. But it's an example of using your agency and working within your current reality to stabilize your well-being from one day to the next. Instead of dragging that nightly what-if into a 12th month, you settle it, and sleep well in your nest, and decide to focus on higher-percentage issues like urging him back into care.

You can go bigger or smaller than this. Smaller would be a sit-down with him on making appointments, for example. And/or, trying on a decision to switch from reacting to acting, and then going through the next few days noticing what things would change when you do that, and how -- then starting gradually to introduce those changes.

Bigger, separation. "I love you. Too much to let this keep spiraling. You told me to F off. You can make appointments to get back into treatment for your depression, or you can pack."

However big you go, though, do take the reins of your life back. Not only will it be healthier for you, but it will actually make you more effective in dealing with your marriage, however you choose to respond.

Nights to Ourselves
Guest Sep 19, 12:38 p.m.
QUESTION: My wife is an amateur singer. She is in a barbershop quartet. They practice one evening per week and go to regional retreats/competitions a few weekends a year. She's been doing this for many years. She loves singing, though she has told me on numerous occasions about various frustrations with her group; it often seems like she is not having much fun. Still, I support her activity because it is what she chooses to do.

We now have two kids, currently four and two. Since they arrived, I've always taken care of them on rehearsal nights. I go with her on the weekends away, bring the kids to her for nursing, and otherwise find ways to keep busy with them. It isn't easy, but it's fine.

Having two young kids in general is hard work for both of us. A year or so ago, I said that since she was taking one night a week off for herself, I should get one too. She agreed, and now I go out to do some activities I enjoy (gym climbing and poker) one evening per week.

This arrangement is fine with me. I thought it was fine with her. Recently, though, I noticed some body-language resentment. When I asked, she said that she kind of felt it was unfair that I got to have "personal time" each week to do things just for myself when she didn't. I was confused, and said I thought of her rehearsals as her personal time. She said that they did not really count as personal time because she had made a commitment to her group and, although she did not say this part, lately has not been enjoying it so much.

I think that if she chooses to spend her time with her quartet, that's great, that's her choice, that's her personal time. If she doesn't want to do it anymore, she can and should quit; other members have quit in the past, there is nothing forcing her to continue. We've agreed to disagree about this.

Her position seems absurd to me. What am I missing?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I suppose I could say, "Her quartet is her personal time," blam, and be done with it -- I want a curly white wig -- but if she needs some relaxation time, then she does. That makes sense, doesn't it? You can understand how her hobby isn't relaxing?

And maybe she isn't ready to let the quartet go -- those two things don't seem mutually exclusive to me, loving to sing and not loving the organizational headaches.

So why not two blocks of discretionary time each. Doable? Maybe get paid care for one of them, so you both get a break and it's not always paid for with the other's energy reserves. It doesn't always have to be expensive. We used community-center drop-in care for a while, for example. We had to stay on site but there was a fitness room and a pool, good enough.

Anyway -- I love the phrase "body-language resentment." And good job picking up on it and talking about it. But don't get so caught up in keeping perfect score that you don't prioritize finding ways to give each other what you need.

This morning's column
Guest Sep 19, 12:53 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, I was surprised at your answer to the expecting mother who is opposed to naming the baby for her MIL who detested her and said so to her. Why not counsel honesty? LW stated she didn't want to burden her husband with the truth. While his mother was dying that might have made sense, but it doesn't now.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Funny thing about that. I would have counseled honesty at the very beginning. That was the missed opportunity. Mistake, I'd say, now that we're talking about it. But that was not and is not a useful opinion at this point.

Maybe you're right that the truth wouldn't be a burden now, but I see your certainty as a failure of imagination. To some grieving children, this could be the exact worst time to be handed an ugly truth about Mother -- sainted, sainted Mother.

You see my point. (Everywhere you turn, perhaps.)

Without knowing the situation LW had to work with, there really wasn't a way to know what was informing the decision to let the mother's nasty back-channeling die with her. But I could definitely see a version of events that would make LW decide now wasn't the optimum time to drop this truth. Ergo, advice to support LW in that assessment.

Food Fight
Guest Sep 19, 1:10 p.m.
QUESTION: During COVID, I became the de facto cook in my household (it's just my husband and me). That included all the shopping, paying for groceries, cooking, and about half the time cleaning up. At the time, my husband's job was more time-consuming/demanding/stressful than mine, so I understood and did not resent taking on the chore. But, over time, I became burnt out. I also started a GLP-1 medication and my appetite is seriously reduced. (Most nights I could have a bowl of cereal or a smoothie for dinner and be satisfied.) I went from full-time telework to five days in the office.

I continue to purchase groceries, which involves some degree of meal planning, and cooking dinner occasionally. But some nights I get home from work and I just don't want to cook. I can tell this irritates my husband a bit and then, rather than cooking the food we already have in the fridge, he will order delivery. Then I wind up feeling obligated to cook the next night otherwise the groceries will go to waste.

Am I being unreasonable? I know I can't force him to cook. Should I just buy fewer groceries every week, knowing that if I'm not up to cooking, he's going to order out?

FWIW, and I swear I'm not saying this to count my chits, I also do all the cleaning, laundry, trash taking-out, and more than half of the dog care -- most of which I enjoy, but still. Do we just need a bigger conversation about household chores?

ANSWER: "Do we just need a bigger conversation about household chores?"

👆️

And about life changes. It's bigger than chores at this point. You're not eating as much and you're at the office -- why are you still shopping like nothing has changed? And asking me whether to stop?

This letter makes a great body-language bookend to the quartet story. You're reading the irritation, too ... and then "I wind up feeling obligated to cook the next night"? That's a whole nonverbal sequence. Interrupt it verbally with your spouse: "I'm reading irritation in your body language. Since I'm not even hungry for dinner these days, and I'm back at the office, I think our division of labor is stuck in the pandemic and it's not working for either of us. Let's talk this weekend to make some new plans. Sound good?"

Re: nights to ourselves
Guest Sep 19, 1:24 p.m.
QUESTION: I think one thing that’s missed in Carolyn’s response is: the parents should discuss and agree on how many nights they want to spend together as a family, and how many are ok with just kids + mom or dad or childcare. I know in my own family (two parents working full time, a 5yo, a 3yo, and a baby due later this year), I would have trouble supporting more than one night per week of solo-parenting, because I think our very limited time together as a family is so important. Other families will have other comfort levels. But it may be that, after agreeing how many nights per week they are ok solo parenting, there may not be enough time for the wife to have her weekly practice AND another weekly night to herself AND fulfill her family quota. Maybe she does the weekly rehearsals and then one me-night every other week, or whatever else works. But maybe THAT conversation is the one that gets her to rethink spending one night per week that she doesn’t really enjoy. The biggest issue is that when you’ve got young kids, there never ever feels like there’s enough time to do all of the things you wish you could, so you have to prioritize.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: It doesn't have to be nights. Weekend mornings, for example, were a natural break time Back in the Day. Sign the kids up for X, and one parent takes them there and the other one has ahhh time. If the family schedule is packed, then the parents trade off that Saturday breather. Saw this all the time.

There was something else we used to talk about and I put it in the column too, though it's been a while? Each parent in a co-parent situation feels like they're doing 75 percent or more -- it never feels like just half. That's when you know you're pulling your weight.

Point being, it's important to remain mindful of the value and exhaustion in what the other is doing, too. If you start getting possessive of time and accusatory with each other, danger.

How to manage annoyance with good neighbor
Guest Sep 19, 1:40 p.m.
QUESTION: Can you help me with some mantras or perspective for dealing with a neighbor who I engage with a lot and who regularly frustrates me? We live very close and our young children are friends and we naturally deal with each other a lot. I think she’s a good person but our styles are very, very different and I find it hard to organize things with her. I will acknowledge that I am on the more organized side and work as a corporate lawyer. She is a former teacher and clearly is more of a person who jumps in and does things on the fly.

That’s fine, but it’s very frustrating when I’m trying to handle logistics with her. For example, she asked if we could pet sit and I agreed. But then she didn’t offer a walk through so I had to ask for one. I then suggested a time and she agreed but then was not around. We worked it out but it’s an example of how I feel like I spend 3x the time and mental bandwidth on any logistics she’s involved in!

To reiterate, she is a good person and an excellent neighbor and has a lot of great qualities that I have not stated here. But on this particular issue, she’s obviously not going to change so I just need some help changing my mindset!

avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Oh this super bugs me.

The correct answer to your attention to something he finds important is gratitude. Or just not freaking crabbing about it to you after you do this for him.

When he crabs that it's not good enough, think of the message -- you have to look like you aren't tired, depleted, erased? It's not good enough that you're doing it for him, you have to pretend you're doing it for you? OHHH, it's terrible you have to pretend? You should be doing it for you? Okay!! So basically you can't win. You can't have an honest feeling. You can't be tired. You can't fake it, either. You have to give him the thing but not look like you're giving him the thing.

This is really crappy and not okay, and all I can do is hope that if he thought about it for a moment, he would agree that it's a crappy and not okay thing to do to you.

Yes, I'm sure you wish, too, that you had the energy to want it. It's not like this is your first choice of feelings.

Now -- I have sympathy for him and for anyone who doesn't think their partner is attracted to them, or with a strong sex drive whose partner's drive isn't there. Difficult stuff. But think of the limited menu that hands them: They can be told they're outta luck!! That right there. Or they can talk about opening the relationship, they can cheat? A lot of not great options. or ...

Their partner can make an effort to push past the low sex drive, understanding that's a part of a long-term monogamous relationship. That it's a mutual effort to meet each other's needs, with love and respect.

That's what you're doing. I wish I could beam thoughts into your husband's head that complaining about "good" because it isn't perfect is not a great look. Everyone is taking something from you, and he's whining that he's not getting enough.

That's all rant, no advice.

Condensed version is the advice: Tell him you would love to feel like your freer self. Currently, you are this self -- offering herself to him out of love. To be criticized for that is not setting a mood.

How to manage annoyance
Guest Sep 19, 2:14 p.m.
QUESTION: It might also help if you don’t attribute your differences to your professions, or former professions, but just focus on a solution that works for you both (speaking as a former lawyer and a former English grad student/teacher, who saw examples of organization and disorganization in both professions). Stereotyping doesn’t help anything.

How to survive as a trans person?
Guest Sep 19, 2:26 p.m.
QUESTION: I'm trans and the world is super scary right now. Do you have any advice on how to keep moving forward?

Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Find your people, and let them help you when you need it. I don't know if there are more of us who want you to be safe and happy and yourself than there are people using you to score political points. But if you can find them, then that can be a refuge from where the "world" is online and anonymous and shouty. It will be something people want to do for you, if I can presume to speak for others. Even if none of you ever says a word about it and the deal is just to allow you to live in peace.

I am sorry you have to think about this. It's not right.

Re: marriage
Guest Sep 19, 2:35 p.m.
QUESTION: I dunno - if I found out my partner was only having sex with me because I wanted it, and not because THEY did...no shower is hot enough for that realization. I get wanting it, I truly do, but...that feels like a much bigger issue.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: It could be, but not necessarily. Esp over a long marriage, mismatches in drives are almost guaranteed -- and if they both want monogamy, then there's going to be some degree of welp-okay. Is it for the other person, or is it for the marriage? Or -- is it so bad that it's for the other person? Or, maybe the lower-drive person wouldn't initiate, but, welp, okay!

Having a fixed idea of how you'd handle "that realization" is the enemy of figuring it out.

Response to Marriage question
Guest Sep 19, 2:39 p.m.
QUESTION: I was just listening to a sexual health expert who said heterosexual couples are nearly always mismatched, and that it is the responsibility of the higher-drive person to take care of their own needs by themselves. The lower-drive person is the one who sets the pace for joint activity.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Sure, because you extend that out -- and you get to a point of the lower-drive person having sex they don't want? Yikes.

But short of that extreme, it is valid for the lower-drive person to see the life trajectory their partner is on, and make an effort to address the low drive, if possible.

Update and new question from LW with abusive stepdad
Guest Sep 12, 11:02 a.m.
QUESTION: I wrote to you over 3 years ago with a question about how to tell my daughter about her father (who was my abusive stepfather). I took your advice and let my therapist guide me in how best to let my daughter know about her father. What she's been told for now is that he’s not a part of her life because he wasn’t nice to me. We are doing great. Last year we moved into our own apartment. We're scraping by, eating a lot of beans, lentils and peanut butter but making the best of it. I converted a walk-in closet to a tiny bedroom for my daughter and made a fabric canopy for her little bed and together we put glow in the dark stars all over the walls and ceiling. Our little home makes both of us so happy. She's a great kid - cheerful, healthy, smart. She’s in second grade now and the joy of my life.
Now my question. Her father died about 6 months ago in a car accident. He was driving drunk but thankfully no one else was severely injured. I’m so happy he’s dead. If that makes me a terrible person, I don’t care. I feel great knowing he can never hurt us or bother us in any way. My mother started contacting me after his death. She claims that she was as much a victim of him as I was and she wants to be part of my life and to get to know my daughter. I guess she could be telling the truth but I only remember the terrible things she said to me and the ugly names she called me when I got pregnant. I never saw him abuse her or even get angry with her. I don’t know. My daughter and I are doing so well and I want to enjoy our stability and not invite trauma and pain back into our lives and that’s what my mom means to me even if she’s telling the truth about my stepfather. My daughter and I finished with therapists just last year and this would start that up again since a relationship with my mom might mean that my daughter has to learn more about her dad, especially that he's dead now. Is it okay if I tell my mom we’re not up to dealing with this right now, check back in a couple of years?

ANSWER: Of course it is, yes -- and would be so without the extent of the trauma. Because you decide whom to have in your life and on what terms.

That's the bedrock here. All other issues -- including what is fair or reasonable or true or healthy, etc. -- are secondary. Everything starts with the fact of you as your own gatekeeper for your time and your heart and your self.*

Now, some thoughts about "even if she’s telling the truth." Knowing only what you've written in your two questions, I believe your mother was also a victim of your stepfather's abuse. Or at least, I find it credible. It's an uncomfortable topic, to put it mildly, but there is room for grey in the reality of abusive relationships, and people who are caught in an abusive cycle with someone like your stepfather can certainly do harmful things themselves.

Sometimes it's to themselves, or to their abusers, but too often it's to others. (Or all three.) Relevantly: We've all seen it over and over in this space, in fact, in the form of either turning a blind eye to the other parent's abuse of the children, or even siding with the abusive parent against the children. Nothing excuses this -- but it's cited so often by people who grew up with an abusive parent that I suspect it's a survival response in the partner. A maladaptive one, obviously. When humans get feral it tends not to be good.

Anyway -- none of that justifies her claim that "she was as much a victim of him as I was." If that is indeed how she phrased it. She was the adult, you were the child, you were raped, and she remained partnered with your rapist till his death. So, absolutely freaking not. There is not enough "not."

And further, "she wants to be part of my life and to get to know my daughter" is only about her. She's coming to you, imagine that, to help her heal? The framing a healthy person would know to offer, as you may have spotted instantly from your own good work in therapy, is, "I understand it was unforgivable, but I at least want to apologize for my utter failure to protect you." In other words, only about you. Only. Paired with an independent effort to seek support and heal on her own time and dime.

You can't want wellness for her. But you can respond to her that you're sorry to hear she also suffered your stepfather's abuse -- and hope she will consider therapy, given how empowering it was for you. (Your own phrasing, of course.)

Losing Half My Kid's Life
Guest Sep 12, 11:14 a.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn, My partner and I are splitting up after some terrible, grueling years. I know I cannot live like this another second - but the idea of missing so much of my (one) child's life is unbearable. Do you have any words for how to bear up with this? Tell me it's going to be ok?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: It's going to be okay.

I'm sorry it has been so bad for so long. That means, though, that you have already been missing some of your child's life to that. So in a way this is your chance to reclaim some happier time.

Plus, the reality of co-parenting under one roof includes more tag-teaming, handing off, you-here/me-there, than you may realize. And, there's another relationship to conduct (an offshoot of the above point). Even when you get along with your co-parent, you are managing that bond and the one with your kid, and the mechanics of the whole unit together. When you're solo parent, it's just you -- you're on.

So yes, it's less time, specifically fewer days, but those days are more. Meanwhile, their time to themselves is something many newly solo parents come to appreciate and learn to use to their and their kids' benefit.

Talk to some parents who have made this transition -- not all the stories will be happy ones, but I think in aggregate you will find them reassuring. Definitely useful.

Fuchsia wedding gown
Guest Sep 12, 11:18 a.m.
QUESTION: I’m getting married next year and couldn’t be happier. During the planning I got the idea to wear my grandmother’s wedding gown. She got married in 1970 and her dress is stunning. She was in the fashion industry and had the gown custom made for her. It’s a slinky floor-length A-line gown in a gorgeous shade of fuchsia. She hates the color white as much as I do. It has a square neckline that's perfect for a statement necklace I have. I contacted my grandmother and she’s having her dress dry cleaned and says she'll bring it on her next visit. She was able to wear it as her mother-of-the bride dress when my mom got married and says it’s still in perfect condition. She even knows a local seamstress who can fit it for me.
My future mother-in-law thought it was wonderful that I’d be wearing my grandmother’s gown until she saw a picture of it. She insists that it couldn’t be a wedding gown since brides only wore white back then even though the picture is clearly of my grandparents on their wedding day. My mother-in-law to be can’t let it go, she keeps saying what a mistake it will be to be married in 'that dreary old pink dress' and that I’ll miss all the fun of picking my own special gown. My mom suggested I wear something more traditional like she did so I don’t upset my mother-in-law to be. She offered me her gown but though I would never tell her, I hate it. It’s white, poufy and just over the top with tulle and beading. My mom also keeps asking what my sister (my only attendant) will wear even though I've told her several times my sister can wear anything she wants that goes with fuchsia. She acts like that's going to be so hard when there's tons of choices. With both moms objecting, is this a stupid hill to die on? My fiancé says I should wear what will make me happy and that’s my grandmother’s wedding dress.

Permission to leave
Guest Sep 12, 11:36 a.m.
QUESTION: Some time ago, I discovered that my spouse had never been faithful to me since our relationship began, well over a decade ago. We have an elementary-aged child together, and I think we get along pretty well on a day-to-day basis, considering that I cannot imagine trusting my spouse with my emotional well-being again. We have both done individual and couples' therapy, and my spouse continues to withhold information about social interactions despite promising transparency.

There are obvious practical concerns, including wanting to retain as much stability for our child as possible, and the costs of separate households in a high cost-of-living area. How do I know that divorce is an okay thing to do when it would upend our child's world? What reasons are good enough?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: That your spouse is fundamentally, serially dishonest seems like one of the better ones to me.

Divorce isn't a picnic for kids but in-house instability isn't, either, so you do your best.

I mean, have you said outright to Spouse, "I know you will never be faithful to me. I am done trying for that. I want you to be honest with me"? I'm not suggesting you have an open marriage, or divorce and live apart, or divorce and cohabit as roommates, or whatever other configuration might arise from this tell-me-the-truth phase of your lives. I'm merely asking whether you've removed this last remaining incentive your spouse might have to hide the infidelity.

If you've done that and the lying persists? Then that tells you something. Spinning off your own household, especially if you have primary custody, could be a lot healthier for your kid. But that's super-speculative, probably (sorry) better for a session or two with the pros.

I'm sorry.

Perceived cruelty
Guest Sep 12, 11:36 a.m.
QUESTION: If one feels they have been spoken to cruelly, is it better for one to confront that, or just cease communications completely?

Thinking of Angelou's poem: "When someone shows you who they are, believe them."

But unsure how best to proceed.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'd prefer more context, but without it I'll say generally that it's best to respond to people directly. "What a cruel comment. I hope you didn't mean that."

When you "just cease communications completely," you don't give people a chance even to know what they did to upset you, much less fix their mistakes. Certainly there are times when people know exactly what they did and have no intention of fixing it -- but severing ties treats that as a 100 percent certainty. Meaning, you're leaving zero room for the possibility that anyone ever misspeaks, or tells a joke that falls flat, or means it but has instant regrets.

That's just not realistic, is it? I believe Maya Angelou is a beacon, but also that you're misapplying her words here. I don't think she's saying, "The minute someone says the wrong thing, they should be dead to you." Instead, it's wise guidance on character, and on trusting yourself. You do know poor character when you see it, and it's okay not to keep granting second and third and nth chances for people of poor character to keep harm you.

That leaves plenty of room for you to tell someone the effect their words had on you, and to weigh their response. Their words, your objection to them and their immediate and longer-term response to that are all, to my mind, under the umbrella of "the first time," which I believe is the omitted part of the quote/thought.

RE: Losing Half My Kid's Life
Guest Sep 12, 11:48 a.m.
QUESTION: I'm 3.5 years into this life. It's ok to be sad right now. I'd be more worried if you weren't struggling with this. My experience has been that my mindset is everything. If you keep focusing on the "this sucks" aspects of this long term, I can guarantee you will be miserable. If you can find ways to re-frame how you view this, you can be as happy with it as you want.

At this point, I'm thankful for the days I get to rest and live only for myself so that I'm ready to be the 100% parent half the time. I've been thankful that my kids have been exposed to a variety of approaches to life instead of one pretty dysfunctional one. I love that I put my Halloween decorations up two weeks ago without being mocked, that I'll never again sit here wondering when or if their other parent is going to show up for dinner. I've taken my kids on vacations where we enjoyed ourselves the whole time instead of trying not to upset "Grumpy Bear". I get to see my friends! I have a social life and hobbies. I wasn't going to get any of that in the life I used to have. My kids see me as a whole person and not just their parent.

Wedding dress
Guest Sep 12, 11:51 a.m.
QUESTION: It seems to me that the OP did have the fun of picking her own special gown: she chose her grandmother's dress. Also, best to nip that "don't upset the mother-in-law-to-be" suggestion in the bud. Begin as you mean to go on, and if mollifying the MIL ends up being a theme, it's good not to buy into it even before the wedding and great that MIL's son doesn't buy into it.

What to do when a guy wets the bed
Guest Sep 12, 12:07 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi, Carolyn. You’ll understand why I can’t ask advice from friend or family on this one:
I’ve been dating a nice man for about three months, and my family and friends have met him. I wanted to take things pretty slow, so we just began talking about becoming intimate. He is excited about this (ok, good), but after we talked about it, he told me that if he stayed at my place, he would need to buy a waterproof mattress cover because he “sometimes pees the bed at night.” I didn’t react with disgust, but I was taken aback and said that he should have this checked out immediately because it could be a health issue. He was hurt by my reaction and said that many people have this problem and I shouldn’t shame him about it. Yes, many people have this issue, but we’re 55 years old, not 85!
I have since found out that even though he makes decent money at his job (he’s self-employed), he finds health insurance too expensive and hasn’t gotten the basic check-ups a 50-something should have like a colonoscopy, prostate checks, vaccines, and etc. I like him, but I’m starting to question getting involved with someone who doesn’t take basic care of himself. Not to mention, a mattress cover may protect my mattress but what about the linens, pillows, and well, me?? Should I be more tolerant of his problem and work with him on it, or is this a big red flag? He doesn’t want to talk about, doesn't want to wear Depends-type underwear it and says we can just sleep at his house. My brain is so preoccupied with this – what do you think?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yes I will understand. Oh my.

I can't believe I am typing this, but the worst part of the adult bedwetting is that he will take it as the reason you chose to proceed to the nearest exit, when in fact it will be -- please -- that he "hasn’t gotten the basic check-ups a 50-something should have like a colonoscopy, prostate checks, vaccines, and etc." and "doesn’t take basic care of himself" when clearly there is a health issue on board that has significant quality of life consequences. Even if its actual health consequences aren't significant, which I don't know and won't address because I am not qualified to.

But adults who do not take care of themselves are, it is reasonable to believe, at the beginning of their burdens and complications. If you aren't even sure you want this one, then you have your answer.

This is going to sound sarcastic, but it's not, you probably want to thank him for his candor.

Proud husband and admiring wife
Guest Sep 12, 12:34 p.m.
QUESTION: Your answer to today's LW was a wis e response to the particular issue of the money question, but I think it failed to flag a more fundamental issue.
I 100% agree with the wife that independence and a strong work ethic are admirable traits. What is not admirable is making them define his identity to the point that he "feels shame" whenever he receives help. Sooner or later, in ways small or large, everyone NEEDS help, and needs to accept it gracefully. If I were the wife, therapy to address this would be a higher priority for me than buying a house. Otherwise, she will have to have the kind of discussion you recommend over and over again.

Turns out I wasn't the gf, I was the other woman
Guest Sep 12, 12:48 p.m.
QUESTION: I was the other woman for months and had no idea. I met my boyfriend through a dating app and immediately felt an incredible connection. It was my first serious relationship. He was a little older than me, a widower just getting back into the dating scene. That’s what he told me. We said we loved each other after three months, he met my family, I even met his brother when he was in town for a week. The only drawback to the whole relationship was that his job required him to work every weekend. Two weeks ago, I decided to treat myself to a Saturday spa day at the best salon in our city. After I was done, I planned to stop at a café that I’d been to once with my boyfriend. It was within walking distance of his apartment. We never spent much time at his apartment since he said it held a lot of sad memories for him and a lot of his late wife’s stuff was still there. When I got to the café, I was surprised to see my boyfriend sitting at an outside table with a woman who looked like his late wife’s picture. I was immediately suspicious so I lurked around across the street until they paid the bill and then followed them back to his apartment. I knocked on the door and when the woman answered, I asked if she was his wife and she said yes. My boyfriend appeared and his face told the whole story. I felt faint but managed to tell his wife that we'd been dating for six months. As I left, I could hear him apologizing to her and saying I meant nothing to him. Later the wife called me and demanded I leave her husband alone. He must have put the whole blame on me. I learned that she works in another state and comes home on the weekends. I don’t know how I’m ever going to get over this. I feel stupid and ashamed and crushed. We were making plans for the future, I thought we would get married. What am I going to tell people, especially my family? How will I ever get over this? I can barely make it to work every day and then I come home and cry all night.

Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Why? Why are you being so hard on yourself, when you did absolutely nothing wrong?

I get that you feel embarrassed in a reflexive way -- the "stupid and ashamed and crushed" is the natural trio of reactions most people would have if they choose Column A reactions (with Column B being the outward-facing set, the anger family). But after reflex comes thought, and I would hope with reflection you'd see there's nothing here that made you stupid or wrong. In fact, a good deal of relief is ready and waiting whenever you're ready to swap it in for "crushed."

This "boyfriend" is very bad news. Of what exact variety, I can't know and don't care. There's no real reason for you to care, either. Maybe eventually when you're ready to review and revisit and learn, but not now.

And the idea that he "put the whole blame on me"? Like, you hunted him down and made him cheat on his wife while she was away? There's nothing he could have told her that would erase his responsibility. Nothing.

There was only a decision on her part to buy his lie. That's another thing we can't know -- what her motivation is to keep lying to herself to this degree. But 100 percent, her call to you was her committing to the bit. She can demand you stay away and this and that and blah blah blah and it was never and will never be you. Okay? It's her husband and she has to know that.

Anyway. You got lied to but good. It's a scary, creepy, destabilizing feeling. That part I get. Especially in a first serious relationship, that can make you question your ability to trust others and yourself, so talking to someone about it might be well worth it. And just that you can't stop crying -- that's a get-help scenario. If your work has an EAP, that's the most accessible care. Right now, even, thehotline.org is appropriate because it's emotional abuse, what the guy did, easily.

But as far as feeling shame, again, please don't. Tell people/family you broke up, he wasn't the person you thought he was. That's all you need -- anything more is totally at your discretion, to whom and when/if ever you're ready. To learn someone "wasn't the person I thought" is basically every breakup ever, truly. Take care.

Frustrated by wife's lack of interest in building a social circle
Guest Sep 12, 1:00 p.m.
QUESTION: My wife and I moved to our neighborhood four years ago, and have trouble making friends to varying degrees. For some background, we have a 5 year old and 1 year old. We lived in a large city, but moved out to the suburbs when our daughter was 1. My wife had a core group of three other friends, but by the time we moved, the other friends were in the process of moving elsewhere in the area/ out of the region all together (that's not why we moved; just happened to occur at the same time). This was particularly hard as her best friend, who was the glue of this group, moved to the other side of the country.

When we moved to the suburbs, we aimed to have a strong group of friends like we had before. To that end, we specifically choose a neighborhood that we knew had a lot of young families, even though it was more expensive.

In the four years that we’ve lived here, we’ve had mixed results with making friends. I’ve been able to make friends with some of the Dads in the neighborhood/our daughter’s school. However, things have been a bit harder for my wife. She’ll get invites from people to have play dates, but rarely reciprocates. We’re both on a few group chat threads, and whenever someone says “let’s meet up at a playground,” my wife’s response is “you should go, I don’t feel like being social”. Whenever I mention trying to get together with some of the other Moms we know, her response is “eh, i don't really want to” or “they won’t want to get together with me, they already have friends.”

On one hand, I empathize with her; I’m an introvert too, and I recognize that socializing doesn’t always come easy. On the other hand, it’s frustrating to hear her complain about how she wishes she had friends, when it feels like if she got out of her shell a bit, her social life would be better, and maybe she shouldn’t be looking for this unicorn of a best friend. It just feels like she thinks that a friendship is going to appear out of nowhere, and that’s not the case, she does have to work at it.

Am I off base in feeling frustrated about this?

ANSWER: No, because it's super frustrating to hear someone complain, then pass up chances to fix the problem, then complain.

However: An introvert with a 1- and 5-year-old (and maybe a touch of PPD? “they won’t want to get together with me") is a low, low percentage bet to agree to the playground meetup to start from scratch to make new friends.

So maybe you, OP, but also you, both of you, would benefit from some realism and patience. She will need friends, yes, and is lonely -- but this is going to take time. Time for her to recover physically and hormonally, time for kids to grow a bit, time for better sleep, time to pep-talk herself into wanting to #$@&! start over.

Your wanting her to get on with it won't help. You mean well but I'm guessing she picks up the vibe. Sorry for the pun, but baby steps. These years are just hard. And moving on top of that? Ugh.

College transition
Guest Aug 1, 11:09 a.m.
QUESTION: My 18 year-old starts college in 2.5 weeks, but has been gone all summer at a low paying, extremely demanding, exhausting, somewhat risky, but rewarding (to him) live-in job far away. He left the day after graduation and has only come home once for 24 hours. His college is 1,500 miles away…. Now the summer job wants him to stay for an extra week, so he said he’ll only come home (reluctantly) for about 24 hours before his flight to college. ….He has a laundry list of things he needs to do: rest up from the job, see the doctor (for a possible medical issue), visit the dentist for a routine cleaning, haircut, buy clothes/shoes, buy things for the dorm room… He thinks staying the extra days post-contract make him a shoe-in for a “promotion” at this summer job next year. The fact is that there are guarantees and the employer probably just wants more cheap laborers to exploit … I said if he doesn’t come home one week before the flight, I’m not paying for college. My question: Is this overstepping? A mistake on my part? Yes he’s technically an adult but I see this as a really dumb decision. College transition is a huge deal and the out of state college is jaw-droppingly expensive. He refused to attend the in-person orientation so he could stay at this job. I don’t want to pay SO MUCH when he’s showing almost no interest. PS back story is he didn’t get into the Ivy League type schools that were his first picks.

ANSWER: UPDATE: I posted this answer Aug. 1, when I announced the chat was going on hiatus -- I saw it in the queue and hoped the parent would see the answer and not threaten to pull the kid's tuition.

[I'm supposed to be off, but I can't help myself.]

An 18-year-old working this hard and owning it this much can't be the worst thing.

He sees the doctor in the 24 hours. Yes.

The dentist too if possible, but that can be at school. Check your insurance. So can the haircut and all the shopping. None of it really matters, certainly not the way it used to. He can click-click-click it all from where he is for delivery at his campus, or you can do it for him if you're both okay with that. A list and a budget and shipping instructions from the school are all he needs.

What neither of you needs is a power struggle right now. That is madness and it is not going to improve his college uptake prospects.

If anything, imagine the job as a relationship you don't approve of -- resisting it will only push them together.

But again, this is work! He's working and caring. I don't know how to beg you hard enough to pick your battles more carefully. Caring is good. Hard work is good.

Okay now I will be resting.

Family (?)
Guest Sep 5, 11:16 a.m.
QUESTION: My ex-husband and I divorced when I was still pregnant with our third and our other two were still in diapers. We became a great co-parenting team and when we each remarried, we welcomed our spouses and their children. We vacationed together, had holidays together. When my ex became ill with cancer, I was part of the inner circle taking him to doctor's visits when his wife couldn't do it, making dinners, being the taxi driver so ex's youngest kids continued with their sports, and supporting our older kids any way I could. My husband did laundry, shoveled sidewalks, and picked up the slack in our home when I was helping. When he died, his wife wrote a heartfelt message on social media and published a formal obituary and never once mentioned me. The larger family my ex and I created was a source of great pride for him. He even did public speaking about it - encouraging families to redefine who is family for the betterment of the kids and everyone. These announcements detailed his life skipping right over our marriage, co-parenting etc. They talked about the great care team and supporting and loving their two sets of kids (older and younger) - neighbors were named and thanked, aunts/uncles, ILs - and my husband and I were not mentioned at all. Our kids noticed it. I'm confused about my relationship with his wife. I thought we were family. Not friends, exactly, but family. Now I don't even know how to be in a relationship with her any more. Bringing up that I wasn't anywhere in any announcement sounds petty but my ex meant a lot to me. Our history meant a lot but maybe now that he's gone his wife doesn't want to be in a relationship with me any more?

ANSWER: Well that's weird and awful, I'm sorry, and I'm sorry for your loss.

As hard as it is to override the impulse, though, I don't think it's helpful to assume she wrote you out because you don't matter to her or she doesn't see you as family or wants to sever your relationship.

I mean -- they're all possible, sure. But it's bizarre to tell you that by erasing you; it's angry. And I'm not seeing anywhere that you were reading anger on her (though grief does mess with people).

She could also, say, have some weird hangup about his having an ex-wife -- like mentioning you in these carefully curated propaganda pieces for public consumption was inconceivable to her. There is still a whole cultural subset that treats a second marriage as a courthouse walk of shame. It's bad form to deny kids but erasing an ex? Pff.

That's one hypothesis. Another is an offshoot of the first -- that she whitewashed the official stuff because she didn't want to hear it from an uptight branch of her family.

Maybe both are a reach. The highest percentage explanation? I suppose it's probably in your own words: "we were family. Not friends, exactly, but family." Do I detect a mutual not-feeling-it? Without your ex to justify being friends, maybe this was her way of ... being done.

Regardless: As for "Bringing up that I wasn't anywhere in any announcement sounds petty," I agree, if it's for its own sake. But bringing it up as an "I couldn't help but notice ..." is an opening to talk about where things stand now. If you would like to remain a blended family of sorts, if way less involved day-to-day for obvious reasons, then float the idea with her. But say that if the announcements were a hint, then you hope she will tell you straight.

Glory Days Gang
Guest Sep 5, 11:17 a.m.
QUESTION: My boyfriend still regularly hangs out with some of his friends from college (several of whom also went to the same high school). My boyfriend himself has accomplished a lot in the decade since graduating, but some of these friends are stuck in old patterns and conversations about things that happened in school. When we hang out with them, my boyfriend regresses; he will never mention things he's doing now in his public health work or with the friends he and I have made together. Instead he retells the same stories about stuff that happened at a school I didn't attend, before he was finished reaching adulthood. It gets really boring and old, and it only happens around this particular group of people. His feelings get hurt when I don't want to be present for those gatherings. What is my obligation to continue hanging out with the Glory Days gang?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Zero.

That's the obligation. His being "hurt" doesn't take away your control of your social time. Plus, while he feels what he feels etc. and all that, the hurt is misplaced. It's not personal; it's just boring. You're not included in these conversations, so you're just an audience, and the stories are all retellings, so you're an audience to the same show on repeat. He'd be bored too if you switched roles.

Those are just the basics, though. There are other things to consider: Snobbery is one. Yours isn't even veiled, as far as I can tell. So that may be getting to him. You definitely look down on this branch of his friends.

There's also the element, if you're both willing, of trying to come up with a third option. Option 1 is that you go and get bored to tears, and Option 2, he sees these friends without you. Right? Option 3, then, is where you agree to go if he agrees to make an actual effort to have actual conversation instead of high school/college story hour.

That's his challenge: Does he want you there badly enough to do the work socially to make it inclusive? If not, then he and his feelings can zip it when you decide to stay home.

How do I begin?
Guest Sep 5, 11:34 a.m.
QUESTION: I have had an ongoing disagreement with one of my siblings which has resulted in not communicating for months. I was really hurt by their actions and I think I did my share of hurting too. What’s the best way to start off a way back? I feel really vulnerable.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: The way back is to admit your part of the hurting, and apologize for it sincerely.

But before you do that, prepare for the possibility that your sibling doesn't do the same, and just accepts your apology as the end of it without admitting any fault. It's a tough one, because the apology is only genuine if it's not intended as the opening of a quid pro quo. But at the same time, I expect you won't feel good about their walking away with the idea they did nothing wrong. It takes courage and a real commitment to owning your mistakes to be willing to do that.

It also may mean you choose not to reconcile for that reason, which obviously is a bad outcome in a lot of ways. But taking responsibility for your mistakes is the honorable outcome that's entirely within your control, so you do that. And you hope for and work toward the best on the rest.

New college student who is working
Guest Sep 5, 11:40 a.m.
QUESTION: I don't know if this question was meant to be posted to this week's chat, and I'm sure that family situation has resolved itself one way or another now (maybe he's off to school?). But I wanted to weigh in that what this kid is displaying is the value of pride in his work. It doesn't matter that it's a "low level" job according to the mother: This is where a career and lifelong ambition and responsibility begin. Too many people now think it's attached to college: Go to a good college et voila! You will be given the golden key to wonderful employment. Yes, it helps, and yay he's going to college. But what will make him successful are these values he is displaying. We battled one of our kids to work over the summer - when she started to take pride at last in a "menial" job we were proud and pleased. And finally, you can't make your kid want to spend time with you. Blackmail won't solve that.

Re: College Transition
Guest Sep 5, 11:47 a.m.
QUESTION: I am a 20-year college professor, and I spent the majority of this career teaching first-year students. Telling your student you will not pay their tuition is equivalent to telling your spouse you want a divorce: you are telling them you are ending their current work/living situation and their future life plans as they know them. Threatening to do this so they behave as you want is just as manipulative as when a spouse threatens to call the divorce lawyer "unless." I have had many, many students sit in my office, weeping, trying frantically to figure out how they will stay in school because their parents have threatened to stop paying for school unless they change their major to something they hate but that the parent prefers, go back in the closet, stop dating their partner, etc. Often the students ask for reassurance that, when they start lying to their parents, no one at the university will reveal the truth (because of FERPA, the student privacy law, as long as the student is a legal adult, the answer is almost always that we cannot reveal any information about them. Students, please think very carefully before signing FERPA waivers--and know that you can revoke them at any time). Alternatively, if parents make this threat too often, students stop caring, or they act first, rejecting their whole relationship with their parents along with the funding. I strongly encourage this parent to find other ways of resolving their disagreements with their adult child. Please make sure discussions about providing financial aid are calm, accurate, and only about your family's financial situation, rather than a leash to control your adult child's behavior.

Maybe the "second wife" didn't really want all that togetherness
Guest Sep 5, 11:55 a.m.
QUESTION: I think it is weird that she didn't mention you, but because it is so glaring perhaps it was a deliberate omission - to make the point that she did not want to be the "second" wife, but his wife. It would have been decent and honest to put your name in. But when you think about it, did she want all that togetherness? Or was it you and him and some unfinished business there? I have no doubt that your involvement was helpful, but maybe on some level it was also too much, and this is her way of claiming her space and family. So I agree that the, "Hey, I noticed..." approach is a good one. You might want to be prepared that she never liked the arrangement and maybe felt run roughshod over.

Was my daughter a great guest or a bad stepdaughter that week?
Guest Sep 5, 12:11 p.m.
QUESTION: My wife, our 2 children (5 and 7), and my mother-in-law spent two weeks at a beach house in August. My older daughter (Tess, 22) from my first marriage joined us for a week. Tess is very fair with blue eyes so is extremely careful about sun exposure. She got up early every morning to run on the beach and swim. I joined her several times. She would then head back to the house for a shower and nap and was back in bed when the rest of the family was eating breakfast. By the time she was awake again, we were all at the beach or out sightseeing. We’d return home at 4 or 5, just when Tess was ready for more beach time so we didn’t overlap during the day. Tess would fix dinner for herself (groceries she’d had delivered and paid for) about an hour or so after we were finished (we ate dinner early because of the kids). The kitchen was open to the living area so while she ate and cleaned up we were all able to chat. Tess would then head back to her bedroom to Facetime/text with friends or stream non-family friendly shows. She joined us for dinner out once and was always in bed by 11. She kept her bedroom and bathroom spotless. I was proud that she was so clean, considerate, and quiet so was shocked when I found out my wife was upset that Tess spent so little time with the rest of the family. I think it’s asking too much of a young adult on vacation from a demanding job to keep the same hours/activities as a family with small children. A lot of people her age would have been partying, chasing guys, leaving a mess so I thought she was a great guest. My wife and I can’t seem to reach an agreement here so decided to ask you which of us is being unreasonable.

ANSWER: So if your wife wins the Who's Right contest, then she wins the right to be mad?

I hope she takes a minute to think about that before pursuing this any further.

There is a chance here to think the best of someone vs thinking the worst, in an area (blended families) that is notoriously fraught with conflict and misunderstandings -- and to do so using the well-established channel of the benefit of the doubt. "Thanks, Pookie, for framing it that way for me. Now that I think about it, she was incredibly considerate of our space and our schedule." That's an example of what it looks like to make an effort to like someone, especially someone whose ways are different from one's own. Or just when there's a huge incentive to keep things warm and functional.

I could cast it in a totally practical light, too: You raised this daughter -- so it makes total sense that she'd be following your model of what makes a courteous guest under these conditions. Your wife, a different creature from I'm guessing a different set of habits, givens and customs, obviously works from a different model.

Now that your daughter's visit has exposed this difference, it makes sense to get rid of the whole "who's right" construct (yay) and have a happy "aha" moment where you realize this is what happened. Your daughter got an A+ on your test because that's the one she thought she was taking and you taught her to take. You and she didn't know, and it probably never occurred to your wife to say, that your wife was taught completely different things and so all along your daughter was getting a C- on your wife's test.

No harm intended or done. Right? (Right?) The whole point of being a great guest and stepdaughter is to contribute to the greater good of the family unit (which, in turn, promotes the health of the individuals in it -- it's cyclical). So it still makes sense to give benefits of doubts liberally and celebrate the good.

And if your wife would like your daughter to interact more next time, then she needs to learn from this to make that expectation clear to you, and you and she need to discuss ahead of time what that might look like while being respectful of her 22/23-year-oldness and thoroughly valid lack of interest in sunburns and elementary age field trips. Then you can talk to your daughter to float some ideas.

QUESTION: i am a married 41 year old trans guy, working at a very stable job at a family business. money is good, work is soul-crushing and boring, white collar industry that tends to lean to the right.

my wife and i are planning a potential move overseas (grad school for her, presumably new job for me) but i'm struggling in the interim. any tricks for 'making' myself more productive without believing in either the work or the future?

for what it's worth, i've been to a couple of marches, and have volunteered on campaigns in years prior. i plan on doing the same for the midterms but i feel like i'm part of the problem by not being a bigger part of the solution.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You are not part of the problem. You have been relentlessly targeted, singled out and bullied by the problem.

That means, among other things, that if you need other people to be the solution for you right now, then that's absolutely fine. That's how compassionate people and civilized societies work. They recognize we can't (and shouldn't have to!) do everything all the time all by ourselves, and step up for each other when needed. That's the social contract.

To help you with your struggle in the meantime, I don't recommend "tricks." You're too smart for that. You know what just working and killing time are costing you. So I suggest instead that you think in terms of what can reconnect you with life and beauty. Think as small as you need to -- playing more music or going to more museums and galleries, for example. More walks. Gloriously trashy fiction or tv. If you have the time, then go bigger -- maybe a pet, a container garden, a new craft or hobby, a volunteer gig where you have regular interaction with the people you're helping. I'm giving a range because we're all so different, and what gives one life meaning can be a demoralizing drain on another.

And of course these things are always on advice-columnists' lists in do-something columns. But it's not what's on the list so much as the nature of it that I'm trying to convey -- get out of the "productivity" and "marches" mind set. Go to the "beauty of being human" well. That's the one I think will help.

How to treat kids fairly when it’s just not in my heart?
Guest Sep 5, 12:45 p.m.
QUESTION: My spouse and I are about to take on the care of our 14-year old nephew. His single adoptive parent is elderly and very ill.

We have a 14-year old daughter and an 11-year old son. They are wonderful kids and have always had the stability of a two-parent loving home.

The cousins do get along well.

I can already feel the tension of knowing that our nephew deserves our full efforts and love AND that I just do not love him the same way as I do my own children. Do I just fake it? The kids are clearly old enough to know, see, and feel the difference.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm sure your nephew doesn't love you the way he loves his parent, either.

Why should he?

Things like that take time, and it's unrealistic to expect it to happen the moment life puts you together, just because. But that doesn't mean you won't ever form as loving a bond as any parent and child -- and that's where you can be the person your nephew needs. Just by opening your home, heart and family to him as another child. That means in standing, access, privileges, care.

It may seem cold to define it as a class of treatment, but that is what you can do honestly -- just not treat him as a second-class kid to the first-class daughter and son. To fake that you love him like your own child seems like it would be insulting his intelligence. And uncomfortable, no? Might he not resent that, even -- having anyone presume to be instant parent, especially as he deals with what must be scary feelings about his sick parent?

It's great that you're doing this, so please don't be so tough on yourself. Don't ask the impossible and then shame yourself for falling short. Be attentive and fair, be mindful of his comfort and need for space as he makes this adjustment, and, again, be open to getting to know him better and to having him as part of the family. Give it time.

panic when the work matters to me
Guest Sep 5, 1:14 p.m.
QUESTION: I am finally in a science ph.d. program, and the work fascinates me. I got through the grueling first year and am trying to write my thesis proposal, just a one-pager to start. I know what it is I want to say but an old panic is gripping me as I do it, imagining that everything rides on this. I can't seem to grasp the idea of allowing a draft and moving forward. Does this mean I'm not cut out for this? Is there a way to do this better?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm just an opinionated stranger so I don't know what it means. But you say it's an old panic, and when it came out of your past and tracked you down, it found you in a science PhD program -- so I'm inclined to think it means you have an obstacle you've worked around in the past, which suggests you can probably work around it again.

Since dealing with old panics over and over again is annoying, and since proposals (grant vs thesis, presumably) are probably here to stay now, this would be a good time to workshop some permanent fixes.

Some ideas: There's the psychology-centered route, where you talk to someone who specifically addresses performance. There's the writing-centered route, where you shake up your techniques -- instead of typing, for example, you can talk your words into a file, just to introduce a small disruption in the pattern. There's the vagus-nerve centered route, where you walk, breathe, meditate, do yoga before your writing sessions. There's the logic-centered route, where you look back at your career to remind yourself of your ability to manage -- to quiet the doubting voice.

You get the idea.

Most writer's block is a matter of not knowing what you want to say, so if you really do have your points all teed up and ready to go, then you're in better shape than you realize.

Trying to be Switzerland
Guest Sep 5, 1:43 p.m.
QUESTION: My husband has had a strained relationship with his dad since husband's mom passed away seven years ago -- and his dad started dating (and having women stay at his house) literally four weeks later. Husband still loves his dad and sees him once or twice a year and they talk on the phone occasionally. The relationship is just not as close as it could be or once was. My SIL, on the other hand, has gone no contact with her dad.

About five years ago, FIL moved in with a woman (not the one he was dating so quickly after MIL's death) who is trying to repair/reinforce the relationship between dad and his children. And she's trying to enlist my help. I told her I thought the reasons for the estrangement were valid -- my husband's dad was really insensitive to his children's grief -- and I didn't think it was her or my role to broker any situation between my FIL and his children.

I told my mom this and she was appalled at my response, so now I'm second-guessing myself. Should I try to reconnect the family? Even if I wanted to, can I?

The other issue is that -- independent of everything else -- my husband does NOT like his dad's girlfriend...and that is rare for my husband. So any aversion my husband has to spending time with his dad is only worsened if it means the girlfriend is going to be involved.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: If your husband and sister-in-law learned from the experience of their mother's death and its aftermath that they really just don't like their father or think he's a good person, then so be it. Their prerogative and they've known him all their lives. This could be a simple actions-have-consequences culmination.

But if the sole basis of these estrangements is their judging him for being with women "too soon," then I'm seeing boundary issues here. His kids don't get to tell him how to grieve or when it is or isn't okay to be with another woman. They can have their opinions, sure, but it's not about them. Just as their parents' marriage wasn't about them. They grieve their ways, he grieves his way.

There's also no one conclusion to be drawn from his behavior. Some widow(er)s are so bereft without their spouses they kind of lose it, and grab the first person who walks by. Or, other extreme, it can be a sign the marriage was oppressive to them and they hung in there and hung in there like they thought they were supposed to ... and oops kind of go a little overboard a few weeks after the funeral.

Just two possibilities. Are they admirable? Hardly. But does "messy" justify seven years of not- or barely speaking as punishment for not handling his kids' feelings cleanly?

Or the other person was on the scene before the death -- which can be anything from a total betrayal to totally out in the open all along, because lives are incredibly complicated.

I'm 50 percent with you on your response to your FIL's new person. "I didn't think it was her or my role to broker any situation between my FIL and his children" is concise and sound -- but it was all you needed. There was no need to tell her what you thought of the reasons for the estrangement, and not just because I happen to think they got up in their dad's business ... disproportionately. It's not your place to be the broker whether their reasons were valid or not.

The upshot is, your second-guessing was founded and worthwhile, imo, but takes you to the same place: no to making it your job to reconnect the family. But if you ever want to broach the topic of anyone's standing to judge another's response to a death, then that might be a fascinating conversation :)

re: PhD writing
Guest Sep 5, 1:49 p.m.
QUESTION: As a practicing faculty member in science, pretty much all scientists get writer's block sometimes. And pretty much everything we write gets revised a lot. So first drafts are cheap--and you're the only one who needs to see your early drafts. I guarantee you can say your ideas in different ways. So start by saying it one way. See if you can say it a little better. Add an idea. Just start any old how, then refine a little bit at a time. After awhile, it'll be in enough shape to show it to someone else for some feedback.

Also, where's your supervisor in this discussion? good ones should be open to you naming this as an issue to work on throughout your degree. . .you're there to learn and get better at stuff, no? so this is a thing to get better at.

to "How to treat kids fairly when it’s just not in my heart?"
Guest Sep 5, 1:57 p.m.
QUESTION: About adoptive and "thrown together" families. You don't have to love-love-love everyone the same, all the time. In fact, the story you describe, sometimes safety, strength, comfort and fun are more important than the "softee" feeling of "love". Love is something you can feel (or not) but a healthy person is "built" thru meals, comfort, conversations, board games, movie watching, eating together, comfortable space to just BE (a room, a seat at the table, a car ride)... small, practical, healthy gestures that say (and show) that YOU ARE SAFE HERE. goes a long way. is that love? i dunno, i hope so!

QUESTION: Another trans guy here. What I had to realize for myself is that trans advocacy via marching/protests was not the correct lane for me. I am an introverted person, and just because I am being targeted in so many ways, it doesn’t suddenly make me an extroverted person. I’ve found the best lane for me is conservation with those around to me (family, coworkers, etc) to make sure they have accurate information and ask them to support me/other trans people when I am not there to do so myself. And then, as Carolyn recommended, I spend time walking through the woods and engaging in other solo hobbies to help maintain some grounding.

grandparents I never knew trying to give me money I don't want
Guest Jul 25, 11:37 a.m.
QUESTION: A few years ago I went to a lot of trouble to find and meet my biological father. Knowing that he left my mom pregnant and threatened her and my grandparents with physical harm if they tried to find him, I prepared myself for the worst. I’m not sure why I even wanted to meet him. With the help of my grandparents, my mom turned her life around, gave me a great childhood and an awesome stepdad. I guess I was looking for some clarity on where I came from. It was so not worth it. There was a reason he dipped, and it didn’t have anything to do with me or my mom. He’s a terrible person who chose himself over his child and everyone else his whole life. Even after I prepared myself for the worst, the awful things he said to me still managed to hurt me. I wish the worst person I’ve ever met didn’t happen to contribute 50% of my DNA and I’ve tried my best to forget all about him. Recently his sister contacted me saying her parents (technically my grandparents though I never met them) made a lot of money from the sale of their farm (they're retiring and moving away) and want to give me some of it to compensate for what their son did because they were always ashamed of his actions. My aunt seems nice and they all seem to have good intentions but I put that man mentally in a locked box and taking this money will open that box back up. My aunt admitted that he knows about this money I’d be getting. I haven’t even been able to tell my mom and dad (that’s what I call my stepdad since he’s the only father I’ve ever known) any of this. Can I refuse this money or is that a slap in the face to two people (three if you count my aunt) who seem like they're trying to do the right thing? It’s a nice sum that would help pay off my student loans but that’s not worth possibly inviting my bio dad back into my life.

ANSWER: I 100 percent support a decision to keep your bio-dad out of the zone of peace you have created in your mind. If it means face-slapping 2 to 3 lovely people, then that is what you have to do.

However. I am not as certain as you are that is what you have to do.

If this couple were, for example, to put the money in a trust for you (or your heirs), and if you (or your heirs) were not to receive it until your bio-dad shuffled off this mortal coil -- or until you decided you were good and ready to use it -- then could the money sidestep him entirely on its way to serving the emotional needs of the decent?

Or they could give it to a cause meaningful to you. Or a person.

These are just on-the-fly examples. But it seems worth some thought, at least, to try to connect the well-intentioned people. Call it a rebuke to the person who did harm.

Or call it off, the moment the effort feels like it's costing to much. You can, like I said, refuse the money, and say why, and say it's not meant as a slap in their faces because they seem lovely. You are not beholden to them.

It's your call, but talking to your mom and dad might really help.

For today's single mom
Guest Jul 25, 11:44 a.m.
QUESTION: You're doing AMAZING - a full time job, 10-year old, maintaining a home, I'm impressed! I did it too, I was a single mom and I know how hard that ish is - and how much I felt like I just wasn't getting it all done.

When I met my now husband though, and explained to him that therapy was just too much and I couldn't do that and then immediately jump into handling the bedtime routine - do you know what he did? He offered to do school pick up to bedtime on those nights so that I could do my appointments and then take myself out for an hour (or read on a park bench) to decompress after. When I struggled during COVID and difficult work schedules? He offered to take turns doing at home school with my child (week on, week off style). He worked to make my life easier, more doable, more manageable - he even did dishes some nights at my house, tidied up when he was "babysitting" (although he would hate to hear me call it that).

In turn, my bandwidth expanded, and I help with stocking his parents freezer when we do elder care visits. I run errands for his parents, helped find them a caregiver, etc. Partners HELP each other. They work TOGETHER to make life manageable and to take on all of the things life throws their way because they're in it together. Someone is out there who will work with you on life, until then you're better off single. Best of luck, you're still doing absolutely amazing at all the things.

My alcoholic husband rejects AA

Glad he agreed to marriage counseling -- that is a great start. Have a look at SMART recovery, which has information for family and friends. And my resource page has other options -- which at this point are for you, but support for family is a legitimate start. There's Al-Anon, too, don't forget.

X is controlling our special-needs adult child.
Guest Jul 25, 12:04 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, I read your column every morning :-)
Trying to be brief, I have a lovely daughter who is almost 30 and has mild intellectual disability, autism and anxiety. We struggle trying to find things for her to do, and her father (we are divorced for many years) gets angry about things that she wants to do if they are independent – he is paranoid about safety and will not let her use WheelTrans, he also gave her a big problem about taking vaccinations because he’s into right wing crap- and generally, I feel that he’s holding her back. We both have trouble with his anger, as he will shout on the phone and sometimes stop talking to her when she does something he doesn’t agree with, which is just awful -but because of the hassle he gives her for every new thing she tries to do, it makes life difficult and she has a lot of trouble standing up and saying what she needs and wants to him. When she tries to do so he talks over her and does not listen, and he thinks that I’m controlling her. I’ve been trying to prepare her for fighting these battles with him herself, but it’s hard for her, and I’m wondering if I should still be inserting myself to help her with him- but I feel that that is undermining my point that he should learn that she has her own mind and feelings, and he needs to start respecting that.
Also would love some tips on how to deal with his bullying behaviour on the phone towards both of us when he feels that we’re doing the wrong thing. Honestly, I don’t know why I let him get under my skin, but that shouting and abusive stuff affects me a lot as well. I feel so ashamed that I also still feel controlled by this man, who doesn’t do any of the hard work for our daughter anyway, and has no real vision for her other than keeping her in a little safe box. If I can’t stand him and hang the phone up on him when he gets difficult, how can I expect my daughter to?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Your daughter needs to hang up the phone, too, when her father is yelling and talking over her. "We can talk when you're calm." Tap.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Please go to a few sessions of counseling -- just you -- to learn some basic strategies for dealing with a bully, and to talk through the merits of advocating for your daughter vs allowing her to advocate for herself. Ideally you want a therapist who has relevant training and experience (the American Psychological Association refers to this accreditation) but that's not going to include a lot of clinicians. Maybe you have someone already?

Also, while you're there, talk about ways you can teach your daughter these strategies through role play, or adapt them for her.

You have no cause to feel ashamed. But it is time to get formal instruction on how to stand up for your daughter's needs against someone who is actively working against them. Take care.

Proud Dad
Guest Jul 25, 12:25 p.m.
QUESTION: My parents were just 17yo high school seniors when I was born. My mom and both sets of grandparents raised me. My dad was around for taking me to the rare movie or driving me to the library (b/c I always have loved books), but the man never made me dinner or picked me up at school or visited my teacher or took me to the doctor. I played competitive soccer and went to state for track and he never, ever attended one of my events. Not once. Whenever I post something on social media or whenever I am in my dad's presence and something positive comes up about me, he says, "Proud Dad" or "That's MY girl - all the hard work of parenting has paid off!" In restaurants, he'll stop the waiter to tell her that I'm in college and my GPA and she is a chip off the old man block. I have a hard enough time being around my dad but when he takes credit for something he had zero part in, it makes me want to punch him in the face. But, at the same time, saying anything to him would crush his fragile ego, which seems just mean. Help.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: It depends on what you say and how you say it, though, doesn't it?

"Dad, stop taking credit for something you had zero part in."

Ouf.

"Dad -- you're here now. You got off to a tough start but now you're here. That story has its own kind of courage, don't you think?"

Invite him to join you in this line of thinking as an alternative to getting defensive.

If he accepts, then: "We both know you missed a lot. Talking as if you didn't can't be making you feel better. It feels uncomfortable to me. I'd rather we build on what's true -- that I'm your kid, that you're here now, that we're both doing great. That's what I'm proud of."

If his ego can't take that, then that's on him. Plus, it's yours to say. You aren't comfortable. And it's your best chance to have a relationship going forward. Staying silently angry means you just keep tolerating him at best while building up resentment.

Boyfriend needs a project manager
Guest Jul 25, 12:26 p.m.
QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been living together for 14 months now. Previously, we’d both been living with our parents and now we’re having some disagreements about him not being proactive. Even though I lived at home, I took care of all my own stuff (cooking, cleaning, laundry) while his mom did most of that for him. He’s a claims adjuster so at work I know he can be proactive and work on his own. I have never criticized the way he does things so it’s not like he’s afraid of doing the wrong thing but I am still expected to give step-by-step instructions when it’s his turn to do things. For example, if when we're putting groceries away, I hand him the toothpaste, later I’ll find it sitting on the bathroom counter instead of in the medicine cabinet because I didn’t say, put this away in the medicine cabinet. He says that if I want it somewhere specific then I need to say so - every time. When I asked him why he doesn’t just put it where he would look for it, he says he’s not sure if that’s where I want it. When I say it’s his house too and he can decide where things should go he just shrugs and says it’s up to me. Another example would be if we’re cooking together, I can’t say, please peel four potatoes. I have to say: get four potatoes out of the bin in the pantry marked potatoes, wash them off, peel them with the potato peeler that you can find in that drawer there, put the potatoes in that pot with enough cold water to cover them and then put the peelings in the trash. And I have to do all of that every time. Same with doing laundry or even making the bed. When it’s his turn, I have to tell him which set of sheets to use, where they are in the linen closet, where to put the dirty sheets. If I try saying, use any clean sheets he keeps bringing out sets asking if that set is the right one until I give up and say, yes use those. I’ve tried saying whichever ones you want, but then he says I’m not communicating well and it's unhelpful.
I want to add that living with him is not all negative: he’s a very loving, fun person, and he does do some chores without direction like taking care of the cat, watering the plants, and doing the vacuuming. The cat and plants are his and he says those are things he feels confident in. Is this step-by-step thing just something I’m going to have to learn to live with?
avatar

ANSWER: If there is only one man on earth, and if you want to live with a man, then this is something you're going to have to learn to live with.

Otherwise, I hope you never hear yourself thinking that thought again about anything of which there are about 4 billion alternatives.

I am seriously serious. The first step-thing here is to take much better care of yourself. Don't ever throw your agency away so lightly. Over potato-peeling instructions.

The second step is for you to read this Emma comic (scroll past the purchase info for the book version -- it's all there).

Then ask him to read this Emma comic. Then have a conversation to find out whether he now understands the problem with "he just shrugs and says it’s up to me." If he doesn't, or if he says he understands but then doesn't apply even a minimal economy of arse* toward figuring out how to function, then you have some thinking to do.

This?: "he does do some chores without direction like taking care of the cat, watering the plants, and doing the vacuuming. The cat and plants are his and he says those are things he feels confident in." Is an 8-year-old.

grandparents I never knew trying to give me money I don't want
Guest Jul 25, 12:27 p.m.
QUESTION: It is sad your experience was so disappointing. My adopted daughter sought her birth family when she became an adult. Her birth mother was a disappointment but her grandmother was wonderful and has played an important part in my daughter's life. Might it help to find that your DNA also includes a share of what appear to be very nice people? The money could help you and them and it doesn't necessarily open the door to your birth father and it doesn' sound like he is looking for an entry anyhow. No right or wrong here, just what works for you.

Sisters not mending
Guest Jul 25, 12:41 p.m.
QUESTION: I have two daughters that lost their father literally 2 days before one got married. The sister now married did not want to attend an elaborate funeral service the next day for her father. This, I might add was not something he wanted. He specifically wanted a small service in another state. Not only that but a relative got involved in a lengthy estate settlement teaming up with one sister against the other. Fast forward, i now have grandchildren in two states with siblings not wanting to have family get togethers and excluding each other from family events. Seriously can't we get over this?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Apparently not.

Plenty of families can't ever gather all at once because of geography; it's still not great that they can't, but presumably they dwell on it less, just because the reason is less emotionally fraught than a grudge. Somehow a grudge feels more fixable than geography.

But it's not. Not here, not for you. You have what life handed you. So I suggest you make the best of it and alternate seeing your kids and grandkids in the two different states, and remind yourself as needed not to waste any of this time on the futility of wishing things were otherwise. Because no doubt you've already lost enough time and joy to this feud.

Controlling special needs adult
Guest Jul 25, 12:42 p.m.
QUESTION: I’m wondering if the daughter - who is an adult woman - lives independently. In any case, at her age Dad can’t “let” or “forbid” her to use public transportation, or anything else. I know a severely autistic man, 43, who not only lives independently (pays his own bills, shops, uses public transportation) but has acquired 2 associates degrees from a local community college. Keep encouraging daughter in all aspects of independent adult life. One day neither of will be there, and she needs to have faith in her ability to function. Also, likely she will run across more bullies like her father. She needs good tools.

striving to remain calm
Guest Jul 25, 12:52 p.m.
QUESTION: During this time of great change, I decided to try to remain calm, while still donating and volunteering to causes I support. Essentially, I decided against being wound up constantly because of politics. The outrage, stress and anxiety certainly did not help me or my family, and I concluded that the outrage did not do much to advance causes I support either. A progressive friend accused me of only being able to do that because I am in a position of security. I was flummoxed. We vote the same way and generally agree on many issues, but I guess I don't meet some expected behavior standard? Can we all try to be more open to others way of thinking, even within the same political party? I know many people are struggling with the amount of change going on, but can we strive not to attack others who may react differently?

Boyfriend needs a project manager
Guest Jul 25, 12:55 p.m.
QUESTION: I had the boyfriend (now husband) who didn't do things around the house without direction. It was frustrating. We had several task-related conversations, that, like the letter writer, didn't produce much change. However, when we finally had the conversation about WHY he didn't feel sure about doing tasks that I thought were 'common', I found he had never done them. Growing up, his mother did ALL the household chores. I was amazed, but also felt sorry for him: so much he had not learned! So, I made it clear that I was not his mother, I was not going to be his mother, and he would have to contribute. I would happily teach, but he had to learn AND then do it on his own. We set a 3 times and then you're out (I do and he watches, he does and I watch, he does it). He was great at learning and has adapted the steps (if applicable) to make the tasks easier for him.
Going on 21 years married. He's fun, loving, motivated, and we share all the tasks of daily life.

Re: Boyfriend needs a project manager
Guest Jul 25, 1:01 p.m.
QUESTION: While understanding the frustration and not disagreeing with Carolyn's points, there could be a couple of things going on with the passive boyfriend.

Does he have controlling parents? And, since he's a man behaving this way with a woman, does he especially have a controlling mother who is the uber-boss of everything in the home? This could be a lifetime of training for him that isn't going to be undone in just 14 months.

If he feels confident with the cat and the plants, he might be better off taking full ownership of a couple of new household tasks at a time, rather than pitching in with a lot of stuff that he still feels a need to get instructions on.

Is it possible he has an executive function issue? My husband and son are both brilliant in general and in their jobs, but they both have diagnosed executive function issues (one b/c of ADHD and one b/c of autism). They lack confidence in new tasks in which I have expertise--not because of ego, but because of fear of doing it wrong. People with that issue can develop incredibly strong functionality in some areas and struggle mightily in others. Practice and consistency helps, which is why I (with behavioural science training) say the boyfriend needs to work on mastering fewer things before moving on to others.

wanting to post a too-long poem as an offering to the woman who was tempted to say "no" to grandpar
Guest Jul 25, 1:03 p.m.
QUESTION: wanting to offer a too-long poem as wisdom and support to the woman who wanted to say "no" to a gift from her grandparents. The poem speaks beautifully to holding on to all of our ancestors, not just one, not just her awful father.
A HOUSE CALLED TOMORROW

You are not fifteen, or twelve, or seventeen—
You are a hundred wild centuries
And fifteen, bringing with you
In every breath and in every step
Everyone who has come before you,
All the yous that you have been,
The mothers of your mother,
The fathers of your father.
If someone in your family tree was trouble,
A hundred were not:
The bad do not win—not finally,
No matter how loud they are.
We simply would not be here
If that were so.
You are made, fundamentally, from the good.
With this knowledge, you never march alone.
You are the breaking news of the century.
You are the good who has come forward
Through it all, even if so many days
Feel otherwise. But think:
When you as a child learned to speak,
It’s not that you didn’t know words—
It’s that, from the centuries, you knew so many,
And it’s hard to choose the words that will be your own.
From those centuries we human beings bring with us
The simple solutions and songs,
The river bridges and star charts and song harmonies
All in service to a simple idea:
That we can make a house called tomorrow.
What we bring, finally, into the new day, every day,
Is ourselves. And that’s all we need
To start. That’s everything we require to keep going.
Look back only for as long as you must,
Then go forward into the history you will make.
Be good, then better. Write books. Cure disease.
Make us proud. Make yourself proud.
And those who came before you? When you hear thunder,
Hear it as their applause.

QUESTION: Take the cash. Always take the cash. It is a gift. It doesn’t obligate you to anything. Take it and don’t talk to them. Take it and do. Those are choices you can make and boundaries you can set. It won’t make you owe anyone a damn thing. Always. Take. The. Cash. - broke with boundaries.

for alcoholic husband
Guest Jul 25, 1:19 p.m.
QUESTION: Sigh. Denial is the longest river in the world - old AA joke. (i have over 25 years sobriety). BUT until your husband is ready to admit to a problem you both have a problem. Second the recommendation for you to get counseling and attend support meetings. You may have to make the hard choice to leave the marriage and have a booze free life on your own. He will go through lots of emotions - denial, anger, guilt, and bargaining until he finally (if ever) comes to acceptance. It's a long hard road but so much worth it in the end if he can give up the drinking. Good luck and give us an update!

QUESTION: I had a parent that had to tell my waiters my school and GPA into my college years, too. It's pretty uncomfortable and kind of infantalizing even if they did make dinner or pick you up from school.

It's ok to say that this kind of attention makes you uncomfortable without there being that much more to it. Ask him to enjoy your success with you and not the wait staff.

Parent with IDD Adult Daughter
Guest Jul 25, 1:27 p.m.
QUESTION: I’m not sure where LW lives but it sounds like the adult daughter is self directing her services. Dad gets zero say in how she conducts her life at this point if she’s receiving any aid from the state and she is able to advocate for herself. If daughter is eligible for self directed services and not in a program, please apply immediately. She has missed out on so much and it can now take years to get approved. You need this in place before you both die. In self direction there will be a team, that includes your daughter, and other team members like case managers, brokers, behavior specialists, nurses, etc., and together they will put together a person centered plan to outline what her life should look like and how it should be unfolding today and in the future. Stop involving Dad in this and get the daughter a team in place she needs to support her from here on out. And the state pays for all of it if you live in a self directed state. Good luck.

ex I blocked claims he's miserable and desperately needs to talk to me
Guest Jul 25, 1:37 p.m.
QUESTION: For Christmas my boyfriend gave me the amethyst ring I’d been admiring and suggested we view it as an engagement ring. I was thrilled since we’d been discussing marriage for months. I started planning the wedding right afterwards. There wasn’t much to plan since we wanted just the two of us at city hall but I did want to dress up and have photographs taken of the day. He kept saying he wanted it to happen “more organically” but wouldn’t explain what that meant. When he no-showed our appointment for the marriage license I asked if he was having second thoughts. He went on this rant about me pushing so hard that I was suffocating him and said he needed a break. He wouldn’t talk to me, just kept repeating that I was crowding him and he needed space. So instead of moving in together like we planned, I had to remove everything I owned from his apartment and not talk to him for a month.
I was crushed but after crying, not eating or sleeping for almost 3 weeks I realized if he didn’t want to marry me after 4 years, he was never going to marry me and I needed to move on. To make a clean break, I ended all contact with him on every social media site, deleted every photo of him, sent back the ring, then avoided him in every way possible. Before blocking him, I sent him a short message saying the break was permanent and wishing him well. His sister delivered a letter from him to me at work this week. He says I broke his heart (?!) because he knows we still love each other and both needed that break to avoid “emotional codependence”. He said he never expected me to "escalate things to pretending he never existed" and now he lost his best friend and is miserable. When his sister gave me the letter she said he really needs to see me. Is this something that requires any response from me or can I ignore it all and keep on healing myself?

ANSWER: So escalating to a license-appointment no-show, a blame rant and a month's suspension was okay, though?

🤦‍♀️

Both of you are emotional flame-throwers, standing on the earth you scorched and believing you're in the right.

Both of you also, for that reason, might want to take a moment to sit in gladness and sweet relief that you didn't get married. Not until your natural (or at least after a beat and a deep breath) response to conflict in your relationship is to regulate your emotions or pause until you can.

This is not to say you were wrong to end things with your boyfriend -- "if he didn’t want to marry me after 4 years, he was never going to marry me and I needed to move on" seems like the only call here to me. But then you brought out Harvey Keitel and his bleach bottles to remove all traces of now-ex-love-of-my-life DNA, and I got a little scared.

I can't talk to him (ex-BF, not Harvey), but for you all I want to advise is a big picture look at this whole thing. It is hard when relationships end, yes, it hurts, but this is just So Much Escalation. And I would absolutely tell him the same thing if I could, and nudge both of you to counseling (individual!) to work on communication. Or read about nonviolent communication and its practice, if the time/money/access is an issue for therapy.

In a basic sense, one of you really needed to talk to the other, plainly, long before it erupted. I think it's clear his contents were under more pressure, but it was a both of you thing, not just on him.

As for now, having the sister come to you is not cool. Responding rewards that. Terrible spot she put you in.

At some point, though, I think it would be appropriate to unblock him, when you are ready to talk. Not forever or at length, just when you're ready to stop this he's-not-talking, then you're-not-talking war.

Still seeking justice from the man who killed my husband
Guest Jul 18, 11:03 a.m.
QUESTION: Two days after I told my husband he was going to be a father, he was hit and killed by a distracted driver. Because the driver was 19, he got off with probation and community service. I read an impact statement, so did my in-laws, and several friends of my husband but none of it mattered. All that mattered to the judge was that driver was young and had his whole life in front of him so he got off with a slap on the wrist. I sued for wrongful death but it was settled out of court and the insurance company paid the money so that guy will never really pay in any way for what he did. He never even said he was sorry to us. He gets to live his life and my son grows up without a father. I know life is unfair but not usually this heartbreakingly unfair. I wish I could stop thinking about how much I hate that driver but I can’t. Only my in-laws understand since they feel the same way. Everyone keeps telling us over and over: “it was an accident’, “his brain isn’t even fully mature”, “let it go because nothing will bring Don back” and so on. I posted on a grief forum how I'll never recover until we get some justice for my husband and they said I should smear the driver's name all over social media and the internet so everyone knows what he did, so it follows him forever, when he tries to get a job or date or anything. Maybe that’s mean but it will make me and my in-laws feel so much better. Is there any reason not to do that?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You say "I'll never recover until we get some justice for my husband."

What would you consider "justice"? How would you define "recover"?

Because all see here is vengeance. And that's neither recovery nor justice. Your solution is just taking the anger you have inside and spreading it as far as the internet can take it -- which we all know is a force you no longer control the moment you unleash it.

And all you're doing is throwing to strangers, like raw meat to wolves, what has always been the proper responsibility of both the justice system and this man's conscience. You're doing this simply because you don't think these two corrective bodies gave you enough. But for one thing, there was never going to be enough, because there never is in the case of an accidental loss of innocent life. It's impossible. There is no eye for this eye -- which itself isn't justice anyway. And, another thing, his conscience may be hard at work on this every day if his life. You don't know that it isn't.

I see every detail of your side of the story, I do, and it's awful -- I hear your grief and sympathize while still adamantly opposing what these grief forum sirens are luring you into. It's terrible and it's as far from healing as I can conceive of at this point.

Life actually is this heartbreakingly unfair. Every damn day.

You may recall former First Lady Laura Bush also did what this 19-year-old driver did, when she was 17. She ran a stop sign and the accident she caused killed a 17-year-old. She said herself she did not reach out to the family at the time to apologize, and was wracked by guilt for years. Her reckoning is one you might want to read about -- when you're ready, but before you go smearing anyone out of certainty of what is just.

My friend Ann Gerhart wrote about her in "The Perfect Wife" in 2005, and Bush herself wrote about it in I think a 2010 memoir.

I am very sorry for your loss. I hope you will -- beg you to -- address the grief, keep going, vs. succumb to the rage.

Non-Beach Blues
Guest Jul 18, 11:13 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,

Next week is my family's annual beach vacation. It is A Thing - my family has been doing this since I was a toddler and I'm in my early 40s now. Not only will my immediate family be there, but so will all of my relatives since they live in the beach town.

I stopped going on this vacation a couple of years ago because my chaotic, alcoholic brother often made it so difficult. Intellectually, I know I made the right choice for my mental health. Emotionally, it's really hard and I spend the week sadly thinking about everything I'm missing. Any advice on how to get through this week every year?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Counterprogramming, right? I mean -- you aren't sitting home alone, flipping through old beach week albums, are you?

Actually, there is something to this. You kind of have to go all in on distraction, or all in on your inability to be distracted. So if you have some great other thing you can be doing, so great that it can get you to stop thinking about what you're missing, then book that annually in this timeslot.

If instead your hard feelings about missing the trip will ruin whatever else you plan for the time, then make this your annual Chores of Misery Week -- attic, basement, old files, DMV, photo purge, weeding, bring your worst. Just, suffer. (Good food and music, though.)

Elderly Mom and Animals
Guest Jul 18, 11:28 a.m.
QUESTION: My mom is an animal person. She's always had multiple pets or rescuing some animal. At this point, she has one reptile, two birds, two dogs, and more fish than I can count. She is becoming quite unsteady on her feet using a walker to get around her house. I cook her meals and she uses the microwave to reheat them when I'm not there. I'm a nurse so when I work my 12hr shifts, I just cannot get to her on those days and I don't think the animals are being properly cared for. Her animals are her only joy and quite honestly have always been her primary joy. I worry she isn't properly caring for them and when I raise concerns, she pushes it all aside getting angry and deflecting. My husband and adult kids simply are not animal people and these pets need a lot of care. Also, what happens to all these animals when she passes? I don't want to hurt my mom and I think removing animals might actually kill my mom. Feeling really stuck.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Can you/she hire someone come in? If $ is an issue, would someone from the rescue group volunteer to come in 1 or 2x a day? Her continuing to work for the rescue could be valuable enough to the organization to make the tradeoff worth it, as long as a quick check-in is all the animals need to receive proper care. Another option is to talk to the techs at her vet, to see if any are taking on side work, or know someone who is. They may be connected to reputable petsitters.

Meanwhile, the unsteady walking and the dogs could be a hazard. Does your mom have a way to alert you? A life-alert-type button, or a smart watch?

Can't say I love you
Guest Jul 18, 11:40 a.m.
QUESTION: I come from a really dysfunctional family. My parents are at the end of their lives (early 90s; mom has early dementia, dad does not but he has some physical health issues). Im in my late 50s with 4 other siblings. I live nearby my parents, who live in an active retirement community.

My parents were never touchy-feely. And I mean no touching, no hugging, no "I love yous" with me or my siblings. Ever. Honestly, if they ever said it to me, I cannot recall it or it would have been before I was in grade school. They do not touch or hug me to this day (although their method of discipline back in the day was physical hitting up until I was in high school, same for siblings - it could be considered abusive by today's standards). Likewise, I don't touch/hug them. When I see them (pretty often), hellos and goodbyes are simply stated.

Obviously, this has impacted me through adulthood. I'm single, no kids, and have had only a few short relationships.

What do i say/do when the end comes? It would so forced to say I love you. Should I find a therapist now or after they die? So much emotional baggage. Where do i even start?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Oh. Okay. I would take this slowly.

Especially since you don't have to decide anything now about when the end comes for your parents.

And it may simply not come up at all -- the opportunity may not happen, or may slip by. The Hollywood death scene where people gather and say their goodbyes is less of a thing than you may think. If the end does come in deathbed form, then it also often comes with spotty consciousness. I'm spelling all this out mostly to ease your mind, so you don't have to fret about a big farewell pronouncement that your life with your parents hasn't prepared you for.

That said, I hope you will tend to the questions and discomfort you're dealing with for your own reasons. If you're thinking a therapist would be a good idea at some point, then the best point is now! Sure. Air some of the stuff that has bothered you. Set down some of the baggage. If you don't feel like unpacking it all, that's okay -- just set it down for now. One thing at a time.

I also wish I weren't answering this live, because your situation strikes me as one that is so good for fiction -- meaning, I have wisps of memories of novels that really get at where you are, but I can't ... get .. them. And I think the beauty of a novel is the ability to inhabit someone else's life, to achieve comprehension and feelings from an armchair.

I know there are serious readers out there. Can anyone recommend a novel or three that takes a character from an emotionally remote and inexpressive family into connection and awakening? Thank you in advance.

Anyway. These are places to start. Another place to start, quite basically, is aesthetic or therapeutic touch, like a manicure or haircut. It may seem incongruous, but what you describe sounds like fairly extreme detachment from human contact. Maintaining regular appointments is a small thing you can do.

Re: Justice vs Healing
Guest Jul 18, 11:44 a.m.
QUESTION: As a former criminal prosecutor turned civil attorney, I want to assure you that “justice” was served here, however unsatisfying it may feel to you and your family. The state pursued the case and rendered judgement and punishment according to the law. The civil case provided compensatory damages. As a former criminal prosecutor. This is justice. Carolyn is right that what you are describing is not justice, but vengeance. And neither the criminal justice system nor the civil legal system is designed to deliver vengeance or retribution.

Having worked with many families of victims, including of horrific crimes, I have tremendous sympathy for your plight. But Carolyn is right that no amount of suffering that you or others inflict on this young man will ever make you feel whole. And that’s because your feelings exist entirely in your mind and body. The healing you seek - and that you and your family truly need - will not come from the outside. Healing comes from the inside, from processing your own emotions and grief, from learning to cope and move forward with your life as best you can.

I hope you will find your way to a skilled grief counselor or program to begin this work of healing as soon as possible. Consider individual therapy for yourself and also group grief counseling so you can travel this journey with others and feel less alone in the world.

Do this for yourself. But also do this for your son. He has lost his father. I hope he will not also lose all or part of his mother to the grief over this tragedy.

cruel but dishonest
Guest Jul 18, 11:52 a.m.
QUESTION: hi carolyn,

how do you handle a close relative who is unbelievably, openly cruel to you while the remaining family either stays mum or enables it? i think i'd be okay with the terrible treatment (being belittled, demeaned, secret messages, thrown glassware, tangents about how me and my wife make everyone's lives worse, etc etc) but the gaslighting from the rest of the family is really changing me for the worst.

i now feel the need to justify all of my behaviors with fact-based proof, like i'm defending myself in court, and i've withdrawn from most of my friendships because it's hard to trust that i am good for anyone.

i'm in therapy, on meds, but because i work with this person and live 10 minutes away i can't escape.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Why can't you escape? There must be other places to work and live.
UPDATE:
Since I didn't see a follow up with reasons the OP can't leave, I will try to answer without it.
First, always, I will urge you to get away from abuse. To interrogate your reasons you "can't." To work with your therapist to plan your way out.
There are interior approaches too:
-Know your abuser and avoid them as much as possible. Except nothing but abuse from them.
-Expect no help from your family.
-Limit your contact with all of them to what is absolutely necessary for business.
-Keep great records. Receipts for everything.
-Assume even this won’t protect you. Don’t see documentation as saving yourself, see it as doing what you can.
-Know that this is a "them" problem – because good people don’t do this.
-Start rebuilding your friendships.
Take care of you.

Breaking up with a narcissist
Guest Jul 18, 11:56 a.m.
QUESTION: I have come to the conclusion, after 9 years together, that my boyfriend is a narcissist who will never change and never put anyone else’s needs above his own. The last straw was I caught him cheating and he lied about it, then justified his choices as “I can do whatever I want”. I have told him I am done, done, done. He keeps texting and calling and telling me how much he loves me and wants to see a couples counselor. I have experienced the wrath that comes with expressing my feelings about his behavior. I need a strategy to convince him to let me move on. If it matters, he is 50 and I’m 70.

Justice for Accidental Death
Guest Jul 18, 12:06 p.m.
QUESTION: I understand where you are coming from - not fully - but as much as any other person can. 15 years ago my Mom was struck and killed by a hit and run driver while we were walking across the road together. The person who hit her was never identified and thus never "paid" - they may not have even known they hit her.

It's horrible and unfair and there is no way to make sense of it. But I know my mom would not have wanted me to live a life of hate and revenge. She would have wanted me to find a way to live a life of kindness and empathy - to focus on finding joy for myself and others, not putting more anger and hurt into the world. That path will not bring you peace or honor your husband's memory.
Find a way to keep him alive for yourself and your son through remembering all the great moments of his life and letting his last moments go.

Healing Touch
Guest Jul 18, 12:15 p.m.
QUESTION: My family was not touchy feely, no "I love you"s, etc. As a result, I'm not that way either and am somewhat uncomfortable with it. However, many years ago I started getting regular massages. Long ago, when I was single, I was at work and someone brushed by me and I realized that was the first time I had been touched, in any way, in MONTHS. I thought that if I got into a relationship with someone that I would go way too fast because of being so touch hungry. So, I started getting massages, and continue to do so to this day. Ironically, I found getting manicures really uncomfortable because a stranger was holding my hand and looking at me directly and that felt very intimate. But whatever works for you.

QUESTION: "My husband and adult kids simply are not animal people and these pets need a lot of care." Are your husband and adult kids people people? Because this is a people issue, not really an animal issue. Your mom needs help. It doesn't matter if that is making her bed, cooking her food, or feeding her pets. You don't have to be an "animal person" to go over and spend 10 minutes making sure animals have been fed. Reframe the need, and make it about your mom, not the animals.

Mom doesn't want brother's gf on vacations
Guest Jul 18, 12:27 p.m.
QUESTION: My brother's girlfriend of 4 years joins us on all of our family vacations. My mom has been complaining about this since we took her on a big surprise trip last year for a milestone birthday, but she complains to everyone except my brother. He and his gf usually go off on their own once or twice during these trips and Mom takes this personally. She complains the entire time they're gone and blames the gf, insisting she is the one "running the show" and pulling my brother away. She has classic "this girl is taking my baby boy away from me" syndrome.

I know that my brother is the one who needs a break from Mom, but of course I can't tell her this. Plus, sometimes they just want to do things Mom doesn't want to do. This all makes me want to travel with them (Mom specifically) less and less.

Now my brother is planning another surprise trip, and his gf is already involved. She loves to travel and would be very hurt if she wasn't invited. Although neither my brother nor I are married, we're well past the age of our live-in significant others being excluded, and I think Mom needs to accept that (I wonder if she complains about my bf the way she complains about his gf, but he joins us much less often).

I did request that we take equal breaks if we do this next trip and my brother agreed (on top of the complaining, Mom has mobility issues, anxiety, constantly loses things, etc.). I'm inclined to stay out of the rest of it because it's really between them, but since Mom doesn't communicate directly with someone when there's a problem, it's very unlikely she'll talk to him about it. So, I'm left to listen to her complaints, despite repeating, "Talk to Brother!" and leaving the room (she turned to my bf and continued the rant).

What can I do? For the record, I've become very close with the gf and enjoy having her on these trips.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You can do all kinds of things.

You can stop traveling with Mom.

You can stop responding when she complains.

You can say, "I've become very close with the gf and enjoy having her on these trips."

You can say, "Mom, if you complain to me about GF, then I won't respond. If you keep going, then I will leave. If you continue your rant with bf, then he will leave." (Make sure bf leaves -- full empowerment.)

You can start singing "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" every time she starts in.

So the question is, what are you prepared to do?

I feel like Sean Connery in the church in "The Untouchables."

Using the word “like“
Guest Jul 18, 12:34 p.m.
QUESTION: My bright and beautiful granddaughter is working for a corporation and very ambitious to move forward. I see an obstacle to her progress, but I’m afraid to mention it for fear of hurting her in some way . The problem as I see it is that she uses the word “like” several times in every sentence. To me it telegraphs a youngster and I know she is quite mature for her age. Do you think I should tell her?

ANSWER: I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I see some people as just the worst messengers for personal habit corrections. If the grandparent role in your granddaughter's experience has been one of acceptance, than this could land really badly. And you could be wrong, too, that her tic is holding her back. So I say butt out.

If you've been her mentor and you're corporate yourself, then I'll reconsider.

QUESTION: There are support groups for adult children of dysfunctional families. You may want to look at them. ACoA is an example on one. As a survivor of a very dysfunctional family, I can tell you that a combination of things helped me. 12 step groups, therapy, a church family (not necessary if you don't believe) were instrumental in my healing (and still are). I also read my parents letters in a cemetery after they passed that expressed my mixed emotions. That's just a thought. Don't do it alone! Get someone as your advocate (a therapist or 12 step sponsor) I hope you come to a peace with your parents and their passing.

For breaking up with a narcissist

QUESTION: Carolyn, I think you let go one part of the question that may be quite important: "I have experienced the wrath that comes with expressing my feelings about his behavior." I don't know if this is verbal or physical wrath, but it's probably worth a call to 1-800-799-SAFE, as you often recommend.

Babies in the beach house
Guest Jul 18, 12:57 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn - I've rented a beach house with the same five friends for 15 years, and the plans have evolved over time to incorporate partners, pets, work schedules and food/alcohol needs. We added my daughter two summers ago, and this summer another friend and I will both have baby boys. When I sent our traditional "30 days to go" planning email this week, one person responded that having babies in the house "really changes the vibe." She said the child free group had been talking and proposed the families take the house the first half of the week, then the child free group the second half, and we can all hang together on the arrival/departure day. I was really surprised, hurt and angry (the week went alcohol free to support her sobriety, which also "changed the vibe," but were genuinely happy to support her). The other parent friend and I want to respond that we're staying all week because this is our planned and highly anticipated time away, and they're welcome to skip or leave early. My husband thinks the trip will be tense now regardless and we should just agree. What would you do here? The rental is in my name, my family paid extra for a room for the kids, and we're past the cancellation window.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Babies in the beach house totally wreck the vibe. "Change" was being nice. And maybe I can say this only because I was in the no-babies camp before I was in the babies camp myself, in a beach house gathering with the same group annually, as it happens (on point life experience for this one, I must say): but I'm going to ask you to re-think the "really surprised, hurt and angry." All three.

There is no surprise here -- little kids absolutely demolish a "same five friends for 15 years" beach house experience. I love babies, they're magical nubbins. But they cry, need gear, nap on day-trip-killing schedules, get up at the crack of piss, and either go to bed while it's still daylight -- or, worse, they don't. I'm sorry, they're just anathema to a relaxed group hang unless you have a rare super chill one. Toddlers? Forget about it. Both take their parents and parents' attention away constantly, because they're supposed to. And your friends are losing that time with you. So where is the surprise in their noticing the loss and not being super thrilled with paying big bucks for your distraction?

And the hurt and anger -- let's talk about those. Your friends don't hate your kids. This isn't personal. It's just ... it changed, not for the better for them, and it sucks. And this may be one of their few vacation weeks this year, and now they're working it around nap time? Don't hate on them or -- this is so important -- take it personally. They're just telling the truth and saying out loud they don't want one of their few precious weeks off to accommodate poop and crying.

If they need you to return the favor years from now when your kids are grown and theirs are small, it might irk you, too, but maybe less.

You have some of a point with the sobriety, but not all.

If you want to have a constructive convo about this, then drop the surprise/hurt/anger, channel the experience of being babyless on a baby-centered beach week, and own up: "I get it. It is a changed vibe. All I did was add a room and assume that was that, vs think how the group was affected.

"It's way too late for big changes this summer, but we should talk about what would work better for everyone."

I suggest you ask as part of this, "Do you see our tradition continuing for another 15 years, another 30?" Because life is change. Kids are just part of it. And doing the work through these "hard" years can really pay off, but it takes commitment and communication. (And fewer defenses.)

Mother won’t stop asking to include relatives in my wedding ceremony
Guest Jul 18, 1:06 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi, my wedding is coming up this October, and while my parents have been wonderfully supportive and loving in so many ways of me and my fiancé “David” over the past year in the lead up, every few months my Mom will occasionally drop into chats that she hopes I can have her sister, my Aunt “Rachel” as a reader during the ceremony, because Rachel is my Godmother, and Rachel’s son excluded her from his wedding (various reasons, but partly because due to a nasty divorce between Rachel and her now ex-husband) several years ago and Rachel was very hurt by it. At first, my Mom started a year ago with “Oh just a thought” suggestions about what I could add, and eventually it’s escalated to “I want you to have your Aunt read a passage at the wedding, it would mean so much to her and she is your Godmother.” Our wedding is three months away, and I know David and I are going to meet with our officiant in a month or two to discuss what we want our ceremony to look like. Earlier in the planning it was easier to brush it off with saying it’s far away and we haven’t figured out details yet, but that’s going to get harder to do now. While I am keeping my mother on as much of an information diet as possible, I’m dreading the inevitability of her bringing up yet another “Have you found a reading for your Aunt yet” guilt trip, and her freaking out when I say no or if she gets me to waffle.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: K, coupla things.

1. It's not "relatives in my wedding," it's Aunt Rachel.

2. If it's no, then say no! I read the Q once and skimmed it a second time and I'm seeing brush offs and info diets and dread, but I'm not seeing, "Mom, I do not want Aunt Rachel to do a reading." A year ago.

3. If she takes it badly, then you can explain if you want, but you don't have to. It's your mom, though, and weddings are big feelings in tents, and you've run away from her for months. So: "I understand this is really important to you for a bunch of reasons having to do with AR's divorce and her son's wedding. But I hope you can understand my discomfort with the use of my wedding as the vehicle for her makeup ceremony? It just seems off in so many ways. Please let me have this without mixing in other stuff -- even my beloved godmother's stuff." A year ago would have been nice, but now will do.

4. You could also have Aunt Rachel do a reading. Do I disagree with what your mom is doing? 100 percent, with a marzipan dove on top. But it's a wedding, and sometimes a reading can be really nice. It's not like she's asking you to fit in a Sousaphone solo.

5. Either way, just Own It Already. Or don't get married. This is not a typo or brain spasm.

Because being part of a married couple is so hard on a person's identity. You have to remain yourself while making decisions as a unit and often thinking as one. You can become overbearing or vanish without even knowing how you got there. And so your ability to say "no" to Mom about Aunt Rachel is one of the many useful drills and test runs you've been handed leading up to your marriage. You've got an F so far, but there's still plenty of time to pass it. Get to it.

Re: can't say I love you
Guest Jul 18, 1:21 p.m.
QUESTION: I know the questioner seems to feel bad about the no "I love yous" and it has affected their relationships, but I just wanted to mention that not saying I love you in a family does not necessarily equal dysfunction. My parents never said I love you and theirs didn't either, but I love them so much and they love me, we just show it differently. I also know families who say I love you all the time but still have crazy weird fights. If you want to say I love you to them now you can, it might be awkward, but it may also be extremely impactful as you have kept it reserved all this time. And if they were good parents and took care of you they probably feel it is implied.

Tired of LAT
Guest Jul 18, 1:28 p.m.
QUESTION: I’m a 60 year-old who has been divorced twice, and am now in a 4 year long relationship where we are “living alone together” or LAT. The person I’m doing this with is wonderful, amazing, loving, and fun to be with. The problem is we live almost 2 hours apart, and the driving back and forth has become tedious. We’ve discussed moving in together, but every time we do, I get very nervous. I really enjoy living by myself and having my own space and schedule. The idea of giving that up, plus possibly my house, just doesn’t feel exciting. Can you give me some ways to think about this that I can share with my partner, so that I don’t upset them and make them feel like I’m rejecting them?

ANSWER: Why is it on you not to upset your partner? "I really enjoy living by myself and having my own space and schedule. The idea of giving that up, plus possibly my house, just doesn’t feel exciting."

You don't move in just to avoid a tedious drive.

You have two divorces. This is not something to feel bad about, this is something to learn from. Worry about upsetting your own equilibrium. If you have to reject your partner to do that, then reject your partner. Not the right one.

Baby Beach House
Guest Jul 18, 1:37 p.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn is right that babies change the vibe, but I think it's OK for LW to feel surprised, hurt, and angry, though I agree that that's not necessarily the vibe to take back to the friends. This is a really last-minute (surprised) way to drop a pretty big change request--one that more-or-less says "we'd rather not have you at all than have you and your kids" (hurt) and "a bunch of us have been talking together about how you're making our trip unpleasant" (hurt again, and together with all of the earlier stuff, most especially the last minute nature of it, angry).

My dirty lens here is that an annual group trip my family participates in has changed in similar ways over the last several years, though the proportion of families-with-kids has been higher than that in LW's group. There is one couple in particular that seems unhappy with the ways that kid stuff has been a constraint for us folks with kids and has cramped their style in general, and I am really sympathetic about that--to be honest, I was ready when we first had our son to have the broader group declare the trip a kid-free zone, which would have been fine--but also we have worked really really hard on this trip to minimize the impact of our kids and it's been tough to get the impression that our friends don't see our work--they just seem to be always thinking we should do more in some nebulous way (which, to be honest, doesn't really feel possible for us).

I will say, finally and for what this is worth, our trip (which admittedly is bigger than LW's) has had some success in recent years getting two houses and having one house be a kid house and the other adults-only. Those who don't like the kid-centric trip seem to appreciate having a place to retreat, and those of us with kids have liked being in a house where people are of course trying to be considerate, but our housemates are more accustomed to and understanding of early wakeups and bedtimes, middle-of-the-night challenges, conversational discretion in the hot tub, etc.

And you're right at separating out the specific anger at the delay and delivery.

The OP's best approach at this late date is really, "Hey, SOONER, and to our faces next time, ffs." Make the point that now everyone's stuck with either a weird half-week or nothing.

Unless you all talk it out like everyone needed to a long time ago -- which, really, everyone owns to some extent. Communicate on how to make this one go better. None of this [whisper whisper] bomb drop, or assumption that everyone's cool with everything, or scorekeeping, or whatever other dysfunction piled up here.

QUESTION: To the author of the question about the work "like" in professional settings: Sorry, no.

I'm in a professional, high-consequence environment. I'm 50. Many of the "youngsters" have these habits that people like to associate with lack of maturity or sophistication. But when I filter out the habit and listen to what they're saying, it's easy to see that they Know. Their. Stuff.

It's time for people who judge on superficial qualities to get out of the way of people who are getting work done. People who can't see a colleague's expertise and knowledge because they're distracted by a verbal tick need to work on their inability to focus!

Adult Friend Makin
Guest Jul 18, 2:03 p.m.
QUESTION: Totally random. When adults talk about being lonely everyone suggests volunteering. I have always thought it was a stupid idea. I would love to hear some other points of view in the comments.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: How is this random? It's what we do here.

Here's the part that is not stupid. The basic, known, as-proven-as-can-be recipe for adult-friend-makin is this:

1. Interact with a blend of new people.

2. Do so on a regular basis with some frequency. (Once a year will probably not help you much.)

3. Have some purpose that brings you together. This can serve as conversation prompt (icebreaker for the shy especially) and common-interest filter.

This is optional but ideal:

4. Have some project that requires you to work together. This allows you to be parallel and not talk, or talk about what you're doing, or go for weeks observing how you contribute to a community vs. going blah-blah-blah about whatever.

So. These 3-4 elements can fit into a lot of different scenarios. ONE of those scenarios is volunteer work. But it's hardly the only one. That's why it's included so much. But any time this topic comes up, people usually throw out a whole list of ideas because it has to be something you enjoy. You, personally, would be stupid to try to make friends volunteering. I feel pretty good about that.

Also, these things are not going to do all the social work for us -- at some point, the people trying to make friends will have to take a leap and say, "Hey, do you want to go to dinner sometime?" or otherwise take a chance of face-planting. It's just how it is.

QUESTION: Elizabeth Berg’s “Durable Goods” has always stuck with me, for its portrait of a young girl who has lost her mother and whose father is “increasingly distant,” and “often violent” - and especially for these lines, near the end: “He can only go so far in a good direction. Then something happens. He is all apart broken. For a moment I see him as someone other than my father, and he seems so curious to me, and sad, like an animal wrongly tied up. *Then he is my father again and I see that he is only what I was given first. There are other places to look for things. I lean back against the seat, close my eyes.*”

Re: Still seeking justice
Guest Jul 18, 2:19 p.m.
QUESTION: Speaking to what Carolyn said about how life is always this heartbreakingly unfair, I know how this kind of tragedy haunts a family. My grandmother’s first husband was killed in a highway collision when my aunt was a newborn. My grandmother was about 20, had no job, and had an infant to care for in the wake of the loss. My mother was born about 10 years after the accident, and her childhood was marked by an extremely unstable home life. I know that grief is something that never truly leaves us, it is scar on us for the rest of our lives. I’m sure you know that vengeance won’t bring him back, but it won’t set things right either. I don’t say this to be cruel, I only say this because in the midst of all this heartbreak is your son. Your son is a part of your husband that is going to live on. Yes, that 19 year old has his whole life ahead of him, but so does your son. Which of those lives you give your attention to is going to affect your son more than it will ever affect that 19 year old kid.
I don’t know the name of my aunt’s late father, I don’t know how the case was resolved in courts or in the court of public opinion. All I know is the generational impact this tragedy has passed onto me. I know that my aunt grew up with a despondent, emotionally unavailable mother. I know that my mother grew up in the explosive conflict between my aunt and my grandmother when the system reached its limits.
Your son doesn’t need vengeance, he needs you. Your in-laws may share your rage, but they don’t share your responsibility. They lost their son, but you haven’t lost yours.

It was always abuse
Guest Jul 18, 3:05 p.m.
QUESTION: To the person who said their parents’ hitting would be abuse by today’s standards - it was always abuse. It was never ok. Your parents always had the option to start doing better. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized how much “by today’s standards” is a canard. There were things in my family that were extremely not ok (my brother bullying well past the point of regular sibling conflict, for example). I used to think it was a function of 1980s/90s standards compared to now. With life experience I have realized there were no “standards” in 1992 that said choking your little sister is ok. My parents were asleep on the job at best. People my grew up in homes where that would never have been tolerated. It was never ok in your home, either, and you deserved much better. Do what you have to do to take care of yourself. I personally found Adult Children of Alcoholics groups very helpful for a while when I first started processing all this. People from all manner of family dysfunction use those support groups - you don’t have to come from an alcoholic home to participate. It’s free and more accessible than therapy for many. I think you also have a lot of stories to tell a therapist, when you’re ready.

I CANNOT forgive my father-in-law for wrecking my gardens
Guest Jul 11, 11:09 a.m.
QUESTION: I don’t know how I’m ever going to forgive my father-in-law for wrecking my gardens. When we moved into our home 3 years ago I assumed total responsibility for the yard and gardens since my husband couldn’t care less about plants or flowers. I’ve been transforming the space with native wildflowers and I planted vegetable and herb gardens. The two pollinator gardens out front drove my father-in-law crazy - he insisted they were weeds and we were going to get a citation. Same thing with my perennial herb garden that took up most of the small side yard. That garden was my favorite, anchored by large sage and thyme bushes that I inherited from my mom. When she knew she was dying, she dug them up and brought them over and we planted them together. They looked bad last year due to transplant shock but this spring they were rebounding.
We went on vacation in early June and my FiL took the opportunity to have a landscaper rip out my pollinator and herb gardens, putting in non-native plants, mulch and edging. He says he spent a fortune and expects me to be grateful. I am devastated and let him know it so he thinks I’m awful. I don’t care. I can’t stand to look at him. I called the landscaper to see if anything could be salvaged but he claims it was all trashed. I’m sure he sold my herb bushes. My MiL claims my FiL is sorry but says I have to accept he’s not the kind of man to admit he did anything wrong or apologize. My husband recognizes the pain I’m in and has offered to help me replant everything. I’m too sad to start. He says we have to move on because even though his dad screwed up badly he meant well. I can’t move on because I don’t agree - my FiL wanted to show that he was right and I was wrong. He's that way - like constantly trying to let our cat out because "cats belong outside" or sneaking hard liquor into our reception because us serving wine and beer wasn't good enough. That got us in trouble with our caterer who didn't have the right license

ANSWER: Whoo. This is the thing: "even though his dad screwed up badly he meant well." His dad did not mean well in the slightest. Obviously you two had talked about it and you had held your "no," so he went behind your back with purpose and forethought.

Your husband, now, he means well for sure -- he is just not there, to the point where he can see his father for who he is. (You are right; profound control issues, rooted in cowardice.) Let's give it a "yet," though. Your husband is not there yet. Because he is supporting you, not his dad, and that's so important.

In fact, my advice is to support his support: Accept your husband's offer to replant the garden with your pollenators. For yourself. for your marriage. Don't wait for him to see his father's emotional sickness to do it. That is a longer term project, but he has gotten a start on it. And hold your line on your message that people who mean well don't do this to prove themselves right.

I am so sorry. I feel sickened on your behalf.

Mom talks with food in mouth—ick
Guest Jul 11, 11:25 a.m.
QUESTION: My mom is almost 90 and, thankfully, in great health. Over the past few years, she’s developed a habit of frequently speaking at meals with food in her mouth. It’s gross.

Our family discusses this habit with each other. But we’re stuck about how to discuss it with her. Our dad, also a healthy 90, seems not to notice. He’s not mentioned it to us.

Next month we’re taking a family trip. For a week, we’ll have most meals together. That means lots of opportunities for chewing and talking. How does a conflict-adverse family discuss this with Mom beforehand?

Thank you.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: She's (almost) 90! You can't look off to the side? Take deep, centering breaths? Focus on her active participation?

Seriously. Before you decide something must be said, do some mental role playing. The business of being 90, even in "great health," is not for wusses. Senses and reaction times simply aren't what they are for everyone a generation younger -- or more if there are grands and great-grands involved. Let's just assume a mind of undiminished sharpness, no ageism here. Eyes probably hardened into the correction zone somewhere between age 40-60 (90-ish percent chance), so we're now plus-decades on that. There is a near certainty of at least some hearing loss. Just these two in combination affect the ability of a person to stay in a conversation with younger people -- unless there's attention to different abilities. There will be muscle atrophy, too, no doubt, and tooth decay and/or dental work, which affect eating and swallowing.

So your repartee with Ma while she's eating taxes her abilities at 90 a lot more than it does yours, assuming you all fall within typical ranges for your age. Needing to focus on things she used to take for granted, meanwhile, would understandably take her focus off things she used to be careful about, such as not talking with a mouthful. Waiting could mean she misses her opportunities to jump in and says nothing at all.

So a little leeway, okay?

For the gardener with the evil father-in-law
Guest Jul 11, 11:27 a.m.
QUESTION: Take as much time as you want to recover, but you should move on for a couple of reasons. First, assume your mother-in-law is correct that her husband will never apologize or admit he was wrong, so it's pointless to wait for some kind of retreat on his part. Nothing would rebuke him more than ripping out the offensive landscaping, and the sooner the better. Second, your father-in-law needs to see your husband helping you replant what you want, and demonstrating that between the two of you, he is backing you. Third, letting his monstrosity remain in your yard will let him think that he is right. Ripping it out and restoring your garden will demonstrate that you will make decisions about your yard, not him, and that no matter how many times he "spends a fortune" you will just rip it out. Get back up on your feet, champ.

Should I tell my daughter she’s cut out of her dad’s will?
Guest Jul 11, 11:32 a.m.
QUESTION: My ex cut our daughter, Anna, out of his will to spite me because I divorced him late in life. He showed the will to me. He is very old, has cancer, and is still lucid, so I doubt he’ll change it. He’s leaving everything to his sons from his first marriage. He says Anna can inherit from me (I’m 15 years younger than the ex). The sons will presumably inherit from their mother, too. Should I tell Anna what I know? It will obviously affect her relationship with her father. If not, I can see her shock after his death — and my sense of remorse for keeping a secret.

Landscaper
Guest Jul 11, 11:40 a.m.
QUESTION: I am a fellow gardener and am furious just thinking about this happening.

1. Call the landscaper again and have them come and remove everything at their cost. How on earth did they do this project without confirming that the client was not the property owner?

2. Get yourself and your husband into counseling immediately. That he does not see what a manipulative violation this is frightening.

3. Keep a safe distance from the FIL, especially if you have children. He has repeatedly shown that he cannot be trusted. This is someone who is capable of physically imposing his will on other people and repeatedly violates their boundaries.

This is not a nice person. He knew what he was doing and did it anyhow -- this was a power move to assert his dominance over you, your husband, and your marriage. .

Mommy war/Daughter war
Guest Jul 11, 11:43 a.m.
QUESTION: Apparently the daughter of my mom’s friend believes that each of our (deceased) moms felt that the other’s career/parenting choice was best. She had a great career and two kids, I had kids a bit later in life—a cross-country move and husband’s job helped us choose to put my career on hold. We’re all in our 60s now, and that hold has held.
However, she went on about me “living in luxury and traveling the world on my husband’s income” and not using my degrees. I said that wasn’t quite right, as I had used them. She responded with her lengthier resume. And then added a message about telling other people she doesn’t know me.
This is just a message on social media, but as a former family friend, I feel not responding is rude.
But I don’t know what to say, as I think anything I do say will be taken the wrong way.

How about “Sorry it took me so long to respond, I was out of cellphone range cruising the Adriatic”?

Making peace with spouse's neglect of health
Guest Jul 11, 11:50 a.m.
QUESTION: My spouse has a medical condition that with no action on their part lead to organ failure, need for an organ transplant and/or cancer. They were told they needed to lose weight and become more physically active, neither of which have happened since diagnosis (over a year ago). How do I make peace with this?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Is your spouse receiving support for the weight loss? Because if not, then the doc's prescription is virtually useless. Before you skip to peacemaking, look for a doctor who specializes in personalized weight loss support. The obstacles are so much more complex than the finger-pointers ("willpower fail") would have you believe.

Pool aunt and uncle letter
Guest Jul 11, 12:03 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi,
I read the question about the aunt and uncle who were being strong armed into babysitting and wondered if there might also be a component of their siblings trying to encourage a relationship with the kids. Of course asking for child care over a vacation is one thing but the “we’d prefer family” made me wonder if it’s a clumsy attempt at trying to make a relationship. Do the aunt/uncle spend any time with the kids?

Maybe they don’t want to, which is entirely in their right, but a teeny bell went off for me as I was reading the letter.

Or maybe I just want a pool to go sit by. I’d be no trouble!
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yeah no. Parents can be present to foster the relationship, if that's what they really want. Or they can say out loud they want the uncle/aunt to know the kids better.

Think about it. The cover story is usually virtuous for the scammy ulterior motive. So who would use the scam -- free babysitting -- as a cover for the virtuous -- closer bond with the kids?

Approaching 30 and feeling dread
Guest Jul 11, 12:06 p.m.
QUESTION: I turn 30 this year and I have a constant feeling of dread. On paper, there is so much I should be happy about - great friends, family, super intense but fulfilling job in the best city in the world. For now, I've reached my academic and professional goals. I have a very full life. But I just feel so lonely. My work is social in that I have great work friends and a lot of my job is spent talking with people. I have plans with friends several nights a week. I visit my parents (3 hours away) 1/month. But I dread going back to my empty apartment in the evening and I dread waking up in the morning to just myself.

I recently broke up with my ex and I miss him so much it hurts. I also just miss having someone there and I miss being there for him. But I know that regardless of having/not having a relationship, I don't want to dread being alone. Everyone says "go to therapy!" but I'm trying that and it's not helping. It's mostly just me blabbing for the whole session. I feel guilty for feeling so blah when it feels like I have everything going for me. How do I reset?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I don't know how "recently" you broke up, but feeling lonely in your home as you recover from that sounds right. Healthy. Normal. It's not going to feel good, but sometimes it's healthy and normal to feel bad. It's part of the healing process.

So having social friends and good work friends and parents you can and want to see often, and a fulfilling job, and a city you love? Plus therapy as a safety net as you heal? That all sounds like good stuff to have in place as you go through the emotional hellscape of post-breakup recovery.

If I'm right that that's what this is, then there's no shortcut "reset" option. You kind of just have to feel it until it doesn't hurt so much.

Except the guilt -- that's crazy talk. There's no "everything going for you" exception when you're hurting and you miss someone. Breakups and other losses come for us all. I'm sorry. Make sure your closer friends know you're struggling so they can be there for you extra.

(If I'm wrong ... or even if I'm not, then I'm thinking more truth-telling in therapy is warranted. Admit the guilt and the "It's mostly just me blabbing.")

QUESTION: A person who doesn't like you yard can't simply trespass onto and destroy it. I would recommend spending an hour with a lawyer to determine if you can force your FIL and/or the landscaper to pay to return your yard to its original state. Just because FIL is related to you doesn't mean he had the authority make changes to your property (unless he owns it). He couldn't do it to your neighbor and he can't do it to you.

Walking on eggshells
Guest Jul 11, 12:22 p.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,
I’m married to a man with two teenage children; we also have two young kids together. (It’s a second marriage for both of us.) He has a high-pressure job and carries a lot of stress, which often sets the tone for our entire household. We find ourselves walking on eggshells, and his OCD tendencies—likely a way of coping—are making home life more difficult for everyone. I’ve raised this with him gently and directly several times, but little has changed. I also feel like a single parent to our young children, as he’s often mentally elsewhere, absorbed by work or stress. How can I support our family and create a more stable, peaceful and engaging home without constantly confronting him or waiting for him to change?

- Overwhelmed
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: This sounds like a couples-counseling situation, not so much in a let's-dig-into-our-feelings way but specifically for the purpose of setting up practical adaptations to get the household working better.

Think about it: He's stressed from work pressure, then he comes home and stresses out you and the kids -- and that's when he's theoretically supposed to be decompressing from work. And then on top of that, he's going to do the mental/emotional labor of figuring out how to change his coping methods into something more family-friendly -- while also stepping up to his fair share of the household labor and having more meaningful engagement with his kids.

You're not wrong (by implication) that your having to function as de facto single parent is unfair, that it's tough on the kids, that he's the one whose approach needs to change. But being right and having sympathy for his predicament are not mutually exclusive.

Getting objective, trained eyes on this can help you two figure this out. Maybe how to give your husband some room to decompress when he gets home, for example -- built into a routine -- so that he's able to be present for all of you, instead of limping along basically incapacitated. How to add hired care strategically to ease pressure points. Etc.

Making it an appointment with you and a trained pro means it's something you work on together, in a dedicated time and space, sharing the workload, instead of asking him to figure it out by himself mid-stream.

Trying to solve stress while stressed is setting yourselves up for failure, with all of the best intentions. Stepping back and treating it as a design problem, then hiring a designer, sounds more like it. Certainly less charged.

Husband's friends are a bad influence
Guest Jul 11, 12:29 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,

My husband and I were struggling in our 15 year marriage. We tried a 6 month separation period. We both worked on ourselves and missed each other during this time. We are both in a place where we'd like to try again.

While separated, he became part of a new social group, linked to a casual friend of both of ours. He seems to have spent some time venting about me and the marriage to these friends. The casual friend, it turns out, felt this was a time to take sides, and he took my husband's side. My husband was ok with that (ugh).

I can't see us reconnecting if these friends stay in the picture. I understand that he needed a social life during a difficult time, but he agrees that they aren't really fans of me or supportive of our marriage. However, he is very unwilling to give them up. He has even lied to me about them, pretending he has cut ties.
What do you advise??
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Of course they sided against you -- your husband was venting about you and the marriage. They got the full dump of everything your husband wasn't liking about you at the time. (You didn't have a friend you confided in?) If you were to have heard an anonymized version of the information he was dumping, then you might not have liked you, either.

I can see (but don't agree with) your "We can't move forward with them in the picture" argument. Somewhat like, newly sober person can't move forward with drinking buddies still around. But you've hit the asked-and-answered point already. You drew the line for your husband and he said nah, friends stay.

So that leaves you with three choices: quit on the reconciliation, find a way to make peace with the friends, or convert this to an unwinnable recurring fight.

There are arguments for 1 or 2. My bias, there's never an argument for 3 except a delight in perpetual suffering.

Argument for 1, the lying! Omg. What is he, 15 and sneaking out on his parents?

Argument for 2, your ask was an overreach. Telling partners they can't see someone is a this-already-isn't-working first step. Either they get it without being told or you trust them without having to control their friendships.

In this case, a viable option for you was to say to husband, "Hey, this was your dump-out friend who heard the worst about me. Not going to be an issue?" And you trust his answer. Just as he would trust you on your staying close to the person who heard your worst about him.

ANSWER: Well yes, and then there are the songbirds. This to me is down the road with the OP and the husband, part of ... well I'll just quote my original answer ... "That is a longer term project, but he has gotten a start on it. And hold your line on your message that people who mean well don't do this to prove themselves right." This couple have work to do.

But it does start in the garden, and it has started.

Maybe the size of the overstep will be what finally exposed the size of the problem. (A concept that has been on my mind a bit lately.)

The MIL is her own concern right now, unless OP has witnessed something that can improve the husband's grasp of the truth.

Strange email

QUESTION: I got an email from an old girlfriend saying she is in a 12-step program and as part of it she is apologizing to those she has hurt. So she was sorry for hurting me. Nothing about what might have been hurtful, just a generic "sorry." How to respond? This was so long ago and the apology is so vague and generic that it doesn't even seem genuine. I broke up with her, so it's hard to imagine what this might be about. Anything I've come up with so far seems snippy: best of luck with your recovery? what are you apologizing for?

90-year-old with chewing issues

QUESTION: As an older person, I second what Carolyn says. My processing is a little slower than it used to be, and I’ve found that if I can’t jump in with a comment soon after I think of it, I either lose track of it in the flow of conversation or someone talks over me. If you want participation from the 90-year-old that you presumably love, look at your plate and fiddle with your food while she’s talking and be glad she’s still able to participate. Chiding her will humiliate her and may shut her down entirely.

Exhausted Husband
Guest Jul 11, 1:21 p.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn, I love my wife of nearly 20 years. But her insomnia is driving me insane. She is approaching 50 and believes she is in perimenopause, which is contributing to her difficulty falling asleep. Her sleep routine has become more and more elaborate as she tries to occupy herself and/or coax herself to sleep. There is the white noise machine. An app that reads boring stories in a monotone voice. Or she sometimes plays favorite shows from the 90s (that I find funny, which keeps me up listening and laughing.) sometimes there is music, other times whale sounds, or rainforest…. and there is the (very expensive) hot and cool fan so she can switch from hot to cold depending on what she needs. And so many blankets and different pillows. And lavender spray on our pillowcases. And sometimes she wants the dog to snuggle and other times the dog’s breathing disturbs her and he must go. Sometimes my breathing, body heat, proximity, or the fact that I can fall asleep in about 5 minutes when she cannot, all seem to disturb her and she will wake me up to complain about it. Carolyn. I am an understanding person. I love my wife. I feel she is suffering and should speak with her doctor. She says this is just something she has to go through. But I don’t know if I can make it. I need my sleep and all of this noise and temperature changes and disturbances are now messing with my ability to fall and stay asleep. I’m starting to think Desi and Lucy had a good idea with their separate beds. Any advice for me? I hope this is coherent - I’m exhausted!

Response : walking on eggshells
Guest Jul 11, 1:32 p.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,
I'm the overwhelmed wife who wrote you earlier. I failed to mention that I've requested couples counseling (I'm in counseling on my own ) and have been met with much resistance. He doesn't think he needs counseling and it feels like an additional demand on all the other demands he has. I am trying to figure it out without pushing too hard. I appreciate your thoughtful advice.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ugh. I'm sorry. It's not "he" needs counseling, it's "we." WE need help with a situation that is not tenable.

This is about lessening the demands -- or else you would not be asking.

Does he trust you enough to trust that? Because:

It is not okay like this, to have this much tension in a home.

It is not okay for you all to be walking on eggshells.

It is not okay for you to be doing the bulk of the parenting. Because he and the kids are missing out! Workload issues aside.

A workable household is not "an additional demand on all the other demands."

Again -- it's to lessen demands.

So I'm seeing stress, eggshell-walking, stubbornness, mention of OCD. Are you ever concerned he will react explosively? Because then you have a different thing, which I hope you are talking about with your therapist, if true. That would nudge this toward a safety issue for you and the kids.

Sobriety
Guest Jul 11, 1:41 p.m.
QUESTION: Alcohol use disorder is so misunderstood in our booze pushing culture. How do I share with my far flung family that I had a bad problem with alcohol but I got online support and found freedom 2 and a half years ago? I would like to be forthcoming but I fear judgement. I have a feeling that other family members might be as hidden as I was in their alcohol addiction.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Good for you for getting yourself and your life where you want them to be.

That is what matters. Not how others respond to your sobriety, and not where other family members are in their relationship with alcohol. I understand they're family and you care, but their opinions of you aren't your business, and their substance use isn't, either.

What you choose to tell them, though, is. So I hope you will be forthcoming, if that's what you want to do -- because you want to be honest about you, not because you want to fix them. I suggest you line up support before you do, though, so you have someone to talk to about their reactions. In case there are some difficult ones.

What does make sense, though, is that he'd be reacting to it emotionally as one more "you're bad and doing it wrong" correction, even if that's clearly not what it is. The reactivity is doing the thinking, which is the telltale sign of a spiral.

Though one cx, I'd say the time, the energy and most important the humility to agree things must change. thanks

QUESTION: I hope your wife can find a physician who specializes in working with women during menopause, as there may be treatments that can help with her pervasive insomnia. Women tend to think they just have to endure symptoms even though they are causing distress and leading to sleep deprivation. These symptoms do not just stop on their own, they can go on for years.

ANSWER: Plus, treatment has come a long way from "nope, can't do that" based on flawed or nonexistent studies. ("What, women have bodies? Huh.") Still has a long way to go, but the idea of just gutting it out before even looking for options is bananas.

What's wrong with telling a loser that they're a loser?
Guest Jul 11, 2:12 p.m.
QUESTION: I'm reading your response to the mom doesn't want to meet her 24 y.o. daughter's 46 y.o. boyfriend, and I do NOT understand why parents should play nice with effing losers preying on young women. My kids aren't old enough to be dating, but if my daughter showed up with a 46 y.o., I'd be civil, but privately I would tell him what he is: a pathetic man-child who needs to prop himself up with youth and beauty in order to feel good about himself. There is no way a man that age values a woman that age for her full humanity. It's all about the fountain of youth. Why in god's name should I pretend to be ok with that?

ANSWER: So you know all the things? All the 24-year-olds? All the 46-year-olds? All the ways they may have met? All the personalities, all the interests, all the conversation topics?

You won't get an argument from me that there's a general experience and power imbalance, no. Problematic, yes. But you'll get 100 percent resistance that every and all fit into that general concept and therefore no relationship with those ages can ever be okay. The range of humans is too great.

Re: Exhausted Husband
Guest Jul 11, 2:16 p.m.
QUESTION: As a person who has suffered with insomnia for much of my life, and is in the midst of the menopause transition, I sympathize with your wife (and with you). I agree with Carolyn that separate rooms, if possible, may be the best and easiest option. I'm in my mid 50s now I find most of my couple friends have separate rooms often for this reason. It only helps the relationship. I also second Carolyn's advice that your wife speak to her doctor if she hasn't already. Sleep deprivation is extremely dangerous to a person's health. It increases risks of heart disease and stroke, can lead to unhealthy weigh gain, and can be very dangerous when driving just to name a few consequences of prolonged sleep loss. If she can get to a sleep clinic that may also be helpful. Good luck to both of you. A good night's sleep is really important for everyone. I hope you can both find it soon.

Hold Your Horses
Guest Jun 27, 11:03 a.m.
QUESTION: My 16yo daughter has her first boyfriend. He is a nice kid. The boyfriend's mom has taken to inviting my daughter to everything and saying that my daughter needs to go "because you are family." The mom wants my daughter to go to church with them every week and was very insistent that she attend their older child's college graduation. Daughter's boyfriend thinks right now - age 16 - that he's interested in joining the military and the mom is telling my daughter that she can live with them - if needed - while he's at basic training. Why on earth would she need to live with them? My daughter says no to many events - she has a job and other friends and us, her family - and my daughter says that she likes hanging out with the boyfriend. My daughter feels like the mom doesn't take no for an answer. The boyfriend just seems use avoidance has his best tactic with his mom. I'm very uncomfortable with his mom's behavior. They are just 16 and have only been dating for 2 months. Is it appropriate for me to talk to this mom? Is that a big no-no and I'm suppose to work through my daughter? I've met this kid's mom over the years and she has a very big, pushy personality.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: That's completely bonkers.

It's most appropriate for you to talk to your daughter -- or I should say to listen, a lot, and save your talk for when it really really matters because you want her coming to you.

With all the eye-popping lunacy going on in your letter, the biggest thing is deceptively ordinary: "My daughter feels like the mom doesn't take no for an answer." This means your daughter is talking to you, trusting you (huge) and she is not okay with the mother's lunacy. It is so, so importanrt that you keep these three things intact.

Nothing you consider doing to "stop" (ha) the overbearing mother is worth risking those three pillars of your daughter's mental health: She is talking to you, trusting you and she is not okay with intrusions on her own agency.

This is not to say that the mother is completely off limits. There may be a time where you need to let her know in no uncertain terms where her family business leaves off and yours begins. But that too is a save-it-for-when-you-have-to thing. The biggest threat to your daughter's trust and emerging sense of agency right now isn't this mother, necessarily; dragging everyone into an ill-advised power struggle is the threat. That's why your position, for now, is to focus on building your daughter's strength to remain true to herself through this pressure.

That's another reason "My daughter feels like the mom doesn't take no for an answer" is so pivotal. Your daughter is identifying the problem and opening the door to your help with it. Much of that help, again, will appropriately be in the form of listening. But it is okay to say to her, unequivocally:

"There is no such thing as 'won't take no for an answer.' I am serious: Your no is final. People of character respect that. She may not want to accept your no and feel entitled to push for what she wants -- lots of people do that, this isn't just about her. But that's always their problem, not yours. I hope you understand and trust this." [pause for absorption and acknowledgment.]

Ideally it leads to further conversation. Either way, on the way out, be sure to remind her: "If you ever need me to back your 'no,' I will. And you can talk to me any time."

Acceptance
Guest Jun 27, 11:22 a.m.
QUESTION: Late 30s - I think I’ve finally accepted that if I won’t be enmeshed and feeding approval supply to my mother, that she does not like or even love me.

She was abusive but I was trying to make things work with gray rocking and sticking to pleasant subjects.

Now she doesn’t reach out, she doesn’t say “love you” back any more. She seems to be living her best life. While I want that for her, I still feel some grief and any time I sit still long enough my eyes just start leaking water. But I do accept it, and honestly I think overall I’m much happier than when I stuck around and engaged with her cruelty.

I guess I just would like any suggestions to speed along the process of truly getting over this. Thanks!
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I am so sorry.

Think about someone who would be cruel and abusive to their own child. Who would go through the expected demostrations of love only in return for getting what they want -- as the back half of a transaction.

Does this sound like someone who has the capacity for "love" or "like," at least as you have come to understand these things? Meaning ... let's say, based on meaningful shared history, experience, connection, time, acts of giving, the joy of seeing thing through each other's eyes, comfort, familiarity.

To me, these things are anathema to the transactional dysfunction you describe. (And of course it's not just your mom, it's a pretty familiar form of emotional sickness.)

So I think the kindest thing you can do is finish the last few stages of the acceptance process and recognize that the mechanism in her that would produce the connection you crave is just ... not there.

It is, I agree, horribly sad that you got a mother who apparently does not have the capacity to love. It is, however, no reflection on you, nothing you've done, not a sign in any way that you aren't lovable.

In my experience, the combination of allowing yourself to grieve the first part, and then focusing on the second part, is healing.

My sister's pain.
Guest Jun 27, 11:43 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn. It would really be great if you could help me. Right as I type, my sister is typing me about our father, who is deceased. He is all that she wants to talk about these days. It started with a psychic who told her that her depression was caused by our dad sexually abusing her. She was like, "Oh yeah! He did!" No specific memories, but just a "creepy" feeling that she's always had around him. She says she went to a therapist who agrees that 100% she was sexually abused by dad. I ALWAYS want to believe the woman, but I DON'T BELIEVE HER. I feel terrible that she feels this way. But I don't know how to talk to her! HELP!
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Oh my. Even if we were given an instruction manual for life, I don't think there'd be anything about how a sibling responds to this.

What may help you here is that you don't have to have a response, per se. You don't have to believe (or disbelieve) her. You don't know what happened and presumably never will, and your father is gone, so life is not reasonably asking you to have an opinion or take a side.

Your sister, meanwhile, does seem to want to tell you about this, but you are not the appropriate person, necessarily, to help her heal. You are/were too close to it yourself -- so you're someone to be updated, if that's what she wants, and to make sympathetic sounds in response to what she tells you. But you are not the right person to bring into her reckoning process. (Check out Ring Theory. As part of the nuclear family, I see you as defensibly innermost to this issue and therefore not a dumping-in place.)

These do simplify your role considerably. You can clarify your role to your sister, too, and put boundaries around it without coming off as an uncaring or disbelieving jerk of a sibling. You can say something to the effect of being glad she trusted you with this, and wanting her to have the support she needs. Then you can say that you feel too close to it as her sib and your father's child to be the place she goes to work through it-- just too confusing and complicated. And you can assure her you aren't shutting down the topic, you just want her to know what you can and can't do right now.

Should I ask or not?
Guest Jun 27, 12:10 p.m.
QUESTION: My partner (P) asked me to fetch them their passport from their travel wallet in our safe. It was not in their wallet where it usually is so I had to look around to try find it. Just before I called P to say I could not find it, I came across 8 pictures in the wallet, 6 were special pictures of P and their close family and best friend. 2 were of P and a particular person of the opposite sex (A), we are heterosexual. When I saw those pictures my body and mind reacted, as if I was not in control of them. I tried to override all the negative thoughts that raced through my mind. Telling myself it means nothing, my mind is just overreacting on the negative side. But this was to no avail, if not making things worse. About 9 years ago before we got married and while we were in early innings of dating, long distance, P told me that someone had asked them if their partner (me) was not worried about P spending so much time with A and sleeping over at A’s house sometimes. At the time I said, no, I was not concerned as I considered A to be a close friend who had previously dated P’s then best friend (B). And that was that. But the pictures of P and A triggered that thought from the archives. Plus I guess how P talks about A more than any of their other friends and has become close to A more than with B and other close friends. All this probably contributed to my reaction, but was never an issue (at least conscious one) until the pictures. I do not think anything physical has ever happened between P and A, they have not seen each other except maybe once or twice in last 3 years or so. Although 6 years ago P went to visit A for a week or so. A was married then and living with their family and kids. So if anything, I guess it would be emotional affair at the worst or just close friends at best I guess. However it’s gnawing at me. Should I ask P about the pictures or should I just keep trying to ignore my mind and it’s normal for one to keep pictures of a close friend of opposite sex in a wallet in the safe among other special family pictures? If you recommend I ask, how do you recommend I ask? I have never had to have such a conversation in my life before and not sure how to approach it or if I should even approach it.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: These are great questions. I suggest turning them over in your mind before you say anything, because they can really help clarify what you'd be asking and why.

I believe, for example, that you already know his having pix of A isn't "normal," or that his connection to A is ... different. That's all I will commit to, because there can be so many different iterations of this. They could be having an active affair; she could be the one who got away, with (a) some embers still or (b) nothing left to it now; he could have a thing for her that she never ever reciprocated and he never got over -- but he just had to get on with his life. Which could be something he's very glad he did! His state of mind now and when he put the pix in there could be different, who knows. And so on.

Anyway. This is not to torture you with new possibilities, but to help you map out your own mind, heart, values. You may have someone from your past who fits this "I had to give up and move on" description, only you didn't stay in touch or save pictures -- in which case incorporating it into your happy reality isn't beyond comprehension. Or you may suddenly see this is the end of your marriage. There's so much potential range.

As you sort out possibilities and what you might or might not be able to accept, also work on your knowledge -- including what you already know but maybe haven't let yourself believe/dwell on. This is usually a lot. Then think about what more you need to know.

There's also much potential range in this category -- what we choose/want/need to know. It has always fascinated me, really, how different people are about this. Some people Must Know and some mindfully choose not to, and I long ago stopped having an opinion on the rightness of any one position. Too personal.

When you know you, then I think you'll have a lot better idea whether you want to ask, and if so, what you'll ask, how, when and why. But the opening is, "I found these." Then space for his response. Few words then much silence make a powerful combo for getting an answer.

re: should I ask
Guest Jun 27, 12:28 p.m.
QUESTION: It is my belief that having a relationship where you fear asking and being vulnerable to a problematic answer so you try to pretend not to know what you know is self-defeating. Ask. listen. Feel. Reply. Ask more. Listen more.

Risk openness.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: yes, yes, agree. Two qualifiers (not really the right word). One is that the pre-thinking process can really help with the state of mind we bring to the conversation. Coming in hot and fearful can have a truth-suppressant effect, even when we're talking to someone honest or willing to be honest. When possible, getting into a calm and open frame of mind -- even scared -- can really help.

Two, I think the "I choose not to ask" option is for when you already know except for the actual knowing, and you've decided the answer does not change anything. I don't recommend it for "the truth is too scary." "I can't handle the truth!!"

Credit card fraud and secrecy
Guest Jun 27, 12:42 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn
I wrote you a few weeks ago with a problem. It has since morphed. Husband's best friend's wife approached my husband with a bizarre request which he ducked completely. Unbeknownst to her husband, she took out a credit card in his name and failed to pay the bill she racked up. She asked my husband if he'd lend her the money to pay the credit card. He completely avoided her. She also said her plan was to negotiate with the company to repay them less than she actually owed. My question to you was shouldn't the husband be apprised of all of this and you, not surprisingly said yes. Wife fraudulently took out a card in husband's name and was now damaging his credit while the poor shnook is in the dark. Well, my husband is someone who takes conflict avoidance to a new level. He never returned the wife's multiple calls and never told his friend anything. Bad move, I know. The question is..me. I REALLY don't want to get involved. This is his friend. But I like the guy and don't feel right leaving him uninformed while his credit is shredded. But if I say something, I will ignite multiple explosions. The wife is a piece of work. Friend will be aghast with my husband for not telling him promptly. And my husband will be irate with me. Help.

Value of non-productive time
Guest Jun 27, 12:53 p.m.
QUESTION: You said something in today's column - "You have value for existing — not solely for what you contribute."
Sure, in theory. I think where I get hung up is that I believe everyone should contribute what they can, and receive what they need. (Yeah, I'm a dirty pinko.)
Since I am a person who can contribute, I must. I have no limiting factors to my productivity other than the time I need to spend eating, sleeping, and like, brushing my teeth. I know many people are not as fortunate, and so the inherent value of *their* lives, even though they are not able to be as productive, means that I and people like me must work a little more to keep the whole boat afloat. Does that make sense?
Burnout is always around the corner for me. Can you help me reframe it and really, truly convince myself that it's ok to NOT?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm not sure you need a reframe as much as a closer look at your own picture:

"I know many people are not as fortunate, and so the inherent value of *their* lives ... means that I and people like me must work a little more to keep the whole boat afloat."

You don't define "more." So, more than what? What if only 15 hours a week, say, covered the share any given person needed to contribute, and you satisfied the "a little more" requirement by adding only an hour to that?

By that math, all your burnout hours would be for some vague idea that you had to even though there's no actual need for it. In fact, maybe deciding not to work those extra hours would free up a work opportunity for someone who needs the work.

You're hung up on your own construct. I suggest a construct where you get evenings, weekends and at least four weeks a year off.

Help stuck son
Guest Jun 27, 1:08 p.m.
QUESTION: My son graduated from college, got a good job, lost the jobs after a year and a half and hasn't found another one. He's been applying to jobs on-line for over a year. He's had some phone interviews, but not one single follow-up interview. For some reason, his college is not responding to requests for help. I've suggested he take some graduate classes, but he asks, what if he gets a master's and still can't find a job? I'd like to find him some career counselling, but don't know where to find someone who will be effective.

How do I help him get unstuck, because it's clear to me that doing what he's been doing is not going to suddenly produce a better result, particularly as the gap on his resume just gets bigger.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I can't explain the college career office, odd, and this is definitely not my lane, but this has become (gradually then suddenly) such an issue for recent grads that I want to get something out on the record to acknowledge it.

I also think your son is right not to panic into "graduate classes" without a clear plan. This is the time for him to think of a career path that has openings and is even growing, as others are drying up. If he needs to train for it, then so be it, but specific training/apprenticeship, on the consensus recommendation of people in the field. Very targeted education.

As for career counseling, that's a yes -- first step -- and he can check here at the National Career Development Association to start looking for someone.

RE: Credit card fraud
Guest Jun 27, 1:15 p.m.
QUESTION: You need to tell your husband, point blank, that he will either tell your friend that he's the victim of what is essentially identity theft - doesn't matter if it's someone he knows, it's still fraud - right then and there, or you will, because you do not want to be an accessory to a crime after the fact. Even if the odds you'd be legally charged are low to nonexistent, it's still not something anyone should be okay with. And if he expresses reticence, then say, fine, I'm doing it now. Whatever consequences accrue to your husband from that are on him, not you - and hopefully this is way way WAY off base, but if you are worried about his reaction to the point of feeling unsafe, then it's time to make a plan to get out.

ANSWER: Well, if it's not way way WAY off base, then it's an important warning.

The other warning is the milder one, but still significant -- of being married to someone so "non-confrontational" as to be virtually nonfunctional when anything gross enough hits the fan hard enough to warrant courage.

Plenty of people develop non-confrontational tendencies, for a lot of reasons. But defaulting to them isn't destiny, it's a choice.

"I have no limiting factors to my productivity other than the time I need to spend eating, sleeping"
Guest Jun 27, 1:24 p.m.
QUESTION: Wrong! Whatever the (debatable) value of your productivity is, it also limited by your need to rest. To play. To let your mind wander, so it can come up with cool new ideas that serve your immediate community and the wider world. Operating on the edge of burnout is NOT "productive," especially since you don't know if other demands on your time and energy are in the future. You need to have some "surge capacity" so aim for, like 75% productivity and rest and store up your energy and time and talents for unexpected emergencies.

QUESTION: It may help to keep in mind that your husband's job is to convey the information. Which is hard. But he may be dreading best friend wanting advice on a range of questions (from why did my wife come to you? to should I get a divorce?). Having watched a few friends go through this (one spouse secretly rack up credit card), the outcome on the marriage is not predictable (divorce is not inevitable). All of which to say this is a "I think you should know" call -- and what happens after that is left to the couple (you and hubby can and should stay out).

(If the walk doesn't happen before the kids wake up, then it doesn't happen at all.) Sarah almost always brings along her dog, "Sparky." Sparky is very big and very curious. He has a tendency to run right up to strangers and explore them. I am not a dog expert and can't say whether Sparky is appropriately trained, but I know that this makes a lot of people very uncomfortable, and some even get quite upset (especially those out walking with their own dogs or small kids).

Sarah does not leash Sparky on these walks (as far as I know it is not required). I have been with her for multiple encounters that turn hostile because other people don't appreciate Sparky's friendliness. To strangers, Sarah and I are both responsible. One woman yelled at us about not leashing the dog. Sarah yelled back, and I didn't know what to do other than to stay quiet. I think Sarah was offended that I did not take her side.

What is my role here? I am not a dog person and honestly I agree with the people who don't care for being approached by a big dog that way. Sparky is used to me and doesn't invade my space anymore, but I would find the walks very unpleasant if he did. Since we're in the space of being close acquaintances but not necessarily deep friends, I am unsure of how to handle this. My husband is worried Sparky will attack someone and that I will get sued as a co-defendant!

ANSWER: This question is like one of those I Spy photo-riddles where you get to pick out all the hidden objects. Except in this case it's Sarah's horrible antisocial behaviors tucked into friendly neighbors' little morning dog walk.

1. Sparky is *not* appropriately trained, ugh.

2. Not leashing a dog on walks, especially a large spelunker and kid-rusher that upsets people to the point of anger on a regular basis, is so incredibly selfish. And irresponsible. Hello. I would be surprised if there were no leash laws -- I suggest you look it up if you feel like completing the I Spy -- but at this point no one with a clue would need a law to tell them the right thing to do.

3. Okay, you just "think" Sarah was offended you didn't back her, you don't know it. So I'll go light on that sign of entitled behavior.

4. But, wait -- no apology? She and her dog force you to witness a yelling match on your morning constitutional, and she doesn't think to say, "Yikes, sorry about that"?

Your role here is to figure out what your boundaries (limits) are, say them and hold them. So if you don't want to walk with Sarah anymore, then don't. If you don't want to deal with the entitlement-off-its-leash show, then don't. And if you want to be the person who signs up to writhe in discomfort through antisocial behavior while doing nothing about it, then keep doing what you're doing every day at 6.

How you phrase the second option is a challenge because the truth is uncomfortable. But, even if it's Sarah's dog, these walks still involve your time and your comfort, which matter. So: "I want to keep up our daily walks, I enjoy your company. But all the negative reactions to Sparky off-leash are stressing me out. Are you willing to leash him for our walks?" If she refuses, then you say you're sorry but you have to opt out. Not good for your nerves. If she gets defensive and turns on you, then -- well, I hope she doesn't, but it seems like it would be on brand.

For “my sister’s pain”
Guest Jun 27, 1:39 p.m.
QUESTION: While I can be a skeptic when it comes to psychics, in my experience people don’t have “a creepy feeling” about their own parent unless there was a real problem. And of course two people can get such different versions of the same parent.

With that in mind I do think it’s okay to say that it’s too painful for you to discuss with her and point her to support groups and things. I don’t think I would ever tell her that you don’t believe her. You can just start from a place of believing that she is in pain and something was not right.

While my sibling and I both acknowledge the same abusers, even we don’t talk to each other about what we went through without checking first if the other one is open to discussing. And we both have said at different times that we can’t right now, and respected that. There was a brief period where we wanted to talk about it a lot to each other but that is less and less as time goes on. While that time period felt necessary it was also emotionally draining and difficult in a sense that I’m not even sure if I could explain.

I would tell your sister that you can support her in certain ways if that’s helpful (for example going on nature walks together) but that talking about it further is too hard on your mental health. You are not obligated to listen to anyone replay their trauma over and over and you can gently tell people that while you love them so much and you’re so sorry they were hurt, that you’re feeling overwhelmed and where your limit is.

Acceptance
Guest Jun 27, 1:40 p.m.
QUESTION: About 15 years ago, I had that moment when I realized my parents were never going to be my Parents. They were never going to be people I could turn to, or who would just love me and want what's best for me. Facing that truth was so painful, and I had to go through a literal mourning period that lasted two years.

All of this to say that I don't think there is a short cut to what you are going through. You just have to mourn what is genuinely a horrible loss.

I am so sorry. You are obviously an amazing person for having offered the grace you have, and now for facing this very difficult path. You are worthy of love and support, and I promise so many other people will offer that to you.

Re: Credit card fraud and secrecy
Guest Jun 27, 1:47 p.m.
QUESTION: As someone who is also conflict avoidant, this is a little bit of a weird suggestion. Have the husband write out what he needs to tell friend. Keep it short and sweet. Then husband takes that note and reads it to his friend. He can acknowledge that its weird but he has something important to tell friend that he has had trouble saying. I did this once with my doctor with some issues I was having. It helps to have the thoughts already organized and then just read them.
avatar

Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Not weird at all -- we talk about this one a lot around here. It may feel weird to use the cheat sheet in front of the friend, sure, but one work-around for that is to set the conversation in motion to the point the husband can't back out of it now -- either by a cheat-sheeted phone call (don't say that too fast) or a text. "Hey, if you have some time later, I'd like to ask you about something." (funky "ask" working in case friend tells wife about it)

ANSWER: This is not only good here, thank you, but I recommend it in general. We told our kids we'd get them/help them 24/7 in an emergency -- no questions, punishments, grilling. It's what we came to when we thought about the either-or. Do we want to cross every responsible parental T in responding to their choices, or do we want them to call us when a situation spins out of control? Talk about a trust fall -- but it was an easy decision.

Value of non-productive time
Guest Jun 27, 1:59 p.m.
QUESTION: I'm not sure that I agree with how you answered this question. The 40 hour work week is also a construct; there is plenty that our personal lives and our communities require to thrive that will take place on some nights and weekends. What I think the writer is missing is that the problem is with how they see themselves in as "a person who can contribute". If they are in burnout, then they are not a person who can contribute. You need to find a way to think of your own well-being as being just as important to the equation as other people's.

Re: Should I ask?
Guest Jun 27, 2:03 p.m.
QUESTION: My best friend of 20 years, was my boyfriend for 10 before becoming a friend at all effects. I cant even picture in my mind that we ever had sex, when I try I see two people that are "not us". He is family. If I had some family pics in a safe I would have his too, and maybe not the one of my partner because my partner is... there with me in person.
I wouldnt make anything about those pics, and I would say ask if it's killing your mind - I am sure the answer will be reassuring.
Dont make it a big deal, I would say this in a tender/kiddish way: "I saw those pic and I got jealous! ...Should I be?"

ANSWER: Ah, i was there with you till the "in a tender/kiddish way: 'I saw those pics and I got jealous! ...Should I be?'" Something like that has to be authentic. Or else it will sound disingenuous and forced, and discourage truth telling.

It would be authentic for you, it seems, so it would be the right thing to say. I don't think the OP is there.

If Sarah gets defensive and turns on you

QUESTION: If you can, say in as calm and friendly a tone as you can, "Okay, well, let me know if you change your mind" and then mention that you have something you have to go do [laundry in the dryer, kid needs something, etc.]. See you later, same tone. Just because she (in this scenario) gets defensive doesn't mean you have to engage. Leave it as friendly as possible. Maybe she will feel ashamed later and change her mind.

ANSWER: Talk to multiple experts. Local, recommended estate specialists, 1 hour intake consultations (perhaps less), discussing your specifics. It's money but well spent given the messes that well intentioned people can find themselves dealing with, and always right as they're grieving someone they love. They're a cautionary tale many of us have lived so others can learn.

Re: Second hand dog embarassment
Guest Jun 27, 2:21 p.m.
QUESTION: I'll bet Sarah doesn't want to leash Sparky because she cannot handle him on a leash. I had a cocker spaniel that could pull my arm out of the socket when he decided to go after something while leashed. I knew a couple of women who were badly hurt when the big dogs they were handling bolted afteer something.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Um. That means no public mingling with the dog, ever. Dogs we can't control stay home and apart from the public. Full stop.

And a dog that's too big to manage on leash like that goes back to dog school or private work with a trainer. Or gets a pull-deterrent setup like a head halter -- plus the proper training, for dog and handler.

This is dog-owner malpractice. They are pets and awesome and wuzzy and our "fur babies" and all, but they are animals and can do harm if not responsibly handled. People who do not know what they're doing have a duty to learn it asap. It's for the dogs' sake as much as anyone else's.

Response to Carolyn asking where post is when we need it.
Guest Jun 27, 2:23 p.m.
QUESTION: My mom used to get really upset at what she perceived as my half-assing. I'm 48 now, have a PhD and a thriving and influential career, and I still think there is very very little that's worthy of my applying my whole entire ass. I'm not interested in burning myself by whole-assing stuff that will be fine if I half-or quarter-ass it.

Being able to achieve maximum economy of ass is an important adult skill. God knows there's no shortage of women out there wearing themselves to nubs because they feel like they can't half-ass ANYTHING. It might help OP's husband to understand that what he perceives as a problem in high school could be a great advantage for the many many decades his daughter will spend out of high school.

Monster

QUESTION: My husband and I tried for 15+yrs to have a child and it never happened. We missed out on a lot of life trying to conceive and grief. I felt like I was just finding a new normal when my husband received a message from a 26yo young woman, Ellen, who was his daughter from a one-night stand when he was early in college. My husband had no idea. Ellen had been put up for adoption. Ellen is a great person. Her adoptive family kind and welcoming. My husband has developed a good relationship with Ellen. I've kept my distance. I'm happy for them but feel intense jealousy that my husband has a daughter and I do not. Ellen is now pregnant and asking if we want to be bonus grandparents. My husband is enthusiastic and I am not. Ellen says she is excited for her child to have so much love, so much family and I see that but I don't feel that. I know my jealousy and my anger is not healthy or normal. I fear I'm pushing my husband a way. I know I need therapy but I'm afraid the therapist will judge me. I mean what kind of monster am I that I will finally have a child in my life to love and I won't do it?

ANSWER: I went into the queue just to post some reactions, but I want to respond to this quickly -- just go to therapy. Please.

First, most seasoned counselors have seen so much. It's hard to surprise them.

Second, they are in this to help you, not judge you.

Third, what anyone thinks of you is irrelevant, especially your therapist. I hope you see this -- right now your focus needs to be you and getting some peace. Stop with the self-name-calling and go.

To be human is to have some dark thoughts.

living on a golf course
Guest Jun 13, 11:05 a.m.
QUESTION: We recently purchased our last (we hope) home in a lovely, large gated community with an 18-hole golf course. We do not play. One of the fairways is directly behind us, with a handful of trees forming a barrier of sorts. There was some golf ball damage noted on the back of the house upon inspection, but it was minor and we proceeded with the purchase because the house checks every other box for us. Surprised and unhappy to learn, however, that any damage caused by a golf ball is NOT the responsibility of the golf course, nor of the player. It is strictly on the homeowner per the HOA! So when I should be enjoying our screened-in porch, sipping iced tea and watching the birds, instead I find myself shooting death stares at anyone whose golf cart makes a beeline toward our back yard to retrieve their balls, and some even rooting around in our yard. This is messing with my serenity and my sanity. When (not if) the damage happens, given that I have no legal right to pursue these folks, how do you suggest I approach them?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: As a homeowner who didn't do sufficient homework, and has no right to death-stare golfers as if that's their fault. I'm sorry.

When I read your subject line, my brain filled in the popcorn sound of golf balls hitting your house. It also brought back memories of a lot of years of organized baseball with my kids, with everyone's foul balls hitting the decks, siding, cars of neighbors whose properties abutted the schools and parks. At least the cars with Massachusetts policies, IIRC, got their windshields replaced with $0 deductible :)

I suggest you have a sit-down with your reality, serenity, sanity, available funds and on-call contractor list, and decide which you prefer: to accept the inevitable, or move one more time to your really-this-is-the-last-one last house.

Because sitting out there in your yard thinking you should be having a golfball-free experience next to a golf course is a recipe for daily fury and stress.

Follow Up From Step Mother
Guest Jun 13, 11:18 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,
I wrote to you about my husband's support agreement with his ex that makes us pay $15,000 per year for extracurricular activities. We had to see a lawyer because we went past paycheck to paycheck, we were increasing credit card debt every month. The lawyer said we shouldn't worry about the college expenses clause because If my step-son picks a private college we can probably win at court to pay 1/3 of in-state rates because that is how most of these agreements are written. He said the proportion of our income to step-son's expense was high so we could meet with my husband's ex to cap expenses a bit lower. Even an extra $5,000 per year to us would make a big difference. His ex refused to meet with us, she would only discuss this in court in front of a judge. The next court date was in 9 months, the lawyer charges more for time in court, and there is no guarantee anything would change. We made two changes on our own. I picked up a side gig to bring in more money. I get out of going with every weekend to the tournaments because I am working. I will drive to and from practice when I'm able, I will go to home games and watch him. I don't like the whole weekend tournaments. If this was once or twice a year, I could go, but it is at least 2 weekends out of the month. The other thing is that my husband made an agreement with his ex that he would pay his half by paying the bill directly. Before he was Venmoing her 50% of the bill she screenshotted. We are putting all our credit card expenses on his credit and he will file for bankruptcy when our step-son is out of high school.

ANSWER: Oh yes this is definitely different stakes, racking up debt -- I'm sorry. Has your husband approached the coach/program? There may be a discreet way to get relief that way. Definitely depends on the quality of the program and the people involved.

In the best sense and in the worst: I'm loath to say this, because I don't want even to imply that if you aren't successful, it will be due to your stepson's shortcomings as an athlete. But the corruption of US youth sports is what it is ... and a lot of game-changing players with money issues happen to find they have secret Santas.

But there are also solid orgs that make sure any player's family, starter or bench, has adequate financial support and a quiet avenue to secure it. Including one that takes separated/divorced parents into account. [Read the original column here.]

Social Media Etiquette
Guest Jun 13, 11:37 a.m.
QUESTION: Are there rules to this? I belong to an online forum of a few hundred users, and have ignored/blocked some others and there's a big kerfuffle going on about how blocking is rude, but is it? If a lot of people are blocking you such that you feel ignored, isn't that a you problem not a them problem? The biggest griper just writes rambling tl;dr screeds too often, I don't even disagree or dislike her it's just too much. Anyway, tl;dr is blocking rude?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I think there's a Golden Rule, don't bring behaviors to a forum that make everyone instantly tired.

If there are rulebook rules. then the ones being broken here are, in order of importance, no rambling screeds; no public griping about other people's screed appreciation habits; no conflating of "block" and "ignore."

"Ignore" is for people you generally like but are wearing you out. "Block" is the dead-to-me button to enough people that it's best reserved for that.

I agree with you on the principle, though -- that no kerfuffle was ever necessary and the fact of one makes the case that it's entirely on the person griping. If I take this forum correctly, then your posts are all basically the publishing arms of your selves, so if one of you wants to pause your subscriptions to some members for whatever reason, then so be it. Nothing personal.

Wait -- did I kerfuffle by answering this? Did you by asking?

opting out of college
Guest Jun 13, 11:45 a.m.
QUESTION: My just-graduated son and my one-year behind daughter have said they are not attending traditional college. My son was never academically inclined, so choosing trade school (plumbing) is disappointing but not a shock, But my daughter is a star student, They both believe that AI will soon eliminate entry level college graduate jobs unless physical presence is part of the job. My daughter does not want to teach or gp into anything medical, so her plan is to enter a car mechanic program where she can make use of her computer and technical ability. I'm not sure what I should do - I'm hoping to convince her to apply to college in the fall to keep her options open, But I'm also not sure that she's wrong. And advice?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whoa wait a minute. Why is your "never academically inclined" son's decison to choose trade school for plumbing "disappointing"?

I know it's not your question, but I tripped over it so hard that I think it's germane to your question. To me your son's decision looks like an unqualified win. Practical, smart, suits him -- right? So if you have a bias that prevents you from seeing that, then you'll want to take that into account and dismantle it before you make any decisions about your approach to your daughter. Certainly before you say anything to her.

And that's even before you deal with the obvious flaw in speaking up now: that you admit openly that you don't even know enough to make a reasoned counterargument.

Your kids are right that many sectors of the job landscape look like an animated Dali painting. (Then there's the economy, depending on its given day in court, holy cats.) But then, is she right about cars? You will have to do some basic temperature-taking before you presume to "convince" anyone of anything.

More important, though, I suggest you draw your daughter out on the idea of: her interests, her idea of what she wants her life to look like (i.e., what is work for, on the "enough money to live" vs "purpose" scale), where she might want to be, whether she sees herself as doing one thing over a lifetime in various stages or multiple different things across a lifetime, maybe even completely different things.

If you can get your single KOLLEGE idea out of the way of your ear passages, this could be a fascinating series of talks. (Listens, really.)

Great for your son too IF he's not already set with his choice and IF broaching the topic wouldn't come across as disappointment in his choice. If there's any risk of that, then leave it be. It really does sound like something you want to back 100 percent with 100 percent sincerity.

RE: Golf Course
Guest Jun 13, 11:52 a.m.
QUESTION: There are some other possible options: more plants, a fence, some sort of net that won’t let the balls into OP’s yard. It sounds like this is all dependent on the HOA’s rules, but I’ll bet there are ways to mitigate this that don’t involve moving. This might be a good way to connect with the neighbors: “I was wondering how you handle golfers wandering into your yard?”

For "disappointed" parent of would-be plumber
Guest Jun 13, 12:08 p.m.
QUESTION: I want to second Carolyn's getting hung up on the "disappointed" part of opting for a trade. Speaking as the daughter of someone who was a (smart, gifted) guy in the trades, who also kinda bought into the notion that he was less-than because of it, I want to say loud and clear that trades require smart and capable people. PLUS- we NEED people in the trades. Your kids would likely be employable for life, quite comfortably. On more of a personal level, if you let it be known that you're disappointed by your son's choice, you will undermine his success by planting the seed in his mind that he's less-than, too. It will not go well for any of you, long-term.

QUESTION: These kids are SO smart. I don't necessarily agree with their thoughts on AI but who cares-- they have a plan! That is worth so much. They will be set up for success relatively quickly. I say this as someone who is very academically inclined and thrived in college and grad school-- if I had any kind of technical or manual skills, I would have focused on that. I certainly would have made more money faster. Also, not for nothing... college can wait. We do our kids a disservice by expecting them to go straight from high school to college when they're not ready or it doesn't make sense.

IMPORTANT re: why are people so secretive about cancer
Guest Jun 13, 12:39 p.m.
QUESTION: Can you continue this important discussion from the 5/16 chat about why people may not go public with the ir serious illness? As a cancer survivor, I’d like to add to the response to the person who was having a hard time understanding why people are still so “secretive” about cancer. The people, who made me feel loved and supported during my cancer treatment, understood that I was protecting myself by not making my diagnosis common knowledge. It isn’t secrecy and hiding; it’s privacy and boundaries. When you have cancer, sometimes it seems like you are being asked to provide support to other people who make your cancer diagnosis all about themselves and what they want and how they think things “should” be handled. People can treat you differently once they know. Some people have lost their job when word gets out. Also, google “cancer ghosting”. It shouldn’t happen, but sadly it happens to many people and even family members may ghost a cancer patient. Poor reactions and comments are much harder to take when you already feel so incredibly ill from treatment, and you have no emotional reserve for dealing with extra things like you do when healthy. You may not be able to see from the outside all the consequences for someone else in not granting privacy that they’ve specifically requested around their diagnosis. When I got cancer, I followed the lead of a dear friend who decided not to tell many about her cancer recurrence and terminal illness because of the upsetting things people did the first time around. Even though I shared only with my inner trusted circle, I still had some hurtful reactions after confiding, like being called “secretive” to my face by a friend. She made me feel judged, disrespected, and unsupported during a terrible time in my life. More power to people who want to let everyone know. That's great if it’s what the person with cancer chooses. But, love for you can be present even when someone didn’t confide. Don’t wait for illness to tell people that you care for and love them. I’m not advocating AT ALL for withholding a diagnosis from one’s inner-most circle and yes, those in the inner circle may need a trusted outlet too. But, it’s sad when people are not respectful about others’ privacy and their carefully thought out life choices. I am almost 2 years cancer free and hope to help cultivate more understanding toward

ANSWER: Thank you for bringing this back up. Going through the outtakes was really frustrating that day, because the queue was filled with "privacy isn't secrecy" assertions -- which of course is true. People put so much work and feeling into their accounts of maintaining their privacy during an awful time in their lives -- but I was the one asking, and I was asking about secrecy. To use your words, "withholding a diagnosis from one’s innermost circle." As you may recall, this thread started because the spouse of the OP insisted on withholding his cancer news from everyone but OP. Which is more than privacy.

So I got to see it from the OP’s side and have heard from others in that position, who were sworn to secrecy. I have heard from many who did not know of a loved one’s cancer until they got news of their death. But it’s rare to hear from the people insisting on this choice. That's why I asked.

The scant response I have gotten is that people wanted to be treated as themselves, not as Sick. I do sympathize. (I would still urge allowing some support outlet for the lone person who knows, assuming there is one. There typically is, given the necessities of care.) I would still like to hear a response to my question.

So, to reiterate, I understand the decision to maintain privacy. People's repetitive, rude, nosy, me-centric, unsolicited Ring Theory violations are known to anyone here regularly, since, "How do I stop people from pushing their judgments/feelings/treatment advice on me," is a chat staple.

Also, no question, this is the ailing person's decision. Even if it's not one I'd want my loved one to make. I am not looking to argue otherwise.

I am sorry you got a big dose of people's stupid when you were in treatment -- but yay to the almost two years.

Thank you again for the invitation to come back to this. It also allows me to mention The Post’s recent reporting on the spike in cancer in young people . Tl;dr: Get checked when you feel weird, and don’t take “you’re too young” for an answer.

What do you do when you can’t do anything?
Guest Jun 13, 12:43 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn:

I know you’ve written about things to do when everything gets overwhelming, but what do you do when you can’t do anything?

I’ve written and called my representative and senators and attended their town halls and gotten zero response (other than fundraising requests) — not even acknowledgement of receipt.

We are beyond broke right now, so I send what I can, but it’s not much, and it can never compete with the monied forces arrayed against truth, decency, and the American Way.

My partner and I still, for now, knock on wood, have jobs that others have lost, but especially with our financial situation being as precarious as it is, I can’t risk those by protesting.

Things just keep getting more and more terrible. I am trying to keep my head above water, and although I don’t feel like the vicious and cruel will necessarily win at the end, the cost of preventing them from doing so is already high, and will only climb higher. I don’t feel hopeless, but I do feel helpless.

What can I do? I engage in hobbies to the extent that our budget will allow me. We are all in therapy, although that is another blow to the budget (and to all the therapists out there who can and are willing to work on a sliding scale — bless you!). My friends and family either are in the same or a worse boat or, worse to me, think things are either fine or good.

It’s like being sealed in a small box that is getting smaller. I will survive it, but it’s going to leave me permanently misshapen.

ANSWER: I am going to disagree with you, but sympathize 100 percent first. Yes it is hard to get through the contempt for the Constitution and all that entails.

Where i disagree is with the "can’t do anything." Just because there has been no response to what you have done so far (written and called representative and senators and attended town halls) doesn't mean it was or is futile and it doesn't mean you stop. It just means it's not a one-bucket fire.

Or, different metaphor, one I think I borrowed earlier -- Notre Dame? The people who labored their whole lives on that cathedral did so knowing they would never see it to completion. It took almost two centuries to build. So, you do your part, of whatever size, because it matters to the whole -- that is the point. Any results you are able to see are a bonus.

Take care. I am also going to post an amazing thing by Stephen Colbert (Anderson Cooper interview) to address your "permanently misshapen" observation. If I can find it quickly enough. I'm already taking forever.

See, I went and took way too long looking for it anyway. Here is the transcript because the videos I found were all edited. Mind you, I am a nonbeliever posting and embracing this. I don't think "gifts" need to come from a spiritual entity, nor do I think differences in or quesitons about belief in God detract from the beauty or utility of the message. To me it's a powerful framework for living with purpose amid loss and pain, which are inevitable:

"Anderson Cooper
00:02:40
"You told an interviewer that you have learned to, in your words, love the thing that I most wish had not happened. You went on to say, What punishments of God are not gifts? Do you really believe that?

"Stephen Colbert
00:02:53
"Yes. It's a gift to exist. And with existence comes suffering. There's no escaping that. But if you are grateful for your life. Then you have to be grateful for all of it. And so, at a young age. I suffered something so that by the time I was in serious relationships in my life with friends or with my wife or with my children, is that I have some understanding that everybody is suffering and however imperfectly, acknowledge their suffering and connect with them and to love them in a deep way that makes you grateful for the fact that you have suffered so that you can know that about other people. I want to be the most human I can be, and that involves acknowledging and ultimately being grateful for the things that I wish didn't happen because they gave me a gift."

College vs trade
Guest Jun 13, 1:20 p.m.
QUESTION: I realize I have a stake in this discussion as a uni professor but can I represent a different view? It saddens me for college to get treated as working papers. In its ideal form, it's a chance -- in total distinction to the vast majority of high schools-- to develop real critical thinking skills, to learn how to learn, to follow curiosity and to grow as thinking people. Everyone should have that chance. And, sorry, but an educated citizenry is something we all have an interest in sustaining. That's why financial aid and the GI Bill and state schools and all that are important. Learning for its own sake isn't elites, I don't accept that.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yes, agreed. But stop with the "sorry"!

I do hate how this has all gotten muddled. When I was in wee school, the trades were falling out of favor -- "voke" -- for "Everyone should have that chance." It should never have been either-or, of course, that was the mistake. Stop applying "favor." But the idea was right to broaden access. Then people noticed the emphasis on college was skewed too heavily on college, and there were a bunch of students there just because they were expected to be, and lo not enough people were entering the trades. Add to that, US has its "Greed is good" 1980s and never looks back, and suddenly it's all comp sci, business degrees and ROI. Ugh.

I get it, it's a lot of time and money and people want to know what they're getting, but it does seem like two basics keep getting swamped: 1. In grade school, give kids options based on their strengths and interests, not their socioeconomic status or educational fashion; 2. In college, think broadening of experience and critical thinking skills first, not career.

Fair?

Re: root canal
Guest Jun 13, 1:22 p.m.
QUESTION: Last year I told Carolyn that I needed to a therapist but was paralyzed, much like you were, because I didn't know what to say. She responded with a two-sentence message to send - I think it was essentially "I am looking for a therapist." Nothing else. I copied & pasted into their contact form, they emailed back almost immediately with questions to help find the right fit, and everything fell into place. I've been going for a year and am in a MUCH healthier place. Seconding the other commenters who said to just call and say "I need an appointment." Let the professionals on the other end of the line pick it up from there.

If you haven't called because you're afraid of the procedure, or you feel like you've waited too long -- I've also told medical professionals flat-out when I'm nervous or embarrassed or scared, and I have always found them to be incredibly reassuring and non-judgmental when I do.

Commenting on privacy vs secrecy
Guest Jun 13, 1:34 p.m.
QUESTION: I had cancer twice in less than 5 years, forms that were curable by surgery but that could still come back. Now when I hear of people that have a cancer scare I always suggest maintaining privacy (bordering on secrecy). The first time I had cancer, I was open about it. People (eg, mother and several sisters) asked me how I was doing. A LOT. And long after things were resolved. Talking about it was painful, reminding of the bad times and the outcome, that I could not bear a child due to the required hysterectomy. Reminders come up often (eg, at doctor’s visits, or even sometimes at the pharmacy) anyway. Minimizing information sharing (and thus questions/reminders) is better. The second time I had cancer I was private. Even secret. It was better.

For what to do
Guest Jun 13, 1:38 p.m.
QUESTION: The other thing I’d suggest is to read, not only about the present, but about the past. One of my favorite movie lines is from Shadowlands - “we read to know we are not alone.” Or, as James Baldwin explained it: “You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive.” All of which is to say, you’re not alone here now, even as you’re not alone in the sweep of human history. Don’t underestimate your own resilience, or the resilience if all those that stand with you now - and take heart from the example of all those who stood where you stood , where we stood, in the past.

ANSWER: I have said my "should" explicitly in this context: The person or people being asked to keep a strict secret often need someone to talk to themselves. In the case that started the thread, one spouse was diagnosed and asked the other, caregiving spouse not to tell anyone else beyond their family. That meant the caregiver (stressed) was having to fib to friends, certainly by omission, and it was becoming weird (stressful).

Bike helmet

QUESTION: My 22 year old is home for the summer and bikes to work, sometimes in the dark. I learned he doesn't wear a helmet. If he weren't living at home I would be unaware of this unsafe activity, but he is living at home and I am aware. After taking 24 hours to calm down and think, I want to tell him wearing a helmet is a condition of living here. Yes, he has a helmet and it fits. It doesn't work when he keeps it in his backpack. In your level-headed, learned opinion, is this reasonable? Or over the top?

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Do you intend to throw him out if he doesn't wear it? Monitor him for compliance?

I make no claims to level-headedness or learnedness, but all my threats have to clear the mean-it bar.

So you might want to ask him to describe for you what it looks like, generally, when the fates collect on bad helmet decisions. So you can be sure he's aware. It'll resonate a lot more when he has to form the words and mental images himself.

(Apologies to anyone who has been affected. It's awful.)

Cancer secrecy
Guest Jun 13, 2:03 p.m.
QUESTION: Whew is this a raw topic. I just had a very close loved one pass - I was her health care POA- and didn't know they had cancer till I got a call saying life support had been pulled, asking if I wanted to say goodbye.

The amount of people who showed right after just devastated and feeling betrayed was earth shattering. They had told any who knew - a boss, neighbors- a few different stories. They were so loved, and people were hurt. I could only do a few disclosures a day. Would let them have a moment and try to gently explain that I hadn't known myself.

So while I completely do respect that it is the best wishes of the person with the ailment and their autonomy... it is truly hard for those loved ones. Would try to aim for a middle ground. Ring theory, privacy, boundaries.

Plan A, Plan B
Guest Jun 13, 2:28 p.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,

My husband is 39 and I'm 36, and we have been married for two years. We are both in total agreement that we want children, but we have been in active disagreement about the timing since our wedding day. My husband has an older sister who went through a divorce in her 30s, remarried an amazing guy at 40, and naturally had two children in her early forties. Breezy pregnancies and everything. This is my husband's gold standard for what's possible, and he has decided that all the fertility/age fearmongering that goes on is just conservative propaganda. I do think there is plenty of propaganda around this topic, but I am 100% sure that trying to get pregnant in one's forties is NOT anyone's Plan A, though it might be a solid Plan B. So how do I get us on the same page about this—do I drag him into my gyno appointments? (Not ideal!)
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: So that's it, that's what he's going with -- it's possible because his sister did it? And anything else is "conservative propaganda."

Dude needs to read. Or, ah, listen to his wife?

I don't know what to tell you, but you've described a degree of resistance to information that is not promising.

If he is willing to consider a source that is neither his sister nor conservative propaganda, and doesn't involve his attendance at your GYN appointments, then I'll be happy to tell him that fertility windows vary from woman to woman -- which means some women struggle to get pregnant after age 30 or 35, some have babies over 50, and some can't conceive at any age. So if he wants you to conceive his child without medical intervention, then now's the actual best time to start trying.

And if he simply does not want you to get pregnant right now, then that is something he needs to own, knowing "not now" might well mean "not ever" -- and not deflect by saying "eh we shall do this no-worries-like when you're down to your last egg."

Also? Pregnancy punishes a body, more so as a woman ages, though not equally each prenancy and each woman. Some get through with relatively little effect and some get walloped and it's not entirely up to them. But, if you are reading, my good dude -- put an 8-ish pound roast in there, then rip it out, then lmk.

(Sorry again, everyone.)

QUESTION: This is less about the timing of your having kids and more about, IMO, your husband's openness to things not going just the way that they went for his sister. There are so many uncertainties that come with trying for and, hopefully, having kids, that his continued use of his sister as the gold standard (for kids? marriage? life?) is not going to align with you and, potentially, reality. I suggest therapy for discussion of how to reconcile all of this BEFORE you start trying for kids in earnest.

So now she wants to be friends?
Guest Jun 6, 11:05 a.m.
QUESTION: Years and years ago, my friend Evie called and said that her long-term boyfriend had just broken up with her and moved out. She was distraught. I told her I'd put the kids to bed and be right over. I didn't make it over there for 36hrs because my husband had a freak accident that ended up in the ER and the next 24hrs were touch and go - there was a chance I'd be raising my kids solo. Half-way through the ordeal, I called and left a message explaining what had happened. A day and a half later, once I was home and kids settled, I called her and she said she saw no reason for us to be friends. I had failed her. We had been close friends for over a decade. I was sad to lose the friendship but I had just been through hell - I didn't intentionally fail her! We are now in our early 60's. Her daughter found me on social media and sent me a message that her mom's health isn't great and she'd like if it I stopped by. The daughter says that her mom wants to see me but won't reach out herself because she is too ashamed. I don't know what to do with this information. If Evie really wanted to see me, wouldn't she reach out directly? And if Evie is so ashamed that she can't reach out herself, then how is it going to go sitting face to face? I am a kind person. If seeing me will help Evie in some way, I'll go but I don't want to be in a position where she expects me to apologize. Am I thinking about this all wrong?

ANSWER: For someone to have been as wrong and stupid as Evie was years ago doesn't come out of nowhere. You knew the context from the decade of close friendship, so I'm guessing you weren't completely blindsided when she did that to you?

So, it makes total sense to me at least that that Evie would be ashamed for years over her own behavior, and would not be able to reach out to you herself, even on her deathbed (if that in fact is her health situation). That seems to be the level of stuntedness Evie demonstrated all those years ago.

What you do with this info is up to you. I'm just saying, Evie was showily dysfunctional then and apparently isn't a whole lot more functional now. If you want to see her, then see her, but I'm not sure it's productive to think of Evie as having ulterior motives. You're in the position of strength, if you want to look at it that way -- if for no other reason than your ability to deal with people directly as a matter of course.

Am I entitled?
Guest Jun 6, 11:25 a.m.
QUESTION: I'm pretty sure my mom would have chosen to be child-free, if that concept existed in the 1970s when she had me. Instead, as a school teacher, she faced a lot of social and professional pressure to be a mom herself. Now that I am the ages she was when she raised me, I understand my childhood a lot better. She hated every part of raising me. She gave up a lot of personal freedom, financial security, and much-needed introvert time (another concept that didn't exist back then) to raise me, and as someone who became child-free myself (no surprise why), I actually get it and feel a lot of sympathy for her.

I already temper so many of my emotional expectations of her because of her circumstances. She doesn't tell me she loves me, she doesn't express any sort of parental pride, she doesn't talk nostalgically about our departed family members or family memories, she doesn't have any photos on display at home, etc.

My husband and I buy her birthday and Christmas presents, pay for brunch on Mother's Day, invite her over for weekly dinners and a movie, help her with her taxes and repairs around her house, but she doesn't reciprocate any of this. She doesn't even call me on my birthday, though I usually call her that week and she works a Happy Birthday in then.

But there was one thing she was doing for us that mattered a lot to us: she would watch our pets while we went out of town on vacation or to visit my husband's family, about four times per year. Now she is refusing to help anymore, because she says it's too disruptive to her life. It's not a matter of age - she's in extraordinary health. I think at its core she thinks our trips out of town are frivolous, and our pets don't bring her any personal pleasure so she can't see the point in doing it anymore. I've offered countless compromises to see if she'd keep helping us, all of which directly addressed her descriptions of the inconvenience it was causing, but she just wants to stop outright.

We can totally afford to board our animals. That's definitely what we'll do now. But this was the ONE THING she was doing that seemed....generous? Caring? Above and beyond what acquaintances do for each other? I have to be honest - I am devastated by this. I already let her off the hook for so many things. I want to pull away, stop the presents and dinners, and just give up on calling this a mother-daughter relationship entirely. Am I wrong to make this the final straw?

ANSWER: If you're going to frame it that way, then, yes. Because, as written, you've created the impression that this isn't so much a dialogue with your mother as a monologue where you're performing your part and your mom's. And so you're kind of getting mad at yourself and leaving.

But please let me answer a bigger question? I think giving up on "calling this a mother-daughter relationship entirely" is a great idea for both of you, dead on, so don't limit its tone and emotional possibilities with a connection to the petsitting.

I hope you see what I mean -- I feel like I'm not explaining it well.

If you say, "You stopped petsitting for us, so I'm punitively withdrawing the last few gestures that acknowledge you as my mother," then it's a tit-for-tat door-slam. I think the emotional complexity of this situation and the incredible generosity you have shown your mother deserve better. I think you and your mom both deserve better than pinning this to an artificially adopted symbol.

Free yourself of the societal-role expectations just because. Because they're merely smaller versions of what entrapped your mom in the 1970s, because they're no less arbitrary, because they're not working for either of you. (Well, maybe your mom likes the tax help and movie night, I shouldn't assume. But her big stand against petsitting looks like her way of saying she wants out of these rituals, too.)

The way I'm thinking about it, all the stuff you do for your mom gets another look, this time from forest perspective vs. tree. Do you buy her holiday gifts and do the Mother's Day dance, etc., because she wants and expects it, or have you been doing what you think you're supposed to? Or doing what you think you need, to tend to the injury of your childhood circumstances?

You make no mention of therapy, so I'll do it. You're dealing with a lot here. You've let more of it go, forgiven more, than I'm guessing most people would have been able to in your position, so I hope you don't take any of this as criticism. Anything I suggest is to help you along on the process you started.

I liken "temper so many of my emotional expectations" to anger. It's laudable progress for people to be able to feel their anger come on and then choose not to act on it. But it's a whole other step to heal the source of the anger so they simply get angry less often. Your next step is past tempering, and releasing yourself and your mom of mom-expectations entirely.

Then? You decide.

It is okay, though, to "redirect" more forcefully. Once you've hit the "good Lord drop it already" point: "If you're trying to say something, please say it." Or, "Your point being?" Or one-worders in the indeed, noted, thanks family, all of which cork the bottle effectively.

The kids always come first, right?
Guest Jun 6, 11:53 a.m.
QUESTION: We’ve been together 5 years and I moved in last summer. He has 2 kids from a previous marriage and we have them 3 weekends a month. On a typical weekend he makes plans for the 3 of them that don’t include me but we will usually have a meal or watch a movie together at some point. I do my own thing or make plans with friends. I have invited them to join me many times but the kids usually aren’t interested in what I’m doing even when it’s kid friendly (e.g. theme parks) or my boyfriend doesn’t want to change their plans.
Once or twice a year I ask him to switch weekends with his ex so he can attend certain events with me. Otherwise, I do most things without him because he’s with the kids. Recently, I asked him in Feb if he’d switch for an event in May and he agreed, happily even. I reminded him every few weeks to talk to his ex about the switch. When the time came he’d never talked to her and said he’d go with me “if” he didn’t have the kids. He made the arrangements only because I got upset (not the first time something like this has happened) despite my telling him not to at that point. As we drove by his ex’s neighborhood on the way to the event he said, “That's where my kids are.” Clearly he just wanted to be with them.
He genuinely seems to want to include me in the bigger things but once there, I’m all but ignored. On a yearly trip with his family I decided to include myself by joining him and the kids in the pool. I tried joining in and asked if they wanted to play any pool games, etc. and was flat out ignored. When we got home I told him how hurt I was by that and he had no idea I’d even gotten in the pool. His brother and SIL paid more attention to me on that trip than he did. We also go on a yearly trip with my family and he decided not to bring the kids this year. He said, “I’ll spend time with you this year since my kids won’t be there.”
We’ve been doing date night once a week and we have our one weekend a month. I guess that’s enough for him but we could have continued that without me moving in. Maybe I kind of thought moving in would automatically make us a family but the 3 of them are still in their bubble. I know it must be hard not to see your kids every day and I’m sympathetic to that. But I’m not asking him to spend less time with them, I just want to be included more. Is this just how it is when one partner has kids? Am I asking too much?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: "Is this just how it is when one partner has kids?" There's no universal "how it is." This is how it is in *your* relationship. That is what matters, and whether you're okay with it.

You're clearly not, so it's time to accept that and decide your next move.

The next move includes your stating to him clearly, "I just want to be included more," because you apparently "kind of thought" it would happen "automatically," which I do not recommend.

I almost didn't bother recommending this step because it seems like you're saying it many different ways, especially by inviting everyone to join you, but that's the thing -- not saying it explicitly leaves all kinds of room for misunderstanding. He may actually think you want to do your own thing, and that you were only hurt that one time because he ignored you, not because you were left out of the bubble. You need to be clear, clear, clear about what you want.

Because that's the only way to find out whether he's willing to do the work to include you. Of course the kids will do their own thing around you, if that's what they're used to. He is going to have to incorporate you now, gradually and thoughtfully, to let the kids get to know you and get comfortable.

That is, assuming he wants you involved. If he likes it this way because it's easier for him, then you have a decision to make whether that's acceptable to you.

Again -- you have to communicate what you want so you can get to this point where you can see whether getting it is or isn't possible. It can't be asking too much if you haven't expressly asked.

You can, of course, read the whole situation as-is and decide you've seen enough; you're being ignored to a degree I wouldn't encourage anyone to rationalize. But you also seem like two people who don't communicate, so this is a chance for you, at least, to work on that.

QUESTION: I think you’ve been holding on to the pet sitting as proof that your mom loves you, in the absence of other proof. I understand why it’s so hard to have that taken away, and I know it’s not about the pet sitting. It sucks that you have to deal with a Mother who can’t express affection. Counseling helped me draw boundaries in my relationship with my own mother.

For am I entitled -
Guest Jun 6, 11:59 a.m.
QUESTION: I’d underline, too, that in addition to releasing you and your mother from “mom-expectations,”as Carolyn puts it, you can, with this process, also release yourself from your *own* “daughter-expectations,” as Carolyn also suggests when she asks why you have been keeping up with Mother’s Day and other holiday traditions. Yes, your mother may have been imprisoned, in a way, by the weight of societal or even internal expectations of what a “good” mother is or should be, but you may have constructed your own cage, based on internal or societal expectations of what a “good” daughter is or should be. Your mother’s refusal to pet-sit may just be the impetus for you, at least, to open the cage doors wide and see what freedom might feel like.

re: Evie
Guest Jun 6, 12:02 p.m.
QUESTION: People who are deeply ashamed of themselves are often far more able to deal with something once it is passed the point of no return in dealing with it. In other words, once you are there, in her presence, in her "face" so to speak, it is a very different set of circumstances and calculus than the one which involves actively reaching out to stir a pot that hasn't been stirred in decades.

But also think about it from this standpoint: What's the worst that happens if you don't go? What's the worst that happens if you do? Which one are you more comfortable living with?

path forward?
Guest Jun 6, 12:14 p.m.
QUESTION: I have a very close friend of many decades. We met one another even before we met and married our spouses. Once we married and had families, we would occasionally spend time with each others families. Everyone liked one another but the primary relationship was still between friend and I. Awhile back, friend and spouse began having marital difficulties. Friend confided in me a lot and mostly I was there to listen and support. Friend's spouse reached out to me during this period to ask me to get involved in fixing the marriage. I politely declined to do so. It didn't seem like a wise move (I'm certainly not qualified as a therapist.) I said I didn't want to get involved but left the conversation with no hard feelings. I subsequently learned through friend that spouse no longer wants to associate with me as I abandoned them in their time of need. I reached out to friends' spouse suggesting that we clear the air and gotten the cold shoulder. Help me understand what happened here. Was I wrong?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: No, you made a principled choice.

It's certainly Spouse's prerogative to take it badly and torch the relationship over it, but that only underscores the wisdom of your decision not to get involved. Yikes.

I hope Spouse's emotional immaturity (or, I could say, friend's poor taste in spouses) doesn't cost you your friend, but there isn't much you can do except settle in on the high ground you staked out. The moment to do so has passed, but if the word "abandoned" ever comes up again, you can assert that your support is unflagging -- you simply draw the line at involvement in anyone's marriage but your own.

Reply to Carolyn, re Evie's Friend
Guest Jun 6, 12:21 p.m.
QUESTION: Just a note, from personal experience: it *can* come out of nowhere. I was close friends for at least a decade with a colleague. We shared bean soup (saying this just in case she sees this), stroller walks, & many years of life changes, until one day she announced that she was sick of being my friend. Absolutely out of the blue; just the week before she had been talking about how much fun we always had together. I was so concerned about the possibility of a serious mental health issue that I called a friend of hers. I never heard from her (or the friend) again.

A former Evie
Guest Jun 6, 12:26 p.m.
QUESTION: I used to avoid people like the plague when I made a mistake - especially a big one. I grew up in a house of both emotional neglect and perfectionism. This meant, if I made any kind of mistake, especially a big one, I could not emotionally handle what I did, and I couldn't face hearing a high level of disdain for another person.

While I've done a lot of work on myself over the years and I am MUCH better since I have the tools to manage these situations, there are some situations that I'm not proud of - people have every right to have a negative view of me due to past actions.

As a former Evie, I'll say this: She was in the wrong 100%. She should have reached out to you earlier to apologize. Much earlier. There are so many reasons she may not have that don't have anything to do with you. I wish that during those times, I had the hard conversation with the other person, even if I was scared to have it. I could have salvaged a few of those connections.

With that being said, you also don't owe her anything. If you think that you will benefit from seeing her in some way, then go for it. If it all feels like a big disruption, you can send a note wishing her well, or respond to the daughter saying that you will not be able to see her. People don't have their epiphanies on their deathbed, they talk about them more since the opportunity for long-term consequences are done.

Setting boundaries
Guest Jun 6, 12:30 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi! I was diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year and am still undergoing treatment. FYI if you have dense breast tissue that mammograms can’t see through ask your doctor if you qualify for extra screening methods! It might save you from having a much bigger problem (like me). Okay, so it’s been a roller coaster for months and I kept my circle small. Just my family and close friends but in the process I came to the realization that my MIL isn’t in “my corner” and never will be. After 26 years of relationship that has been at times really challenging and hurtful (went to therapy for it 15 years ago), I really feel so much better with essentially keeping her away from me. Cancer helped me set boundaries with her. My question, and I’m embarrassed I still don’t know how to do it, how can I keep a friendly but somewhat distanced space from her? I am a people pleaser so this is really hard. She keeps trying to connect - she misses my attention.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I am so sorry you are going through this, a really taxing experience without the emotional weight of a difficult relationship. There is absolutely no need to throw embarrassment on the pile. Managing a difficult relationship is not a one-size-fits-all thing we are all supposed to know how to do by x time or y age.

Anyway. Your spouse really needs to step in here and tell your MIL that you are taking more time to rest/for yourself, or you are communicating less, or however you two decide to phrase it, and so your spouse is to be her primary contact hereafter. Period. And your spouse eats the fallout for this. Period.

That is the path to the distanced space while you undergo treatment and heal.

If you and/or spouse are unwilling to take a step this drastic, then I am going to be a noodge and ask you to think about that for a bit. Because you deserve and need this space and support. So who is not giving it to you and why? Who is treating your needs as less important than hers?

If that is too big to take on right now, then, fair. I will back off. And suggest this:

Pick a form or topic of communication with her that is easy, and live there. Errands, recipes, your spouse, a TV show, a team, books, her garden/dog/job -- by text only, or one call a week, or one narrowly defined help request per week, etc. Set it and forget it.

I know this is emotional work just to figure out, which is why it is my second option. But once it's in place, it can be magic for containment.

Take care.

Grief
Guest Jun 6, 12:49 p.m.
QUESTION: Sibling and I just past the 2nd anniversary of our mom’s death, and are quickly approaching the two year mark on the incredibly difficult job of clearing out and selling her house. Sibling and I have had an up and down relationship over the past 30 or so years.
My relationship with mom was strong when her relationship with sibling was tenuous, but became fraught as she pulled closer to sibling after the first grandkid was born. In recent years she almost seemed to try and pick fights with me when we’d see each other and criticized many things about how I parent my own kids.
How do I grieve the mom I was close to when I’m not all that sorry to no longer have to juggle a volatile relationship with random landmines?
Thanks

Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Best advice I have is to relieve yourself of the burden of having the right kind of grief. You can miss one version of Mom and not the other in the same thought. Have all the complicated thoughts and feelings and don't bother feeling guilty.

The classic saying -- if you don't like New England weather, wait a few minutes -- works pretty well for grief like you describe, especially when you're digging through box after box of memory triggers. Try just letting it all roll by. See if that helps.

Friend going through a split
Guest Jun 6, 1:03 p.m.
QUESTION: A close friend is going through a divorce, and has taken a dive into a new relationship before even moving out of the house and legal proceedings haven't started yet. They say they are in love, but I am struggling with watching this. I think the move to start the relationship so soon is a) not fair to their spouse, and b) ripe with risk for going supremely badly since it's such a tender time. They've asked my opinion about everything else split-related except for this. Do I say anything? It has nothing to do with me except for concerns about their judgement and a dread that I'll be asked to support them through another messy split at some point. But again, no one has asked me for my thoughts. We rarely keep things from one another.

Feeling like MIL’s servant
Guest Jun 6, 1:22 p.m.
QUESTION: No crisis here, just a repeated effort to talk myself down from resentment I’m not sure is justified, and you have such a way of bringing insight when people feel stuck. 2.5 years ago after my FIL passed we moved 80’s non-driving MIL into independent living about 20 minutes away, and since my husband still works full time while I volunteer part time now, it made sense that I take her to her appointments and bring her supplies. The thing is, I’m from a southern-ish area and am used to a certain kind of considerate treatment from friends etc, and my husband is also quite considerate. However, she’s NYC born and isn’t mean, just rarely thinks to say things like please and thank you, and is the only person in my life that would ever just tell me what to do vs asking. I just feel disrespected, especially when she’s anxious and it comes out in talking to me in a way I would never tolerate from anyone else. But I don’t think it’s anything she is even aware of, and I’m rather conflict averse. Is the problem me, and I should learn to be less sensitive and more compassionate? Or is there any way to address the dynamic that won’t likely do more harm than good?

ANSWER: Thanks for the kind words.

I'm sorry, too, that you're the designated driver for exactly what torments you in a person. Very "No Exit," if you're up for a little Sartre.

But you have gone 99 percent of the way to solving your own problem, so I hope you will take me up on the easier suggestion to push the last 1 percent. You are not being "disrespected," any more than you would be if your MIL spoke English as a second language and used an insulting word inadvertently as a consequence.

The formula for disrespect includes intent. From your description, your MIL is not only deeply imprinted in her mannerisms, but also the same with you as with anyone, yes? -- though let's take away the geographic markers; they're not relevant. (They may dictate manner and accent, but to suggest region determines thoughtfulness vs. self-absorption is a nonstarter.)

So there's nothing to internalize or address. You're carrying a passenger who doesn't speak your language, and you don't understand hers. The fact that she goes deeper into "her" language when anxious or upset really tracks.

The thing for you to learn, then, is more like retraining, to see your differences as stemming from communication vs. intent. Nothing hurtful there.

Couples therapy
Guest Jun 6, 1:29 p.m.
QUESTION: My wife is has been seriously depressed for a couple months, more so than in the 25 years we've been together. In the past few couples therapy sessions, she declined to explain why when I (at the therapist's suggestion, though I had asked before too) invited her to do so. She then said part of the reason she couldn't is that I would then get upset, which would shift the focus from her to me. The therapist supported her position.

In other words, it is my fault that she won't explain why she is upset to me. (Narrator: He knows why she is depressed. It is because she doesn't like sex, he is hurting as a result, she knows she will never change but is unwilling to say so clearly, and we both realize there is no good solution. But his saying so would be speculating about her internal mental state which he's learned is a no-no in couples therapy; it is important only to talk about one's own feelings.)

Is this rational? Is this abuse? Is this therapist playing favorites?

ANSWER: What do those questions have to do with anything.

Your wife doesn't like sex. Are you ready to accept this and move on to whatever is next for you -- as a couple or not as a couple anymore?

Or is it your intention to try to talk about this to some better outcome for you, when you seem to be saying you already know there isn't one?

If it's the former, then you say what upsets you is limbo and not knowing the truth, and you are prepared to accept your reality, even one you don't want, because then you at least know where you stand. Because it's not about blame it's about living honestly. (Isn't it?)

If it's the latter, then you don't belong in couples counseling, because your wife is not safe to speak freely -- because you may try to use her honesty to get something you want from her.

Re: friend split
Guest Jun 6, 1:31 p.m.
QUESTION: My best friend recently moved in with her 2nd ex-husband. Their actual marriage was volatile. They’ve had several rounds of semi-reunifications, friends with benefits, and barely speaking. It was chaotic for a few years. I used to feel the same way every time she told me there were back together. One day it hit me: their relationship isn’t my business. I’m here for her, and if she is ok with what she’s doing, that’s good enough for me. I don’t have to fix it and don’t have to prepare for the next break-up. That has nothing to do with me.

Re: kids always come first
Guest Jun 6, 1:43 p.m.
QUESTION: You don’t mention how old the kids are, but they are presumably still pretty young. You can NEVER force kids who went through a divorce to accept you, and are just building the wall higher if you force it. They have their own issues with their parents split, which you can’t ever understand from their perspective. It may be hard to deal with, but it’s nothing you can do anything about.

Spouse hasn't spoken to me in five days.
Guest Jun 6, 1:55 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn. Late last week, my husband and I got into a big fight over a misunderstanding (that I don't even know what prompted it) which escalated to the point of me angrily telling him to go to his parents' place, which he did. He stayed there for three days, before I went down and convinced him to come back home with me. But he is still angry. I know it was wrong to ask him to leave and have since tried to apologize sincerely multiple times. But he stays sequestered in our second bedroom and I have now not seen him for five days, nor heard from him, though I know he is there. He is eating by himself and only doing his own laundry. Any attempts to engage with him are met with either silence or angry words about how he doesn't want to talk to me or look at me. I'm at a loss and I don't know what to do. I'm trying to wait patiently, but his anger doesn't seem to have dissipated in the slightest, and I'm breaking down being stonewalled in our home. Any advice?

ANSWER: I think it goes without saying, this is outside the bounds of healthy adult anger management. Do you have access to counseling -- through work maybe, an EAP? Through your health insurance? This would be for you of course to start. The direction would be toward emotional education for both of you, which would be what brings him along, but that's a goal down the road. Right now you're doing what you can do and assessing your options, with credentialed support.

How do I get over myself?
Guest Jun 6, 2:03 p.m.
QUESTION: I got laid off and recently have been hired by former colleagues as a consultant, but I've never been a consultant before and I'm really struggling to get started. I helped develop the scope of my work, so I actually do know what is needed, but I seem to be in a paralysis and can't seem to get started. Huge amounts of imposter syndrome happening here. How can I get over this so I don't lose this opportunity?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Can you pick something? You developed the scope of your work, you say -- so what's the first thing? Type it and send it in. And if you want, also say why you aren't doing it, because there's a reason you aren't doing it.

If it's a good reason, then do the second thing.

Imposter syndrome is real, I know that, but it's also BS and here's why: It affects regular healthy people who know what they don't know, while all the "I alone can fix it!!" Dunning-Krugerite yahoos rush in and screw it all up because they don't know what they don't know.

So just do a thing. Once you start, you'll have it.

QUESTION: Another thing you can do, especially since you already know your former colleagues, is straightforwardly say to them "So, as you know, I've never been a consultant before, and I'm used to interacting with you all as colleagues. So I'm learning as I go on things like [whatever's different about being a consultant], so don't hesitate to let me know if I miss the mark and I'll adjust." Then, as things come up, you can ask them "Do you prefer if I [A] or [B]"?

Re: How do I get over myself
Guest Jun 6, 2:13 p.m.
QUESTION: I worked on a consultant basis for decades. At first I always felt like you do: "What am I doing here? Why did they even hire me? I don't know what I'm doing! I'm going to screw this up and never be able to work again ... " Etc., etc. After a couple of experiences like this, I realized that I ALWAYS felt like this for the first week or two on a contract -- and it wasn't because I was ignorant, it was because I genuinely did not know at first what the problems were and what I was going to do to solve them. I was being a good listener and figuring out what the client actually needed, rather than coming in with a canned solution that might not fit their situation at all. So I learned to relax and be a sponge for the first couple of weeks, maybe (as CH suggests) produce a bit of work to show the client that I was listening ... and then kick into problem-solving mode once I felt surer what the problem was. Your reaction is perfectly normal, so don't worry about it.

Ex insists my gf is toxic because she wrote a book about cheaters
Guest May 16, 11:04 a.m.
QUESTION: My marriage ended 3 years ago because my wife cheated on me and left me for that guy. The whole experience was devastating but after wallowing for months, I spent time in therapy, worked on myself and carried on. My ex and I have reached a good place and co-parent our son well. We are not friends but we are friendly.
Now, I am in love with a beautiful, smart, funny woman who I’ve been dating for 6 months. Because of her I am happier than I’ve been since before my marriage ended. She was also cheated on and we bonded over that experience. She wrote and published a book about it. My ex Googled her name and read the book and told me she’s not happy about the relationship. The book is very brutal about cheaters. My ex says she’s worried about what my girlfriend will eventually say to our son about cheaters and about her. I promised I won’t let that happen but my ex says my girlfriend is bitter and toxic and I should steer clear. I read the book for myself and it’s very funny but she doesn’t pull any punches about her hatred and disdain for her ex and all cheaters. Her ex was mean and insulting all through the divorce so it's understandable. They don't have kids so she's free to hate him all she wants. Could that book be a sign of toxicity or is it a great method of coping?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Guess what. Your ex wife doesn't get to decide whom you date. She doesn't even get an opinion, not even as the amicable co-parent of your children.

If someone you are dating does or says something that either causes harm to your kids, or presents a credible risk of imminent harm or long-term damage (I think that covers it), then your ex does have standing to speak up. Arguably that's what she did, but you answered her concern so her proper next move was to drop it, not drop a "should" on you.

Cuz, sorry, ex's complaint that she's uncomfortable with your GF for authoring a book about cheaters because ex is a cheater herself does not pass the laugh test. Unless "laugh test" is literally that it makes a tired advice columnist laugh out loud at her keyboard, in which case it passes with flying colors so now I'm confusing myself.

Of course she's not happy. You can say this to her. "Of course you're not happy after reading the book. I wouldn't expect you to be."

But then you can say: "I am not dating her, though, as some kind of hired assassin to kill your standing with our kids."

Because you're not, right? You're dating her because she is her own person and you like her a lot and you like yourself with her.

So: "I am dating her because I like her. She and her ex are not the two of us. You and I are our own people and have our own history and have made our own peace."

Then: "If she can't respect that, then of course we won't stay together. But I decide that, not you."

End of conversation, no negotiating.

As for whether the book is toxicity or coping: It could be either. Or both. Her book could be a snapshot in time, maybe since superseded or outgrown, and possibly even part performance.

You have chosen the high road as your kids' co-parent, so if you and your GF are going to stay together, then first you're going to have to find out for yourself whether she is willing and able to support that choice 100 percent. No oopses.

Again -- YOU find this out. You don't preemptively walk away because your ex thinks she can exercise veto power. You do not want to grant her that.

Your ex could choose to blow up your detente over this, because that takes only one person to do. She can do more harm than any anti-cheating zealot you date. I hope she doesn't force the issue so you have to articulate things like this.

Fun fun, the need for trust never stops and keeps running both ways.

New Job
Guest May 16, 11:08 a.m.
QUESTION: I've been offered a new position at work. I dont love my current role but the new job isn't a slam dunk either. They are both management roles for high profile projects, the same grade level, and I have the same relative skill level and knowledge to bring in either role. I want to keep working for my employer because of their excellent benefits. How do I choose when both options are so similar?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I have no idea, since any new job is a risk you will hate it or be more layoffable than if you had stayed in the old one, and I know nothing about the intangibles of your company (e.g., whether taking new positions is an unspoken part of a rise through the ranks, even "lateral" moves). But if I'm looking at this as more of a logic problem, then I'm seeing something you don't love as the "old" option. So why wouldn't you try the "new" option? Unless there's a not-zero risk you'd hate it.

Living with a cheater… strategy or insanity?
Guest May 16, 11:26 a.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn, I’ve been serially cheated on by my wife. I have not directly confronted her. We have settled into routine and can enjoy a day without issue if I compartmentalize my knowledge of her deceit, which now comes more easily. My heart is not in it, my kids are my life, my work supports us and fulfills me, along with hobbies.

If I can take what pieces of enjoyment I can from my weak relationship, live my life finding love and fulfilment outside of my supposed partner, and let the kids have a “normal” upbringing in the midst of background secrecy, is that fantastic adaptation and coping in a tough situation, or am I just a masochistic time bomb waiting to have a breakdown?

In the thick of it I’m not sure if this is strategy or insanity.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Huh. I see your predicament -- this could be one honest conversation away from being a functional(ish) open marriage. Or, boom.

We know you're lying to your wife (about not knowing how epically she's lying to you). The question is whether you're lying to yourself about how okay you are emotionally with the arrangement.

Two suggestions -- well, one, to spend some good honest you time with that question.

But the first version of it is, on your own, to imagine a life where you tell your wife the truth and then live with configurations of that idea. Same "open" (loveless) marriage but honest; divorce; shared home but separate rooms and social lives; and earnest reckoning with the marriage and an attempt at least at repair and monogamy. At various points of your days, think where you'd be at that moment if you chose option x. Better, worse, too weird to know? Not that you'd be 100 percent in control of the outcome, you're just pushing your mind out of the "This is fine" meme you're living.

The second version is to put yourself in solo counseling to figure out what you want and feel and where your lines are between healthy tradeoffs and self-erasure.

I vote version 2 -- but getting therapy set up takes time, so try on version 1 while you wait for your appointment. (Unless your work has an EAP. Then you can usually talk to someone in a matter of days.)

Guest May 16, 11:43 a.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,
First of all, thanks for all the great advice and the community you've created through your columns and your chats.
I'm reaching out now because I’ve had some stressful events this spring/summer, but my anxiety is resting in one weird area, and I'm hoping you have some advice. My granddaughter was born prematurely earlier this spring to my daughter who lives 1000 miles away. Fortunately, I was in a position to be able to go be with them and help out during the last 2 months. Happily, the baby is now doing well. My husband is now facing treatment for prostate cancer. So, I will be staying home with him for the rest of this summer. He is a very private person and has asked me not to share this information beyond our family. Here's my problem. Many of my friends are surprised that I won't be returning to see the new grandbaby until fall. They ask me why. I'm having trouble figuring out how to respond to that question from these well-meaning and loving people. What do you suggest?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Thank you for your kind words, and I'm glad your grandbaby is doing well.

Now can I throw things around the kitchen in frustration at people for not letting things go that aren't their business?

Ugh.

Here's all you ever need to say to people who are asking for more info than you are willing or able to give: "Ah, long story."

This one, you can cap off with, "But I'll be back as soon as I can."

Then you change the subject. Have a pivot topic ready.

Also? Unsolicited, sorry: Your husband is asking a lot of you. In my book, which is irrelevant, he's asking too much. The caregiver needs care too.

If you agree with that, then ask him for license to confide. Not everywhere, just your chosen place of unfailing discretion.

Boundary-setting with possible special circumstances
Guest May 16, 11:53 a.m.
QUESTION: I've learned a lot about setting appropriate boundaries in relationships over the past few years. I recently had a conversation with a close friend which led me to look at a specific situation differently though. I have sibling with whom I have a complicated relationship. He can be verbally explosive and insulting, including cursing, name-calling, etc. Sometimes this is followed by an apology, or an "I was just angry" explanation. I told him that this type of communication is unacceptable to me. My friend's point was along the lines of "what if this is early dementia or mental illness, and he truly can't control it?" If that's the case (we're both seniors), I realize that I still have a choice, but it makes the choice more complicated, doesn't it? I'm interested in your thoughts about this.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whether someone can or can't control their "bad" behavior matters, sure -- I'd let my wailing infant smack me in the face without consequences, right? But my healthy 8-year-old, not so much.

The boundary for a sibling who is "verbally explosive and insulting" but who has dementia or mental illness would be that I don't engage with the insults at all, or leave the room or end the call or whatever -- whatever it takes to go non-responsive. I also wouldn't take it personally. Not about me.

Also, that behavior never gets "rewarded" in any sense. That can mean the threat of it never factors into my decisionmaking; I do as I intend for my reasons and if the reaction happens, then it happens. There's no tiptoeing around.

I'm answering generically here. You don't say whether your sib's behavior has deteriorated, to suggest onset of dementia, say. "I was just angry," absent context, doesn't fly. We all get angry. Not all of us take that as permission to lash out and inflict harm.

The amount of their control factors into the amount you limit contact with the person, as part of your boundary. That's how it works for me at least. And of course it's just our perception of how much control they have, because who knows. The closest we get are formal diagnoses.

Dealing with inquiries of ambiguous loss
Guest May 16, 12:08 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,

I'm so grateful for your column and am an avid reader. I'm sad to be writing you, but I hope you can help. A friend of mine has been missing for a month now. She is an adult, but it is under suspicious circumstances that she disappeared (she left behind a cat that she loved deeply and daily medications), the police are involved and every day I help with the amount of spoons I can muster. I do hang quite a few posters and talk to a lot of people at my job (I get a lot of people from many areas of Denver passing through) about my missing friend to try to create awareness and possibly recognition to generate leads for the tip line. My question is that sometimes the overwhelm of people asking follow up questions about things we (her collective of friends and warriors trying to find her) have covered 100xs gets to me and I need a nice way to say that I don't have anymore answers. I realize I'm instigating these conversations, and people want to be helpful, and I point them to the tip line and the Facebook page her mom has going to try to organize everyone. I'm also undergoing therapy, to help manage my own loss here. I really miss her. Thanks for your help.

Sincerely,
Bring Jax Home

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Oh oh oh. This is awful.

Your question is very much like the one people have when they are seriously ill and everyone they talk to says, "Have you tried ...?" It comes from this place of real caring, and then it's over and over and over, and you. just. can't.

I have a few suggestions. One is that you release as much of this worry as you can. You are lovely to worry about how people feel when they talk to you, but I can't imagine any of them don't see your distress plainly (unless they're just not capable). So you're good. really.

Another is basic and mechanical. If you can carry a stack of little printed business-size cards with the Facebook info and the tip line and some FAQs or whatever else, then, "Thank you -- this is all of it," is a natural transaction closer.

And, you can also say: "I am so grateful you're asking. I can't be the answers though. I hope you understand."

A huge hug through the ether to you.

Feeling weirdly guilty after my weight loss
Guest May 16, 12:33 p.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn, I'm glad you answered today's question to open a discussion about weight loss drugs and judgment. I have a different but related one. I've lost 70 pounds taking meds, I'm healthier (was pre-diabetic), but now I'm having an unexpected response. I really like seeing myself thin. I like shopping for clothes, something that's been torture for years. But in this era of more body positivity, I'm feeling strangely guilty and kind of ashamed that I had to make myself so much smaller to embrace my body. I have friends of all sizes, of course, and I love them for who they are. But sometimes I can hear that judgy voice in my own head (never out loud) saying I'm glad I look the way I do now. And I hate that. Is this just another way that diet culture has messed with me? What should I do with these contradictory feelings?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yeah dramatic intentional weight loss definitely brings up some interesting new ways to feel bad -- when all "body positivity" was supposed to mean was not linking body size and shape and food to punishing measures of personal worth.

I wouldn't call your experience "unexpected" though. I mean, you were pre-diabetic -- your body wasn't in a happy place. Now it's happy, or happier. where it is, and it's okay to feel good about that.

So while I don't think it was ever misguided to focus on liking yourself and wearing flattering things at whatever weight you were -- and wow it is TOTALLY right to be accepting of others wherever they are, and being open to beauty in whatever form it appears -- we are allowed to have personal, internal signals. This feels good, this doesn't feel good, this feels great. It's our metering system. The best we can hope for at this point is to grab it back from social pressure -- or protect it from, in the case of kids.

FWIW I had premature twin grandbabies and after that first longer visit I only returned when needed/requested. After that first rough period, they have grown to be happy healthy elementary schoolers.

ANSWER: So, yes -- you're right. I'll say that upfront. The less we say the less we have to explain.

But. For one thing, that's a tough lesson to apply in arrears. OP may have been chitchatting as usual, and suddenly there was Husband's Cancer Embargo to deal with, and oops, suddenly OP needs creative phrasing where none was ever needed before. It's like learning a new dance step and tripping over your own feet.

And, further, this dovetails with the need for caregiver to have care: The OP probably really wants to go back to see the daughter and grandbaby. And is worried about husband, too. OP is talking to friends! So, "Not sure, haven’t made plans yet," is not just info withholding, it's emotional withholding. That's hard.

So that's why the breezy deflection you suggest is 100 percent effective and right but ... ugh. Not. For a person like OP, newly in this spot. (Maybe eventually, with time.)

And why the pushing is so hard, too, from friends. Wish they had their sensors on.

Aaaaand why "keep my cancer a complete secret all summer" is just not a fair ask. Again. I say this already spotting anyone sick a huge sympathy advantage.

QUESTION: you mentioned :Same "open" (loveless) marriage but honest;

I'd add: Same honest, open *love-filled* marriage.

I know someone with that and it's not a way to not upset the apple cart. It's a reformation. And excising of the word 'cheater.' Also, it contains deep respect for the other so that nothing is being rubbed in the spouses noses.

ANSWER: Sure, can be. As always, any answer I write is to the details in the question only. Any application beyond that is at your own risk -- meaning, subject to your own interpretation, filters and sensitivities.

But when you give me "My heart is not in it" and "my weak relationship" and "my supposed partner," then I get to say, "Same 'open' (loveless) marriage."

how does your vacation work?
Guest May 16, 12:45 p.m.
QUESTION: Not looking for advice, but I'm just curious. You have spoken before about how you have to submit columns several weeks in advance, but when you go on vacation, your column re-runs seem to coincide with your time off. Given the lag time for syndication, shouldn't your re-runs appear about two weeks after you return? How do you get those time lines to match up?

Personal Health Issue
Guest May 16, 12:52 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, your answer to the new grandmother with the ill husband was good. But I am a wife who has forbidden my husband to talk about my health at all, never, zero. One reason is he has no boundaries at all, so my demarcation line has to be kind of all or nothing, or else he'd tell a stranger in the grocery store. What I would tell this woman is to look as though she's going to confide and then say, "Actually, I have a little health issue I'm dealing with. I'll talk more about it when I can, but I appreciate you keeping this quiet," and then moving to the pivot topic. I love it when my husband actually protects me, and I bet her husband would appreciate her handling it this way.
avatar
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: Yes, there's that. I'm sorry.

Then of course there's the other class of people who hear, "Actually, I have a little health issue I'm dealing with. I'll talk more about it when I can, but I appreciate you keeping this quiet," and they hound you to the ends of the earth for the rest of the information!!! or you see them everywhere from then on and they're being super discreet but with The Eyebrows / \

EAP followup
Guest May 16, 12:59 p.m.
QUESTION: I work at a large employer with a mental-health benefit/EAP. I've been struggling to feel productive at work, wondering if I'm burned out, or depressed, or just bored with my job, etc. I recently signed up with the EAP and did indeed get to talk with someone in less than a week, which was great. I found that the therapy she provided seemed very "results focused," with the desired results being that I was able to be productive at work. To be fair, that is the problem I brought to her that I wanted a solution for. However, I also mentioned that some of my poor mental health state had to do with some issues I am having with my wife. She did not follow up on that at all. We talked instead about attention issues, possible ADHD, etc., all very reasonable things, ... but all focused on my ability to work.

I had somewhat of a feeling that maybe the employer-provided mental health providers were mostly focused on ensuring that employees were able to be productive at work and not necessarily as interested in probing "outside the box" of what I described to find deeper issues.

Just something to keep in mind.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Thank you. Yes, that's one potential limitation. Another is literal, in that the number of sessions is typically capped. But it's what I think of as a gateway -- a trained and licensed mental health provider who can identify areas of concern and refer out if needed.

That might not be something all of them can do, will do, are empowered to do. Mileages always seem to vary. But by my understanding, because the number of sessions is capped, part of the function is to refer out people who need more care.

For Bring Jax Home
Guest May 16, 1:07 p.m.
QUESTION: Two of my husband's brothers and a niece and nephew were injured in a serious car accident in which they were all injured (one brother-in-law's neck was broken, though he survived). I became the conduit of information, both to and from, for friends and family.

It almost broke me, especially when people made suggestions they intended to be helpful (but they did not themselves help). About three weeks into this, seeing that I was reaching capacity to do this while working and caring for my young kids, two friends became my "communications secretaries." I gave them information and they made the contacts with relevant people. They filtered the return responses and suggestions from others, so that I only had to deal with appropriate stuff. And because they were one remove from the situation, they could simply say, "I'm sorry, I don't have the answer to that, but I should know more when I call you next."

Maybe Jax's friend could enlist some people to do that for them, especially if they have become "information central" for a wide circle. Because it's not sustainable, especially when you're dealing with your own anxiety.

ANSWER: I hope this does help Jax's friend, thank you.

I'll say, it gave me a lift too just because it had two friends in it who saw you needed them and stepped in. I know I'm at that point of tired where I cry easily, but, still, I think that would have gotten me on a regular day, too. Pretty great 🥹

why are people so secretive about cancer?
Guest May 16, 1:12 p.m.
QUESTION: I have a hard time understanding why people are still so secretive about cancer. I thought we had gotten over that years ago. My husband is clergy, and if I have lost count of how many times he has told me about someone's cancer and then said "it's not public." Please help me understand this. (Disclosure: my mother died from breast cancer over 20 years ago, and she didn't feel the need to hide it from people.)

Re: difficult guests

QUESTION: I’d also try to focus on this - no matter how many difficult guests attend, the student will still graduate, the wedding will still take place (well, unless one of the difficult guests objects … I kid, I kid). I know how we can get pictures in our heads of what a perfect event should look like, but all those details we can stress over are just that, details, not the real focus of the celebration, nor the real cause for celebration. Life is messy, people can be difficult, and yet there is still so much to celebrate. Keep your eyes on the prize, and don’t focus on the self-promoters or the selfie-takers.

EAP, for me, not work related at all
Guest May 16, 1:28 p.m.
QUESTION: Just a counter balance to the person who experienced the EAP therapist as all about being productive at work again, ignoring other issues (ug, sorry that happened).

My experience with the EAP was different. I had a crisis (called with the question “how do you know it’s time to hospitalize someone for mental health issues they don’t think the have?”). Got excellent advice, and it wasn’t about work. I also have Fed friends making use of EAP as they face the fork in the road decisions.

TLDR: with EAPs, YMMV

Evil Ex Wife
Guest May 16, 1:34 p.m.
QUESTION: A decade ago, when our kids were just babies, my husband was hit by a drunk driver and the physical and emotional impacts are lifelong. My husband did all the therapies and regained a lot of physical mobility/ability but his mental health spiraled out of control and I was his target of all his anger. He was verbally abusive and when I'd get close to help him, there were a few times he was physically abusive. For years, I tried to hold it all together but when my older son heard a particularly nasty insults thru the intercom system, I knew it was time. I got myself in therapy and planned the dissolution of my marriage. I've been out of the house for six months now and several in my church and his family have asked how I could leave a man who is disabled and disabled through no fault of his own. What happened "in sickness and in health" is what several have asked. I have been honest and I've said he was emotionally and physically abusive. Is it wrong of me to be direct? It is the truth. I'm so tired of hiding and angry at others' judgement of me when he goes to church and presents as some pillar of the community when he most certainly is not. Their dad is passionate about the boys attending this church school and I didn't fight it in the divorce agreement so for now, I'm stuck with this church and its community.

ANSWER: I am here for your directness.

This is a terrible story in so many ways, I am sorry.

I'm sure you are on this already, but just to make myself feel better, I am going to ask out loud whether there are extra eyes on your boys to make sure their dad doesn't turn his anger on them. Especially given that your husband is playing the church community, acting the pillar and using their sympathy to present himself as a victim 2 x over (accident and now you). Having them in the church school means there's a full coverup mechanism in place, for people to be very slow to believe he's harming them.

Re: keeping cancer secret
Guest May 16, 1:38 p.m.
QUESTION: My husband had prostate cancer, which ultimately took his life, and he wanted it kept from his family and friends, though not mine. He did that because he didn't want to be treated any differently and he wanted to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible. I understood that once it started affecting our lives in a big way, I longed for the "normal" days. I didn't necessarily agree with not telling his family, but understood and although I tried to talk him out of it, it was his decision.

Secretive about cancer
Guest May 16, 1:41 p.m.
QUESTION: My spouse had surgery for aggressive prostate cancer 2 years ago. Last year, he had to undergo 35 sessions of radiation. We kept it very quiet. Only our closest friends, who don't live here, and our pastor knew. He works in an industry and at a level where people are always looking for your weak spot as a way to push you out. He's also about 30 years older than the other people he works with. One is constantly asking about his age and when he's going to retire. He was able to work from home for about 3 days following surgery, and he scheduled his radiation treatments for very early in the morning before work. He only told the HR director and one other person. No one else in the office knows. We live in a small city, and info like this spreads quickly. As a side note for the chatter whose spouse is a member of the clergy, my dad was a clergyman, and we never spoke to anyone about his health for the same reason.

school fundraiser misbehavior
Guest May 16, 2:01 p.m.
QUESTION: My daughter's school has an annual silent auction fundraiser. We typically do some small bids, but there was a particular piece of art we liked this year that was a little more expensive. We were the last ones to bid on the item before the auction closed. Yet, we were informed a few days later that there was a "mix up" and someone else bid after us and was considered the winner. Neither my husband or I understand how this is possible, as there was a bell and announcement, it was not unclear. My husband thinks we should ask the school to fix this, which involves physically getting the art back, refunding the other person, and allowing us to pay and take it. I have suggested letting it go (after all, the school got the funds, which was the point). We save our money, buy other art, maintain harmony - although I also believe we should decline to attend poorly-run auctions at the school in the future, and contribute to school fundraising in other ways. What do you think? And if we want to find out the details of what happened, are we just stirring the pot?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Heh. I think you definitely let it go, because there are a few reasons the auction could have been messed up but there's no good outcome to complaining.

I also wouldn't "decline to attend poorly-run auctions at the school in the future," either. Next time don't leave without it when you win :)

By let it go, I mean really really let it go. But next time don't leave without your winnings when you win :)

(Clearly there was inside finagling, right? It's just a matter of why. Was the wrong piece put up for auction by mistake? Okay, school auction, you let that go. Did someone with more juice want it? That sucks. Did they drop it? Etc. None of it matters at this point, it's over, you aren't out any money, so forget it happened and la la la ...)

Group Conversations
Guest May 16, 2:06 p.m.
QUESTION: We are going on a trip with a small group (6) of long time friends. We love the group chats but a couple of them like to start side conversations during a group time. I find this very distracting, no matter if I’m the one being sidelined or the one in the larger group. I don’t want to miss any discussion! Should I make a request to the group: Can we agree to keep our conversation A group one so I don’t miss any of your stories? Or should I try to guide the side talker back to the group? Unfortunately, the most active side talker likes to pigeon hole my husband and seems oblivious to his constant chatter.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: That irritates me too. I don't think there's much you can do about it, though. You can certainly try to make your request to the group -- especially if you have, say, a hearing or focus impairment that makes following it all extra challenging -- but what if some group members dislike group talk and prefer 1 x 1?

The person being split off is the one who has the reins, and can say to the one trying to divert them off to a side comversation, "Hang on, I'm following this [main group] story." So, I say make a strong appeal to your husband.

Talking with kids about mentally ill dad after divorce
Guest May 16, 2:15 p.m.
QUESTION: I have been divorced from my spouse for just over a year now and share custody with my ex. We have two teenagers - one in middle school and one in high school. Dad has significant mental illness, leading to paranoid, strange, and manic behavior both in public and private. I don't think they're in physical danger, but I'm struggling to talk to them about his mental illness; in addition to a non-disparagement clause in our divorce, I am worried I will push them away, or worse, that they would repeat what I said back to him and he would take it out on me through the kids. I'm not looking for advice on custody (I have been assured that my 5 day (to his two-day) is really the most I'll be able to get), but rather how to talk to the kids about dad's significant impairments and erratic behavior. One kid is becoming increasingly anxious and distressed, alternating between fighting with his dad and saying he wants to live with him full-time. I've tried getting the kids into therapy, but they have seen multiple therapists without opening up, and I worry my ex has warned them not to talk about him to others. I've been dealing by being as neutral as possible, never mentioning mental illness and just giving them a lot of my own emotional support, but I'm worried I'm not giving them the language to describe what is very clearly in front of them, which feels like a conspiracy of silence, and I worry I'm failing to give them the tools they need to safeguard their own well-being. Help!

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Maybe instead of therapy-therapy, look into the programs offered by NAMI for families of people with mental illness? I know Family-to-Family is one of their more popular ones, but not sure if that's the age you need. Still -- the emphasis on education vs counseling might get at the problem from a more effective angle.

A Married Sib Picks Estrangement - the OTHER Side
Guest May 16, 2:16 p.m.
QUESTION: Here's the flipside to a sibling distancing themselves from their FOO, and, no, it doesn't involve abuse or control issues. (I'm tired of your fans and columns jumping to abuse.)

I'm the youngest in my family, and I didn't have the best childhood because of it. For most of my life, my family always considered me an afterthought. The four older kids made all the decisions about vacation spots, restaurants, movies, etc. My mom was the only family member to show up to my events when she remembered. My dad cannot remember my birthday, and none of my siblings know how old I am. (They subtract at least ten years.)

By the time I was a teenager, I found my family of choice, my best friend's family. From then on, I adapted that way, and no one in my immediate family ever noticed my emotional distance and frequent absences...until I got married. My husband (the oldest in his family) was pretty horrified at the second class citizen treatment we both received because the favoritism extended to my choice of spouse and our kids. My in-laws, however, welcomed me in a way I'd never experienced from family so we don't spend as much time with my family.

But ever since my husband came on the scene, my family decided he is "abusive" and keeps me from contacting my family. They have severe amnesia of all the times I complained about being ignored and the emotional distance in the previous 20 years. I'm not sure why my husband's presence has changed their outlook, but they're convinced his behavior, not their behavior, is the reason I don't come around anymore.

My family doesn't believe me just like all the other times they didn't believe me when I expressed my feelings to them. That's the other side.

Credit card fraud again

QUESTION: Hi Carolyn. I wrote in last week because my husband's best friend's wife took out a credit card in her husband's name, maxed it out, can't pay and asked my husband to loan her money. My husband knows he should tell his friend but can't get up the confrontational courage to tell his best friend his wife committed fraud and will ruin his credit.

Elementary Teacher PLEADING with caregivers: A PSA
Guest May 17, 10:49 a.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,
Please let me advocate for caregivers to refrain from giving children phones until the end of middle school at the earliest.
I work in a small mid-westerrn town teaching 4th grade. Many of the students in my class have smart phones, smart watches, and unlimited access to the internet. On top of this, parents allow students to have phones whenever they want, so kids come to school having stayed up until after midnight on their phones (or gaming systems). One parent told me she couldn't control her 9 year olds phone usage because they have different phones, thus different operating systems! Others tell me the kids have phones so parents can have peace of mind of knowing where they are all time time (emotionally unhealthy for other reasons, but I have a soapbox for that too), in case the bus breaks down, in case they feel sick at school, in case we're on a field trip and something happens, etc. I realize there may be a very, very slight chance a child would need to get in touch with a parent because of an extreme situation at school, but even then there are overlapping systems in place to keep parents informed. Teachers spend precious hours in PD reviewing, updating, and practicing how to contact parents in many different scenarios.
Caregivers, please, please, please consider: the positive benefit of your child having a phone is so small compared to the negative impact of your child having this device on physical, social, emotional, and psychological well-being.
If you insist your child have a phone, please please, please consider the following: strict parental control through the device's system and through your authority as the parent; give your child an emergency only flip phone; set limits and enforce them.
Each year, the age of students with smart devices gets lower and lower. There are many research studies showing the negative influence these have on child development.

Thank you Carolyn for all the good work you do and for all the Nuts who contribute to making this chat a success.

Guest May 9, 11:06 a.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,

In February, my partner started cheating on me. I found out in March and immediately ended the relationship. He was upset about getting caught, but not deeply remorseful, and the woman he cheated with is still in his life and in his phone (though I don't think they are going to get together).

A week after breaking up with him and blocking his number, I found out that I was pregnant. This was not exactly planned but it was also not UNplanned. I am 36 and we pulled the goalie a while ago, feeling some time pressure. Our thinking was that we would get married soon regardless, sooner if I happened to get pregnant.

I contacted him to tell him that I'm pregnant. He asked if I want to get back together, which I considered, but the answer is no. The trust is gone. Then he asked if I want to end the pregnancy, and the answer is absolutely no. I am 17 weeks now and so attached to this baby.

My ex-partner is very upset, because he wanted to be a father and wants to be involved. I shared ultrasound photos with him, but then he was upset because I didn't invite him to the appointment. He has called, crying, to ask if he can come over and rub my belly (he swears this is all he wants). I do not want to be touched by him because I'm too angry, but I can't decide whether this is unfair.

We will co-parent in some way (we have set up counseling to start planning for it), but do I have to involve him in the pregnancy too? It has turned out to be a much more tender and vulnerable experience than I had expected, and I wanted to share that with him but not under these circumstances.

ANSWER: This is an unusually intimate heartbreak, I am so sorry.

I am sorry specifically that he made such a needy and clueless ask of you. I mean. No! Okay? No. Talk about a forfeited right. It's time for him to help *you* feel better, not the other way around.

I think he needs to hear this. That having broken it, he might consider thinking how to fix it -- instead of coming to you and expecting you, the person he just devastated and is now trying to handle her own pain, to take on his pain and make it all better, too.

Plus: You are going to be partners in raising this child, and you are going to have to find ways to get along, and that is going to require levels of forgiveness you never knew you had in you -- and that might be true even if there were no cheating involved! parenting is like that -- but tender-sweet-vulnerable access to your body is something to put way down on the access list right now. If it ever makes the list again.

So to answer your specific question: Your body is the one going through so much physically and emotionally, the latter of which he's responsible for, so you can decide, without being "unfair," what lines you don't want him to cross. You just can.

If you ever eventually want to give him some access to the experience of the pregnancy, as your anger recedes, or as something you decide will be better for the child and their bond, or because you believe you might regret your hard line later (just offering these, not endorsing any of them) -- then here's a way to think about it.

First, decide on your terms, not in answer to tears.

Second, think what is about you and what is about the baby. For example: Most incremental OB appointments are about your health, so, nope. If there's an ultrasound scheduled later on to measure fetal growth, then (quietly) keep an open mind about letting him be there for that.

You've got counseling coming. It's okay just to say no now and decide to decide later. "I have a lot of anger yet to process, pressuring me on top of that is not okay."

(Plus a 17-week belly is kind of just a belly. But that's beside all the points.)

Congrats on the baby and good luck through the extensive deep breathing process ahead.

So much advice
Guest May 9, 11:27 a.m.
QUESTION: My husband and I are the parents of two teens, who are generally sensible kids who share their lives pretty freely with us. In the past year, my husband started seizing on every opportunity to advise them about whatever subject the kids mentioned. It’s to the point where the kids can’t mention anything without being talked at for ten minutes by their dad. The kids zone out, exchange looks with one another and have also said (to my husband) that they feel condescended to and sometimes they’re just venting. I know my husband feels the inevitable, and normal, drift as the kids grow independent and he’s trying to be superdad in these last daily opportunities to parent. I’ve said as much to him and said I get his instinct to parent more but we need to back off and let the kids heed their own judgment before we jump in. My husband got very angry and accused me of “shirking” my duty as a parent and said the kids will get his advice as long as he’s alive (he’s perfectly healthy) and he owes them his “wisdom.” It was out of character and bizarre. I tried to raise it again weeks later and he took the same angry stance. The kids now avoid him as much as possible so they don’t constantly hear about what they “should” do or have done.. What can I do?

ANSWER: Ironic, isn't it. He's living proof that advice is pointless when people don't want to hear it.

I'll just assume he won't appreciate it if you put it to him that way -- unless you know how to disarm him, or catch him at a particularly receptive moment.

Once you're dealing with someone so dug in as to be angry-reactive upon approach, questions and generalized concern are often a better entry point: "You okay?" Maybe a long walk, too, away from the kids. This is oddly specific, but there are reasons for that: A literal change of secenery from the source of stress is helpful to clarity of thought. Also helpful, physical activity. Movement can jar our deeper, scarier thoughts loose from their embedded places. Walking in particular, if we're able, has this power. Also, when people are facing forward, vs facing each other, they often find it easier to talk about difficult things (why cars can be such a great place for kids to unburden).

So, you have a partner who clearly is knotted up over some stuff and acting out. And not only is the path he's taking unproductive, but it's also directly undermining his own started purpose. He's pushing his kids away and they're tuning him out on contact.

This is something you might, might be able to point out to him eventually. If he does start talking a bit about this anxiety he's feeling, no doubt about the passage of time, about the kids' futures, about his own relevance -- then you can be supportive and sympathetic. The timing is pretty typical for a parent to go through a lecturing spasm.

But ideally he won't need you to point it out, because once someone gets to the point of admitting this stuff out loud, it's often self-correcting. Just saying it can reduce the anxiety dramatically. Then: "So I just need to shut up and trust that I've already shared whatever wisdom I have, and it's up to them to ask me or figure out how to use it."

Maybe way too optimistic. But keeping it in your mind as an anxiety response and dealing with him accordingly might get you there.

And the occasional: "My duty as a parent is also to recognize when something isn't working -- and if they're pushing me away, then I need to adjust my approach."

This is all Part 1. Part 2 is for your husband to talk to someone, about the anxiety and anger, if he is completely inflexible. (Or you do, if he's inflexible on that.)

Credit card fraud?
Guest May 9, 11:38 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,
I'm writing on behalf of my husband with his knowledge. His best friend's wife recently called him asking for a loan. Apparently she has a history of poor financial management, took out a credit card in her husband's name (how?) and maxed out the card. She called my husband asking for money to pay the company. Even worse, her intentions is not to pay right away and make a deal with the company for a lower amount. My husband is ducking her calls. I told him he must confront her, tell her if she doesn't come clean to her husband, he'll have to tell his best friend himself. She has put my husband in a terrible place: keep a secret from his best friend (unacceptable )which could ruin the poor guy's credit or blow up a marriage. Any advise to me, the advisor?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: If this were my friend's spouse calling me for the loan, then I would go straight to my friend with this information. Meaning, I would not apply the usual, "You have 24 hours to tell my friend the truth or I will tell," here. Here's why:

I already know I can't trust the spouse (fraud), and there's room for plenty more damage in those 24 hours. So I tip my friend off asap. And I give my friend the info for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. And the name of a good lawyer, if I know of one.

Any damage to the friend's credit or marriage already falls squarely on the shoulders of the spouse.

If there is damage to my friendship for doing this, then I will own that. A fair risk for doing what's right for my friend.

My advice to you, the advisor, is decide whether you agree with that hypothetical, and counsel your husband accordingly.

Update from Wedding Mom
Guest May 9, 11:43 a.m.
QUESTION: I talked to my daughter and we came up with a list of priorities/compromises. I offered to work on the flowers since I'm a landscape architect and my daughter loved that idea. I thought we could go for local/native flowers but my daughter wants something more traditional and formal so that's what we'll do. It's also very important to her that I have an escort for the wedding so I talked to my boyfriend and even though it's not his kind of scene he promised to show. Lastly she asked me not to show up "dressed like Mrs Maisel" but I pushed back on that since I've being wearing vintage since she was born. In other words, we're getting there

Guest May 9, 11:52 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,
In December I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Fortunately it was caught early, is highly treatable and my prognosis is excellent. Understandably (I hope) during this time sex has been a low priority. There has been the emotional uncertainty before I knew everything I knew now, batteries of tests, and most recently surgery and radiation. About six weeks ago, when looking for one of my own medications, I accidentally discovered that my husband had a prescription for 20 mg of Cialis, with the specification that they be used one hour before sexual activity (i.e. they are the daily use ones). At the time, I just could not deal with what this likely means -- I had just had surgery, and so I didn't say anything. Since my "discovery" five pills have been used (but we have not been sexually active). There's no other plausible explanation, right? My daughter (his step daughter) is getting married in June and I don't want any drama, but eventually I have to have this conversation. Our finances are separate, but if I am to leave, what else should I be doing before having this conversation.

ANSWER: Take heart: When this nightmare is behind you, you will know exactly how much crap you have the strength to get through.

Whoo.

The "what else should I be doing" question is for a lawyer. So that's my advice, find yourself a good one and have a talk. If you want a steady source of confidential emotional support, then line up a therapist, too.

The generosity you are showing your daughter is lovely, I just want to acknowledge that.

SIL blocked me
Guest May 9, 12:13 p.m.
QUESTION: My brother has been married for 33 years to “Lynn”. In those years, she built a wall between him and his family. She has held grudges and has never tried to get to know his family. She once accused me of trying to steal their tent I borrowed because my brother wouldn’t make plans to meet so I could return it. When our mother died, my brother didn’t come to the funeral because she refused to come. I recently discovered that my SIL has been blocking me on social media. I don’t know what I did to upset her, but it makes me sad that I am missing out on my brother’s life, my nephew’s life, and my SIL’s life, and I will never know why or if there is anything I can do to change it.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm sorry. This is mostly a brother problem. Lynn is the source, but he is the one who could have said this level of control and division was not okay, and instead he chose to go along with it. Who knows whether marrying her was part of his decision to separate from his family, or if the estrangement was an unintended consequence of being with her. It's a known phenomenon, though, for people who want some emotional separation (for whatever reason) but lack the strength to follow through, to find a partner who does the dirty work for them. If that's the case with your brother, then there really is very little you can do.

Either way, whether this was his choice or a slow-motion accident, all you have to counteract the distance between you is consistent, non-obnoxious effort to stay in touch -- with him, with her, with them. However you can manage it, in good faith, with as much patience as you can muster.

That may sound awful and self-erasing, but the alternative is to give up. Because that's the only one she has left you.

Her blocking you on social media is a sad thing and does cut you off from the feed of their news, but it really is just the last superficial tie. You are "missing out on my brother’s life, my nephew’s life, and my SIL’s life" already if you are not involved in it. So, focus on that -- in what ways are you still able to be involved? And try to get the most out of those.

Response to sister’s concerns!
Guest May 9, 12:15 p.m.
QUESTION: My sister is going down a rabbit hole about her 4 year old’s health. He has some eczema issues and she has started banning all sorts of food and products with certain chemicals in an attempt to solve the problem. I’m a child of the 80s where we ate and played with anything and everything so it’s hard for me to understand this level of anxiety. I obviously want to validate her feelings and be supportive. Are there any generic statements that I can make, even though I don’t fully understand or even agree with?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: The first thing you can do is not equate your sister's parenting experience with your 1980s childhood. That's basically saying it's her fault for being a headcase, instead of recognizing she has to work with too many different variables to count.

I mean -- do you know for sure her child isn't reacting to a food additive? Even the word "anxiety" comes with judgment attached.

I'm from Planet 80s, too, so I get where you're coming from. But that cred didn't make, say, my kids' reactions to scented laundry products any more real. Some products and exposures are just different now from 40 or 50 years ago.

The best thing you can do for your sister is "fully understand" that, as much as humans don't fundamentally change from generation to generation, the conditions parents have to deal with can change a lot. Just the exposure to information is an enormous change. My older sisters got their parenting advice from other people, TV, radio, print. Just the 10 year gap means I started to get mine from email and online, and socials by the end. Another 10 years and parents are saturated with so much information, misinformation and disinformation that the ones who aren't anxious might be the outliers.

So maybe commit to not judging her, understand what you don't understand, know it's not your place to "agree" unless you're a stakeholder in possession of all the relevant information, and ask if there's anything you can do to help.

Auntie Smaug and the Necklace
Guest May 9, 12:21 p.m.
QUESTION: Re: Tuesday's column, I'm OP. The wedding went great! I did invite the aunt (not worth the drama). She's always been a peach and would've reacted very poorly to being called out. I wrote the letter, tore it up, and moved on. My maid of honor was on high alert for bad behavior the day of, but thankfully all went well.

The ring was my paternal (step)grandfather's - aunt's biological dad - and all the siblings received a piece of the reformed jewelry, as agreed between them. Mom gave it to me with my dad's blessing. I'm not sure what her claim to ownership of my dad's portion was, but I don't much care anymore.

My dad and I walked down the aisle to the same music my mother did, and I wore that gift from her proudly.

RE: Tell it to me straight
Guest May 9, 12:29 p.m.
QUESTION: I agree that the circumstantial evidence doesn't look good for your husband. But in the spirit of acknowledging the burdens of caregivers, I have to wonder whether there might be a more compassionate explanation. It seems plausible to me that he might be freaking out about your diagnosis in his own way, and keeping it secret in order to conceal the burden from you -- and also because of his own guilt and shame. Obviously you may not have the energy to help manage his fear, but you should at least encourage him to get some kind of support -- if not necessarily the support you fear he's choosing. If he is otherwise a good and loving husband, and a compassionate caregiver, then it's essential to talk to him about it. There are a lot of missing details here, and you might be surprised by what you might learn -- and what you can forgive. By all means, talk to a lawyer and prepare for the worst -- but don't assume the worst until you can confirm it with him. Good luck.

So Much advice- here's just a little more (sorry)
Guest May 9, 12:35 p.m.
QUESTION: Maybe this will help enlighten your husband- what he's doing is very counterproductive. Teenagers live in the same world we do. They know about the bad stuff, and they probably know more about how it plays out in their own personal corners of the universe than you or your husband ever will. Yes, they are impulsive and emotional compared to adults, and they aren't always great at calculating risk. But what helps them is to have an adult they can reach out to, without fear of judgment or harm, who will meet them where they are when they have a problem. This is the opposite of what your husband is doing. Yes, we venerate the image of the family patriarch imparting wisdom to their children (ideally at a hardwood table or under a tree), but... that doesn't mean that lectures actually help kids. Right now your kids know that if they have problems, find someone other than dad to talk with about them.

Doesn't everyone deserve a second chance?
Guest May 9, 12:55 p.m.
QUESTION: I had some set-backs (a break-up which left me homeless combined with job loss) that were a wake-up call for me. I deserved all of it because I cheated on my boyfriend who was supporting me and had gotten me a job with his family’s company. After a lot of therapy, I came to realize that I had coasted through my 20s taking advantage of various people. I intend to change my life for the better and so I took a new job that pays much less but one I am qualified for. My brother and SiL were nice enough to rent me a room in their house which is very close to work. That's important because the only car I can afford is not very reliable.
In the past I was snarky and judgmental about my SiL for superficial reasons and she knew it so our relationship is strained. As part of my new life I’m trying to mend fences so I’ve apologized and tried to befriend my SiL. She blew me off, saying that I’m only trying to “make nice” now that I need her and to forget it. My brother accepted my apology and we’ve become close again but he takes his wife side in this so whenever she is around her animosity makes things difficult. Do I just accept this is how it’s going to be while I’m living here? I wish she’d give me another chance, I know she doesn’t owe me that but her cold shoulder is really wearing on me. Should I try again to explain myself or am I just going to have to live with this until I can save up enough money to move out?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I don't think explaining yourself is the way to go. You have already explained, and SIL didn't buy it.

Instead I suggest saying to SIL that you can see why she didn't buy it. For example:

"You have every reason not to believe my apology is sincere. I spent the last [number] years taking whatever I wanted from people and not caring about how I treated them. I also wasn't kind to you. If I were you, then I wouldn't believe me, either."

I mean, would you believe you? Be honest.

Your brother probably did because he's your brother. He either wants to believe you, or he's better at reading you, so he has more than your word to go on.

After you say this to your SIL, then say: "I am grateful you are letting me stay here, even though you don't believe me. I hope time will let me prove to you that I mean it. I created this mess, so it's on me to clean it up."

Then don't try to "befriend" your SIL. Be an excellent tenant, helper, guest, sibling and general citizen. That's how you live down past mistakes.

Can’t make anyone feel
Guest May 9, 1:25 p.m.
QUESTION: I’ve heard this- you don’t have control over anyone’s feelings. Okay, makes sense. But is the reserve true- that you are not accountable to anyone’s feelings? So if I tell someone “you are making me feel sad” is this wrong? Isn’t there some accountability for affecting people’s feelings? I may have been talking to someone else who misinterpreted this. I just want some clarity.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Well ... as manipulators across time have always understood, there's a lot we can do to control other people's feelings.

What you're getting at is where the lines of reponsibility go. It's a really good concept to have down, because it's what differentiates healthy relationships from unhealthy ones.

Each of us is responsible for what we choose to do. That includes taking into account its possible effect on others.

But that doesn't mean anything I do that hurts someone else is wrong. I don't have to make plans with someone I don't like, for example, just because saying no would hurt them. My time is my responsibility, not theirs.

If instead I did something hurtful just to hurt, like ... I broke something of theirs out of spite, then their hard feelings would totally be my fault.

So to take your example, "You are making me feel sad." It depends on the context, but in general, it's okay to tell someone when you are feeling sad in response to their actions toward you. "When you say these things to me, I feel really sad." Even if it's not something they're doing to you, it's okay. Like if someone moves away: "I'm sad we don't see each other anymore."

But that doesn't translate into another person's responsibility to make you un-sad. You hope the person will stop saying the things to you -- but if they don't, then it's up to you to do what you need to protect yourself from that person.

I'm taking forever on this, explaining it through examples. In any situation, though, you can reason it out by tracing the baseline responsibility. Whose choice it is, whose business it is, whose time it is, who has the last word. When you're trying to get other people to make you feel better, or trying to manipulate how others feel for your own advantage, then you're crossing lines.

Rub her belly???
Guest May 9, 1:29 p.m.
QUESTION: The request by the cheating ex to rub her belly (!!!) made my jaw drop. It is so creepy. Accompanied by the unsolicited reassurances that "this is all he wants," my "yikes" alarms went off. This guy has major boundary issues. Keep your lines right where they are, LW. The fact that the LW is even asking if it is "fair" to say no to such a gross request suggests that there may have been some conditioning/manipulation going on during their relationship. LW, are there other ways this guy has twisted things to make you worry your boundaries are unfair? Make sure solo counseling for you is in the mix as you navigate this. The ex's attitude of being sorry he got caught but not sorry for lying and cheating is another red flag here. Stay militantly on your own side and on your baby's side against boundary pushing and line blurring. And thank stars you got out, as crappy as the wakeup call had to be.

How do I talk about separating?
Guest May 9, 1:34 p.m.
QUESTION: How do I start a conversation about separating with my partner? We've tried multiple therapists for multiple years, and I don't have the energy to keep working. The straw that broke the camels back was during therapy, when the therapist said to my partner: "Your partner [me] is looking at you lovingly." And I thought to myself "I don't feel that. I'm not feeling love for this person and I don't know how to get that feeling back."
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You start telling the truth in therapy. That is what you are there for.

It sounds as if you kept your thought to yourself?

I realize that's a brutal one. But you're there, and it's time for your partner to hear it.

Or how about this, and you don't wait for the next session: "We've tried multiple therapists for multiple years, and I don't have the energy to keep working. I would like to separate."

Often saying it is the tallest obstacle.

Other times she instantly attacks if you even come close, despite her apparent pose for one. The point is, the person wanting to give the belly rub is NEVER the one to decide if it's OK.

In this situation I would be all extended claws and teeth. Don't give in to his manipulation.

RE Response to sister’s concerns!
Guest May 9, 1:36 p.m.
QUESTION: As the parent of two kids with eczema, I would like to point out that what your sister is doing (banning certain chemicals and additive) is pretty standard advice that all dermatologists have recommended. It's definitely not a rabbit hole!!
Also, severe eczema untreated can lead to bacterial infection (my kids have had them because they were scratching themselves), so anything you can do to proactively manage it really makes a big difference.

Summer with Nephew...
Guest May 2, 11:03 a.m.
QUESTION: My sister (single mom if that matters) is having a challenging time with her 15yo son and asked if he can spend 8 weeks with us this summer for "change of pace." We have two teenage daughters and they are excited at the prospect of his coming. My husband and I asked to talk about expectations - contribution to household chores, cleaning up after one's self in the kitchen, do own laundry, and he needs a job or volunteer thing or participate in a sport. We have these expectations of our own kids. Nothing different. He's not welcome to scroll through social media for 8 weeks on our couch. My sister was indignant saying that of course her son would help out and of course he'd clean up after himself and that we are expecting the worse in her son and if we aren't going to support them, then why even bother? I really want to provide her a break and her son an opportunity to be some place new, but I know myself and I don't do well with kids just laying about all summer. I also know my nephew right now is disrespectful to my sister leaving messes all over the house, routinely skipping school, and doesn't contribute to the household at all. Our girls work at our local pool and we can probably get nephew the check-in desk job for a few hours a week and maybe a local rec summer baseball team could take him on, but it all requires planning. Ideas for how to re-engage my sister again? - so that she can hear we are trying to support her and our nephew but not at the expense of our sanity?

ANSWER: You've said what you need to say about your rules. If you mean to follow through with hosting your nephew, then this is one of those things best not over-talked. Say to her that you weren't "expecting the worst" -- or the best! -- or expecting anything. You were just spelling out *your* expectations to preempt any misunderstandings. Your basic abundance of caution. So now if he and she are on board, great, then you'll start the arrangements, "let me know."

The more you say, the more you validate the idea that you're worried about him and the the deeper you dig the hole.

Dog with cancer
Guest May 2, 11:18 a.m.
QUESTION: I read last week’s chat after the fact, but I feel compelled to comment on the person whose dog has cancer and the vet bills are pushing them to the brink. A lot of people suggested ways to pay for the dog’s care. If the OP can find a way to do that that doesn’t cause them irreparable financial harm, great. But I’d also like to give the family permission to say a kind, humane goodbye if they need to, without guilt. For every “my dog was cured and lived to 16!” story I’ve heard, I’ve heard three “we went into debt and got 3 not-great months and watched the dog suffer” stories. I have said goodbye to many, many dogs in my life—some when they were way too young to die. All of them were gut-wrenching and I sobbed for days, sometimes weeks. But every dog who has left me has also opened the door for another dog to come into my life. And that new dog helps to heal me, and because I always get rescues, I hope I’m helping to heal them, too.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yes, thanks for bringing this back up. I meant to get back to it but got chat tired and never finished the thought. It is a completely defensible position -- for the family and the animal, not just the finances -- to choose not to subject a pet to extensive medical intervention in the face of a dire prognosis.

We decided upfront for our pets, for example, that for a cancer, we'd do surgery if that was an option but not a bunch of cycles of chemo, because making a dog sick over and over without being able to explain what it is and why was not something we had the stomach to do. Other pet parents and their vets might go a different way for different reasons, no judgment, but that was a part of our pre-adoption conversation.

Dogs and cats have short lives relative to humans, too, so it's fair to factor that into the calculation of suffering in treatment for lifespan gained.

The more comfortable we get with having conversations like this toward humane and compassionate outcomes, the better, IMO -- about pets and people. Thanks again.

My daughter wants me to be more excited about her wedding
Guest May 2, 11:24 a.m.
QUESTION: I accidentally hurt my daughter’s (“Lisa”) feelings and I want to make amends. Lisa is 24 and just got engaged. Personally, I think she’s a little young to settle down but since I had her at 21, I’m not one to talk. And I like her fiance, “John” a lot and do think they’re a great couple so it’s all good. On Easter Sunday Lisa announced to the whole family that she and John were getting married in 2026 and told the story of the elaborate proposal he’d arranged. Later my sister asked me why I wasn’t more surprised and emotional and I said that they’d been discussing marriage for months and ring shopping so there was nothing surprising about it. Lisa later told me she was devastated that I down-played the very romantic proposal John had arranged for her and wished she had a “normal” mom who would be as excited as she was. I apologized but Lisa still seemed upset. Last night we talked it out and she asked me to be excited about her wedding and behave like a “real” mother-of-the bride. It’s true that I’m pretty laid back about these sorts of things, probably because I’ve never been married or even interested in getting married. I love Lisa so much and am sorry she thinks I carped on her big announcement. I'm giving them almost half the money they need for the wedding but otherwise I’m not sure I can fake an 18-month interest in wedding details. What should I do?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I think this is a fascinating question.

Which means Lisa would probably wish I would behave like a "real" advice columnist and tell you to rally around your daughter.

Which of course I do advise, but you're only going to be able to do this well, credibly, in a way that is true. And while there's always some Lycra in that -- we can always find something new to learn about others and ourselves -- you're still you and you're never going to thrill at the idea of mother-daughter facials. (Or are you? Who knows.)

So I think the first thing you have to do is go back to Lisa to say you love her, genuinely 100 percent are there for her, and 100 percent want what is best for her in life. And you think John is great and great for her. Say you never want her questioning these things. [This is where you wait for her to nod or something.]

Then you point out that you can only be who you are. Which means if she wants a mother who is genuinely swept up in a lot of the wedding details, then you are going to disappoint her -- possibly many times over by the time the I-dos are all-dones. Which is exactly the last thing you want to do!! Truly. Tell her it breaks your heart that you let her down already. [Pause again for evidence of daughterly absorption.]

Then the message: So here is what you are proposing:

You will love her and love how excited she is about this and pay amply for it and, where it counts most, rally to be the mom she wishes you were.

And in return, you will ask her to behold you, the mother-of-the-bride she actually has, and find it in her heart to see you as "real."

(Also maybe note that if she zeroes in on a few top priorities for her Real Mother of the Bride to rally for, then this will set you up for success.)

Security person here on Tracking Stalker
Guest May 2, 11:38 a.m.
QUESTION: 1. OP should do a thorough review of all their computers and devices to ensure that THEIR devices haven't been compromised in some way.
2. They should also change all their passwords, ensure multifactor authentication is on for their email and all accounts possible.
3. They should also review the privacy settings and connections on social media to ensure their information isn't publicly available and isn't leaking to the tracking stalker through a shared connection.
4. They should document this most recent encounter.
5. If there is any further contact they should clearly tell the tracking stalker clearly and simply that the stalker's contact is not welcome or wanted and they are to stop making contact. That encounter should also be documented.
6. If the stalker continues to contact the OP, they should document it regularly, contact the police and look at other physical security measures like self-defense courses.

They boyfriend can/should do all this too but at this point the OP's focus needs to be on themselves and the tracking stalker is after them as well.

Take this seriously, read De Becker's Gift of Fear, take action. Do hesitate. Do not rely on "orders of protection". Assume this person is armed, dangerous, unpredictable and will take violent action.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: This is in reference to last week's chat. I saw it only on a trip through the outtakes. I was not as concerned about the possibility of other access because OP mentioned the ex had access to the date's text messages, ergo the phone number. However, 1-2 is just good hygiene anyway, 3-4 is sensible after a weird encounter, and 5-6 apply to anyone who crosses a line more than once. I'm happy to post it.

Preemptive comment: A lot of people respond by seeing these as overreactions, but if you read carefully it's preparing, assuming, reading, documenting. I.e. not being the one who is surprised if it's the rare worst case.
Carolyn Hax chat: We were on a date. And then his estranged wife showed up.

Mental Load Backfire
Guest May 2, 11:50 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, I wrote a question about this to you a couple of months ago when it first erupted, but I don't think it ever ran. I'll try to summarize the background as quickly as possible to get to the awful new update.

Background: Husband and I both work full time, but I usually do 99% of the administrative stuff for my household, like lots of moms. Summer camp/activity planning has always been my domain until last year, when I got super fed up with it and my husband agreed to take it on for 2025. He disregarded all of my tips about timing, ignored the emails I forwarded with the kids' favorite places and their deadlines, and we ended up with 0 weeks scheduled for each one (later updated to 2 weeks of a crappy backup place that my husband's brother recommended). My husband knew he blew it and agreed that he would be in charge of keeping the kids occupied during 75% of work hours over the summer (I agreed to cover the rest). The kids, to provide all needed info, are 9 and 7. They can play together for a while but do need supervision and need help with food. Not the most fun summer for them, but doable because we both telework.

Okay that brings us to now. My husband's work abruptly called everybody back into the office effective June 1. I still telework. This means that even though we had agreed my husband would take on the primary responsibility for the kids, it's actually ALL GOING TO FALL TO ME. Our family focus right now is on my husband's frustration about the big change at work, but I am quietly seething with rage because I would have just booked the camps myself if I had known I would spend all summer being interrupted for snacks and noises. I am so mad I can hardly start thinking my way to solutions. Is there anything I can do to salvage the fairness of the arrangement?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ooh, I remember this one -- it was in my queue to answer but I never got to it. And I have to tell you, just reading it gave me a somatic stress response. Then and now, with the update.

It's not just the camp fail. It's the underreaction to the fail and what it means. Saying the equivalent of, "My bad, I'll be in charge of keeping the kids occupied 75 percent," is not enough.

This, to me, is what enough would have looked like:

"You were trying to make a point by handing this to me, not only that you are overwhelmed but that I completely take it for granted that you will handle all the intricate details of our family's management. You do it seamlessly and I just let you.

"So the one time you make it clear you've had enough, you hand one responsibility over to me -- and not only that, you spoon feed it to me, with all the instructions and warnings and necessary links and emails and secret codes. And what do I do?

"I totally ignore it. And trash our kids' summer -- and yours -- because I can't be even minimally arsed.

"So. Obviously I am on the hook for their care this summer. That goes without saying. It will be only to the extent I can, of course, with my job, and I will need your help, but I will be the Mental Load Boss of their care. That's what I'm saying. This summer and ever after too. Because I get it now.

"More important, though, I am telling you -- I get it now. I have been a complete barnacle on this ship that you have been running singlehandedly for years. And there is no excuse for that. That injustice ends now."

Right?

So the fact that your household is now focused on his RTO feelings and not on your "enjoy getting that 75 percent child-care back!" feelings, and your rage is "quiet-seethe," is proof there's a way bigger problem than his biffing camp deadlines.

Fairness can be salvaged only if he can grasp fairness. Can he? Can he? (Said like Cam in "Modern Family.")

BTW -- if any camps are available still, at outrageous late signup cost, then perhaps there's something of his he can give up to finance them. That too would be fair.

Summer nephew
Guest May 2, 11:57 a.m.
QUESTION: At that age, nephew should be included in conversations about expectations, not just his mom/OP's sister. He might not want to stay at aunt/uncle/cousins home. And forcing a teen to spend the summer away from home when he doesn't want to, that's not going to help whatever "having a hard time" is about.
Also, OP might rethink the job thing. Certainly, chores around the house. But depending on what "having a hard time" has been, this might be a chance for nephew to decompress and have a [mostly] unencumbered time to get his well-being together. I was the same as OP - insisting my kids have a "productive" summer vacation. My pushiness got me a kid in the hospital because I missed that they needed to decompress. Just my 2 cents.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Well spent, thanks. The "include the nephew" part is the real value, because the job could be the best thing or the worst, depending. Maybe he needs to have a reponsibility -- or be relieved of any for a bit. It's hard for us to say what his stressors are.

I will note the job the OP referred to was quite small, "few hours" I think?

For the summer of nephew
Guest May 2, 12:04 p.m.
QUESTION: Not that you asked, but a good thing to do is also discuss with your spouse what plans *YOU* both have if those expectations are not met with your nephew. We had an exchange student that repeatedly failed to meet basic expectations of cleanliness and I thought I was prepared, but honestly, we didn't have anything to back up those expectations. Will you send your nephew home early? Will there be other consequences? It's good to chat.

I don't want my friends to go to ex's wedding
Guest May 2, 12:05 p.m.
QUESTION: My ex is getting married this summer. I know this because we have a number of shared friends, though I am closer to them than he is. (He is a very social person with a wide field of shallow friendships.) We were together for seven years spanning our late twenties and early thirties, and our breakup (2022) was lifechanging for me, a truly awful experience. A couple of friends have asked whether I am comfortable with them going to his wedding (they don't otherwise see or talk to him very often, but he apparently invited every person he's ever met). I know the right answer is to say of course they can go, continue to live my own life and worry less in general about what's going on in his, but I actually feel very sad, mad, and anxious about it. It's not ok for me to say no, is it?

Summer with Nephew
Guest May 2, 12:14 p.m.
QUESTION: I wanted to reply to the letter about the summer with the nephew. In my experience, kids treat their own parents worse than they treat other people. We had a nephew stay with us when his parents were at the end of their rope with him, and he was like a different kid - polite, helpful and happy to be there. And he has great parents - he was just at that age where they were butting heads! Assuming he wants to come and isn't forced to, I think you just talk to him about how things run at your house and tell him you thought it would be fun to work a few hours at the pool with your daughters as a way to be around people and make some spending money. I think if you engage with him instead of your sister, you'll be surprised at how well it goes. Fingers crossed for a great summer!

For not wanting friends to go to ex's wedding
Guest May 2, 12:22 p.m.
QUESTION: We asked our sibling if they were OK if we did the same thing (attend their ex's wedding) - sibling wasn't even married to ex. Just boyfriend/girlfriend in separate residences for 3 yrs. Sibling said "Sure, it's not my preference, but I can't stop you and I think I'll be OK afterwards". Sibling was definitely NOT ok. That was the catalyst for 2 major family eruptions and now we haven't spoken in 15 years, and all of it traces back to us attending that wedding WITH sibling's knowledge and "permission". Don't be that person. If you say you are OK with them going (which in all honesty IS the only right answer, you don't get to tell them what to do with their lives) then mean it. You cannot hold it over their heads after the fact.

excited daughter, mom not so much
Guest May 2, 12:22 p.m.
QUESTION: I was that mom as well. Although happy for her and her choice of life partner, I didn't jump up and down and do cartwheels--that's just not me. And then my kid took exception to everything I said or did, even slight facial movements or tone of my voice she deemed something negative when she was planning her wedding. So I stayed neutral and in the background, and when asked for my opinion would give it, but not otherwise. Husband and I decided to give them a gift of cash they could use whatever way they chose (wedding, trip, whatever), and I would stay the heck out of my daughter's way. And darn it if that didn't work out just fine for all of us. Weddings can have weird effects on people. Deep breaths and it's their upset, not yours.

Help, I need to fire my parents
Guest May 2, 12:33 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,

We've had terrible luck with daycares and ended up without coverage for my 20-month-old daughter, so I was thrilled when my parents agreed to care for her during the workday. They are actually not quite retired, but they each only work part-time and completely from home, so they made the case that they could alternate shifts. Seemed great.

Several weeks into the arrangement, we have come to understand that they are basically plopping her in front of the TV all day, with occasional breaks for meals and errands. This is not what we discussed. We are a no-screens-until-age-2 family, which they know, but of course I understand that you take what you get with free family babysitters. However, I think the hours upon hours of TV are way past the acceptable threshold for a toddler. I asked them to please reduce (not stop!) the TV watching and try to steer her toward play and activities, but there has been no change over the past two weeks—she's still just watching TV, enough that it pervades all of her chatter and she fusses when we won't let her do the same at home.

I don't feel I've been left a choice but to pull her from Grandcare, but I dread the hurt feelings this will cause (and the impact to our wallets). Go for it anyway?

Mental Load Backfire
Guest May 2, 12:38 p.m.
QUESTION: It would be so lovely if the husband so beautifully understood and followed through.
Absent that, what does OP do? Are acceptance and resignation vs Divorce the only choices?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I think there are a lot of in-between steps, all geared toward that overdue aha moment -- certainly a few that involve couples counseling.

I also think the "acceptance and resignation" side can include some bargains with reality that push it more toward a fair deal of some kind, just not the fairness we're talking about (50-50 domestic labor split). The carriers of 99 percent can extract 99 percent of something else of value in return, especially after the kids start to launch -- they get to choose where the couple retires, for example, or get to pursue a "dream" career later in life.

Actually, a version of this alternative bargain happens all the time -- the parent who does most of the work has most of the relationship with the kids. It doesn't always work out that way, but that is one of the known outcomes.

But it's super fraught. If the one doing less is actively shirking the responsibility, and also earns more, then the one carrying the domestic weight can get unceremoniously dumped into a bad financial situation as soon as their housework and childrearing services aren't needed.

So, better option is to keep talking and documenting toward that beautiful moment of understanding and follow through. If there is zero progress and acceptance is out, then, divorce.

For ‘mental load backfire’
Guest May 2, 12:39 p.m.
QUESTION: It seems your husband needs to find a caregiver for the kids for 75% of the summer. For kids aged 7 and 9, a college student or older high school student (especially if driving is critical where you live) is perfect: young, cool, probably have some fun ideas. Hubs needs to get on care.com, every neighborhood parenting social media group he can find, ping his parent-friend networks. With all of the money saved in camps, this should be do-able. For any gaps, I guess he’ll have to take personal time, or maybe trade time with other parents? This IS NOT the wife’s problem. She can HELP, but she shouldn’t need to SOLVE.

Wedding excitement
Guest May 2, 12:39 p.m.
QUESTION: When I was getting married, I felt some disappointment over the fact that my mom couldn't be as involved in wedding planning as I would have liked because I live 800 miles from her.

She acknowledged that the distance was challenging and asked what I really wanted to do together (go dress shopping) and also if there were any wedding chores she could help with by phone (yes, please call the photographers on this list and tell us who is nicest!)

Maybe make that part of your conversation with your daughter, at the end of the script Carolyn suggested: "Are there specific things you would really like me to be part of during the planning process? What do you want me to prioritize?"

excited daughter, mom not so much
Guest May 2, 12:50 p.m.
QUESTION: My mom was not excited when I told her I was getting married (Her exact response: "I thought you were going to grad school!" (I did go to grad school. AND I got married.) After a few months, she continued to not be excited, so I just starting making wedding plans myself. At which point, my dad took me aside and told me it was hurting mom's feelings not to be included. (Mental table flip) So I think it took a taste of not being included to change her mind. And while she never was the most enthusiastic participant (all my stress dreams were about her not getting around to doing her stuff), she did make all the bridesmaids' dresses and my veil, so she did make it clear that she loved me, even if she didn't love the wedding planning.

Advice Columnist
ANSWER: 1. This is such a good story of how people can love you but be so complicated and difficult and knotted up about showing it -- thank you. (And I'm sorry.)

2. Are you sure she "change[d] her mind"? Seems possible at least that she felt the same way all along (loved you, wanted to be included) but all along was hopeless about expressing it.

Maybe your dad understood that about her, gave her time to try to figure it out for herself, then had the presence of mind to step in.

RE: Mom & Grasp of Reality Again
Guest May 2, 12:56 p.m.
QUESTION: It's not new-there's been some version of this going on for at least 20 years. What it's been focused on and the specific outlet for it has been different over time and seems to shift with changes in my life circumstances (college, moving out of state, getting married, having kids), but I'd say it's overall not new or worsening. I do take your point though regarding the doctor and full workup: I have asked her to get checked out or see a psychiatrist and generally the retort is that I should see one (maybe I should, but I don't think it's a reasonable response). I guess I will just try harder to get through to her on seeing a doctor? In the meantime I find myself searching for what I did wrong to provoke this, and somewhere I know that's not what this is about but I can't help but feeling bad about it.

And no, I would not encourage you to try hard to get through to her. It's time for you to take care of you. Not a psychiatrist, though -- a psychologist. Please talk to someone about your experience with your mother. What you describe in these two posts suggests you have been subjected to a lifetime of her gaslighting and emotional abuse. I am so sorry.

Re: camp fail
Guest May 2, 1:04 p.m.
QUESTION: At this point I think the letter writer should be calling camps for last minute spaces and lining up a teen helper. I don't see the husband actually following through with this even if he agrees. Then later work on fairness. But right now it seems like an emergency situation and I sure wouldn't trusy him to come through.

ANSWER: Fair point. A kneecap-me-twice situation.

Also? While the goal of his Actually Getting It (tm) remains in force, the intermediate goal of figuring out what the husband can be counted on to contribute reliably is completely reasonable. People are better at doing what they are better at, care about most, or hate doing less. We're just like that.

And while there are all kinds of things wrong with giving the worst jobs to the people who are selfless about getting things done, being a purist is a great way to stay stuck. Find out what he cares about most (or gets most annoyed at having undone, like an unstocked pantry or uncut grass) and there you go, that's his full responsibility now.

Seat at the Table - Follow-UP
Guest May 2, 1:09 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi - I'm the DIL in the seat at the table question. Thanks for the advice and for the reader re sponses.

What did you mean by, "FWIW: Drawing the hard line when the in-laws visit was totally within your rights to do, but you inadvertently stepped into a power struggle with them that you didn't need to have."

How did I not need to have this? If you were me you would have invited them for dinner and then been okay with everyone sitting everywhere for the next 30yrs? Or just avoided inviting them for a meal ever? That wasn't going to be possible. We invited them. I served dinner at the table and both FIL and MIL got up and sat in the living room and asked for TV trays (which we don't own for no specific reason - just don't have them).

We both asked if we could all sit at the table and FIL said no, he wasn't a kid, and I couldn't force him. So, we carried our plates to living room and watched TV as we ate.

We just haven't invited them back for a meal.

And the readers are too kind - there is no reason why they can't sit at a table. They go to friends' houses and business associates and sit at their tables. This no-table eating is what they do at their house and their other two sons families houses. I think they feel judged that we won't do it, too. FIL is definitely one who takes his role as "head of the family" seriously. In many ways, his feelings are most important.

ANSWER: So, hi! Thanks for writing back. This is a useful follow up.

He sounds deeply emotionally stunted. In a manner, in fact, to which we're all becoming a little too well acquainted these days.

The answer to your question is, yes, sort of -- I would have been "okay" with *their* sitting everyhere, letting them be weird for the next 30 years. You say, "So, we carried our plates to living room and watched TV as we ate," and that's where we differ. I would have let them go sit alone, then and forever. Their choice. We'd be at the table. My house, you see.

And for future meals, yeah, the menu would get super simple and I wouldn't be the one cooking -- and I and my spouse and whoever else was there would eat at the table. The invitations to dinner would also drop in frequency, sure. But not to zero if zero gave them the satisfaction of being able to complain to their friends about me.

I'm just saying my method would be to concede as little as possible and add as little fuel as possible and exert as little effort as possible. And to show as little irritation as possible, with this as my general unspoken messaging:

If you lunatics think this is your big dramatic power play, then go ahead and eat your reheated frozen cocktail weenies in front of the TV and gloat, congratu-freakin-lations. The grownups will be in here. [tight smile]

It's not for everyone, but it's a way of opting out of an overt power struggle by identifying and claiming all winnable turf in advance.

"better at doing what they are better at"
Guest May 2, 1:14 p.m.
QUESTION: No one is better at the "skill" of waking up at 6 am to refresh the browser until a summer camp slot is confirmed, then plunking down $500. There are just people who know it needs to get done and others who are insulated from that knowledge.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Of course. Please refer to my original answer.

But the conversation has moved to the, "What now -- divorce?" stage of the conversation. And for that, there are two unpleasant options: Yes, and not yet.

In the "not yet" space, there can be weeks and weeks of getting by while trying to get your exact message across.

So how are those weeks going to be spent -- more exhaustion while carrying 99 percent of the load? Or trying to rebalance the load in a way that has a better chance of being successful than the camp debacle?

That's what I was talking about.

Thank you very much.

I showed my husband that comic strip visualizing the mental load. He was hurt that I felt that way, but reflected on it and came back to me saying he was fully taking on A, B, and C and I could take them off my mental list. He's been true to his word and it's been huge.

Should we move to avoid daughter's stalker?
Guest May 2, 1:40 p.m.
QUESTION: I’m wondering if I’m going to have to move because my 21-year-old daughter is being relentlessly stalked by her ex-boyfriend/father of her baby. He was opposed to her continuing the pregnancy and got violently abusive when she decided to have it (e.g. he rammed her car with his truck when she was 5 months pregnant and drove her into a ditch). She got a restraining order against him and doesn’t want child support or anything from him but to leave her and the baby alone. That RO hasn’t stopped him from harassing us and stalking her. His father is on the police force so they do the bare minimum when we report the violations. We keep detailed logs of all his behavior, which ranged from trying to get into the hospital when she was in labor, endless harassing calls (she blocks his number but he keeps getting new ones), banging on our door all hours of the day and night, slashing her tires, vandalizing our home, following her car home from work, the latest was him trying to break into my daughter’s room in the middle of the night. Our dog went berserk and that scared him off but it looks like he’s never going to stop. Like always, we turned over the logs to the cops and they said (like every other time) “call us if he actually does anything to her.”
I talked to my sister who lives over 400 miles away and she thinks we should leave quickly and quietly, letting no one know where we’re going except my boss who is aware of the situation. She said we can stay with her until we find a new home and jobs there. This is such a drastic step - the cost of living there is much higher and if I quit I won’t be able to collect unemployment. We can live on my savings for a while but I’m worried about selling our house remotely, and what happens if it takes me and my daughter too long to find jobs. I’m an administrative assistant and would take excellent references with me and she’s an LPN who can work in any hospital or clinic but in this economy, who knows? We’ve lived in this town since my daughter was 4 months old; my husband is buried here but I don’t know what else to do. Neither of us can take this much longer. Is moving the right thing to do?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Call 1-800-799-SAFE -- the National Domestic Violence Hotline. You concerns for your ability to support yourself are real and valid, and of course this is your home where you have ties. This is one of the many reasons the stalking is such a horror. It robs all of you of your agency, your peace of mind, your security, your home -- this is the power the ex is abusing.

But being right means squat if you-daughter-grand aren't alive. So talk to the hotline and get trained support asap to develop a plan to get your safety back in one form or another.

The police inaction is an outrage. The "actually does anything to her" is a false standard if he's committing property crimes and trespassing, which are more than enough -- I don't think one needs a law degree to 2 + 2 that one.

Chronic guilt pit
Guest May 2, 1:50 p.m.
QUESTION: I am crowd sourcing the group here: What is everyone doing about the guilt pit they swallowed that sits in the pit of their stomach like a weight? What, is that not normal? Just me?

I feel guilt for moving away from my family, I feel guilty for not calling my friend more, I feel guilty for not going on that jog, I feel guilty for not paying my babysitter more, I feel guilty for not taking on that extra project at work, I feel guilty for not being 'in-the-mood' more, I feel guilty for not putting more effort into my hair, I feel guilty for not enjoying the weather UGH

Any one thing I could fix relatively quickly, but it just is feeling like a game of whack-a-mole. Knock one thing out and there are just endless more guilt pits of varying sizes!
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: By whose life instructions are you living?

That's my main question.

I for one can't be part of your crowd to answer your "guilt pit" question because I don't have the pit. I am, though, upon quick inspection, just as "guilty" as you are -- moved away from my hometown (5.5-8 hour drive, depending on traffic); crappy, out-of-touch friend (too long a rap sheet to document here); chair jockey (👋); hair tragedy (attached).

But you know what? Who gives a shirt. I loved my parents, and they knew it. If I felt guilty for leaving, then I wouldn't have moved or would have moved back -- but I didn't because my reasons for leaving were better than my reasons for staying. Are yours? If they're not, then consider moving back. (This is a walk I walked -- moved back-ish 18 years after I moved away, when circumstances changed.) And if you can't, then you can't, and it's not up to you so no guilt. It really can be that simple.

I love my friends, and they know it, and they aren't great about calling me, either. They've got stuff to do.

Yes, I sit too much. Arrest me.

And what is not to love about the free time made available by this hair.

Again -- for whom are you living? Not you, currently. That's the issue. In order of appearance, you see yourself living in service of family, friends, societal standards, your employee, your employer, your partner, societal standards again, and you're at the mercy of the passage of time. Whew.

It feels like the most flippant, heartless advice ever to tell a well-meaning stressed out person, "You need to figure out who you are," but I suspect you are in fact suffering the accumulated effects of working hard at checking what you were told were the boxes of being a good person -- without having fully reckoned with who you really are and want to be. Or why anyone's opinion of you matters.

I hope I'm wrong and you're just flat out freaking exhausted. That works, too, since you're a working parent of young kid(s) with a partner and well that's way more than enough for one person's to-do list. But it's enough for a lot of people not to need any encouragement to say "erf my hair."

So that's the arcing wire -- who/what is saying you need nice hair and muscle tone and a perfect attendance award to matter? You don't. You matter as-is.

How to be positive for teen
Guest May 2, 1:57 p.m.
QUESTION: I’m having a hard time balancing my own negative feelings about the state of the U.S. and the world with trying to be a positive example for my teen. He is autistic and has depression and anxiety, and has become even more negative about everything with the new administration. I feel very negative myself and don’t know how to help my kid be more positive when I am not feeling it myself. I don’t stick my head in the sand or want us to be fake happy, but I also don’t want to think about negative stuff all the time. ALL he ever talks about is very negative stuff. He is seriously Debbie Downer. Yes, there’s a lot of awful stuff going on, and yes, feline aids is the number one killer of domestic cats, but I cannot focus on that constantly. He is in therapy and on medication, btw. As am I. I feel like I am failing him. How can I be real without projecting a feeling of hopelessness.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yes, there are objectively bad things happening right now that contribute to a sense of negativity, and yes this feeling will be heavier for a teen with autism and for a parent of a teen with autism. I won't try to fake-happy you either.

I'm reading this, though, as I look out the window on one of the more dazzling May days I've ever seen.

And this part of it all is not fake: The backdrop of the things dragging you down is a big noisy complicated world that has nature, art, music, dance, food, literature, crafts, sports, movies ... and love, and family, and humor, and about a thousand things at any given time that can break your heart with their beauty.

So I don't know. Maybe it will feel "fake" to drag yourself outside to look at a beautiful thing, like a crescent moon or a cityscape or a museum exhibit. Or to put on music in your home that you can sing along to, if your son isn't noise-sensitive. Or to put a game on TV and start following a team he likes. Or to make yourselves get in the car to go to a store to buy the ingredients or materials for a meal or a project you can work on together. Or go to your local library to take advantage of the progamming, classes, materials there. Or start doing yoga with him every day.

But at some point, maybe 15 or 30 minutes in, it won't feel fake anymore. Or maybe if you make a habit of it, after a day or two the practice won't feel fake anymore, and the anticipation of your walk or meal or project or music or game time will start to feel genuine.

There is a whole lot of life out there, is what I'm saying, that was there before all this and will be there after, because that's how humanity works. We over focus sometimes and forget that. I mean -- you're probably upset in part because so many of these great things are getting squeezed right now, or threatened even, I get that. But if anything now is the time to go all in and live them to show what they mean to you. So give your humanity a kick. That's the mood lift. And that's the antidote to hopelessness.

Re: Mom and reality
Guest May 2, 1:59 p.m.
QUESTION: My mother blamed us for things that we didn't do (and for things that never actually happened).

My sisters and I used to "go beige," as we called it. We wouldn't challenge her or ignore her. If she said something like, "I was really offended that you went on vacation with your in-laws again, but you never have time for me," we would say, "Oh, we're sorry that you're feeling bad. Let's plan something fun we can do together." If the in-law trip never happened, we didn't address that. If she perseverated on the phone or in person, we wouldn't cut her off mid-sentence, but when she stopped for breath, we would say, "Well, you've given me something to think about, thanks. But I have to go now."

We never addressed (with her, but we did with our dad) that she needed psychiatric care, and we didn't get angry or defend ourselves.

Our mother still went into rages and made bizarre accusations, but we reminded ourselves that it had NOTHING to do with us, what we had done or done done--and that we couldn't fix it with discussions, reality, or even love.

Dementia Breaking Boundaries
Guest May 2, 2:05 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn. My father wrestled with mental health issues for most of his life that led him to be unstable and emotionally and verbally abusive. Over the past decade, I have constructed a set of boundaries that keeps him at arms length to protect myself and my young family. Recently, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, which explains why things have gotten worse over the past few years. I am trying to figure out what to do with my carefully constructed and maintained boundaries now. My brother says that our father needs us and that I need to be there with my dad, engage with him by phone and text, and just take his abuse and let it roll off me when it comes - chalking it up to the Alzheimer’s over which dad has no control. Since my father was abusive before the Alzheimer’s, I’m having a hard time giving him a free pass on his behavior even now and feel like we cannot really tell what behavior is good-ole-dad being horrible or the result of dementia. But perhaps I am ignorant and need some education about this new diagnosis and I am willing to learn. It also feels like the impact on me and my family is the same, regardless of the cause of the abusive behavior. Having my father send me texts where he calls me a good for nothing piece of garbage hurts today just as these actions hurt 5, 10, 20, and 40+ years ago. And I do not want my wife or three children (ages 11, 13, and 16) to be exposed to someone who thinks nothing of ruining a family dinner with yelling, swearing, and name calling because there is too much butter on the vegetables in his opinion. (True story.) I do not want to be a bad son, brother, or person. But I don’t know how to be a good son while also being a good husband and father and while also keeping my own mental health in tact - under these challenging circumstances. Do I re-engage with my abusive father in service to him knowing it puts me and my family at risk? Or do I keep my guards up, protect myself and my family, and let my father and brother down in this time of need? I can’t find the middle ground here - or even any stable ground from which to approach this problem. It seems like heartbreak all around no matter what I choose.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You do not "need" to "be" anywhere or do anything. You are in charge of yourself and you make your own decisions. Your brother has no right to order you around like that.

You may decide your father's care is a responsibility you want to share with your brother, or feel you owe him, or your own sense of decency. Fine. But that's your call, not his.

You may also decide to help out at arm's length, which is valid and fair. Finding him good care, helping to pay for it as you're able, or not. Protecting yourself and family.

Here is the Alzheimer's Association. It has a help line. Lean and learn.

I'm sorry you were so badly mistreated. Don't let him anywhere near your kids.

For chronic guilt put
Guest May 2, 2:08 p.m.
QUESTION: This may not apply to you at all, but it did to me - sometimes the things I felt guilty about, or the people I felt guilty about, I was actually angry with - but I turned the anger inward, because if it was something *I* did, then I was in control of it, and then I could fix it. It doesn’t apply to everything, of course, but it may be something to think about in some cases, and it’s sometimes a way to move beyond guilt and deal with what’s really bothering you - anything from unreasonable personal expectations to unfair personal expectations.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I think this is not only fair, but more common than we realize. Women especially are not "allowed" to be angry. i.e., commonly socialized away from it toward self-criticism and peacekeeping. I'd like to say this has gotten better, in that more Baby Boomer and Gen X women will identify with this than Millennial and down, but it's still pretty pervasive.

Psychiatry vs psychology
Guest May 2, 2:22 p.m.
QUESTION: Why do you recommend psychologists over psychiatrists? It is true that a lot of psychiatry residency programs focus on medication rather than psychotherapy.
But not all of them—and not the best ones. Psychiatrists can be excellent psychotherapists depending on their inclination and where they trained. I think I am that kind of psychiatrist. My medical background and my expertise in medications are in the background as I do psychotherapy to be called on to rule out somatic causes for psychic distress. Also, the meds background helps me to prescribe appropriately to decrease the patient’s pain and suffering.
How do you find a psychiatrist that does psychotherapy? You ask them if they do or if they farm it out to non-medical therapists. Non-medical therapists can be good at what they do.

How do you tell if a therapist/psychologist/psychiatrist is a good choice for you?
1.) the relationship feels, on a gut level, like a good fit.
2.) Problems are on the way to being solved by 4 months.
3.) The professional understands you—on a racial/gender and background level. They should be willing to accept that your background/problems are just as severe as you say. Though, in a reversal, they may be able to point out aspects of the patient’s problems that are worse than the patient feels they are.
4.) Always, always there should be respect and acceptance.

Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: This is great to add to the search criteria in the caregiver search, thanks.

I recommended that as a shortcut -- the searching process is arduous, and if someone is calling practices, a lot of psychiatry offices will focus on medication or illness management and say no to psychotherapy. Trying to spare somebody some calls.

This is a dangerous situation and the dept. needs to have a functional response to it, which they have yet to provide.

QUESTION: Re: the psychiatrist's comment: decades ago, when still on active duty in the Navy, I regularly saw a psychiatrist to get my depression RX renewed. Like all his predecessors, I called him Dr. Drone, beause at each appointment, they always asked the same questions ("Doing OK? Any thoughts of hurting yourself? Sleeping OK? Meds working?"). That guy retired. Got a new guy. This psychiatrist actually asked if I would be interested in talk therapy. Nonplussed, I demurred, and asked for time to think about it. Went home, asked my clinical psychologist husband what he thought. Husband's advice: "WHENEVER A PYSCHIATRIST OFFERS THERAPY, SAY YES!" I said yes, and greatly benefitted from the time I spent in his care. (Still taking meds, still OK.) :-)

Homophobic Relatives
Guest Apr 25, 11:04 a.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,

In light of Everything, I am trying to get my actions in better alignment with my principles. Among other things, this means no longer tolerating bigotry of any kind from my acquaintances. If they want to be in community with me, I'm going to challenge them on it; if they don't want to change, I don't want the relationship. Even though I happen to be cis and straight, I love a lot of people who aren't, including my sister who is pan/poly and currently in a relationship with another woman. Therein lies my question. How do I handle it if my sister wants to remain on friendly terms with people I think have disrespected her horribly? Our parents are 90% of the way to acceptance, but their siblings and some older family friends are a mess.

ANSWER: Huh. This took a turn I wasn't expecting.

I was ready for you to ask how best to stand up for your sister.

I guess that is still the question in the broadest sense. But the reality is much more nuanced once you factor in that your sister is both on friendly terms with people you're objecting to, and not asking you to stand up for her.

Typical reality. Refusing to make things easy.

The short answer for you is to do -- keep doing -- whatever you think is right. If you don't like these relatives/friends, whether it's because their morals offend you or their politics annoy you or their conversation bores you, then keep your civil distance. That's your prerogative. If you hear them say something offensive or that you know to be untrue and harmful, then politely but firmly correct the record. Nothing new or exciting here. "That is disinformation. It's _____. I'm sorry you were misled." Or: "That is unkind and untrue." And/or: "Don't talk about _____ like that in my presence."

The longer and more interesting answer is to pay some attention to your sister. She is the one with more on the line, yet has chosen a friendly path with those who aren't respectful of who she is. Why has she made that choice, do you know? Is it a kind of Stockholm Syndrome, or is she a total badass, or ____? Have you two talked about this? If she thinks the path to progress is through converting hostile people over time with her humanity, then she might not even agree with your decision to start slamming doors.

It would be interesting to know what brought your parents to their 90 percent (presumably they started at a much lower acceptance number). Time, pressure? Did shame from the "mess" cohort slow things down? Did shame from allies speed things up? Did pressures work in combination -- the pull of your sister's grace and the push of impatience from less BS-tolerant allies like you?

Anyway. Not to get too deep into a thought exercise, which is also a risk. Sometimes you do find yourself staring down a bigot, a true believer in wiping out anything "other," and you need to be ready to declare that person dead to you. Vulnerable people don't need their stronger allies playing footsie with storm troopers.

I think all the interesting stuff is right here: "if they don't want to change." Do you trust yourself to know?

It is okay, in general, just to commit to being braver on a day-to-day basis.

How Do I handle this?
Guest Apr 25, 11:11 a.m.
QUESTION: I've been dating a guy I really like for about 3 months. He's been separated for 4 years and is working on getting a divorce. Last night on our date, his ex-wife followed him to the restaurant and confronted him after I left and then contacted me -- with very angry and harsh words. I believe she has access to his phone text messages and some sort of app that tracks his whereabouts. How do I can handle this? I'd like to keep seeing him, but WOW ... this has never happened to me before.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Wow is right. Do you know all those specs about his separation/divorce in progress are true? That's my first thought. My second one is, I can't see dating someone who would consent to being tracked like that.

If she was just using access he didn't realize she still had, then ... okay. Easy to see how that could happen. But all of it would have to be shut down and some papers filed, frankly, before I'd venture back into the middle of that.

I.e., I would want hard proof the unfinished business is entirely on her side, not his, because one side is bad enough.

Today's column - people pleaser
Guest Apr 25, 11:12 a.m.
QUESTION: I was the people-pleaser from today's column until a very good friend got frustrated with me and said "It's okay to have an opinion! I *want* to know what *YOU* want to do! That's why I asked you! I enjoy spending time with you, but it is EXHAUSTING to always have to pick - the restaurant, the movie, the day and time we meet - all of it. You have to take a turn, too!" and then, calmly, "I know your family and know you're used to just going along to get along, but I'm not them. You can have an opinion and a choice and input as to where we go and what we do. PLEASE speak up. Our friendship is a two-way street, okay?" - what an eye-opener!!
I'm probably a little *too* opinionated now, but I really needed to hear that it was okay to both have and state a preference.

Helping a child choose a college
Guest Apr 25, 11:34 a.m.
QUESTION: My daughter applied to numerous colleges. Only her safety schools admitted her. She’s struggling between two similarly selective (40-50%) school, one very rural and one in a large city. She’s terribly disappointed and frozen. We’ve done the pros and cons lists. A huge health issue upset her academic Apple cart last year and torpedoed her hopes of a super selective school. We as her parents are supportive but certainly don’t want to choose. One school has offered a lot more money which does matter to some extent. Any suggestions on how to provide support here?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm sorry she's feeling so disappointed. It sounds as if she is in a pretty decent spot except by comparison to where she was hoping she would be. I know there's no cheerleading someone out of that, she is just going to have to keep moving forward until she realizes she likes where she is (or wants to transfer).

If the only way she moves forward is with a gentle shove from you, then you may, de facto, be choosing for her. It's not great but it's something.

So here are the steps I'd take in that position.

First, don't rush her. May 1, right? If she processes quietly, then her "frozen"might be thought and recovery.

Next: If there is a specific program she wants, then that of course goes to the top of the list, but as long as each has a selection then that can be secondary.

Next: The obvious is to say, "Take the money!!!" And not just because it's money!!! but there is something to be said for a school that really wants you. That's a case you can make to her that isn't a bunch of spin.

But ... agh. I'm not going to advise that. Because the difference between a rural and urban school is so huge that I think you are better off thinking hard about your kid's natural habitat -- or, if she is coming from the burbs and hasn't been in either environment, what that is likely to be. Which one is going to be right for her temperament.

Then make that case to her and say why: "You love underground art and music and I just see you in a city." Or, "You've always been drawn to quiet places." Reflect your kid back to her and see if she sees the same thing.

Last thing, an insane wild card. Does she have a seriously plugged in college counselor? Because some schools that haven't hit their numbers may take a late app.

Navigating family estrangement
Guest Apr 25, 11:53 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn. I cut ties with my sister about ten years ago. Sister's untreated mental illness was sucking my parents and other siblings into a spiral. The other members of my family enable my sister's disfunction, and beg me to make up with her, even if that means sweeping issues under the rug. I think I would like to be on better terms, but I want to be an enabler either. I want my sister to acknowledge the harm her behavior has caused -- something other family members don't confront explicitly. How can I keep the door open to reconciliation, but with firm boundaries? I don't want to get sucked in to an unproductive fight again.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: The way to reconcile with firm boundaries is to understand what you do and don't control, and then be very clear in your purpose for and management of the part you control.

Let's look at your list of wants and don't wants:

1. "I want my sister to acknowledge the harm her behavior has caused." That is not something you control. You control whether you ask for it, sure, but it's up to your sister whether you get it. So I caution against this, because it puts a big part of your path forward in your sister's hands.

2. "I don't want to get sucked in to an unproductive fight again." This is something you control. When you feel a fight coming on or hitting an unproductive point, then you can walk away from it. Entirely up to you.

3. "I would like to be on better terms, but I don't want to be an enabler either." This is something you control. You can make an overture to your sister to resume the relationship, carefully. You can decide beforehand what behaviors you will not enable, accept or encourage. What that means in practice is that when you are, say, subjected to abusive behavior like getting screamed at, you will not listen to it or scream back or apologize for whatever set it off. You will simply end the conversation and step away. Knowing it is a health issue, you may choose to call again at a pre-determined interval, and continue this arm's length engagement. Or you may choose to check in less often or not at all.

As for your family, you let them know you are engaging on your terms and are not seeking input on this. If they start to intrude.

Re helping a child choose a college
Guest Apr 25, 11:57 a.m.
QUESTION: Don't forget to think creatively. Gap year? Transfer after freshman year? A child whose life has been upset by a huge health issue doesn't have to lock back in to the traditional path/timing. The options as you have presented them seem a bit narrow.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Even a child without a huge health issue does not have to lock into the traditional path/timing. Gap years and transfers are useful tools for all.

But, too, so are "safety schools." SO many people love where they go, and quickly, despite feeling meh at best about the idea the April before they go. It's a well known phenomenon.

So yes, full menu. Thanks.

Cancer dog
Guest Apr 25, 12:14 p.m.
QUESTION: We just used the last of our savings to pay for a young and otherwise healthy dog -- our child's best, sleeping on the bed and meeting the bus with joy, buddy -- to have a cancerous tumor removed. All the signs are good and the vet believes the chances of recurrence are low. But if it comes back we _cannot_ afford to treat it again, not without taking on debt. We currently have no debt. But both adult jobs are unstable right now, and while the kids would 100% give up their extracurriculars to save the dog's life, another round of treatment would cost more than all their activities combined for a year, and I don't want to kneecap their life launch for a dog. But I'm typing this while I hold the dog and cry into his fur at the thought of killing him so my kids can what, take karate? I can't think and I'm so tired. He's such a good boy but the kids have to come first. How do I stick to my logical guns if I had to make this decision again? Husband is in the same boat as me, mentally.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Two thoughts. First, you just did this, you're stressed, tired and broke, so this is not the time to think about it. You don't have to decide now so don't.

Second, now may be the time to rethink the extracurriculars. Does everyone need all of the stuff? I mean -- I'm pro enrichment opportunities. But only if they're actually enriching, and not a reflexive signup at this point.

If you're down to no savings and the jobs are wobbly, then this seems like a great time to think about the real return on your activity investment. There's nothing wrong with being more mindful about how you do this, and seeing whether your kids' interests have evolved or come into tighter focus.

Any other cost shaving you can do elsewhere would also be good. This is the thinking to do now -- you know you may have an issue coming, so, do what you can on the money side to get ahead of it. Much better than dwelling on the dread side.

choosing a college
Guest Apr 25, 12:17 p.m.
QUESTION: I'd recommend visiting each school--even if you were there before. We did that as my daughter was unsure, with schools that were top choices for her. A second visit showed us one was extremely quiet, even in a city, and the other, in NYC, was lively and had literally thousands of easily accessible things to do off-campus. It wasn't a choice I thought she'd make, but she still lives in NYC, years after graduation.

Mom asked "Why do you hate me?"
Guest Apr 25, 12:32 p.m.
QUESTION: At a family gathering me and my husband were hosting, my mother got me alone and, out of nowhere, asked "why do you hate me?" I just said "what?"-I was shocked and didn't know what to say. My father came in and she moved on as if nothing happened. I don't know where this is coming from. The only thing I can think of is earlier she had asked me (again, out of nowhere) "you don't plan on selling the heirloom table you inherited, do you?" and I responded "why would you ask that?" She kept pushing until finally I gave in and said no (but I don't see why I should have to report on it, especially when there is no indication I don't want it-it's our dining room table, though I shouldn't have to justify any of this). Also, I have lately been trying to set and enforce boundaries due to past events in our relationship, like:
-I hired a photographer to take a family photo with both of our in-laws and the kids. I got enlargements made, matted, framed, and then gave them to all family members as gifts. My mother's enraged response was "how dare you-you edited the photo to put me in the back!" I did not. In fact, during the photo shoot she refused to stand in the natural position with my father opposite the in-laws and instead insisted on moving to the back.
-For our anniversary, my husband and I hired a babysitter so we could go out to have a nice dinner to ourselves. Going out just the two of us is something we have done only 3 times since our 1st was born 7 years ago. When my mother learned of this, she accused me and my husband of being bad parents. I may have overreacted, but when she said that I asked her to leave.
-My mother has repeatedly insisted incorrectly that we have somehow secretly been spending time and taking trips with my husband's parents. We have not (and though she poses it in an accusatory way, I'm not sure what her point is-if we want to take trips with someone, so what). Again, this is out of nowhere and triggered by ?.
-Every year a day before my mother's birthday, she posts on social media "my birthday's tomorrow: we'll see if my daughter remembers this year" or similar. I have never forgotten her birthday and always have a card and gifts on that day (unlike her who remembers the birthday itself but always sends cards late).
There are more... and never any apology. But that's just backstory to my real questions: how should I have responded in the moment to her asking "why do you hate me" and should I still respond now, after the fact?

ANSWER: Is this new or worsening behavior, or has she always been like this? Because to this layperson, these examples suggest a rather weak grasp of reality. The place to start is with your dad. "I am really concerned about Mom. She is increasingly paranoid and saying things that have no connection to reality." Then hope he's not covering for her. Time for a trip to her doctor, full workup and truth-telling.

Protecting my kids is most key right?
Guest Apr 25, 12:38 p.m.
QUESTION: My cousin, 17 years older than I, has been convicted of sexual abuse to his young teen daughter. My immediate family are deeply, completely certain he’s been wronged and it’s a vendetta of his ex.

This man chased me as a small child for hugs and kisses - even when screaming in terror. I reminded my family - they told me it was harmless and to stop being dramatic.

We live in a different country but have long calls each week. My gut tells me I need to pull away and with my kids as this attitude is so wrong to me - whoever is right a child is clearly hurt here. but I’m hesitant in case I’m overreacting. I could do with some perspective please

ANSWER: Trust your experience. You lived it, you knew something was wrong.

And when you spoke up recently, they could have said, "That must be an awful memory for you. We don't think the incidents are related, but if you need to sit this one out, we will understand." Instead, they told you to stop being dramatic.

So, yes. Protect your kids.

published letter about asking DIL for travel plans
Guest Apr 25, 12:45 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi, Carolyn. I missed the live chat where the son's mother posted about asking DIL for the family travel plans so I read it 'new' this week in the paper. Completely agree with your answer. But I wondered on the face of it why the mother-in-law thinks travel plans/planning is 'women's work'? If she wants to know the plans (and she doesn't need to) why not ask HER SON??? She wrote about how this is common among her 'mom friends'. Again, only women do family travel planning? Sheesh.

ANSWER: Writing this column for me has become a three decade journey in discovering new versions of the "two kinds of people." Apparently another two kinds are people who think being 35 and telling mommy you're on flight 427 is normal and people who "wha?"

I also learned from many people that it would have been "so easy" for the DIL to just give the flight information. A lot of them, possibly all, heard back from me that it would have been just as "so easy" for the mom to ask her son for it.

In other words, I'm with you kind of people.

Apparently I also need therapy for my anger issues with my parents, because I never gave them my flight information. [Read the column here.]

Political differences
Guest Apr 25, 1:02 p.m.
QUESTION: After much effort to build a close relationship with my dad despite geographical distance, the U.S.'s political chaos has revealed a huge wedge between us. His rule is that my siblings and I cannot discuss politics when we are together (because we are intractably opposed), but now when he and I speak on a call and I provide my perspective on an item of news he disagrees with, it's like the call has suddenly dropped. He just...doesn't engage. I feel like our relationship is becoming superficial and emotionally dishonest because we can't discuss reality. I'm not sure of my question exactly but I'm feeling loneliness in a relationship that used to provide me great comfort.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I think a ton of people are going through a version of this. It's anecdotal, but I'm seeing a lot of questions from people in mismatched coping pairs: The ones who want to process it all are coming home to the ones who want to live in a complete news blackout, and no one feels understood.

I don't think the wall you've hit is the end of it all with your dad, though. It's just a wall on the politics path. There are so many other conversational places to go.

The problem is, The Chaos (tm) means the others aren't front of mind -- and you're having these conversations by phone, so it's not like you can putter around your kitchen for a while in companionable silence until a new topic bubbles up.

So ... I'm going to suggest something that feels really artificial, but is so only in cutting out that gap time you don't have the luxury of allowing to elapse naturally. During the course of your days, any time you think of your dad, write down whatever topic you have in mind to run by him. Talk to your notes app, whatever. Even a couple of items will give you a pivot for when he disengages. It's something you had in mind, right? So it's valid -- it's just a little memory jog.

Try it, see if there's enough reality to discuss of other varieties to restore your faith in your relationship.

A seat at the table
Guest Apr 25, 1:16 p.m.
QUESTION: My in-laws do not sit at the table to eat. Whether it is just MIL and FIL at home or the entire extended family, food is placed on the counter and people self serve and sit all over the house - some in front of the TV, others in the living room or porch looking at phones. When at their houses, I go with the flow. In our house, I want to sit at the table unless it is something like a cookout or superbowl. This was such a concern of mine that I raised it with my husband while dating and we agreed to sit at the table. We are living together now (married) and when his parents come over, they refuse to sit at the table. His dad, in particular, says he's not a child and I can't force him. So now we are in a bit of a stalemate. I don't want to have them over for a meal if it means working hard to prepare a meal only to sit scattered in our house and not talking. MIL is telling everyone in the family that I won't have them over for a meal. They like to play bingo and take their dog to the park for long walks. My husband has asked if we can join them to do these things or go to a restaurant and MIL refuses (because she knows why we are asking to do these things...avoiding meals at our house). I waffle between thinking I'm being obnoxious and should give up to thinking my MIL/FIL are really being bullies. My husband is supporting me but frustrated, too. He asked me to write you. So I am and hoping you've got ideas for me.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whoo. Good luck with these two.

Couple of things.

1. Tell your husband thanks.

2. Also tell him I'm really sorry, because his dad is such a child. He really said, "You can't force me"?

3. You (OP) already "won" a while ago. You both did. You are a gently united front against this bizarre tantrum his parents are having.

FWIW: Drawing the hard line when the in-laws visit was totally within your rights to do, but you inadvertently stepped into a power struggle with them that you didn't need to have. That was unfortunate. If time travel ever becomes available, then do take advantage by not picking this battle next time. Plus they sound like wonderful people not to have across from you at the table.

3. I used "" up there because the only victory is a happy, harmonious and loving marriage, even if each of you eats standing up in a different closet. So please work this out with your husband -- how would you like to deal with his lunatic parents, so that you both can breathe freely and not think about this ridiculous standoff ever again? That is the entirety of the answer.

4. Your MIL/FIL are really being bullies. There is no reason to concede anything except that the whole thing is so insane. But if you want it, you have room: You say, "I don't want to have them over for a meal if it means working hard to prepare a meal only to sit scattered in our house and not talking." So if they want to come live by their rules in your home, then can bring the food.

But really, I am throwing that out there because I look for possible solutions. If I were the person living with this, then I would hope my husband was talking to his parents separately in a "You have one shot at this, is this really the best you've got? Trashing us to your friends? Refusing &^%$! bingo?" conversation. After which they get told they know where to find him once they get their heads out of [places].

(What's the dad's issue with sitting -- does your husband know?)

Margo
Guest Apr 25, 1:17 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, I was excited and surprised to see my letter run today about my MIL "Margo." You wanted to know how her judgments were making their way to me and about the "third parties" I mentioned—it's not as nefarious as it might have sounded like. The main third party is my husband's younger sister. I can tell you exactly how it happened. My SIL has her own (open) frictions with Margo and was venting to my husband and me about her worries that it will get worse whenever she has a child. I commented that Margo has been great as a grandmother, and my SIL responded "Yes, but then she cries all the way home because (whatever the most recent thing was)!" This opened a sort of floodgate, and also a couple of bystanders overheard and chimed in. So this is how the third parties became involved—generally everyone is discreet and I don't really consider SIL to have broken her mom's confidence (though I can see where some would).

So that is why it's tricky. No one has done anything wrong. But I don't like to think about making Margo cry, even in secret.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ah. Okay! That is good news. I can totally see that kind of floodgate-share happening organically.

But ... ehhhhh I should just be happy and leave this at, "No one has done anything wrong."

But ... I feel like I'm on a fault-finding mission.

But ... Margo is doing something wrong!!! There, I said it.

Whoo. Wrong in being sooo wound up and judging sooo hard. No? I mean, are you being that controversial as parents, to make your kids' grandmother cry? That she has her own daughter worried about ever becoming a parent is telling.

Anyway. It's a lovely sentiment that you want Margo to be okay and/or to be okay with you. It remains lovely that she at least tries to do all her most ferocious judging in private.

If others' experience is any guide, then Margo will cry less with time. No guarantees of course. But the parents of littles seem to get the worst of it. Not sure whether the grandparents eventually warm to the parents, warm to how the kids are turning out or just lose their will to fight it all so hard.

Re: political differences
Guest Apr 25, 1:19 p.m.
QUESTION: It seems like OP’s dad set a boundary about not discussing political stuff, but OP still wants to bring up “news” he disagrees with and is surprised he disengages.

We have friends on the other side of the conversation. I firmly set boundaries that I’m not debating the latest news they’ve heard from their sources. I tell them they will not convince me of their “facts” and I won’t convince them of anything, so let’s move on to the things we have in common. If they wouldn’t let it go, we wouldn’t be talking at all anymore.

It might be more difficult with a parent if you want a relationship, but feel there is nothing meaningful left in common for you to discuss. Maybe reminiscing about childhood / family would be that thing. But, really, if he wants to avoid the conflict of endless discussions of politics, I think it’s worth respecting his request.

Feeling like a failure
Guest Apr 25, 1:42 p.m.
QUESTION: Is it just a normal part of adult (or mom) life to constantly feel like you're failing at basically everything, or is that just depression? I can't figure out if what I feel is a normal reaction to societal pressure to be an impossible level of the perfect mom/wife/employee/other, or if it's just depression raising its stupid and ugly head.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Certainly you want to go through the steps of treating it as depression, because if it is (and it sure sounds as if it could be), then you don't want to leave it untreated.

As you have the medical side in progress, you can also have the nonmedical side going too, since those best practices are similar:

1. Tell societal pressure to erf off. It is not a contest, or a race, or a reality show. Praise dogs. Wouldn't it be awful if it were?

2. Streamline whatever you can streamline. When I'm in a state of unraveling, I sit down with a yellow pad and a Sharpie and dump out everything, all the stressful pieces, then cut it down to the have-tos.

3. Give yourself grace, breaks, forgiveness, belly laughs, deep breathing (box breathing is great), a serious reality check -- whatever it is you need or have closest at hand. The reality check is that perfection doesn't exist, for one, and that the closer people get to achieving it, the less likable they tend to be. K? So.

4. Eat nutritiously, exercise regularly, sleep on a schedule, and tend to other habits that help counteract depression.

This is about anxiety, but so much of the conversation applies to depression too. Specifically, it covers why it can be tempting to push back against "take a walk"-type advice but taking a walk is still good advice.

Anyway. Also, both are "normal" -- overwhelm and depression. Not a failure, and nothing stupid about it. Take care.
did you take your stupid mental health walk for your stupid mental health?

YES, absolutely apply to schools with a higher chance of acceptance because no one wants to get stuck without a chair when the music stops. NO, don't inhabit the idea that anywhere you apply is "lesser". If you think it's no good, don't even bother applying.

ANSWER: Yes, so glad you brought this up. The kids know, of course, whatever term anyone uses. BUT, there is no need to scream it with the language. My kids' school used "reach, target and likely" as the three labels for their chances of admission. That did help. Plus, the counselors absolutely drove home your main point, not to apply if they wouldn't want to go. Choosing the "likelies" was some of the hardest thinking they had to do.

More reasons not to need flight information
Guest Apr 25, 1:52 p.m.
QUESTION: Some years ago, the airlines started asking for an emergency contact in case something went wrong (with you or the flight). My sister asked if she could put me down because my mom - a normally sane and rational woman - had started to have a tendency to overreact to the idea that her kids were in need of help.

Re Homophobic Relatives
Guest Apr 25, 1:57 p.m.
QUESTION: I'd add one other point to consider... We are living through an increasingly absolutist time. "...[N]o longer tolerating bigotry of any kind" is another manifestation. Can you take a deep breath and help people, especially those who are close to you, get 10% away from their disturbing point of view? 25%? 50, 75, 90%? If you can, you will have done a good thing. I get it, sometimes there is no better answer than walking away. But there's also value (frequently a *lot* of value) in being clear in your position while also being available, welcoming and not shaming toward people who have had a change of heart.

Sit-down dinner DIL
Guest Apr 25, 2:07 p.m.
QUESTION: I'm 100% for not tolerating childish disrespect toward your reasonable house customs and hosting labors. How about workarounds that don't involve cleaning, setting tables, shopping and cooking grown-up menus? Just bare-bones outdoor cookouts. Dessert-only evenings at the card table. Finger food while watching a TV sports event or movie you all agree to watch. Anything except real sit-down meals. And only if your husband will draw a bright line on them trashing you to the family.

For in-laws who refuse to sit
Guest Apr 25, 2:13 p.m.
QUESTION: Personally, I would look for the solution that amused me the most, and I think it would be pretty hilarious to invite in-laws to dinner, set the table (elaborately would be even better), serve the food at the table, but say nothing if the in-laws took their plates and departed. You and your husband could stay at the table and eat as if nothing was happening and in-laws could wander around. What I would NOT do is serve from the kitchen. Make them come to the table to fill their plates then do whatever they like. Better yet, invite other people and have everyone at the table but them.

What physical and mental health resources will she need/possibly need going forward? I have needed to consider this due to my health.

Flight info straw that broke the camel’s back?
Guest Apr 25, 2:32 p.m.
QUESTION: The DIL suggesting therapy to the MIL asking for flight info to me says there is more to the story and that the MIL has other anxiety-based behaviors that she failed to mention. I grew up with an anxious mother who told me not to cross my legs in the passenger front seat of the car because if we were in an accident my legs would be horribly mangled. It is exhausting to deal with. So maybe asking for the flight info was the straw that broke the camel’s back.

In laws at the table
Guest Apr 25, 2:33 p.m.
QUESTION: I wonder if one or both of the in-laws suffers from misphonia- a condition where certain sounds are literally intolerable (like chewing sounds)? While this is in no way an excuse for such rude behavior, it could be an explanation and a way in to come to a more amicable arrangement. I know that the sounds of chewing drive me into a panic and I have to do anything necessary to get away from it- again, not an excuse for a tantrum! But I do use this knowledge to either guide my choices of interactions with others, whether it’s suggesting other activities than a quiet dinner (uuuuhghhhhh) or quietly discussing alternate arrangements if at family gatherings.

Emotional turmoil
Guest Apr 11, 11:16 a.m.
QUESTION: How do I stop hiding things from my husband and my family? I walk around terrified all the time. I always think I have to handle everything myself, that I can never ask for help. But then I end up not dealing with things in the best way sometimes and I get in trouble. I am trying to fix everything, but I am drowning. I'm sick to my stomach all the time, I can't sleep, and I think about running away a lot. I'm so scared I can't breathe. And I don't know what to do. Everyone expects me to take care of everything all the time - my job supports everyone, I pay all the bills. I take care of everyone but no one takes care of me. I don't know how to break out of this circle of hell.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm going to give you this first: It's information for the Crisis Text Line, 741741. It's an immediate place to get help when you're terrified and thinking you can't ask for help. You can. It's right there.

Of a similar nature, if you want to talk, is the 988 Lifeline, though you can also text or chat with this service as well. Use it, please.

As I'm sure you understand on some level, what you're doing is not sustainable because it wouldn't be for anyone -- meaning, it's not your fault or your failure. People just can't carry everyone and everything indefinitely without support. But the thing is, the longer you put off getting help, the more help you will end up needing.

That's why I urge you please to interrupt this cycle asap. Use these free resources. Therapy is where all roads lead in your scenario, but that can be hard to find, arrange, pay for and make time for privately -- so here's a possible shortcut, also a free resource. Even better would be if your employer offers an EAP, which could get you some counseling sessions right away. Let the focus of these first couple of steps be very narrow, just on getting someone to help you take the bigger steps. Take care. Check back in too if you can, if it's not another burden to deal with.

Tired of being Google for my Husband
Guest Apr 11, 11:20 a.m.
QUESTION: Something snapped in me the other day when I realized my husband of 30 years tends to use me as Google instead of doing the research himself. "You want to hire this contractor, is there a better one?", "What are we going to go and what are we going to do on vacation?", "Where should we go to dinner?" and even better "what should I do after I retire?" On the one hand, I appreciate he is asking my opinion, on the other my opinions are most often then rejected out of hand or I am inundated with follow up questions about WHY I made a particular choice or know a particular fact with requests for followup reasoning. Maybe it's analysis paralysis, but I'd just like him to switch shoes and do some research and make a decision! How do I maintain my cool now that I bristle every time we have an exchange like this.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You keep your cool by recognizing that you both pitched into this dynamic for a long time without noticing either your contribution or what you were creating.

And you recognize that if he were the one who had the sudden snap of unpleasant recognition, not you, then you would feel awful if he went from being his normal self to bristling and losing his cool at you without explanation, when for all you knew everything was the same between you as it was yesterday.

I'm not saying you aren't right to be annoyed about some/many/most/all of the things that now annoy you. My point is separate from justification. It's about the fact of long relationships and, in your case, 30 years of slowly building something together. Even if you didn't take active part and just contributed passively with your consent.

If you're going to pivot, then say so, and say why. And the less irritated you can sound about it, the better -- again, because that's what you'd want if your husband were the one abruptly waking up to his unhappiness. Ideally you want to make this a joint project toward a better quality of life together.

Just to give you an idea of what I'm thinking: The nuisance behaviors of his that you describe could stem from habits both of you have developed over the years. If, for example, you've always done the research on X or Y for both of you, year after year by default, then his abilities in that area may have atrophied without either of you realizing it, and now you're tired of always having to research X and Y and he's a weird combination of helpless at it and annoyed he has no agency. Again, just a riff.

The answer is not to be annoyed with each other. It's to say, huh, we let this slide to a place neither of us seems to want, let's try to correct it.

Forgotten grandchildren’s birthday
Guest Apr 11, 11:32 a.m.
QUESTION: My mother in law is a sweet, quiet woman who has begun to have some memory issues. We live far from her and see her once or twice a year. For the last two years, she has forgotten my twin son’s birthdays (they are 10). My kids don’t need gifts but it makes me sad that they don’t even hear from her . I know if she realized she had forgotten she would be sad and embarrassed. Should I say anything to her? Or just let it lie?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Contact her before the birthday every year (and before every other milestone she would want to mark) to "help" her "figure out what they'd like." It's the kind thing for all involved.

If she has already missed it this year, then, sure, let it lie -- because you're the one who's sad, right? If the boys are sad, then put them in touch ... but regularly, not just for their birthdays, because, really, who cares about a birthday. The point is for them to have a relationship with their grandmother, isn't it?

I don't know. Seems to me the issue is not where's-the-once-a-year-contact-for-my-children-on-an-arbitrary-day, but how can I make sure this sweet, quiet woman who raised my spouse (now living far away from her) isn't completely detached from her child's family as she slips into memory loss?

If she is the one holding herself apart, then I'll merge safely back into my lane, but "sad and embarrassed" suggest she does care about staying in touch.

LW Somebody that I used to know
Guest Apr 11, 11:53 a.m.
QUESTION: Earlier this week you had a letter from somebody who, when she runs into her ex-fiance professionally pretends not to know him. The ex has called her out and wants her to knock it off. You do, too, and I think you were too harsh. Her little game of pretending never to have met him when a work acquaintance tries to introduce them is petty af and I am here for it! Not that long ago it was accepted etiquette that divorced people were considered permanently estranged and need not recognize or acknowledge one another if they met socially. It's taking it a bit far to pretend never to have met him, but it is less awkward for the person trying to be polite by introducing them than an icy "we've met" or God forbid the actual truth. Maybe it would be healthier for her to get beyond it, but in the meantime her behavior is merely annoying to the ex (to whom she owes nothing) and neither impolite not truly hurtful. Hurtful is leaving someone at the altar and then expecting them to be okay with it.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I agree with you on one point -- that the LW's charade is "not truly hurtful." Certainly not on the level of walking away from an engagement.

But that's it.

Because I maintain that, while doing so clearly causes pain, walking away from an engagement is the right and brave thing to do if the idea of going through with marriage doesn't feel right. Because that half-hearted, "It would hurt her too much not to follow through" marriage will cause so much more pain over time. So I will not jump on any bandwagon to vilify someone who pulls the plug on an engagement.

Ideally people will face down their conflicted feelings sooner rather than right at the edge of the aisle runner. But even leaving someone at the literal altar is better than going through with a wedding with doubts.

So I'm supposed to cheer on a, what, decade-long campaign of pettiness because it supposedly gives a guy what he richly deserves? No. No no no. It perpetuates that whole terrible "he's the villain" mind set that actually pressures some couples to go through with marriages they really shouldn't.

I wish LW hadn't been hurt. I wish for LW's sake that the fiance, as I said, had come to terms with his doubts way sooner. But that's not how things always play out, and sometimes things end messy.

When they do, our best response is to have the tears and/or the fury and/or the dissection of recent history to see what signs we may have missed that this was coming, then square up and say to ourselves, "You know what? I wish it hadn't ended messy but thank the merciful dogs it ended before we got married." Then regroup, then rebuild, then say when you see your ex at a business conference, ice-free!, "Yes, we've met. You're looking well." Because you can say that, because you've recovered -- or at least you grasp that sounding as if you've recovered seamlessly is really, if this is what we're doing here, the pettiest play of them all.

I need a reality check....

QUESTION: Are many teenagers sullen, messy, and completely annoyed by everything the parent says? Just feeling like I am the only parent right now....
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Did you miss every teen movie and book ever? And your own 12-17-ish?

Sorry, I still have some adolescent in me I guess.

People that age are a roiling mess of self-doubt and feelings and huge new thoughts and they take it out hardest on the ones they trust most to love them through anything and not abandon them. So, you. Plus you annoy them so much you make their cells vibrate with annoyance when you're within two rooms of them. It's not personal.

And it's not only not just you, it's pretty much everyone in your spot at some point.

Be present but not up in their business unless you have to. Be open to talking when the need to talk strikes them, even if it's midnight. The better you are at not taking it personally, the better you will be at the availability part. Getting defensive tends to escalate things needlessly. Last unsolicited thing, "don't take it personally" is not the same thing as being a doormat. Good luck!

Re: tired of being google

QUESTION: Just something to consider. My ex-husband and I had a similar dynamic. At one point we did have a conversation in which he pointed out that I tend to be controlling and often dismissive of his ideas. It was a real eye opener for me as I could, in hindsight, see this behavior in myself. He also had a tendency to not speak up for himself. The combination resulted in a lot of hurt feelings. Once we examined the dynamic it was easier for me to spot when I was being dismissive and I could stop myself, or at least apologize and be a better listener.

ANSWER: Great stuff, thank you. It's so hard to do a self-inventory like this.

I appreciate the example, too, because it's easy to see how this could develop into a lopsided situation over the years without either of you realizing it, like in the OP's case. Years of dismissing his ideas in favor of yours turns into his not offering any ideas at all anymore, and you're doing everything, and ... there you go.

Took guts for both of you to be honest.

QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, I was let go from my dream job at NIH as part of the so-called April Fool's Massacre. I loved our mission, my projects, and my colleagues. Now all that has been torn away and I'm on the outside, looking in. My friends have been amazing, so supportive it just blows me away. My family, not so much. (MAGA really is a cult.) But I have a lot to be grateful for, including severance pay, which I realize those in private industry don't always get. What I'm struggling with is just how passive I've been. I always thought when I reached retirement or otherwise had a block of free time I would do amazing things with it. Instead, I pretty much just... Sleep. And time is ticking by, along with my life. I'm already on medication and working with a counselor for depression and anxiety. How do I get out of this funk and do something instead of just stagnating and wasting the time I do have to try to find work or at least do all those projects I'd dreamed of? Obviously my job was just an excuse before. I have no motivation or ambition. Advice and strategies welcome! Thank you for your light during this dark time for our country.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: First, I am so sorry this is the way your country thanked you for your work. Even if this were about saving taxpayers money, which it never seemed to be, since there were such obviously better ways to do it, and even if it were actually saving taxpayers money, which it pretty glaringly is not, this is just a despicable and inhumane way to go about it and I am horrified it is being done in my name as a taxpayer. Rage.

Second: Whoa, slow down. Barely a week so far is "ticking by" since this all went down. You went through a wringer of uncertainty for months before that, no? Then very abruptly showed up to your new reality. Meanwhile, people who retire or just leave a job with agency (!) and the usual preparation time typically find themselves sleeping a lot and drifting in that big open sea of unstructured days.

So, please be kinder to yourself and more forgiving. Allow yourself some extra sleep. Let the work with the counselor unfold. Let your dreams reconstitute.

The one thing I will say is not to allow yourself too much extra sleep, because that can be a trap. It's a depression accelerator.

And I will also suggest that you spend some of this recovery time outside, walking, if you're able. It can be a surprisingly therapeutic but still unstructured use of your newly free time. Plus if you live near the NIH mothership then you're in the peak moment of earth's renewal, which is a well-timed bit of counterprogramming.

15 year old LW with college and career plans???
Guest Apr 11, 12:24 p.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn, the LW this week who is a 15-year old planing on being a vet and going to college in the UK… left me with my jaw on the floor as the parent of 14-year old twins. Are 15 year olds planning their college years already? Do they really know (like actually) what they want to be “when they grow up” with such specificity? My kids are pretty good students, play sports, hang with their friends… and could not tell you what they want to do as a career or even name a college (unless it’s sports related). Am I way behind all the other parents and their ambitious kids in getting mine focused on college and career in their early teens?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ack, no, please don't take that message way from the column!!

A couple of things to keep in mind. First, the obvious, but reminders never hurt: People have their own developmental pace.

That means some 15-year-olds are thinking college and do have a career goal taking shape. And good for them! That doesn't mean there's something wrong with other kids that age who haven't progressed to that point. (I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life till I was 30.)

What is wrong is when kids push themselves to have it all figured out by X point because they think they're supposed to, and burn their best exploration years checking boxes for the college-admissions chase and/or for a major and career path they think will have a high ROI. What a waste. Worse is when their parents push it on them.

The best thing you can do in this situation is love your kids and give them room to figure it out. If one or both of them catches onto a passion or ambition, then, great -- follow their lead in feeding it. If neither does, then instead of panicking, be grateful for how long that keeps the window of wider exploration open. Both outcomes have their advantages.

It's important not to get sucked into the zero-sum thinking -- that because there are kids like this one, your kids will get squeezed out. There are places for all the kids who want educations.

Re: Forgetful Grandma
Guest Apr 11, 12:26 p.m.
QUESTION: Also, you can facilitate your kids reaching out to their grandmother on their birthday, too. It was not until I became a mother myself that I fully realized that my birthday was actually pretty big day for my mom. (I mean, she did a lot of work that day and I don’t even remember it!) So if grandma forgets to call, go ahead and call her! Be warm and wonderful and do a video call if she can work that technology - “Hi Nana! It’s Sally’s birthday and we wanted to give you a call to say we love you on this special day!” No reason to put the pressure on your MIL in cognitive decline to do something that can easily do with the same result.

When they got engaged, they wanted a ring that felt meaningful, whether it was their fiance's mother's ring, or a non-diamond ring from an antique store, or a diamond ring they chose together that suited their style and budget. There is no "women usually want." There is only what individual women want.

Wanting an expensive ring and wearing it
Guest Apr 11, 12:30 p.m.
QUESTION: Hm, if you're wondering why you bought an expensive ring that isn't getting worn, then ask your person. If it's anyone else, not your business.
I almost never wear my INexpensive engagement ring, that I helped shop for because 1) not a huge jewelry person 2) it's not attached to my wedding band and that's awkward but if it were attached 3) it would catch on things, get dirtier and be harder to clean, etc.
4) sometimes I don't feel like wearing my band, either.
BUT you made a number of assumptions, too. 1) that folks want expensive rings AND asked for them 2) that they even HAVE an engagement ring.
Again, check your assumptions with the only person who matters here- yours.

Mad at friend; who's at fault?
Guest Apr 11, 12:40 p.m.
QUESTION: (online only) Hi. I asked a friend to put me in touch with her adult child for a personal project I'm excited about. She said child is busy. I said "Four minutes, literally. Any of these days/eves/weekend days. People tell me they're happy to share a sentence or two." She just stared and said nothing at all when I asked her to let me know, and we haven't spoken in a week.
She probably thinks I was pushy. Maybe. She knows her child could add something helpful, but if she didn't want to pass along the message, she could have said she didn't want to be a go-between. Fair enough. Instead she clammed up and never responded, which I see as rude. And dropping the rope of conversation is a hostile act. Can I get your perspective?

ANSWER: I'm going with: both. But mostly you. There's no "maybe," you were pushy AF. You knew it was a hint and you didn't take it because you wanted what you wanted when you wanted it. "People tell me they're happy to share a sentence or two"!?

Yes, you were excited, and she could have said, "I'd prefer not to be a go-between." That would have been preferable to going silent on you, for sure. But she ended up there because oh wow you pushed. So apologize to her for pushing. (And don't expect anything in return, because an apology just to get one back isn't an apology.)

Forgotten birthday
Guest Apr 11, 12:46 p.m.
QUESTION: Good advice regarding advance reminder. But if this is a woman who always remembered without fail, then take it as a warning sign that things will degrade from here. Take it from someone who has gone through this with two beloved family members within the last couple of years. Assuming this relationship is important, not just to your kids, but to you and your husband, make more time for it. Increase contact, increase visits. Make memories while you can.
avatar

Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I don't think there's an "if." There are signs of memory loss, so that is the warning sign that things will degrade from here. Unless the spouse intends to have zero involvement in the mother's future life and care plans (which would be pretty unusual), this couple needs to look down that road now and start preparing.

Snide sister
Guest Apr 11, 1:09 p.m.
QUESTION: Today's question about the snide sister constantly putting down her brother really hit home for me. We have a sibling like this in our family. Sibling was clearly one parent's favorite and got far more than the rest of us not only emotionally but materially. When parent did this, parent would rub it in our faces and then demand to know why we weren't happier for sib. It felt like emotional waterboarding.

Sib also feels that need to share harsh and unkind observations, and is accustomed to having the rest of us 'be the bigger person,' or 'let it go, as we were brought up to do. After getting counseling (thank you, couple of excellent therapists) I've gotten better at calling it out. Your 'wow,' and 'that was a really hurtful thing to say' help too.

A couple of years ago, though, sib accused me of something that was not only unkind but also blatantly untrue. Sib had all the evidence to know this was not true but still accused me of going behind their back and plotting to hurt them. I was deeply hurt and massively offended that sib would think I was capable of any of this, let alone fabricate that I'd actually done it.

Sib, when asked to consider the facts, provided an 'I'm sorry if I hurt you' cursory apology followed by a lot of explanation that they were under stress, so I couldn't hold it against them. Sib then whined extensively to favoring parent that I wasn't behaving warmly towards them and parent tried to extract a promise that I'd work things out with Sib. I declined to make the promise, A year ago favoring parent died.

Sib now apparently wants to have a relationship with me but says 'I don't ever want to talk about the past.' I just can't do it on those terms. I think I've forgiven sib--I understand that all the favoritism very much set them up to feel they were never wrong, and much of my anger is at parent. But I also believe forgiveness is one thing but walking back up to the person and saying 'thank you sir, please sir may I have another,' is an entirely different matter.

My rational mind knows it's fine if I believe I also have a say in any terms of reconciliation, but I can't quite get past the suspicion that I'm being horrifically unfair and unforgiving. How do I let go of the idea that it's on me to make this right when I have zero trust or affection left?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You sound remarkably clear-headed about it all, so I don't have much to add.

A few things. First, this seems right, that "all the favoritism very much set them up to feel they were never wrong"; it's been a long-running theme here that favoritism stunts the favorites. Still, some do recover, even to the point of apologizing to the unfavored siblings -- so your sib is not without agency here. You need to hold your healthy boundaries for your own reasons, but it would be a nice side benefit if smacking into them delivered a clue to your sibling.

Second, your rational mind has it right: You have a say in any terms of reconciliation. Period. "I'd be open to the possibility of a relationship, but honest discussion of the past is the only way forward for me. Let me know if you change your mind."

Third, your last sentence is the emotional garble from all the years of cluckery, so just ignore it. Here:

It's on me to make this right but I have zero trust or affection left.

It's not about responsibility or trust or affection. It's just about your sib's offer: You aren't okay with the terms. For reasons. So, you decline it, and propose the terms you would accept. Your sib is free to accept them or decline them. That's why it's really really okay to strip it down to that, without guilt.

Finding a therapist?
Guest Apr 11, 1:27 p.m.
QUESTION: I may or may not need a therapist to help me with a medium level of anxiety. How do I know when it's time to find one? And how do I find one that can ehlp me with my specific issues? p.s. Love the Nedster!
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm going to send you here, to my Resources page, to save me some typing on finding someone. You ask about the specific issue once you've identified a possible provider, though many list their specialites in their bios.

As for when "it's time," to me the answer is, when you're asking whether it's time. Might as well go. It takes some time to set up anyway, so better to go now than when you're in full blown crisis -- and, why not take steps to feel better sooner? "My head hurts, but i'll see if I can wait till tomorrow to take an ibuprofin."

When people don't have access to counseling, that might be the option they're stuck with -- knuckle through it till they can get help. But if help is available to you, then accept it.

Nedster says ❤️. (Did you know he's anti-knitting? It's peaceful resistance, but still.)

Judgmental family
Guest Apr 11, 1:38 p.m.
QUESTION: My daughter is getting married soon and my very judgmental family has me on edge. I am helping her with planning details etc and I find myself only looking through the lens of “what will they think “ - how can I stop worrying about their opinions which will inevitably be snarky and snotty and focus on my daughter’s happiness instead ?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: People whose opinions will "inevitably be snarky and snotty" are rude. Don't plan your daughter's joyful event around rude people.

Do you have to invite them? Seriously. That might be the ultimate wedding gift to your daughter, to show her she doesn't have to sell out her joy to unkind people just because they're related.

If for some reason you decide that's harder than it's worth, then, Plan B, do you have a good friend to help you through this? Someone fun who will actually enjoy ... shopping for rental tablecloths, and can remind you at key points that if these relatives snark at your plans then you're doing something right?

It can't be your daughter, you want to "dump out" here. A place to de-stress, have some giggles.

You do know, I hope, this decoupling from people's opinions of what you do is a bigger project than this one wedding? I mean, who gives an everloving floof what the shriek chorus thinks. The how-to-start-therapy link isn't just for anxiety, it's also for people who've been emotionally ground down to the point where they think they have to pass everyone else's tests.

ANSWER: Aw, yay youngest son.

This is my chance to say again that it is necessary for them to differentiate, to push off from parents so they can see who they are without their parents hovering over them. That wave of annoyance they feel for their adults is really effective and important. Their secrets are important, too. It just gets white-knuckley for parents as they hope it all stays reasonably under control ... as they resist the impulse to dive in to try to control it. Which usually makes things worse. Good times.

Guest Apr 11, 1:49 p.m.
QUESTION: I’m so sorry for what you are going through! Please be kind to yourself. Many of us who haven’t even been as directly affected as you by this administration's cruelty and chaos are struggling. Furthermore, I remember what it was like for me when I retired from federal service two years ago. I planned for it; I was excited by leaving; I had a new, part-time endeavor to step into; yet I felt incredibly depressed for about 2 weeks. All that emotion and a big change was just incredibly draining. Your situation is way more jarring.

So, please heed Carolyn’s advice and get outside every day. Find one other small thing to take care of each day - clean out a closet; contact a friend (and/or other colleagues who are in a similar situation); look into volunteer opportunities; research opportunities for classes; harness those emotions in ways to help protect others - whatever. Allow yourself time to grieve, heal, recover, but don’t give up on yourself or what your new life could be. Hugs and good luck.

About sleeping too much
Guest Apr 11, 2:08 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,

Just had a question about your response where you said sleeping too much can be a depression accelerator. Can you say more about this? I have struggled with depression for years, and when it is bad I am just exhausted all the time and can barely function without sleeping in or taking naps. Without the extra sleep, how are you supposed to get through it?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I am going to refer you to a licensed health professional, which I am not. The caution not to sleep beyond a typical night's sleep is passed along from best practices I discussed with a doctor recently, in the specific context of things people with depression can do outside of medical treatment to ease their depression symptoms and boost the effectiveness of their treatment.

So -- medical treatment would be things like medication and therapy.

These other things included regular exercise; social interaction; attention to nutrition; regular, short (ie not overwhelming), structured attention to keeping spaces clean and uncluttered (e.g. 2 x 15 minutes a day on clearing workspace, doing laundry, basic management); connection with purposeful activities. That last one is a broad category, but covers hobbies, causes, arts, music, etc. Among these was a regular sleep schedule; sleeping in and napping were considered disruptive to the overnight sleep schedule, which contributed to nighttime restlessness and anxiety, daytime grogginess, sense of sluggishness and futility.

Again -- your care plan is personal and that's why the medical consult is your advice.

I spelled out my backing info for context. I also want to say these non-medical things are not depression cures or treatments -- there's often a conflation problem when careful life management is helpful. If anyone tries to use any of what I'm saying here as a justification not to treat depression as an illness or not to go to a doctor, or to yell at me for implying that people can exercise their depression away, or that they can't! then allow me to state here these are all willful misreadings of my point. Not cool. Thank you.

RE: AdRift
Guest Apr 11, 2:08 p.m.
QUESTION: Structure is your friend (now and always) and when you lost your job your structure went away. I 100% agree with Carolyn that you need to be patient with yourself and keep expectations reasonable. BUT you can also use structure to help manage this. Plan lunch dates with friends, or even better, walking dates. Set small goals that are low expectation - read a book, watch a movie, or listen to music rather than get lost online. Commit to a yoga class once a week. Figure out what time of day is most productive and do an hour's worth of chores, then let the rest of the day go. Make a checklist of those chores and check off one per day. Give yourself several months of not doing anything bigger than managing your time (you can even set an end date on the calendar) and then let yourself just observe what it all feels like. This is HARD work, so be kind to yourself!

Petty Ex Left at Alter
Guest Apr 11, 2:32 p.m.
QUESTION: I feel you, Carolyn. But like this person, I suck at moving forward once someone has burned me. It’s much more natural (for me) to hold a grudge and ice people out. I don’t like this quality about myself and wish I could be more forgiving or understanding or whatever the quality is you’re channeling. How do I develop it?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: It's right there in the framing -- "burned me."

It's great that you want to develop a more forgiving and understanding mind set. The quickest path is to familiarize yourself with the "fundamental attibution error." Here's one explanation that seems to cover it, but you can plop it in your browser and read a lot more. It's basically the rationale for getting out of the victim mind set and applying the "we're all just people trying to get by" framework to other people's choices. It's quite freeing. It's nice not to think everyone is a jerk, attacking us, making us carry yet another grudge.

And it takes some practice. If your mental pathway goes right to grrr, then you'll need the mental override to, "Wait, I break up with people sometimes, and I'm not 'burning' them when I do that and I don't deserve to be iced out as if I don't exist." Or, when you get cut off in traffic, say -- instead of getting enraged, remind yourself of the handful of times you did something rude witout realizing it because you didn't understand the merge pattern or you didn't see that car in your blind spot, really! If you keep doing that, then it becomes reflex (except maybe when you're hangry and frazzled and the old reflex breaks through).

Some people will be actual jerks, sure, and acting with malice. It's not all fields of daisies.

Re: concerned about 15 year old letter writer with college plan
Guest Apr 11, 2:38 p.m.
QUESTION: This parent’s concerns about kids being on track hit me. My son (2 years ahead of his sister) had no idea what he wanted to do for many years. His sister knew from age 10. But they both ended up on long tracks to get through their late teen years. My daughter was ill and lost two years of school. My son developed issues with alcohol / marijuana dependence. We were fortunate that both recovered. They both went to community college, then transferred to 4-yr universities and finished grad school at age 27. And, yes, she did end up studying the field she picked as a 10 year old.

This wasn’t our dream path for them. We were very tied up in helping them achieve our idea of success, until life happened and they did it on their schedule. With our support, and without us comparing them to where they “should” be.

As an aside, my son lost a brilliant friend to a fentanyl overdose and another in a car accident where my son was a passenger in another seat of the vehicle.

I completely agree with Carolyn’s response. Love your kids with your whole heart and give them space and support they need to find their way in the world.

A promise is a promise
Guest Apr 4, 11:05 a.m.
QUESTION: When my wife and I were dating, I told her I'd only wanted to have kids if they didn't consume my whole life and I was able to still do things that are important to me like go to the gym before work. My now-wife promised I'd be able to maintain my morning gym workouts. We have an 18mo and an infant. My wife is complaining that my days are too long. They are long. My routine includes leaving the house to get coffee, check email, workout and then work. I get back in time to kiss my 18mo before bed and then spend the rest of the night cleaning up the house and packing for the next day. My wife is complaining she is exhausted with two kids all week and needs some help. In a few months, she is returning to work for the first time since we've had kids and pushing for change from me. I'm feeling cheated and angry. How can I get her to understand that she promised and a promise is a promise is a promise?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yep, a promise is a promise.

You are you and you have your needs and you foresaw them, I do get that. But a reality like this -- how much work kids will require -- is not 100 percent foreseeable. So to enforce it as if it is, at the expense of your wife and kids, is pretty spectacularly selfish and crappy.

So. What are you ready to say about yourself, your child, your wife, your priorities and the variables of life in defending the territory you staked out with this promise?

Do you think your wife agreed to this in bad faith -- i.e., knew full well it was unrealistic to add two kids to your life without making any changes to your schedule, but expected you would change, because who doesn't change to spend more time with his kids?

If that's the case, then you need to say that to her: "I believe you entered our original promise knowing I would have to give up things that were important to me eventually, and figuring I would eventually do so willingly. And I am struggling with that right now."

Or, alternately -- if you don't think it was bad faith, just bad foresight: then you need to be willing to hire out some help to make space for the things you value, instead of expecting your wife to absorb all the extra work displaced by maintaining your routine. Or just pick your priorities and let some other things go.

Because, damn.

Don't want to give them the satisfaction
Guest Apr 4, 11:21 a.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn—

My husband and I tried for two years to conceive naturally, got nowhere, and through counseling finally learned that IVF would be our best recourse. It is not covered by our insurance, and we are not wealthy. However, my parents are affluent and comfortably retired, with low overhead and grown children who are all living independently. So I swallowed my pride and asked whether they would be willing to contribute to the out-of-pocket costs of 1-2 IVF cycles. They took months to get back to me (meanwhile remaining completely warm and chatty on unrelated topics!) and then finally said that they had decided against it, partly because they don't want to lose their financial security—but mostly because they "don't understand" IVF, feel that it's a little bit "unnatural," and vaguely believe that God would give us a baby if it were meant to be.

The hurt and disappointment I felt is hard to express here. I don't feel entitled to their money, but they have helped me and my siblings pay for other things they approved of (college, weddings, expensive grandparent gifts for my nephew).

My husband and I wound up saving aggressively for the next two years and funded our own IVF. We were successful on the first cycle and I'm 18 weeks pregnant. We have shared the news with our family and my parents are jubilant, which really irks me. My mom texts or calls every day to ask about the pregnancy and to squeal about how excited she is to have another grandchild. But I feel that she actively stood in the way of this happening or at least let us twist in the wind, and I don't want to share my joy with them. How do I forgive, without letting them have the satisfaction?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Are you up for a conversation?: "Mom, you turned down our request for financial help -- which of course was your prerogative -- saying you felt IVF was unnatural and that 'God would give us a baby if it were meant to be.' But now that we conceived through IVF with our own money, you're jubilant without any qualms. I hope you can understand why I'm having mixed feelings about your response."

Think about it. It's a fair complaint, for one. Plus, leaving it to harden into a grudge denies the whole family a chance to get past it.

But think about it -- see if time does anything to move you past it naturally. For example, if you start to see this reflects who your parents have always been, committed to their way of seeing things whether there's any integrity to it or not.

Pets

QUESTION: My husband and I are missing our elderly cats who both crossed The rainbow bridge last December. We are elderly as well and wonder whether we should just enjoy our kids’ cats and dogs from time to time. Ever since my husband developed mobility problems the litter box task was mine and was somewhat overwhelming as the cats developed issues associated with aging. Also we don’t have a fenced yard to accommodate a dog—yet! Just looking for advice about 75 year olds adding a pet to our family because we miss their company every day!
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Since I am not there to assess the situation, I can only advise that you bring 100 percent pragmatism and foresight to assessing the situation yourself to counteract any wishful thinking. Wishful thinking can be harmful to animals especially, since they are so vulnerable, but also to the humans who care for them.

Lots of things to consider, but first I wonder if your husband is still ambulatory. Someone with difficulty walking + a pet may = an increased risk of falls.

Second, because you already mentioned overwhelm with prior pet care, I would say the minimum would be to have backup care in place before taking on a pet. By that I mean both daily drop-ins from a paid dogwalker/catsitter (great job for a reliable neighborhood kid) and a backup place for the pet to go in the event the animal needs a new home.

Third, think cat, not dog, unless you're sure you can meet the exercise and socialization needs of a dog.

Possible fourth point, if you have a person in your life (adult child, neighbor, other quasi-caregiver) to whom the care of or responsibility for this animal might devolve, then talk to that person, too, as a courtesy.

Of course the easy answer is not to do it, for all the reasons, but animal companionship is so rewarding that it is worth considering if you can pre-answer all of these questions and issues -- especially if you can afford to.

Letting go of my brother due to politics

ANSWER: Things don't have to be permanent. The conversations are too combative, so you send the message that you won't continue to take part in them on these terms. You do that by taking a break and saying why.

You can check in again in, say, a month to see if pulling back was effective. If he brings up the same stuff and gets combative again, then you remind him you're not interested in this experience with him, you're hanging up now, you'll try again in a bit.

Repeat, once a month, see what happens. If you feel you can be healthy as you maintain this schedule, then keep at it. See if he can shift to other topics with you. If it's still too much, then try 6 weeks, then 2 months. Etc.

The "completely end" may happen, but there can be a lot of interim steps before you get there, if you want there to be. That's what I'm saying.

Divorce
Guest Apr 4, 11:51 a.m.
QUESTION: I was married for 40 years and just filed for divorce. I was expecting to feel relief, but am just feeling sad even though I think it was the right decision. Also, a little fearful of the future. Any advice or input from anyone who has been there
And how to move forward.

ANSWER: This is definitely one of those YMMV situations, but I think this part is pretty common -- that when you have been in a certain place or status for a long time, the first days of Something Else have an element of fear to them. It's just hard to envision what the new thing will be. It's kind of a big gray blank. And when we can't envision things, there's a sense of low level animal panic. In my experience at least.

The best advice I have for that is to take deep breaths and trust yourself and get through the days the best you can -- making good decisions for yourself, being your best advocate. Because the other thing that's more than common, probably universal, is that we are built to adapt. You will get used to this as your normal, and before you know it your ability to envision a future will come back to you.

Re A promise is a promise
Guest Apr 4, 11:52 a.m.
QUESTION: Man, I was SMDH through the entire question. What you asked for, per you: going to the gym before work. What you're doing: running out of the house first thing for coffee elsewhere where you sit and quietly read email, then go work out, then go straight to work and then home? Those are not the same requests. If I were your wife, I'd be mightily upset at you, too. Can you maintain your gym workouts by then coming home afterward? Make coffee at home and take it with you to the gym so free up a little time? There are ways you can make more space for your family but failing to compromise, or believing that your children are somehow a scheduling bait-and-switch on your wife's part, is a selfish viewpoint.

QUESTION: Does your mom know that the child was conceived via IVF or is part of the jubilant reaction that she thinks this pregnancy was non-IVF assisted and, rephrasing here, it's a God-given baby that was meant to be? Because that's a very different kettle of fish.

Nosy or helpful neighbor
Guest Apr 4, 12:20 p.m.
QUESTION: Our neighbor’s trash can was knocked over by wildlife a few days ago. They picked up the can but left a large mound of trash in the alley (I walk by this every day). Would I be a helpful neighbor if I picked up their trash (wearing gloves)? Or a nosy neighbor because I can see that the trash includes empty prescription bottles and other personal items? (The trash is technically in the public right-of-way in the alley. Not on their property). I don’t know them. What is the “I want to be a good person” thing to do?

ANSWER: This didn't go where I thought it was going. It is/was your neighbor's responsibility, but if they're not dealing with it then, yes, go for it. ASAP. You don't want this out there drawing other vermin.

I wouldn't give a second thought to issues of nosiness or privacy, especially after they've left it out there for days. No peering at labels.

Neighbors
Guest Apr 4, 12:35 p.m.
QUESTION: I had a falling out with my neighbors gradually over political issues, hey, ain't that America, something to see.

Nothing got through until yesterday, out of nowhere, when the 10,000th something stupid cost them some money so they now feel lied to and apologized and is it too wrong if I just think it's already too late?

We're all having to find out from their {redacted} around and it's just beginning .

I guess I'm supposed to think better late than never, I'm just not there yet. What a dumb, dumb world we chose here.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I can't argue with much here, nice touch of John Mellencamp.

A couple of things before I make a huge ask. First, well, maybe it's the only thing? The money hit to people like your neighbors is getting the big attention, but the flouting of due process is what I wish had been the universal Find Out from the "{redacted} around." People getting grabbed off the street by unmarked, sometimes masked law enforcement, spirited off and locked up (do I need to specify inhumanely?) only on the administration's say-so, without their presenting any case/evidence before a judge: That is the death of freedom for everyone. Especially when the judge says "You can't do that" and they don't turn the planes around. That means anyone, literally anyone, can become the next person they decide doesn't have rights because the administration welp just doesn't like what they said. We are kidding ourselves if we think people who smirk about acting with impunity toward Group A will suddenly color within the lines with their treatment of Group B. If one set of papers doesn't matter, then no one's papers matter. This is the 2 + 2 of the past few weeks. A couple of links:

Are you freaking kidding me.

Robin Givhan has a roundup here.

But I could post 20 if I had time.

Okay, here's my ask. I'm going to zero in on your "yet." Take your time and do some breathing or pillow-punching or whatever it takes, but: There can't be a "too late."

There just can't.

Anyone who "now feel[s] lied to and apologize[s]" needs to hear, "Apology accepted, thank you, welcome." That's because the cruelty is killing people, and we need a way out of the cruelty, and that means making it as easy as possibly -- appealing even -- for people to walk away from it. Which means not punishing anyone with the courage to regret voting for it.

re Neighbor Garbage
Guest Apr 4, 12:38 p.m.
QUESTION: 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 For the person who just wants to clean up the trash left by a neighbor in the common area. In our neighborhood, issues like this become such a huge issue that causes arguments, strife, and tension. I have neighbors who patrol the neighborhood and take photos and knock on doors to complain about so many small things. It makes this terrible place to live. I so appreciate your offer to extend some grace and just clean it up and move on. You don’t know what’s happening with those people - maybe this is the worst week of their lives and the garbage is super low on the to-do list. If it becomes an ongoing issue, then it makes sense to say something politely. But huge kudos to you for not making federal case out of this.

Re Promise
Guest Apr 4, 12:48 p.m.
QUESTION: As a family lawyer, when I hear someone casually complaining in this way, I sometimes share what a judge would think of their complaint during a divorce proceeding. And I can assure you that this “promise” has absolutely no validity. Zero. You have not a single leg to stand on, are being ridiculous, and you would get laughed out of any court in the nation. You are a grown man who fathered not one, but two children. Those children are your legal responsibility. You cannot claim that you were tricked into having these children. You cannot shirk your duty to your children because you want to go to the gym instead. You can choose to be a good or bad father, but you don’t get to choose not to be a father at this point. You either make this work with your wife and keep your family together. Or your wife will come to her senses and hire someone like me who will make you take responsibility in a court of law - with your time and/or money.

ANSWER: This is a satisfying read, thank you. But it still leaves me so sad for the kids whose dad is just so angry they exist as an obstacle to his old routine.

So, OP. Were you loved as a child? Do you know how that felt?

If you do know, then please, move heaven and earth to give your babies that same feeling. Make sure they never doubt they're loved and have that certainty to keep them warm into adulthood, even on their worst days.

If you don't know, then please move heaven and earth to make sure they don't grow up wondering, as you did, how different their lives could have been if they had been loved.

I think this is a fair offer.

For the person who can't forgive
Guest Apr 4, 12:53 p.m.
QUESTION: I'd echo Carolyn's sentiment about generosity to someone who voted for the current administration and is now regretting it. In the current polarized atmosphere, it takes A LOT of guts for someone to say out loud that they are sorry and they regretted it. This person didn't just think it- they found you and told you. I fully appreciate all the feelings your having now, and I'm sure I'd have the same ones, but at least recognize that they didn't have to say anything at all- they seem to be intentionally trying to repair and that, if nothing else, should be encouraged.

QUESTION: My sister is the type of person that can be loving and funny one moment and aggressive and difficult the next. I'm realizing my life is a whole lot better without her in it. She has had mental health issues in the past and is extremely bright. She will enter into a disagreement like her life depends on winning it and I'm just so not in the game anymore. Whats the best way to forgive the hurt she has caused, own my own part and lay out why I'm not willing to be here for it anymore.

Gruge holding husband
Guest Apr 4, 1:10 p.m.
QUESTION: My husband (73) can hold a grudge longer than anyone I know. He will never just let things go. It become a problem when I try to convince him to forgive and forget and he takes that as my siding with the offender and a huge fight will ensue. Who needs counseling, him or me? (he has refused BTW)
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Well, then what's the point of my saying he's the one who "needs" it?

If you want things to change between you, then apparently you're the one who will have to make the changes. Therapy can be one of those changes. Go and have some good talks. Another change can be a decision not to "try" anymore to "convince him to forgive and forget." If he wants to stew in his old resentments, then let him. You can live your life breathing the clean air of forgiveness.

If he's trying to, for example, keep you from seeing friends because they're on his grudge list, then that's something else -- but you do have agency, right? You don't need him to give you permission?

Or is that the real issue, he uses his resentments to limit what the two of you do as a couple. If so, that's more than just grudge-holding. That's control, and another point in favor of your talking to a therapist yourself.

Re: IVF
Guest Apr 4, 1:35 p.m.
QUESTION: My mom did the same thing except it was about my husband. She didn't think I should marry him, and she hated our wedding choices, but you'd never know it now. For the last 15 years, my mom sings my husband's praises and goes on and on about how our wedding was the best wedding she'd ever been to. Both of us saw my mom for what she was doing: backtracking after she saw things were going to work out and she was terrified about not being able to see her daughter and grandchildren. She was right! My mom has never apologized or explained herself, not that it would matter if she did, even though I asked her. I can't forgive her. Give your parents a chance to explain themselves, but don't wait until the baby is born. Don't push yourself to get past it either. If you can't, you can't. No one would blame you for not letting them see your child.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whoa, wait a minute: "not that it would matter if she did"? Really?

I can see being skeptical of the just-backtracking-for-fear-I'll-never-see-my-grandchildren non-apology-apology.

But a genuine apology, to my mind, deserves to matter. If not always, then darn close to it.

Even over something stupid and bad-faith like hating your wedding choices, which is pretty much the surest way to squander a lot of parental goodwill for zero potential return. (Objections to a choice of spouse are more complicated -- still not a great idea, but heartfelt concern is at least in play there.)

Idunno. You asked her, so maybe you think this too, and you're just really (deservedly) angry?

I'm sorry she's too small a person to admit fault. Sounds like all her praise gushing is the best her ego can do.

avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Well, if you put it that way. But that's not the either-or. It's either the parents get on board with it when the couple are asking for needed financial support, or the parents say, when the couple conceive via IVF after two years of scraping their pennies together: "Oh, we get it now, assisted or un-, a pregnancy is joyous news of a coming grandbaby. I'm sorry we balked at helping you with IVF" ... and ideally will, say, help with other expenses, or open a college account for the baby, etc. Since the couple probably did put a hurting on their savings for this effort.

Tired of being polite
Guest Apr 4, 1:59 p.m.
QUESTION: This has been building for years now, but I feel nearly depleted by the lack of consideration and basic manners in society. I’m forever stepping off the sidewalk so people can walk two abreast, or saying “thank you” to cashiers that literally don’t say a word to me, or waving the other person through when there’s confusion at a 4-way stop. And it feels like no one ever does any of that for me. I let the person with a few items go ahead of me at the store, or wait patiently when someone has trouble parking. No one lets me go ahead and I get honked at. I’m in my 50s and certainly not a saint, but I’m so tired of giving others consideration that’s rarely extended to me. How do I not throw up my hands and just become the type of person I resent? It sounds more appealing than being walked on all the time.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I feel you. But the alternative doesn't make much sense (except maybe with the sidewalk-stepping). Thank-yous and other kindnesses to people, especially those in service work, are never wasted. Even when not reciprocated, they are a net benefit to the system. I liken it to a 20-minute walk. Even if you're not doing it every day and getting in shape from it or making progress toward your fitness goal, you're still better for having done it than you would have been if you hadn't.

Waving people through intersections and letting people go ahead in checkout lines involve a small sacrifice from you, so carry a different benefit. I think those can actually send someone off into their day a teeny bit more optimistic about humanity. A wee smidge. So even if it's not coming back around to you, I think it's a great practice to continue, if you can remain forward-thinking enough to bear it. Maybe that person will be less angry with others a mile down the road. And that's to your credit.

The parking situation? Not stooping to impatience is purely for you. You gain nothing from honking except reducing yourself to an angry troll and knowing you inflicted more stress on the person just trying to park. So don't even think about it.

(And note to anyone out there who does this: Just freaking stop. Thank you. It never once in recorded automotive history ever made anyone park any faster, just more anxiously, at the likely expense of neighboring cars' paint jobs. Yours, at some point, if there's any cosmic justice.)

Last thing, the sidewalk: Don't step off. That's excessive deference to the entitled. Plowing through them isn't ideal, either, tempting though it may be, so I've settled on standing still to allow them to flow past. I'll post others' ideas if you send them in.

Anyway -- I hope this approach > "fork it."

Aunt in white jeans at wedding
Guest Apr 4, 2:00 p.m.
QUESTION: I still think the aunt was issuing some kind of (bleep) you, perhaps to the couple but maybe to the whole family.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Maybe so, but the only play was to ignore it and be exactly as gracious a host to her as to everyone else.

Here's why. If she left her home thinking this was the right thing to wear, then of course the thing to do is to treat her as if she fits right in and looks lovely. Right?

If she chose her outfit as some kind of [bleep] you, then what better response than to be unfailingly gracious to her? Then she gets to feel one of two ways: 1. Nobody even noticed her big bird flip. 2. Anyone who did notice was too polished or kind (or too wily) to take her bait. It's the [bleep] you falling in a forest, with no one there to hear.

Win-win.

Another farewell
Guest Apr 4, 2:20 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn.

I'm not writing this with the intent of it being published in the chat, but I certainly don't mind if it is. Like numerous folks before, this is a farewell. I cancelled my subscription just before the election, and my access is coming to an end in a few days.

I kept hoping ... SOMETHING ... would happen that would make me change my mind. Instead, as the current administration has been even worse than I could have imagined even in fever dreams, the Post's ownership and editorial leadership has increasingly bent the knee to the current occupant of the people's house, who seems to want nothing so much as to punish the entire country for daring to reject him in 2020. The constant exit of bright, talented, passionate writers, hitting its peak (nadir?) with Eugene Robinson's resignation has cemented my decision.

I've not ever had a question for you, but reading your advice over the decades (!) has helped me along the way - before needing to ask them in many cases. Even before I subscribed to the Post, I followed you back in your syndicated days, and I will miss the daily dose and (especially) the holiday and wedding hoots and the weekly Ned fixes. My best to you and yours, and a fervent hope we all survive the next four years (somehow we still have almost a full four years of this ... insanity left) mostly unscathed.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Thank you for the note. I too am heartbroken to see Gene go; he is not only a great columnist, but also a remarkably decent human being. He led the Style section back in the early days of my column and his support was invaluable. Best office holiday parties ever, too.

I will also say this: Given the announced changes to the Opinion section, I expect there will be more turnover. If you had said to me before that you were looking to this part of The Post for your "SOMETHING," then I would have suggested you look instead to the news side.

That is where The Post ownership is not directing coverage. Instead, it news side is behind the same wall it has always been -- which means the owner and publisher hire top editors and then let them do their jobs.

I never know when a reader asking about the changes at The Post is aware of the difference, so I err on the side of over-explaining, because it's such an important distinction: News side is its own thing, and is covering the administration and everything else it covers under the direction of editors, not ownership. The Post's news coverage has borne this out.

Keeping a level head is a thing to do, at first. Then it becomes something to build on.

Re: another farewell
Guest Apr 4, 2:53 p.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn - thank you for explaining the news side of the house at the Post. I've been confused by people who balk that I get my updates from the Post (they don't) and it dawned on me that all they are hearing is how controlling the owners are, but haven't actually read the quite informed and facts-driven reporting. I am lucky in that as a federal employee I have access to the Post for free, and if I'm being honest, I probably wouldn't pay for a subscription on my own given the uncertainty in my job status. Here's to hoping the administration does not take this perk away from us and thank you for your wonderfully direct advice and much needed candor as the world gets a bit more insane each day.

ANSWER: You're welcome, and thanks for the anecdote, because I'm never sure where my information is landing.

Here's another thing. I'll link to my colleague Erik Wemple on the fact that 3,200 newspapers have closed in the past decade. Do you know who loves this? People in power who want to get away with stuff without being held accountable. People who love low-information voters.

So as long as The Post is fighting to hold people accountable, I will support The Post. I support other news outlets, too -- the narrowing of the business is catastrophic. It is part of why we are where we are.

Also, there is great stuff coming out of the Opinion side too. Monica Hesse is a must-read. Dana Milbank was born to bring black humor to the end times. Just for two because all this linking is taking me forever. As I said, that part of the paper is in flux, but they're there now and I read every word.
Opinion | It’s a 🤦🤦‍♂️🤦🏽 week for Trump’s 🤡🤡🤡 national security team

Opinion | What exactly does Trump think is in the Smithsonian?

Opinion | This Sling TV ad made me really mad

One more for being polite to service workers
Guest Apr 4, 2:56 p.m.
QUESTION: I was buying a washer/dryer on the weekend and the salesman very sincerely remarked to me "you are so nice to work with, you really are," and it broke my heart to think that my baseline politeness on a Saturday morning warranted that sort of response.

ANSWER: Ah, breaks my heart, too. But the flip side is, you made this person's day. One ray of light at a time I guess.

Combative Phone Coversations
Guest Apr 4, 3:04 p.m.
QUESTION: My husband has this method with his parents: If they start talking politics, he ends the call. He told them he would start doing this, and he even started to time it. "10 minutes in and you brought up politics, bye." And, it worked! On the last call, his dad made it 50 minutes. Even then, the calls are still fewer and farrer between because, for his isolated parents who only consume propaganda, their reality is very distorted and they are not interested in anything but the topic du jour that they are being told to be angry about.

ANSWER: It really is remarkable how effective it can be. Similar to "gray rock" responses to people who like to stir the pot. We really do control what we talk about with people. No means no if you hold the line.

Comments closing at the end of the chat
Guest Apr 4, 3:10 p.m.
QUESTION: Haxvillians used to be able to hang around and chat about the chat. Recently, the comments have been closing at the end of the chat. Can we go back to having the comments open for longer, like the two or three days on the regular columns?
Haben Kelati
Hi, chat producer here. Apologies! The comments closing as the chat ends is a glitch we are trying to fix. They should be open again now. Thanks to everyone who flagged this!

Chaos theory
Guest Apr 4, 3:13 p.m.
QUESTION: If you are overwhelmed with current meaness and stupidity, do something nice. Pick up your neighbors' spilled trash. Be kind to service people. Greet the side-by-side folks on the sidewalk with a pleasant "good morning." Love your kids and dogs even when it's hard. Love your parents - even when it's hard. Subscribe to your most local paper. Go to the library. Offer grace to those around you.

Ned's April cherry blossom dog collar , which to be accurate I'll have to bring out a couple of weeks early every year and then take off after the first hard rain, definitely before the parade.

Update from LW with adopted daughter
Guest Apr 4, 4:31 p.m.
QUESTION: I saw my letter this week. Things are okay. My daughter and I went to family therapy together and worked some stuff out. It can still get a little weird between us sometimes but we accept that. My parents abstained but we accept that too. They said they were going to tell her all when she was 18 and she seems to believe them. Her bio-dad started all of this because he told his fiancee about our daughter and the fiancee wanted to meet her. He went directly to our daughter because he figured my parents would say no. He thought maybe he still had some rights since he never signed any papers but my folks sent notices to his work place and his sister's house (his last known residence) and the judge said 'good enough' and terminated his rights. Our daughter didn't want to meet his fiancee or him and that's the last we've heard from him. I think things worked out as well as can be expected

ANSWER: Thank you for this. I'm glad you and your daughter are working through the weird. In fact, that you're both committed to doing it is the best possible outcome, really.

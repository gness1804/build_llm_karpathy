QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, Happy Halloween!

There is a ring of moms in my neighborhood, we've all become friends as many of us are staying home with our young children. One mom, "Paige," loves to make treats for the kids, give them all little gifts (for example she left them all a "boo basket" last night that they found this morning upon waking up), and invite people to send their kids over for a couple hours if we have an errand to run. It is all so lovely and kind, and yet she NEVER lets anyone reciprocate. I have invited her countless times to let me watch her daughter while she steps out (as a bonus, this would help entertain my kids, who love playing with hers), but she always says no even if I know she does not have an alternative. There is no real space for anyone else to do things like the boo baskets because she always does it so well and so early that we can't really compete.

Is it ok that some people are just givers who never want to take? (But, I don't want it to be thought that my family takes and doesn't give!)

ANSWER: There may be no space to give back, I've definitely seen this -- but is there no space for conversation, either? One-on-one with Paige: "You do so much for the rest of us -- always so kind and thoughtful. I am not comfortable, though, with how lopsided things have become. I have never been a 'taker.' If you won't let me reciprocate in kind by watching your daughter, then will you at least name something I can do to put the accounts more in balance?"

She may still rebuff you, but at least then you will be on the record with your discomfort with taking advantage. Not to get too alarmist or put ideas in your head, but a mom who always hosts and never ever ever lets other parents reciprocate may have had a bad experience herself as a child in another's care and this may be her way of being vigilant without denying her kid a full community social life. Just ... I don't know. There are plenty of other possible explanations but it rang a bell, let's say.

The second thing this conversation accomplishes -- again, assuming Paige doesn't respond with some concrete suggestion for you -- is to free you from any expectation that she will say yes to balance. Now you can take it upon yourself to do something nice for Paige on your own. Pay attention, see where she shops for treats or how she decorates or what she does for fun or whatever, and buy her gift cards periodically and generally spoil her a little. Presumably she won't give things back?
Wait, there's more to my intro that I forgot ... I will be off next Friday for more routine maintenance. Back the Friday after as usual.

Sorry I was a couple of minutes late today, too, I get stuck in pre-reading sometimes, even when I set alarms. Please accept this Ned as a gesture of healing. (Can you see where the ball is, off frame?)
Your column
QUESTION: I think if you had come out and said that you were going to change up your production commitment. We would all understand. But the sudden cut of the cartoons and daily columns was a bit abrupt, hence why some people want to know why they can't see you as usual. In the Post we got used to yours being the only reliable column to appear in the Style section. Now not so much. I've always loved your snark and honesty and understood why you went from 2-3 questions daily to one but I know it had to be a huge burden to do daily. So go ahead and dial it back but admit to it. I retired so can you.

ANSWER: I did! I came right out and said it. In the chat right before it happened, and then there was a notice on the columns that published that week.

I suggested I film myself doing an interpretive dance, but that was voted down. Ned was the decisive vote, brindly little twit.

(I really, really don't understand any of this, and am not retiring, as the announcement spelled out. And the 2-3 questions to 1 thing? Um. That was basic evolution. Every advice column out there does quick hits, so I decided to go the other way -- but not in some announcement-worthy moment of discovery, but gradually.)

--Mystified at My Desk
Husband's therapist seems to want him to cheat.
QUESTION: Several months ago I found some old messages my husband had sent to young women on an "arrangements" website. It was apparent he never followed through, but I was devastated. After lots of tears and pleading from him, I agreed to stay with him, but only if he agreed to therapy.

The problem is, his therapist, a guy, has emboldened him. Before, he was emphatic that he was in the wrong, that it was a moment of weakness, and that it would never happen again. But now, he's almost indignant, saying our sex drive used to be the same but now mine is much lower, and that I have a responsibility to tend to his needs, one way or the other. He's pushing me to have sex (when he knows I'm less interested), to take libido-enhancing drugs (which he knows I'm against), and even that I should agree to let him be fill his needs with these "arrangements" since his love for me has not changed (using marital money and exposing me to disease).

The worst part is that he's weaponizing his therapist against me. All this pushing is at his therapist's behest, and when I push back, and tell him to stop violating my boundaries, I'm met with "but my therapist said X" and then he won't budge. Someone wrote on chat a few months ago about a spouse using their therapist as a marital appeals court, and that's what it feels like.

Truthfully I want him to stop seeing this therapist who is putting all these marriage-ending ideas in his head, and to stick with his first instincts -- that he screwed up and won't do it again. But I'm the one who insisted on therapy so I don't know how I do this. Advice?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I can see why you want the therapist off the scene. Your husband's "first instincts" response sounded much more in your favor -- mainly because it let you believe this would all go away and you could go back to the marriage you thought you had before your awful discovery.

Thing is, that whole "my bad" and "I'll never do it again" reaction is a panic response from someone who doesn't want to break anything. It's scary to think it might all be over in an instant. So people, when caught, tend to do what your husband did and try desperately, reflexively to hold the status quo together. This doesn't make the underlying stuff go away.

I (and you) don't know that the therapist is saying to your husband. But I have a pretty good idea, if he's doing his job, that he's getting at the unhappiness and frustration that led your husband to sneak around on websites. And urging your husband to talk to you instead. Wouldn't that make sense, when you see it spelled out that way?

The therapist could be guiding your husband (not advising, remember, that's not what they do) to say out loud how unhappy he is that you decided unilaterally without conversation or remediation effort that sex would dwindle to near nothingness, and that he would have no recourse because you were also deciding unilaterally that it was monogamy or bust -- again without conversation.

This is, arguably, a fair beef -- not the unilateral decision on sex, because that is what it is (the alternative being rape), but the "without conversation." I say arguably because two people can differ on what "no" conversation or effort means.

It's also possible your husband came home from this work and spun it as "My therapist says you owe me X." You don't know how well he's representing the therapy. And no means no regardless, once conversation is had -- but it's discussion of options and recourse between you.

So, two possible ways out of this blind alley. One is to see if your husband (and the therapist) will agree to have you join him for a session. The other is to enter couples counseling in addition to your husband's individual. Pretty common configuration. You could also do both, sequentially. But expecting to shoo away the problem with the therapist is not realistic. I'm sorry.
Needing a break doesn't mean I don't care
QUESTION: Hello. I’m having a difficult time conversing with my teenager (age 17) about politics and world events. We’re mostly on the same page as far as values and concerns. The difficulty lies in my needing time away from all the doom scrolling and negative energy. He wants to talk about politics and what is wrong in the world all the time. I do not. We do have lots of conversations about these topics, but I cannot handle it 24/7. When I say I don't feel up to continuing a conversation, he says “well I can’t just ignore that this stuff is happening.” When I try to talk about something positive, his response is to find the negative. It’s like we live in a Debbie Downer episode.

I’ve explained that needing time away from negative news doesn’t mean I’m ignoring it, don’t agree with him, don’t think it’s real, or don’t care about it. We’ve talked about focusing on what you can do now, rather than spending all your time agonizing about an uncertain future. We’ve talked about finding pleasure in small things, which will invariably turn into a conversation about something negative about that nice thing. (Like, I say the flowers in the garden look so pretty right now and he says, not for long with how we’re ruining the environment). It’s not like I don’t think about these issues, but I find value in spending time appreciating things just to appreciate them regardless of where we’re headed as a society.

Some background in case it helps – my child does suffer from anxiety and depression (as do I) and is already on medication and in therapy (as am I). He is also on the spectrum and tends to obsess over topics.

I wish I could help him see the value in turning off the negativity, and that doing so doesn't mean you don't care. I don’t know how to do that beyond what I’m already doing, but I would love some suggestions. As I'm writing this I'm also realizing that I am sad because it seems like my child doesn't respect me or see that I do really care about this stuff. I'm not sure there's an answer for that part.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: All the elements of this -- the over-talking, the doom looping, the anxiety and depression, the parenting challenge -- all point to relief in the form of a concrete action framework.

For example, your kid needs things he can do right now, vs. talking about focusing on things he can do now. Canvassing/phone banking if he's into politics, omg food banks need everything -- any community organizing or volunteering. But apolitical works too, like an animal shelter.

You and your kid would get along better if you were doing this productive thing together, including talking about it for specific organizational purposes, instead of talking generally about all the problems.

Your correct diagnosis of negativity exhaustion, and your prescription of "talk about something positive," would land more effectively if it were part of a cycle of effectiveness: You will do your Productive Thing better if you take this rest period to restore your productivity. This is where your kid is right now. Bonus, this is also correct -- the most productive people are the ones who rest. So you won't be trying to sell flowers to your kid in the vacuum of pleasestoptalkingIneedflowers!!! anymore, which obviously doesn't resonate with him. You can even incorporate two other truths: Beauty and peace are what you're fighting the negativity for, right? So it makes sense to devote time to appreciating those, too. And, you can also actively cultivate them. The values don't promote themselves. Plant and nurture, literally and figuratively.

Do, though, take the "it seems like my child doesn't respect me" out of it. He's 17, there's a good, developmental chance he's actively hating you right now. He's just doing his job, though, of differentiating himself from you, and the more personally you take it, the harder you make it for him. Just love him and trust he loves you through all the aaaaaaarghggggghhhh (wait -- can you mentally conjure the Tasmanian Devil cartoon sound? Imagine that's his psyche till 18-ish. It helps.)
Husband’s therapist
QUESTION: It could be that the therapist is encouraging the husband to be more upfront about his sexual needs, and Husband is taking it the extra step (all on his own), after being validated that his feelings and needs exist, to assuming ergo he is entitled to having things “his way”. The therapist may only be encouraging him to start the conversation. If the husband is going from that “point A” zooming past discussion to his own “Point Z” of feeling allowed to bully and gaslight to get what he wants, I see many many red flags a-waving that have more to do with the husband than the therapist.

QUESTION: If you and Paige are part of a group of friends, surely the lot of you have gone to get coffee at some point, correct? If not, try suggesting that. Once you know Paige's specific order of coffee/tea/whatever, occasionally get one for her and drop it off at her house. This works best if it's on a random afternoon, FYI. And on the off chance that Paige ever has an extreme emergency and asks if she can take you up on the child care offer, do that if at all possible -- life is full of the unexpected. On a side note, both you and Paige sound delightful -- thanks for making the world a kinder place.

QUESTION: How should a dinner bill be split when it’s a couple and a single person?!
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Into 2/3 and 1/3, unless one of the parties wants to treat everyone, and I'm answering this incredibly obvious question only because I hear there are still people out there who try to stick the single with half because it's "easier," and NO, people do not get to make their crappy arithmetic skills anyone else's problem. Which includes forcing the single person into the awkward "nope" position.

Was that the question?
Therapy as a condition
QUESTION: I once made therapy a condition of staying with a partner. The partner did get into therapy (desperately didn't want to have to leave our home), but did it for my reasons not theirs. Of course it didn't go the way I hoped. The person has to be in therapy for their own reasons, not on someone else's orders. My then-partner tried and did make a little progress but not with the issues that had led me to set that condition. Later (after we broke up), my ex started therapy for other reasons--their own reasons--and made much more progress over a period of a few years. I learned a lot of lessons from that relationship and breakup in terms of what is mine and what is the other person's. I would never ever set that condition again.
Needing a break doesn't mean I don't care
QUESTION: Advice I give to everyone: pick your lane. Pick your movement or issue and focus your time, energy, attention, money there. Trust that the people in the other movements are doing their work in their lane just like you're doing work in yours. They will tap you in when they need you; you will tap them in when you need them. One of us can't solve every problem -- and if we spend all our time trying to solve everything, we'll be too burnt out to solve anything. Also rest and joy are resistance :)
Re: husband’s therapist
QUESTION: What Carolyn said, but I’d also ask yourself this - what, if anything, are you willing to do to address your husband’s unhappiness with the state of your sex life, including, as Carolyn suggests, sitting down to talk to him about it? Or talking to a therapist or other medical professional to see what possibilities are out there to improve things for both of you? I’d also question your assumption that the therapist is putting ideas in your husband’s head - clearly, he’s been unhappy about the state of your marriage for some time, and your response - at least as detailed here - is for him to bury that unhappiness somewhere, and never talk about it - and for both of you to continue to do nothing constructive to address it.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Right, thanks. It is really easy to vilify someone who is doing and saying all the sketchy stuff this husband is doing -- and, in fairness, the extent of the sketchiness may be more than the marriage can or should withstand. But that doesn't change the fact of the mutual responsibility in a marriage to hear each other out and respect each other's needs and feelings -- even as each of you retains full veto power over your individual actions. All his wrongness doesn't make it a valid option to, like you said, "bury that unhappiness somewhere, and never talk about it."
RE: Mystified at My Desk

RE: Paige
QUESTION: I knew someone who was always a giver and never a taker. I concluded she was a bit of a narcissist and it was extremely important to her to be the nicest, most generous person. She wanted ooh, aahs and thanks, not competition. Once I figured that out, I stopped trying to return the favors and gave her the warm thanks she wanted.
Where is the line?
QUESTION: Where is the line between a reasonable ask of a partner and asking them to change who they are?

I'm not talking about abuse - I'm talking about (for example), a complete one-sided overhaul of a communication style that otherwise works in other areas of their life (both personally and professionally).

I've been struggling with this for over a year - both in and out of therapy - and still don't feel like I have a good answer for this. I feel like my spouse married a direct, confident, assertive, gets-stuff-done person and then seems to resent the fact that their spouse is direct, confident, assertive, and gets-stuff-done.

I also recognize that it can be a lot to be with a person like me, and that there's (always) room for me to improve as a person and inject more thoughtfulness into my communication. I think I've gotten a lot better at asking questions and reigning in places where assertiveness could veer into steamrolling.

But I also don't think that change in communication can be one sided, and he resists my (and our couples therapist's) ongoing point that we need to meet in the middle on communication changes because there's two of us involved.

Any insight on the line between reasonable behavior modification vs change who you fundamentally are would be appreciated. I'm willing to - and have - done the former, but I'm not willing to do the later, and I'm starting to suspect that's where we're stuck.

And I am so, so, tired and have even less energy than normal to navigate this given *gestures vaguely.*
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Hard to answer, because such a line is personal, of course.

But i think there is a fair way to look at it generally that takes into account different personalities.

Being human has two types of "work." There's the work of life management, such as chores and a job and keeping cars safe and registered. Then there's the work of self-management, which includes hygiene, emotional regulation, social awareness. Oversimplified, but I'm too slow as it is.

When you're with someone, you need to manage your workload in both. Hold up your share of the chores and other life management, and not let the self-management slide.

Good so far.

To my mind, a couple isn't working when being in it demands too much work in either category. Now, their life work might just be crazy -- young kids, etc. -- and as long as they're sharing it and both equally flat out exhausted with "too much" work, then okay. That's temporary and they can get through it, and true sharing means they're a good pair. It's lopsidedness that will doom them -- when one is doing everything and the other says "You wanted kids I didn't!" or whatever.

That is also true of self-management work. If you're kind of a mess and your partner asks you to get some help, and you're in therapy and it's hard, but you're learning healthier ways, then your self-management work will go up for a bit but ultimately go down as you get healthier. That's a good thing.

If instead you're being asked by your partner to, basically, suppress yourself into a little box (because you're "loud" or whatever), then you're going to work yourself to exhaustion on the self-management side, trying to be someone you're not.

That, to me, is the line: when being with someone doesn't make your life better, but instead drains or exhausts you (in a chore sense or self-management sense), with no prospect of improvement.

Hope that helps.
Bad Wife?
QUESTION: Women in my family have the luck of going grey in their late 30's. I'm 41 and just about completely grey. Our kids are 10 and 8. My husband is asking me to dye my hair as most of the women in my family do, but I really am resisting. Its expensive, time consuming, and I don't like the chemicals (no shade to women who dye....just not me). My husband does have social anxiety and since we met in college, there are things I do to help both of us in public - I'm aware he needs to sit at the end of a row or table, know where two exits are at all times, and will review party list of names/jobs/relationships before we go out. If a place is too loud/crowded, we leave or I plan to go alone. He's saying that doesn't like the grey because of what people think - they could think I'm the kids' grandmother or that I am older than I am. He is asking me to consider dying my hair - for him. He sees it as another small thing to do to make him comfortable. He has even said good partners, good wives do things for one another and he has asked me to "strongly consider" dying my hair. He says that he thinks once I'm in my 50's everyone else will have grey. Great - so I'm looking at 15yrs of dying my hair? I'm I a bad wife for not doing it? An uncaring person if this really could help him feel more comfortable socially and ease outings?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yeah no. Sorry husband. Feeling better with multiple exits is not the same as "I need my wife to look a certain version of hot." But you can tell him I said nice try 🙄

Plus, if we're going to address the anxiety here seriously, making him comfortable is not the answer. His facing your gray and getting used to it is the winner. Anxiety is fear of something that isn't happening. Accommodating an anxiety = feeding a fear of something that isn't happening. Meaning, feeding an irrational fear.

Meaning, if he is not in treatment first, and then coming up with evidence-based solutions second, then I'm side-eyeing the effectiveness of the lot of it.

Here are my biases:

1. I think pretty gray hair looks just as pretty as any other color hair.

2. Hair dye maintenance is a colossal butt pain.

3. I think fewer dye jobs in real life are pretty or persuasive than we want (a direct extension of 2, so I feel bad saying 3, since it's really just that people have other priorities for their time and $ than to get perfect gray cover, so good for them, and they certainly don't need me critiquing the results).

Anxiety fact-check is readily available. Making his world smaller-easier is exactly counter to the recommended approach.
communication styles
QUESTION: Perhaps spend some time asking your partner what they love and originally loved about you, including these aspects of your personality, to remind them that these were once desirable traits that they chose. And then focus on 1-3 things that you do that really do come off as overbearing or rude or offend them, promise to focus on those alone. But ask them to determine how to get back to loving you as you are.
Re. Where is the line
QUESTION: I am also direct, assertive, etc. I had to learn to be diplomatic and kind, as well. Is that the issue? Assertive people can have trouble making room for others. Other people's opinions are just as valid and need space, just like our opinions do. Remember kindness and diplomacy if that's what is at the heart of your spouse's issue.
Re: Paige
QUESTION: Or maybe she's not a narcissist, but the total opposite. She could have low self-esteem. Or she could feel like she's been given gifts due to life circumstances (family money or whatever else she feels super grateful for) and she feels like giving back in other ways to people who haven't had all those same advantages is a way of showing gratitude to the universe for what she was given. Lots of options, most of them not nefarious. I think the conversation with her is the best approach.
Why do women do this?
QUESTION: I'm a professional woman who genuinely enjoys getting dressed. If they comment on my appearance, most people are kind, but occasionally, someone will make a very snide remark along the lines of "you poor thing in the morning", meaning they assume I take forever to get ready. One, I don't, and two, that's none of their business! Oddly enough, the people (mostly women) who say such things also tend to be well-dressed. I guess they think it's a competition, which I find distasteful. How would you respond to such remarks?

Feel bad all the time
QUESTION: Why do I feel bad about myself all the time? I feel regret for things in my past, take things personally, obsess on what I may have said wrong, etc. I’m an accomplished person now retired and hate perseverating like this. I struggle to break out of this negative internal dialogue. Any tips?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Please make an appointment to see your primary care person, then follow the breadcrumbs from there. There is no need to resign yourself to suffering and then tough this out as if it can only be about personal failings. Perseveration can be a symptom of a medical issue -- or something else, but the medical issue has the lowest barrier to entry as far as exploring causes, plus it's the logical starting point for that kind of detective work.

Meantime, as your health permits, consider also adding physical activity and mind-consuming activities. Busy is good. If you're moving forward on the two paths -- pursuing diagnosis plus keeping occupied with purpose -- you might find some quick relief.
Paige
QUESTION: I am a (recovering) Paige and I had friends tell me directly it made them uncomfortable. That may help here but it wasn't until I got divorced and really needed my friends (and acquaintances, and professionals and strangers!) that I realized that my giving was self-protective. Once I had to let people do things for me, I realized the joy I had been denying them for years. Paige may think her value is in giving and it can be very hard to let that go. You may have very little influence here, even if you are honest with her.
Gray hair
QUESTION: I also come from a family where the women go gray early (starting in high school). Over the years, I saw all sorts of responses to and judgments made about individual decisions, and I guess it comes down to this, for me - do what’s right for you, period. You don’t owe anybody, including your husband, any explanation for what you decide to do with your own hair - and his extreme anxiety about what people might think is something he needs to address in his own, not through trying to control your choices.

Husband’s Therapist
QUESTION: As a retired therapist of 30 some years, I think it’s interesting that Husband uses the phrase, “My therapist says I should…”. That’s really no different than “My dad says, “ or “My boss” says or anyone in a power position says I should do this thing. It just seems to indicate that the client is still uncertain about the new change that is being requested, and needs to refer back to someone with “ credibility.” And I agree with the advice to suggest you attend a session. We therapists only know what is presented in the room, not necessarily “objective” reality. And, while it may seem counterintuitive, our stance can also be misrepresented to family/friends if the client has a different agenda than what we are aware of. Just saying.
where is the line/communication style
QUESTION: At the start of relationships, we are attracted to people who have qualities we lack. We think: Chemistry! Gratitude! You complete me! Then, in the long-term and day-by-day, enthusiasm for difference vanishes. If you aren't careful, you start to try to turn the partner into someone more like you. We all tend to do this. But the secret of long love (which is amazing, btw) is not to. He needs to modify his expectation of change. You are who you are. Your love for him won't last unless he accepts you as you are, even when your approach to life at times grates. You're getting close to your bottom line. Stare at it awhile, because he will have to give up on this project or you will have to leave. You've done what you can. The next move is his.

That happens with age, injuries, illness, menopause, stress, etc. Mine is considerably lower thanks to all of those, and I know it frustrates my husband. I make an effort even though I could go months without sex and not care.

But in NO WAY would he look to cheat, then gaslight me and misrepresent a therapist saying the things the writer's husband is saying.

ANSWER: I didn't see anyone blaming the wife for a low(er) libido. Or anyone letting the husband off the hook for poor behaviors.

Any discussion of the wife's side of the ledger was about a responsibility to communicate about things and to consider both their needs with respect vs. expect problems just to go away. To call that "blame" is a terrible misread.

To clarify, I agree that my husband now shares these thoughts on some level, but it's more that he's been convinced than that this is my husband's true self coming out. He's channeling his therapist, prefacing with words like "My therapist said I should explain that..." and "My therapist said you would probably respond that way..." Even the choice of words seems rehearsed. I know my husband and this is NOT the way he thinks or what he sounds like.

His therapist is in a non-monogamous relationship himself, has his own blog, and seems to be some sort of advocate of it.

I've suggested couple's therapy (which my therapist suggested too), but my husband is not interested, as he's VERY happy with the advice he's getting. Apparently his therapist did offer to talk to me in a joint session or to my therapist, but honestly I don't want to since I think the therapist's values are just so different from mine, and I don't want to join whatever cult he has going. I suppose I could let him talk to my therapist, if you think I should... but at that point, doesn't it seem like we're just handing over control of our marriage over to our therapists instead of actually having it ourselves?

ANSWER: Run it by your therapist before you do it, certainly, but I don't see how your going to one session and hearing it from the guy directly means you "join whatever cult he has going." To me, it would mean you confirm for yourself, firsthand, what you suspect is happening.

The whole blog thing, too -- I assume you've talked to your therapist about the ethics of what's going on?

Maybe you don't need confirmation. If your husband believes what his therapist is advocating and is "VERY happy with the advice he's getting," and if you don't even want to be in the room with it, then you're at a crossroads with your marriage, no?

I want that for you, for the two of you to have "control of our marriage," but if your husband won't cooperate, that's not something you can will yourself to have on your own.

One more Paige comment
QUESTION: The part of the question that bothered me most was that the OP felt like she wasn't getting to do the things for her own child that she wanted to do, because Paige was doing them first. So maybe that is the thing to talk with Paige about, more than the rest of it
Husband’s therapist
QUESTION: Interesting and important additional details in the update from the OP - but why turn down the offers from husband’s therapist? The “control” issue here seems to be something of a distraction, if not an avoidance technique - why not get all the information you can get, and all the help you can get, to solve this problem in your marriage? And to address your husband’s dissatisfaction with the state of things, even as you both explore ways to deal with it, in ways that are comfortable for you both? At this point, what do you have to lose?

Is it possible to be a happy working mom?
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, here goes. Is it possible to be a happy mom who works a 9-to-5 job?

I always assumed I would stay home with my kids, at least during the early years. That is how I was raised—my mom was home throughout our entire childhoods and eventually (when my youngest sibling was 18) went to go work as an in-home aide. On reflection, she really disliked working as an aide and often made comments about wishing she had other options. Those comments were in my head as I sought out my first adult jobs. I work in HR at a midsize company and my work is predictable but challenging.

My husband and I are expecting our first baby in March and I'm starting to plan for parental leave and beyond. I am finding that, despite my original plans, I don't want to leave my job. It also doesn't make sense right now, because I bring in roughly 60% of our family's income (my husband is a schoolteacher).

Most of my friends either don't have kids yet or are stay-at-home moms. I don't have a great model for what working motherhood works like except in my coworkers, who seem frazzled and complain about their kids all the time. Obviously it's because mine is still in utero, but I can't imagine complaining that bitterly about my baby and assume it has to do with the competing demands of their lives.

I guess my overall question is whether there are working moms who are fulfilled the way stay-at-home moms are, or whether I'm letting money make a decision for me that should be moral/emotional?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist

ANSWER: I have so many answers fighting to get out, they're all jammed into each other. I'm just going to pull them out one at a time and probably get the order all wrong.

First, I suggest you talk to your co-workers vs. observe them. Not in a judging way, either -- do not , do not come at them with, "I can't imagine complaining that bitterly about my baby." Because defenses will go up so fast they may knock you backward. If you approach in an "obviously there's some exaggeration here but you're scaring me" way, and, "I'd love to hear some good stuff," then you have a much better chance at truth. There could be an enormous gap between what they're blurting out in moments of exasperation and what they deeply feel.

Second, as long as we're doing the "most of my friends" thing -- most of my friends (vast majority) worked while they were actively rearing their kids. And not only were most of them also happy, the relatively few unhappinesses were often not related to the combination of working outside the home and being parents. So, that it might not be "possible" is astonishing to me, really. In the way that it would be astonishing to ask, "Is is possible to be a happy breather of air?"

Yes, it's challenging. Time is an issue. But being home is challenging for different reasons. Working outside the home or not isn't what makes or breaks a household. The trick is to choose what is right for your specific circumstances -- you and your partner, if you have one, and your kids, and your finances, and so on.

So, third item. If I were to construct an is-it-possible-to-be-happy scenario, I might use this phrasing: Is it possible to be happy with an "I had always assumed ___" outlook on life? Because to me, the building blocks for a satisfying life aren't in this choice or that choice or the other demographic. They're here: in openness to making a joyful, meaningful life of what comes.

You're a few steps into that with your epiphany that you don't want to leave your job. Despite what you "had always assumed," the life course you're on has its own ideas.

So, keep going with that. Keep challenging your assumptions with reality. Your husband, for example, as a teacher, might have a schedule that aligns well enough with your child(ren)'s over the years to tame some of the frazzle. You may be able to hire help or organize better around some of the stress. You may find that "venting" is not your parent-bonding language; no judgment.

In the doghouse
QUESTION: My brother and sister-in-law have been using me as their dog-sitter since we moved close to each other about ten years ago. I never ask them to reciprocate, since one of my dogs can be a little destructive when unsupervised; I put my dogs in a kennel when I travel.

Their dog (we’ll call him Sid) is a bit of a hassle. I take care of him in my house. Sid is quite a bit older than my two dogs, so every walk turns into two—a long one for mine and a short one (distance-wise, but almost as long time-wise since he walks so slowly) for Sid. Sid needs five pills daily, eye drops, ears cleaned, teeth brushed—is not terribly cooperative for any of it.

They’ve stopped giving me food for him, since my dogs eat the same kibble, but it’s expensive (about $45 per week per dog).

They’ve even asked me to drop him off when they get home, since they’re so exhausted from their travels.

It used to be they would take me out to dinner for a thank-you, buy me a souvenir if it was a pleasure trip, etc., but even that seems to have stopped in the last couple of years.

I have confronted them on occasion regarding one thing or another. The first time they didn’t give me food, they said, “it’s just for the weekend.” The next time: “we have more at our house; you can come get some if you need it” (it’s a 20-minute drive each way). Once we went out to dinner together just after I had cared for Sid for several days, which I thought was my thank-you dinner. When they asked me to split the check, I “joked” that taking care of Sid for the weekend didn’t pay as well as it used to. They did not say, “oh, right, never mind then,” but collected their $60 (kennels in our area cost $40-$65 per night).

We’re all rather well-off, and on the one hand, it feels churlish to insist on them buying me dinner and gifts, or to refuse to pay for Sid’s food. But on the other hand, I feel I’m being taken completely for granted. Rather than a close relative who’s taking care of their dog for free, they’re treating me like some sort of expensive concierge pet-sitting service, or as if they’re doing me a huge favor when I take care of Sid, rather than the other way around.

They know I’m not going to refuse to take care of Sid when they need me to; I wouldn’t do that to Sid (he’s never been in a kennel in his life, and can’t start at his age). So how do I address this?

ANSWER: Draw lines where you hold the pen. Never, for example, drop off Sid for them. I mean really. I expect that will mean you have him an extra day, which will then mean more work than the drive would have been, but if the point is to make a point, then that will make your point.

Partner OCD / State of Our House
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,

This is my second time writing in. I wrote over the summer about my husband’s OCD (I was “Walking on Eggshells”).

My husband has a high-stress job, and together we’re raising four kids in a busy, blended household. He’s a wonderful man and deeply committed to our family, but he has strong OCD tendencies — his way of controlling what he can when everything else feels chaotic.

Here’s the hard part: when he’s on his way home from work or a trip, I can feel my body tense. I rush to clean the counters, vacuum, put away dishes, make sure no toys are out — all before he walks through the door. If anything is out of place (a cup in the sink, a blanket on the couch, a toy in the driveway), he immediately starts straightening and cleaning, often before saying hello.

By nature, I’m more relaxed about clutter, but over time I’ve come his way because I know how important order is to him. We’re both tidy now, but I feel like I’m living under constant pressure to keep things perfect so he doesn’t spiral into cleaning mode. It’s exhausting, and I hate that I sometimes dread his return because of the energy shift it brings.

For a while, we even had cleaners come every other week, but that ended up creating more stress than relief — if a plant was moved half an inch or a picture frame slightly askew, it really bothered him. I managed them, and eventually it became more work than it was worth.

I also worry about what this teaches our kids — that a toy on the floor or crumbs under a chair are somehow “wrong.”

We’ve talked about it many times, but not much changes. He refuses counseling, saying he’ll “work on it,” but I don’t see real progress. Medicine isn’t something he’s willing to consider either. I love him and want to be understanding, but this dynamic feels heavy and unsustainable.

How can I support him without losing my peace — or turning our home into a stress zone for everyone else?

Signed,
Walking on Eggshells (and Crumbs)

ANSWER: Obv you can't make him go. But you can present to him this breakdown of the unmet terms of the deal, and that the result is his untreated anxiety is affecting the entire family. This can't be what he wants -- can it? Ask him. Acknowledge that it's a hard threshold to cross for anyone, and you're sympathetic. But this stress is hard too and the alternatives only get harder.

You may have to initiate those alternatives -- separation for the kids' sake -- but that is many steps away and I hope wont' be necessary, once you make it clear that his getting help is not negotiable now that his anxiety is affecting all and his self-help plan is stalled.
Not wild about my daughter’s fiancé
QUESTION: Oldest daughter is engaged to a young man; they have been dating three years. She is an accomplished professional with degrees to match, and he hasn’t come close to finishing undergrad and works as a grocery manager for a chain store. They are worlds apart (suburb vs. country living). He seems a bit on the spectrum and he takes everything personally. Both see therapists. Talking to him is difficult and we haven’t conversed in over a year. He wanted my blessings to marry my daughter via a phone call. He thinks my nose is out of joint.My husband and I are concerned with red flags that she will settle on this person and they are so disparately worlds apart that it is scary to see how she might be left holding the bag. She still lives at home but pays rent. Her therapist hasn’t nudged her to grow and evolve like a person her age should….she is socially awkward and doesn’t seem to want to do much beyond work, home and visiting her boyfriend. She wants to buy a house; we have suggested she rent and be I. Her own for awhile. i don’t have tough conversations anymore because it ends up in a screaming match.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist

ANSWER: By the end, you're admitting (I don't think that's too strong a word) that your daughter has serious challenges of her own ... but kind of blaming her therapist for them. And having screaming matches with your kid about how you think she should be living her life.

I want you to reread because maybe then you'll see all the finger pointing, all the things you think everyone else is doing wrong. With their lives -- not yours.

Then I hope you will see that as your cue to excuse yourself from this picture. Talk to your own therapist if that will help you with the difficult feelings. Yes, it's hard to watch people make choices that you think will make their lives harder. But they're not your choices to make. Not anymore.

And the more you try to impose your will on your kid, the more urgent you make it for her to push back against you. And the worst decisions we make (collective "we") are always the pushes back against a smothering authority.

Give her the space any adult deserves. Give her the trust you would have wanted to have at her age -- even if you don't think she's ready for it yet, or has earned it. Sometimes you have to put it there because it's (past) time, and let them figure it out.
Re Happy Working Mom
QUESTION: The thing that struck me is that you work in HR, so consider that you are probably more likely to hear complaints than other professions and I don't even mean in a professional capacity. I'm a former therapist and either because people know my training or it's part of personality type that seems like a kind, nonjudgmental ear I am the person people want to vent their spleens to. I have to establish boundaries, but I know perfectly lovely, happy people who have tried to share every frustration with me while others in their lives don't hear a single complaint. This may be going on here. So don't assume that these people are miserable parents constantly complaining. You might just seem like a friendly outlet that will let them vent for short bursts.

OCD husband
QUESTION: Some people don't want to talk the moment they get home. (Not saying the OCD husband is like that, but some people are.) What if you let him clean when he gets home instead of rushing to do it all before he arrives? It might be a way for him to self-soothe after the stress of his workday.
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: "What if this is a way for him to self-soothe after the stress of his workday? Talk about this, and ask if it would help if you let him clean when he gets home instead of rushing to do it all before he arrives."

That plus this: I still think counseling remains a nonnegotiable if the stress is bleeding into the family beyond just one straightening up session per day. I won't get into the particulars, but I have run across the straightening thing as an anxiety outlet where it is a bottomless pit of fussing.
Former gym rat
QUESTION: Prior to the pandemic, I was a huge gym rat and used to work out all the time. I got out of it when the gym closed and never went back. But my husband will. not. let. it. go. He keeps nagging me. (I have not gained weight, changed size or anything else.) I have used "Not happening. Next question." and he has now stooped to trying to embarrass me about this by mentioning it in front of friends who are all "But you LOVED to work out!" Yeah, and now I don't. Ugh.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist

ANSWER: Or, simpler, just leave. The room, party, restaurant, bar, whatever. Evening over.

Time to have this out with him I guess:

"What is it going to take for this to stop? Do I have to ask you something over and over, even though I have the answer, until you break? Do I have to embarrass you in front of our friends? Do I have to say out loud to you, 'Yes, I KNOW you liked me better when I was a gym rat, I KNOW you are really bugged that I don't go any more, but I am still not going back' -- will that do it? What? Please tell me so I can be free of this b-------."

The weight/size thing is a red herring. Even if you did change some, this is a one "back-off" issue. You get to manage yourself as you see fit.

Where a spouse gets to express concern is in engagement-with-life management, and even then, it's both nuanced and about you (you-indiv and you as a couple). Meaning, this I-want-so-I-embarrass-you crap would never fly.
For the working mom question
QUESTION: One thing that I kept hearing when I was pregnant, and that I frankly found very annoying at the time, but which was totally true is that you really won’t know how you feel about staying home versus working until you actually have a child on your lap that you’re taking care of. I agree with all of Carolyn suggestions about preparing and having conversations, but ultimately towards the end of your parental leave, you will either be feeling like yes I’m ready to go back, or no I can never imagine being away from this baby, or maybe a combination of both I found out that more than anything informed next steps .

Congratulations to you and your husband. I hope you find an arrangement that works for your family.

But one might also see moral value in having Dad home, to show that role model -- especially for a baby boy? Or for a girl? (Discuss.)

Feeling Unprotected and Losing Trust in My Marriage
QUESTION: I’ve been married for two years (together for four), and while my husband is a great person in many ways, the biggest strain on our relationship has been his family. They’ve consistently disrespected me, and despite my husband saying he understands, he rarely takes firm action. He tends to avoid conflict and often gives in to their requests—especially financial ones—which has made me feel unprotected and unseen.

We tried couples therapy, but it didn’t help much, because I don’t think the counselor was a good fit. I’ve communicated my boundaries repeatedly, yet he continues to prioritize keeping the peace with his family over my comfort. Recently, I suggested opening a joint account to rebuild trust and create transparency, but he refused, saying he didn’t want “little fights about purchases.” But when I asked if I could have the passwords to his accounts and he said that was fine.

I’m exhausted from being the only one fighting for our marriage. I still care about him, but I’m starting to wonder if we’re simply incompatible—if I’m holding on out of love or fear of leaving. I want peace and emotional safety, but I don’t know if I can have that here anymore.

What would you do in my situation? Can a marriage survive when one partner won’t fully protect you from their family? Do I need to be stronger? I’m afraid of the dynamic if we have a child.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whoo. I'm uncomfortable answering a question with the central conflict presented in such vague terms. Your husband's family is hitting him up for cash, I take it? Is he giving it to them without running it by you first? Is it $5, $500, $5,000? I can see different answers at the extremes. Plus, I can see "counselor wasn't a good fit" = counselor wasn't good, or counselor wasn't agreeing with you.

However, I can answer part of your, "What would you do in my situation?" especially from my perch in my late 50s: I wouldn't go into anything serious with someone conflict averse. Not a large purchase, not a child, not a business deal, maybe not even plans on Saturday night -- nothing where our interests were combined and I had to count on this person to stand up for those interests. Because I know now that I couldn't.

So, if you are confident that your husband is beholden to his family, and that you are the one he's comfortable disappointing, then you need to say that to him now.
Friend back with abuser - update
QUESTION: Original poster of last week's chat question here. My friend was being nicer...but she g ot kicked out from her main friendgroup and now she's being isolated, cold, and distant. I'm trying to be a safe presence like everybody said, but it's getting more and more challenging as she now just ghosts people. Not sure how to handle it:(thank you all for supporting me last time.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You're welcome.

I am not going back to the transcript to check details, so this will be a general answer:

You handle it by making regular check-ins with the expectation that you will not get regular-friend reciprocation out of it. Meaning, she will ghost you, or take a kind of rudely long time to respond, or respond defensively, or respond right away by leaning on you hard as if you've talked every day for years when in fact this is the first time she's reached out in months. Because, think of it this way, all her emotional dials and gauges are in their red "unhealthy" zones or else she wouldn't be where she is.

What you're offering isn't a reciprocal friendship (yet) -- it's an escape plan. When she's ready for it. And for it to be effective, what she needs is to get accustomed enough to your presence to think of you when she's in a full cortisol event.

This is the role a person signs up for, if they want to help a loved one get out of an abusive relationship who is still in the cycle of going back and telling themselves no really, it will be different this time.
Should I fake grief I'm not feeling
QUESTION: My father died 2 weeks ago very suddenly and unexpectedly. I’m not actually grieving since we’d been estranged for the past 3 years. My entire childhood he was either neglectful or emotionally abusive. In plain language he either ignored me or let me know what a disappointment I was to him since I wasn’t outgoing or popular. I was 12 when my mom found out he was cheating because he got his girlfriend pregnant. He moved out of the state with his new wife and didn’t bother visiting me or letting me visit him for the next 5 years. When I finally was allowed to visit him and his new family I couldn’t believe how affectionate and involved he was with my half-sister. When she was 10, the difference in the way he treated her and me at that age was so stark, I had to I talk to him about it. He told me that he was able to love my sister unconditionally, like he never could with me. It was devastating to hear but he blamed it on his “stage of life” and said I shouldn’t take it personally. How do you not take that personally? That was it for me, I stopped seeing or communicating with him. He either didn’t notice or didn’t care. I stayed in contact with my sister by sending birthday/Christmas gifts, texting, Facetime, and on Instagram. Since our dad died, my sister has been calling/texting me nonstop, wanting to pour out her grief on someone who “understands”. Her parents separated last year (infidelity again) so her mother isn’t exactly heartbroken. I love my sister but I can’t possibly share in her grief even a little bit. The only grief I’m feeling is for the father I never had. Especially since I found out that my father told my sister that my mom was to blame for our recent estrangement. That lie would be funny if it weren't infuriating since my mom never even thinks or talks about him. Do I need to fake grief I’m not feeling for my sister’s sake?
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: Yikes.

No, you do not have to fake grief you do not feel, to comfort the sister you do not identify with.

I do appreciate that you're considering it. It is a kindness toward her that shows the true extent of your grace. Clearly she is not to blame for any harm your father did to you. But still, so many people struggle to separate their difficult feelings so effectively. Many wouldn't even know their sister in this situation, much less be in regular touch, having reached a "Just can't" point with it all.

So if anyone can thread the needle, I'm thinking you can -- of letting her know you feel for her in her grief, and understand in the sense of knowing what she has lost, but not in the sense of having had the same father she did.

From there, you can offer her whatever you're willing. There's lots of range there, 0 to full gusher, and it's entirely up to you. The zero is to ask her kindly to direct her grief to another source of support, "since I'm going through my own process right now"; or saying you can listen as long as it's understood that the two of you are not in the same place; or you can set a time to check in once a week, or whatever. It really is your call.

I am sorry for your loss in your childhood.

In other words, yes, I add my appreciation to the pile and my hopes for real relief, soon. Thank you for this info.

I remember having lunch with a college friend who had just moved to DC, late aughts or early teens, to take a fed job. His was a pretty common story -- educated to the teeth, in-demand skills and taking a significant pay cut because he wanted to serve. (And had to claw for the honor; iirc, it was a sought-after job.) But what brings him to mind now was that he was also looking forward to the stability :-/
Nick
QUESTION: Why has Nick been switched (downgraded??) to an illustration, rather than a cartoon? His cartoon were great!
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: No no no, absolutely NOT downgraded.

The illustrations are gorgeous and more work for Nick.

The cartoons were more work for me. I co-wrote them. That plus the seven-day column schedule (with chat) meant I never had room to do anything but that and the seven daily columns (with chat).

Taking the cartoon lines off my writing schedule, and two of the adapted columns, means I can now breathe and think a little about new things to do. Which will come, but it won't be instantaneous because my schedule has been so opened for all of two weeks at this point (and I spent them catching up on some appointments).

Thank you for asking. But please -- do not think for a moment that Nick is seen as anything but valuable here. He also edits my first drafts.

Grandparent name vs stubborn toddlers
QUESTION: Before the birth of our eldest (now 4, first grandchild on both sides) we had asked all grandparents what they wanted to be called. My FIL chose “Grandaddy”, and our 4 year old went with it. A few months ago our second, now 2, started calling him “Grandy”. Assuming that she would grow out of it eventually, we didn’t make a big deal out of it, just continued using his preferred when we spoke of/to him. But, our 4 yo has started using the shortened name, too. We know it bothers him, so how should we handle it?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: 1. He can correct your 4-year-old, if it bothers him. "I prefer you call me Grandaddy, thank you. Like you used to. Your [brother/sister] can't pronounce it yet, which is why Grandy is okay." You also keep referring to him as Grandaddy, to him and about him to both of your children, out of respect to your FIL, but it is not your job to correct your child on this.

2. Is he always this much of a tool? There is no gift more precious on earth than a grandchild's spontaneous naming. Smh.

Reply to: "Feeling Unprotected and Losing Trust in My Marriage"
QUESTION: Regarding money and accounts, it would be helpful to know if you both have your own careers / incomes and/or if one or both of you have your own money from before the relationship started.

However, for almost 50 years spanning three major relationships, my rule has always been: "There are three types of money: My money, your money, and our money. We have frank conversations regarding how much money is needed to run the family, pay the mortgage, etc., and where that money is going to come from. And that balance can and probably will change over time. However, once we have a current agreement, we have three bank accounts: Mine, Yours, and Ours. As long as the 'Ours' account is properly and fairly funded, what happens with the money in 'My' account and 'Your' account is only the concern of that individual. I am not entitled to make judgments about your spending and you are not entitled to make judgments about my spending. However, for emergency and life-event situations, we do always make sure to share logins/passwords on the accounts."

Lastly if you don't think the therapist was a good fit, find a different one, even if your husband won't participate (but I think he probably will). And if the next one also does not seem like a good fit, in consultation with your husband if he is participating, find yet another therapist. Keep looking until you get it right. Though it may not be or feel "fair", you are going to have to drive this train.

Wishing you the best!

Not fake grief
QUESTION: Even in intact families, the loss of a parent can hit differently - each child’s relationship with each parent can be so different. Your grief, over the father you never had, is real grief, just as real as hers is; I think it’s important for you to acknowledge that and honor it, just as you can honor and acknowledge your sister’s grief. As Carolyn suggests, I think that is the needle you can thread - acknowledge that you’re both grieving, but for different reasons, since you had very different relationships with your father, without necessarily going into any detail. From what I can tell, your sister is a teen or a preteen; is there any chance you can encourage her to reach out to a school counselor, who might direct her to a support group, closer to her area (I’m gathering you don’t live close to her). It sounds like she might need day-to-day support, perhaps individual counseling, but I don’t know if you’d feel comfortable suggesting the latter.

Bungee Jumper Dad to Be
QUESTION: As I read this week's question from a very pregnant woman so furious at her husband, I thought back to when I was pregnant and how mad I got at my husband when he didn't make it to a doctors appointment with me. In fairness, he was super supportive and went to like 90% of the appointments. So why was I so mad? Probably because it showed that at the end of the day, he could walk away (have the beer, eat the sushi etc etc) and I couldn't. So maybe that's the root of at least some of her anger - he can tap out, go on the wild trip, act like there's no baby coming and she.. just can't. The biology isn't fair on this one.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Right, it's not. That cuts both ways, of course. The feeling of being pregnant is just astonishing intimacy with ... life, really, but specifically with the coming new member of the family. It absolutely comes at a cost, just as that freedom to bungee jump comes at a cost.

Comfort with the tradeoffs is why a lot of fits of anger don't happen, at missed appointments or with ridiculous last hurrahs or whatever.

When they do happen, they're not necessarily bad or wrong. They've just got lots of possible explanations -- because there's so much complexity to this stage of life, so much change, and responsibility, so much riding on another person, so much anxiety swirling around in there. Plus, like I said, some hormones adding rocket fuel to it all. So which one is the root of the anger? Any one of them could do it, depending on the couple's history.

Anger is a tap on the shoulder that there's something unexplored or unexpressed that might need some attention. Certainly some walking off, first, to get enough feelings out of the way to figure out what it is.

Recovering after fiancé cheats.
QUESTION: My fiancé of three years cheated on me and immediately pleaded depression, anxiety, and disassociation. She started therapy and said that she was losing herself in our relationship and needed to work on herself, so we're essentially are broken-up while she does this work. I continue to support her (she is in school with no resources to continue if I don't) as I committed to doing. It's been three months now and she has been consistent in saying that she can't be in a relationship with anyone until she learns to love herself.

I've had a long journey through therapy and cheated myself under similar circumstances in a prior relationship, so I have more understanding than most and I also believe that people can change and learn if they are open with themselves.

But, I feel like she avoiding dealing with the hurt and trauma that she caused me and I don't know how to call this out while being supportive of her process. She's said the expected "I'm sorry for causing you pain by my actions", but we have not done any work on taking accountability, owning decisions, or figuring out where things fell apart that led to the cheating. As each day goes by, I feel like she's "getting away with it" under the guise of doing the work on herself.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: If you are broken up, then she did not get away with it. The consequence was losing you. You are merely honoring a prior commitment toward her schooling (the rest of which I will leave to the lawyers, though I have to think you have other options there if you want them).

If you are merely apart while she goes through school and counseling, with the understanding that you are still engaged, then you are not broken up. In that case, I see your point of her not really having consequences.

That's just the surface-y stuff. I mention it, though, because it seems really mushy, and mushiness always makes things worse. You're looking to her to figure out where you stand, and she seems to be telling you in multiple ways that she can't even figure out who she is. So my suggestion there is to treat yourself as someone who is broken up. It's cleaner, it makes sense (her getting lost to you doesn't sound promising regardless), it's Square 1.

Meanwhile, tho, you're leaving out the inner stuff completely: conscience. Feeling utterly regretful/bad/shamed/worthless/contemptible, just a sampling off the cheaters-who-don't-love-themselves menu, is not my idea of "getting away with" anything, so if she feels terrible, then she's paying dearly for "the hurt and trauma that she caused" you.

She's not saying it to you, maybe, but, back to the beginning: Taking her at her word, her issue was a feeling of self-erasure around you. That, to me, is a person who needs to feel a lot stronger before she's coming to you with anything. Certainly more than a few months.

Meanwhile 2, your inner stuff. If you two indeed are broken up, then your "figuring out where things fell apart" process is yours to do now on your time. Stop looking to her fix it, or you. Anyway, broken up officially or not, she's "consistent" in telling you: She can't. So stop asking. You were betrayed, yes. But whether she "owes" you is immaterial.

Your topic line is "Recovering after fiancee cheats." Recovering is about you, not her. Keep that in mind so you don't lose your focus. Step back, stop looking to be made whole, work (again) on you.

She's in therapy to figure this out for herself, so that she even has this information or can perform these actions.

Disaster surprise birthday party on the horizon
QUESTION: My brother has organized an ill-advised surprise party for my father's 75th birthday. Our father is a complete introvert and also very exacting. He likes things to be a certain way, and gets tense and angry if everything is not perfectly to his taste. He hates loud places and large groups of people. Unfortunately, he's always used excessive alcohol to handle social engagements and gets belligerent when drunk. Because of all of this, I was surprised when my brother, "James" told me that he'd planned a surprise birthday party of 30 guests for my dad at a new restaurant. The guest list includes the following extremely awkward confirmed attendees: our aunt (dad's semi-estranged sister) who is an overbearing religious fanatic none of us can stand; our mother (dad's ex-wife) who is resented by our dad and hated by our aforementioned aunt because of the divorce; and a number of neighbors who our dad has been feuding with off and on for the last 20 years. I asked my mom why she was going along with this and she said James called in a big favor she owed him and she felt like she couldn’t say no, so he’s pulling out all the stops to make this happen. I don't know how James could possibly think this is a good idea, except that he has a huge ego and believes this will be some fairy tale reunion where everyone will suddenly make nice. I don't mean that James is a bad guy but he has a tendency to steamroll over people and do things "for their own good." Every argument I've made against this party has prompted him to lecture me and act like he knows so much better because he's 7 years older than me. It's true that my Dad can be difficult but I don't want him to feel ambushed on his birthday. If James keeps refusing to cancel should I warn my dad? Or do I just kick back with a glass of wine and watch the drama unfold?

I would suggest, though, that you stay in driving condition in case your dad wants or needs to leave on short notice.

In-law correcting grandkids
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn & Nuts! I have an in-law question. I will preface by saying my MIL and I do not get along nor see eye-to-eye. I avoid her but my husband and small children (1 & 4) go to visit his parents when I'm travelling for work. Everyone wins. On the rare occasion I do visit with them, how do I handle my MIL correcting my children? I'm trying to understand the different balance of "my house, my rules" with "my children, my decision". For example, she wants the 4 yo to sit at the table to eat his whole dinner and not leave until everyone is finished, asked to be excused, etc. In theory, I agree and we are working to instil manners (please tell me boys eventually chew with their mouth closed without constant reminders!) but he's 4 and sitting longer than 10 minutes while adults talk is boring. It also grates me to have her correcting my children when it's not her job. Should I tell my children that Grandma has different rules at her house and to listen to her or should I push back when she corrects my children? She is not the type of person one can have a rational conversation with, so it's either stay quiet or push back in the moment.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I need a bomb suit to take apart this question.

First, please let go of the idea that no one else can correct your kids but you. Parents who give stinkeye to anyone who dares say "no" to their preciouses have always bugged me. You and your husband are the top of the discipline chain, yes, and therefore you get the last word. However, the "village" concept is a good and necessary one that absolutely falls apart if you refuse to empower the village to tell your kid "no" sometimes.

I (really really) get how hard it is to grant that power to someone you don't like or trust. But it is worth it to take the deep breaths and make yourself apply an across the board standard of village access. Meaning, the village can correct your kid, even villagers you loathe, as long as the correction itself is not actively harmful -- because the institution of the village is worth supporting. And yes, that includes telling your kids (and reminding often) that rules in Place A are different from rules in Place B. That's just life. Home to home, school to home, etc. There's nuance to who's in charge, but you'll get there over time.

There are also definitely times to step in and protect your kid from people who undermine your childrearing methods or who push really bad, unhealthy or outdated methods themselves. The actively-harmful exception. Your MIL has one that I see immediately -- the "eat his whole dinner" thing is a resounding NOPE, I don't care whose table it is. Insisting kids push food down past their satiety point is just so ridiculously moronic and unhealthy that it has to be a hill you die on. Food issues are notoriously hard to "uninstall" once they're in there (since you can't just quit food) so make sure your husband is extra super crystal clear on this too. No clean plate BS ever. Omg.

I am once again reminded how hard it is to type when I'm flapping my arms in exasperation.

BTW, sounds like your kids will quickly find MIL visits stultifying, which means you're going to win this one. Don't overplay your hand.
Suicidal teen
QUESTION: My husband and I recently discovered that our young teen is depressed and has contemplated suicide. I found out by going through their phone after noticing they seemed “off” and didn’t want to talk to me. Teen feels betrayed and angry that I went through their phone. We took them to their pediatrician for an evaluation, and teen refused to talk at all or to consider an antidepressant or nonmedical interventions. We went to a therapist twice and teen refused to speak at all. I have tried drawing teen out, waiting patiently, explaining how suicide cannot be undone and we will get through this together, they are not alone…but nothing seems to get through. Teen did confirm that there was no event that triggered this. They’re just sad. They did say talking to their friends helps. But I don’t know what to do. I’m barely sleeping and every time teen is out of sight I’m wondering if they’re ok. I asked if they’d see a different therapist and got completely shut down. I am at a loss and don’t know how we continue in this liminal space where teen is suffering but refusing help.

My husband and I spend time with our teen, doing what they enjoy but also luring them outside for walks. It’s met with a lot of resistance but we’re trying.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Raising kids is a scary business -- you know that famous description, it's like having your heart out walking around in someone else's body? -- and what you describe here is just peak terrifying. I am so sorry all of you are going through this. The combination of the pain you're in, the fear and the sense of helplessness would keep anyone up at night.

Since your teen refuses to talk to a therapist, it's all the more imperative that you and your husband work with one, asap. One who has the training and experience to work with troubled adolescents. This is where you get your guidance to work with your kid. I would advise you to get this counsel even if your teen had agreed to talk to someone. Being a parent ends up being about 99 percent winging it on the fly, but there are times when you really need professional instructions, and this is one of them.

Something else that will be a therapist question but that I want to plant in your mind upfront: The phone is a problem. I know I don't know this, but I know. The link between it and depression and teens is established, for one -- and you say "young" teen, which means an extra degree of vulnerability. Talking to their friends helps because that is human. That is what we are more prepared to handle. I note this as a therapist question because I don't want to send you barreling in after their phone on the strength of my warning here. Proceed with licensed guidance. But until you get there, yes to the spending time together, on other things, outside, etc., off the digital feed.

Also -- get eyes on in school. This comes with a risk of ticking off your kid for saying too much, so you always have to weigh that against the value of more awareness. But a cautious talk with the counselor at school (ergo confidential) can be your starting point.
AITA?
QUESTION: Hi, Carolyn! I recently made a spur of the moment plan to travel with a friend to Europe for an event taking place next summer. Tickets to the event, as well as travel, aren't cheap, but I can afford it and know that it will be fun. My husband was present when my friend I made these plans and immediately purchased the tickets. Later, he told me that he was hurt that I made plans for a big trip when he and I had discussed planning a big trip, as well, although we hadn't finalized our destination or time frame. I told him that the plans with my friend do not preclude or replace our plans together. At that point, he balked at the cost, saying that if I had enough money to make spontaneous plans for a pricey trip, he wished I'd put them toward a loan we took out last year for home improvements. I admit, I'm not as fiscally responsible as I'd like to be, and told him that I see his point. I am going to move some funds around so that we can pay off this debt together in the near future. Still, I think what stung him is that I do have the resources to be able to make spontaneous plans for a trip like this, although I don't do it often. We've been married for a little over a year, living together for almost 10 years, and have come up with system for managing our joint income and expenses that works for us. I typically pay from my personal account for any non-essential splurges that I want for myself. He knows that my income and investments are more than his own, due to many factors, but mostly because he raised and put two children through college, as well as suffered through an expensive divorce. I don't want to "flaunt" my ability to spend more freely than he does, but I also want to be able to do the things that I can reasonably afford even when they don't involve him. We discussed the issue the same night and he is not harboring a grudge, but what is a better way to handle this in the future?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: If he knows all about the separate splurge account, including how much is in it, and is/has always been okay with it on principle, then I don't see the issue here. It also seems as if he knew it was there when you took out the loan, so I'm a little confused on that -- are you too spendy or did you agree to keep your separate splurge money no matter what? Maybe you and he need some better communication there.

But as for the emotional side of it: His feelings were hurt, he spoke up, you talked about it, you both figured out that your trip was just the manifestation in real time of what the splurge account allows, and now there's nothing to see here. Sure, maybe having the plans happen in front of him wasn't ideal, but spontaneity is pretty great, too, and he could also have spoken up, or tugged you gently aside to say "Hey, does this affect our trip?" and you could have assured him then that it didn't.

Even in a good relationship, it doesn't seem realistic that you'd never have hurt feelings ever. More likely, when mature people do feel hurt: 1. They're going to be able to talk about it. 2. They're going to find out it was a misunderstanding. 3. Or they're going to be able to admit/forgive mistakes. 4. Or find a way to accept each other's differences.

No one needs to be TA.

That same best friend was hauled off to counseling in her early teens, and she has said that she felt terrible about it because she felt like her parents were trying to "fix" her because she was the different one in the family. So I'd say that's the small piece of wisdom that I've used from her struggles in dealing with my own kids - make it clear that you're not trying to fix them or make them different. That you just want them to be comfortable in themselves.
Good luck - and don't forget you're not alone.

Take the plate away

I sent you a picture of my boy all those years ago. I love seeing your photos of Ned but the one today is exceptional. I haven’t found here in Tucson any Plott hound mixes with this look, so I’m wondering if you could tell me where you found Ned. I’m so missing this brindle Plott energy!

Re: suicidal teen
QUESTION: I think it's important to normalize therapy and treatment for mental health issues for teens. Hey, kid, if you broke your arm or got the flu, we would take you to the doctor for the appropriate treatment. This is no different and there's no shame in feeling sad--but also no need to stay so sad when there are things that might help.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: These are all true, and I've been at this same message for almost 30 years, and it's a great point to make with kids from the youngest ages (please!), though if you get to it late then it's still a great message -- but. If a person, even a kid-person, refuses to talk to a therapist, there is not a whole lot that other people can do to make them. And such accurate and well-meaning encouragement as you suggest, to someone who has dug in, can backfire.

There can be an involuntary commitment for someone who is at risk of harming self or others, but that's about it.

This is a major contributor to the sense of helplessness.
For parent of suicidal teen
QUESTION: My son, now mid-20s, went through two terrifying, suicidal years in his late teens. One thing that helped both of us was NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness). I know they have chapters all over the country. He attended a support group for people going through severe depression, and it helped him immensely. And I attended the support group for parents, and I was relieved to know that what I was feeling and experiencing was not unique to me. Best of luck to you both; I would not wish this experience on anyone.
Follow-up about lousy hosting
QUESTION: My wife did as you suggested and talked to her dad. I was right that we were unwelcome - or at least that they were mad about something. Their first issue was that our hostess gifts ($40 bottle of wine plus a flower arrangement) came from the grocery store! Biggest issue was that step-mom-in-law was annoyed that we showed up on Friday night expecting dinner. Also, I should have somehow known to bring back breakfast for them too on Saturday and Sunday, even though they told us they only ever had coffee and those cookies.
What a crock. The wine and flowers are the same no matter where it came from. And when we host them (3 times since they moved!) we not only have dinner ready for them on Friday night but appetizers and drinks too. Her dad's excuse is that it's different because "there are only two of them and three of us". Right.
I am 99% sure this is not a money issue since they spent the weekend talking about their recent purchases - a boat, fancy patio furniture and a newly landscaped patio to put it on. Also, there was plenty of fresh food in the house - they just weren't sharing it with us.
My wife and I decided in future we will get an Airb&b when we visit them and provide all our own meals. Since they live in an expensive resort area this will limit our ability to visit. Oh well.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whew, yeah, that's what petty scorekeeping will get you -- guests determined to find every reason necessary never to come back. The stepmom-in-law sounds like a real charmer.

This flirts with a bunch of faerie tale stereotypes, so I type it at my own risk, but I wonder whether this played out exactly how she wanted it to -- with you as the bad guys on some made-up charge and thinking twice before crossing the Evil Stepmother's threshold again. If her husband is a pushover or dependent on her, then she wins, pesky stepkid and family are out of the picture. (Don't eat any apples, spin wool or befriend their mice just in case.)

This doesn't have to be so cartoonishly villainous, either. One or more of the elements in all of last week's speculation could still be involved.

And, too, you could be taking the exact wrong message from the boat and patio -- ie, now they're up to their face holes in debt -- but I think that's a long shot explanation. As expensive as food is, they could have literally fed you beans. That's what kindhearted broke people do.

Thanks for the update. I'm sorry you just had a firsthand reminder of how much people can suck.

Sibling’s shows of grief drag me into uncomfortable spot
QUESTION: Sibling has a podcast and instagram presence that appears to be geared toward creating a name for themself and developing a clientele for coaching/empowerment/creativity consulting services. It is a side project of theirs, and since our parent passed away 2 1/2 years ago, there has been a marked turn toward including grief related content and “celebrations” of parent.

The content comes across to me as an attempt to monetize our parent, photos of our parent and other family members (including me and my kids) and photos of our parent’s art. This includes links to a clothing site where people can buy items printed with sibling’s collages that incorporate photos of parent and parent art.

We don’t have a great relationship, and that goes back many years. I’ve tried asking to go to family counseling, sibling hasn’t been willing.

Every time I see one of these posts, I get deeply uncomfortable. Do I have any standing to ask them to stop? How would I go about it without setting off a new round of fire (sib is reactive and can be nasty)?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You don't have standing to ask them to stop podcasting, posting or talking about grief or your parent, no. It's their business, you don't have to like it. Parent's art, depends on who owns it, I would think.

But you absolutely have standing to ask sib to stop using images of you and your kids. Since sib is reactive and nasty (sorry, I think we've all more than had it with that combination), I'd talk with a lawyer first to find out what recourse i have. Then, with that in my pocket, I'd talk to sibling myself, and go to my the legal Plan B only if I had to and still wanted to.

Once I was sure about the photos, I'd unfollow this sib's venture entirely after that. I can't see why you'd pay attention to something nonessential that upsets you. Hit "unfollow" and it stops, magic.

Grumpy Unpaid Non-furloughed Fed

Eldersitting
QUESTION: We are once again in the thick of fall sports season. My kids are finally old enough that when they aren’t on the field, they watch, hang out with friends, and I can relax, actually watch the games, chat with parent friends, and decompress a bit from work, shuttling kids around, cooking, laundry, etc. my in-laws recently relocated closer to us, and they want to go to the games, virtually all of them. Due to some mild cognitive changes in my MIL and my FIL never having managed these sorts of things, they need support. They are always cold but never dress warmly enough, even with reminders. They need chairs and water and snacks, which they can’t carry. It feels like packing for toddlers again. I like them as people and have a good, if not extraordinarily close, relationship with them. But did I clarify: all the games? My husband does some assistant coaching and team managing so generally isn’t the point person for this. When I’ve mildly suggested skipping a cooler evening game, they won’t hear of it: they have the link to the schedule and just show up. My husband says just don’t bring all the things, and let them adjust their attendance accordingly. I can’t watch them shiver and end up giving them my jacket, water, whatever. Can I set a limit on the number of games per weekend, or a minimum temperature, and tell them that’s it? Or do I just accept this is the highlight of their social week and keep hauling all the stuff, setting it up, etc.?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I just big-sighed this one. On the one hand, it's small stuff, it's the grandparents, it's tough to be lonely/old/slipping, it's a kindness you'll want from your kids or their partners someday. On the other hand -- really? It's all on you? You can't be hands-free for one freaking game? I do feel for you on the idea of gazing at the calendar at that mythical day when you are in charge of no one's care, then it suddenly flips forward years and years and you can't stop it 😱

So here's what I've got.

1. Your kids are old enough to chip in toward their grandparents' comfort, no? Isn't this a lesson in care, kindness, intergenerational understanding? Not every game, but one shift on a rotating schedule, a kid or kids can do the setup.

2. If your husband can't step out to help get them set up for one day of a rotation himself (can he?), then he can get involved in the stocking of supplies in 3.

3. The needs are predictable enough to pack most or all supplies in a car and leave them there. Yours, theirs, your husband's? And can you put the chairs, blankets, bags of snacks in a cart or wagon. There you go. I say if you have money to throw at the problem (it's not a ton), then start chucking.

4. The limit is fine, too. Number of games or minimum temp, fine -- but is that really up to you? I would think they could just go regardless.

For parent of suicidal teen
QUESTION: I was that kid, exactly. Years later my mother told me she took me to see someone because I had stopped talking. They shuffled me around to well-dressed people sitting behind large desks, and I refused to talk with them too. Silence.

Eventually I told my mother I thought it wasn’t helping. She said ok, then we’ll stop. I remember clearly thinking the time, no, you’re supposed to say let’s try something else but I couldn’t get myself to say that.

At the clinic I remember being walked past art therapy rooms and thinking ‘that looks interesting’ but no one ever noticed my head turn as we walked by and I was never invited in.

So maybe if the kid won’t talk, try something that doesn’t require talking and maybe talking will happen eventually. Face-to-face in an office, sitting in a straight-back chair while someone stares at you and commands you to speak wasn’t helpful.

Maybe letting the kid know that it’s not that there’s anything wrong with them. They’re learning how the world works and trying to figure out where they fit into it. Maybe it’s that there are things wrong with the world (there are!) and kid is trying to figure how to live with that.

Some sincere, credible assurance of as much confidentiality would be helpful. A kid who won’t talk to parents isn’t going to talk to a therapist who is just going to report back to the parents.

Not at all to suggest that this is this kid’s issue, but I’m trans. After decades of depression and feeling suicidal I finally dealt with that, blew my cover, changed my name and a few other things. It’s been more than 15 years since I last felt suicidal.

Suicidal Teen
QUESTION: Child psychologist here. Therapy is important- keep looking for the right fit. Don't forget group therapy options, becauee teens in particular are motivated by peer connection. In the meantime, leverage all the social relationships you can, because social supports are a major protective factor. Are there aunt/uncles/family friends who can send notes/go on outings? Encourage your village to reach out and nurture those connections (while maintaining your kid's privacy). Also, ask for a meeting at their school and talk about who their safe adults are. Your school social worker can be a great resource.

Re: suicidal teen
QUESTION: The parent OP didn’t mention whether they apologized for going through their child’s personal device…reading their diary. It’s a pretty serious boundary violation that the teen might be responding to by leveraging the power they have; to stay silent when expected to talk to experts. Also, as a person who has dealt with/is dealing with depression, it can be particularly hard to talk about in front of one’s parents, if OP means that they attended appointments with their teen. By definition, my parents want me to be alive; how can I tell them I could take it or leave it, or would like it to be over or have a plan? I’d be so acutely aware of my parent’s distress that I couldn’t tell the truth.
Food and Personality Sensitivity
QUESTION: I have a friend who's diet is restricted to gluten-free products. I just had her over as part of a large group for dinner. A couple of other people were bringing desserts and bread. I requested gluten-free, if possible. As a back-up, I made sure to buy a bakery fresh gluten-free dessert and store-bought gluten-free bread just for her. It turns out we needed both. Not only wasn't she grateful that I went to the trouble to accommodate her diet, she was outraged that she was singled out from everyone. She said the whole meal should have been gluten-free and no one would have said a peep. She told me that all of her friends now know that she has a gluten sensitivity and she's embarrassed by this. She won't even speak to me about this anymore. My husband says I should apologize and promise to never do anything like that again. He said I should also ask her what I can do to make it up to her (take her out for an expensive dinner, free babysitting for a few months?). I don't see that I did anything wrong and I really don't like the idea of apologizing to someone when I went out of my way to include her. Thoughts?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: "Outraged"? That hits me as a lot.

I also don't see what's even remotely embarrassing about a food sensitivity or limitation. (I have firsthand experience, so.) But she can have her feelings.

I do agree with the apology, though, no matter what -- in writing, since she won't talk to you about it. "I am sorry I made you uncomfortable. That was the exact opposite of my intent -- I was trying to make sure you felt welcome, and obviously that backfired. Next time I will run my plans by you first.

"Please do allow me a next time. We'd love to host you again soon."

That's all the makeup you owe; no need to lay burnt offerings at her feet for having the nerve to buy her a special dessert ffs.
last week follow up
QUESTION: I wrote last week about the dog=kids question. I was purposely vague which prompte d many readers to fill in the holes. To clarify: the person who insists raising their dog is just like raising a kid isn't a friend but a relative: a middle aged gay male. I feel pretty confident in saying that it's not my constant talk about my kids that prompts this behavior as this relative is a conversational monopolizer so I hardly get to say anything at all. I wouldn't have bothered writing back but the mom who wrote in about their suicidal child is heart-breaking and I guess to my point. There are so many worries we parents have. Will my child harm themselves? Will they grow up to be a school shooter, a psychopath or any number of destructive things? That kind of responsibility is just not part of owning my sweet canines.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: So ... huh. Okay. First, small thing, I already agreed with you that the dogs/kids comparison didn't work. But I do want to add, now that you put it the way you do here, there are so many worries a pet-parent might have that a typical child-parent wouldn't. Like, getting loose in traffic or fear biting, or not being able to say what hurts, or knowing when it's time (or when you jumped too soon or took too long) to euthanize. Plus a dog will never learn to feed itself or let itself out. So I think we did better just not comparing.

Second, big thing: You left out the fact. Had I known "this relative is a conversational monopolizer," I would have been able to talk about a broken clue receptor. That's the issue. Has nothing to do with dogs, kids, hurt feelings or broken dreams or whatever else. He's not reading the room, he's just filling it -- so of course all kinds of dubious stuff comes out, Stop overthinking it; that just sends it on a journey through your own sensitivities.
My wife's therapist is driving us to divorce
QUESTION: This is a weird question, but I could use some help in how to deal with my wife's reliance on her therapist.

We've been married eleven years and have always been able to work through our disagreements with candid communication, compromise and empathy. Last year, she lost her mother, and decided to start seeing a therapist to help her work through the trauma, which I supported.

But since then, she's started talking about our occasional marital disagreements with her therapist, and the therapist always seems to have a strong opinion about how it should be resolved -- almost always in her favor. So now, when we have our disagreements (which she usually brings up right after her sessions), and we start what used to be our period of communication/compromise, she says "But my therapist says...", and then she becomes totally inflexible, treating it like it's some sort of binding appellate court ruling.

I almost always disagree with the therapist, who's only getting a once-sided viewpoint and a small slice of the big picture. But my wife won't budge, so now, for the first time in our marriage, we've had a series of blow-ups due to her unwillingness to budge from whatever her therapist told her to do. (I'm sure she'd say I'm the stubborn one, unwilling to acquiesce to what her "neutral" therapist says.)

At one point I asked to talk to her therapist to at least hear my point of view before rendering her judgment, but the therapist says we'll need a different therapist if we want joint sessions, and recommended her friend. But I've resisted as these therapists are really expensive, and I don't feel like I should cede control of my marriage to them.

It reached a head where she wouldn't budge on something important to me (my hour of zoning out with a video game when I get home from work to decompress), and I asked to separate. She bawled and said we could work it out, but then the next day, after her therapy, she told me I was "gaslighting" her and that I should go if I can't "respect her boundaries," like she was reciting lines in a play.

I feel like I could save our marriage if I could free my wife from her therapist's clutches, but I also don't want to disrespect what my wife says, e.g. that the therapist is just helping her "find her voice." What do I do?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: "I've resisted [joint sessions] as these therapists are really expensive, and I don't feel like I should cede control of my marriage to them."

But you asked to separate. So, to me that says you will end your marriage rather than "cede control" of it, and pay for two homes full time rather than one hour per week of a "really expensive" professional's time.

Meanwhile, you don't know whether you "disagree with the therapist," because you are not in the room. You are hearing it from your wife afterward. You also don't know how your wife represents your arguments to her therapist. Her "one-sided viewpoint" could be pretty accurate. You're assuming she skews it to her advantage.

None of this adds up to a credible argument against therapy or this therapist. It's a lot of conjecture and nonworking math.

What it does add up to is this: You feel like your life was better, and your marriage was better for you, before your wife got therapy -- and you're angry. You want the changes reversed. And you really don't want to go to the place that you blame for breaking everything to try to fix it.

Fair assessment?

If so, then here's my response to it:

-If you want to hear how your wife represents you and your marriage in therapy;

-And hear what a trained therapist says about that;

-And to make sure your side of the story gets heard;

-And spend hourly dollars vs monthly rent;

-And try to "save our marriage" and "free my wife from her therapist's clutches" vs walk away from it;

... Then you have been offered that chance in joint sessions with another therapist. Find out for yourself what the conversation is about and join it, instead of railing about what you think they're saying about you.

It takes guts to get in there, open your mind and really listen. But if your wife wanted things to be the way they were before, then they would be. For whatever reason, what worked for you so well wasn't working as well for her, and that's not a therapist's fault. A significant death and grieving can be an eye-opening experience -- emotionally transformative. The therapist may be correlation, not causation.

Listening is the first step toward figuring out whether both of you can be happier on the other side of this.

I'm the tattoo person!
QUESTION: Hi, Carolyn - I don't know if I am more thrilled or terrified that my question was opened up to so many readers, but thank you! To reassure everyone, I am not afraid of my husband and feel completely safe. And, to the respondent who asked why I love them if I can't see them - I can see them whenever I want! I just have to pull my hair back. The public just can't see them.
I am extremely rejection-sensitive and have been my whole life. My biggest fear/dread is disappointing someone. I spent most of my life making sure what I did/said/wore would be approved before trying it out, and still do often. The reason I told my husband I was going to get my first tattoo unless he forbid it was that I decided I wanted it Enough to live with any related disappointment, as long as it wasn't a marriage deal-breaker. (It wouldn't have been one for me if the roles were reversed, but I am the rejection-sensitive one and he is not.)
Now, while he knows they are there, he can't see them. This is why I was stressing about adding one where it CAN be seen by anyone if I am wearing shorts or loafers. I would instead do another hidden one with less fear, but my hair is only so long.
My husband hates tattoos because they are Permanent-with-a-capital-P. You don't like your haircut? Grow it out. Don't like your job? Get a new one. But, decide you don't like your tattoo? It's going to stay there. And, as people get older and their skin loses elasticity, it's not going to look as great as that first month. But, you can't fix it or take it off. The other reason he hates them is he is an introverted navy polos and khakis kind of guy. So, he is uncomfortable doing things that call attention to oneself. And you can't take off a tattoo for a special occasion like an office party or a wedding to avoid conversation.
I hope this is helpful. I still really want it and think I am going to ask the artist if it could be done without an outline, so it isn't quite as noticeable from a distance. Thank you so much again.

What's wring with being happy?
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn! Lately I've noticed a lot of my friends are really down about the state of the world. I totally understand and don't judge. However, I think I'm pretty good at judging the size of my hands, and exactly how much of the world's pain I'm able to hold in them, and *spoiler alert* it's not much. Therefore, I do my best to be a good person, and accept the rest as not within my control. It works for me and I'm pretty happy.

However, this seems to really rub people the wrong way. There are quite a few friends and acquaintances I know who seem to think if you're not consumed with hatred and rage and fighting and screaming, that you're not a good person and you're not "doing enough."

I'm not really sure what, exactly, I'm expected to do to make our dear president start acting with some sense, but until I have that answer, I'm not going to make myself miserable over it. Also, hating anyone (even "fascists") is against my religion, and I don't think it helps anything, and I simply won't do it.

My question is how to talk about this? Sometimes my friends make comments that I'm "burying my head in the sand," or they'll say "you can't look at what's happening and not be upset." It feels like I'm failing some litmus test simply for taking care of my emotional wellbeing. I read the news. I'm perfectly aware of what's happening in the world. I just refuse to be consumed by it. Do you have any suggestions about how to handle the people who believe that misery is a moral imperative?

Roommate's eating disorder is disruptive
QUESTION: I share a relatively small townhouse with 2 roommates. We’ve been roommates for almost 2 years and everything was going fine until recently. My one roommate Patty and I are longtime friends and the third is Linda - a friend of Patty’s sister who moved in when Patty’s sister got married. Linda works from home. She has issues with food which she assured us, after years of therapy, were under control. She explained that due to her eating disorder she needs to prepare and eat her food alone. Okay, we could accommodate that. But it’s gotten to be a burden, especially on weekends and other days off. At first she needed 30 minutes of private kitchen time twice a day, plus about 15 minutes to eat her lunch. She used to prep her lunch and breakfast at the same time and be out of the way before we got downstairs in the morning. Now for vague reasons that’s no longer possible and she wants the kitchen to herself for at least 90 minutes at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We’re not “allowed” to go into the kitchen/dining area while she is prepping or eating. Last month she upped the ante by requesting that we not even use the living room since it’s within sight of the kitchen. That means she wants us to head directly upstairs to our bedrooms when we get home from work until she texts us that she’s done with dinner. That isn’t possible, same with avoiding the kitchen when we’re trying to get ready for work. When we interrupt her, Linda gets upset to the point of crying and throwing her food away uneaten. She will not eat in her room or anywhere but the kitchen/dining area because she insists that’s “disgusting” and she’d rather go without. Last week Patty asked her to contact her therapist but Linda screamed at us that her ED is under control if we’d accommodate her “simple rule”. This has become a daily problem and even though we’re very sympathetic, we’re paying to live here and want to be able to access the kitchen and living room when we want to. What can we do?

In-laws made us feel unwelcome
QUESTION: We just came back from a visit to my in-laws (FiL and StepMiL) and I don’t know what to make of it. If they were trying to make us feel unwelcome then mission accomplished. They relocated a year ago and have been bugging us to visit. Between one thing and another, we were only able to commit this month. It’s a 4-hour trip so we both took a half-day Friday and drove straight through since our 3 yo son slept most of the way. When we arrived on Friday at 6 pm they said they assumed we’d already eaten and hadn’t prepared anything. After we said we hadn’t had dinner and had rushed lunch they put out 3 slices of lunch meat, 6 slices of bread, some mustard, and a snack size pack of chips. They are not hard up for money and there was more lunch meat and bread in the packages as well as more bags of chips but that’s all they put out for all of us. I asked for some of the fruit I'd seen in the crisper and StepMiL said she was saving it for a cobbler on Sunday. For breakfast the next day, they said they usually have coffee and little sugar wafer cookies and that’s what they offered us. I asked about cereal since I’d seen some in the pantry but my FiL said they didn’t have “enough milk” though there was a quart container in their fridge. My son was hungry, so I went out for take-out for both of us. My wife made do with cookies and coffee. Lunch was the same meager sandwiches. My wife offered to fix dinner since they had plenty of food in the fridge and freezer. They accepted the offer and that was the only full meal we had that weekend, other than us taking them out for lunch on Sunday. The cobbler never appeared.
I don’t think it’s an age thing since my parents, and my MiL and her husband practically shower us with food when we visit them and they’re all the same age (late 60s). I asked my wife why they acted like that and she said she didn’t know but we’re never visiting again. I can’t shake the feeling that they wanted us to feel unwelcome and unless I can get an explanation, I’m not going to have a good feeling towards them ever again. Is it okay to ask my FiL what was up with the lousy hosting?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'd call that more than unwelcome -- that's downright weird.

A couple of things. First, maybe unrelated, you can't draw conclusions on "an age thing" just using a few others in the age cohort the way you did. There could be health-related problems in your in-laws' home that have an age component, and that could have been a contributor to your weird weekend (so many qualifiers there ...) -- and whether your parents or other in-laws feed you is immaterial. Likewise, you may think you know their $ situation but you do not know.

Second, weirdness to that degree is well worth a follow up, so I'm with you there -- but I would step back a bit from seeing it through such a personal lens, for now. Where you see, "They wanted us to feel unwelcome," try, "That was bizarre behavior that doesn't track at all with bugging us to visit." You have the facts of the severe food withholding and control. Wait until you have more information before you draw any conclusions about their motivations.

Third, your wife is with you on this. In most cases, the immediate family member is in a better position to communicate on weirdness. If she's willing, then she might get better answers. Plan the questions beforehand, using your past experience with them as a starting point: "I loved seeing you, but noticed things were very different on this visit," she can say. And then give specific examples -- one slice of lunch meat for dinner? Then, "I'm concerned."

This does seem to need eyes on it, I'm sorry. In a way I hope they were just mad at you (maybe for taking a whole year to get there?) and being shockingly childish about it, because then it's not an emergency; you can just peace out and not visit again.
two thoughts for today's husband who doesn't want to move back
QUESTION: As somebody who lived this (my spouse and I alternated: best place for me, best place for her, then compromise city that wasn't perfect for either but above average for both and our young kid), two additions to Carolyn's advice.

While moving back and enabling her pursuit of her career is clearly the right answer, keep in mind the old home won't be like it was. You have a kid now, and so the questions of where to live and lifestyle and work/life balance, will have to consider the kid's needs. That means your partner's effort to resume her career is going to have more compromises (can't stay late in the lab because tonight is kid's talent show, etc.) There will likely be nights when she says "this isn't how I thought it would be" and your reaction better be, "OK, so how do we ensure you succeed?", and not "Oh, maybe we should go back to my happy place and you can just teach"!

To that, point consider solo counseling for you (if you prefer, a good job coach can work too) during the first year after the move, so you can work through your emotions and your loss (leaving a great job!). You're going to be balancing a job change (hard), trying to support your wife as she reboots her career (harder) and parenting (hardest?). You need to present to be a great parent, to support your partner in her tough moments, and to succeed in your new job, without carrying emotional baggage from the move/change. Oh yes -- and being a great parent is #1 -- if you and your partner don't have to worry about whether the kid is thriving, the edges of the other issues get less sharp.

Go Ask Your Dad
QUESTION: Before we were married, my husband agreed to have two kids and at least one dog. Soon after we got married, I quickly learned he only wanted one and no pets ever. Since it was a two yeses/one no situation, I had to go along.

The problem is when our daughter wants to know why she doesn't have a sibling or a dog. I've never told my daughter about my husband's bait and switch, and I don't think it's my responsibility to explain my husband's decisions. He's the one who pulled out the rug underneath me.

My husband thinks we need a united front on these two decisions, which is hilarious because he contradicts me in front of our child all the time. I say he made both of these decisions unilaterally so he needs to defend and explain it, not me. Why would I defend something I don't agree with for the sake of martial harmony just so he doesn't look like the Bad Guy?

What do we do?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: "We" -- you -- need to own your decision to stay with your husband once you learned about his (apparent) deception. Or you need to be true to yourself and make a different one.

I say apparent because people do change their minds, and they're allowed to. Conversations about x kids and y pets before marrying are essential, absolutely, for what they reveal about visions for the kind of life we want. I'm not minimizing that. People who say they want a stampede of life through the house will offer a different experience from the ones who say "... ehhhh no pets, maybe a child, but I have reservations about that and we need to talk about it." Both also are absolutely valid ways to go through life.

So what matters is the transparency -- and that means, as always, the main character here is character. More accurately, the integrity of the person you're weighing as a potential life partner. That tells you how much you can count on what they promise. It's not about the number of kids or pets, per se, because to treat that as a certainty is to deny how much of a say reality gets. All kinds of stuff can change, go wrong, pleasantly surprise you. (Hello, multiples.)

So -- back to your situation. You "quickly learned" his true preferences. Are you certain he did not come about that change of heart honestly? You say you were baited and switched -- which matters, because it is a towering plate of horse brownies that you "had to go along." Unless you live where divorce is illegal, you chose to go along.

If you chose to go along knowing your husband deceived you, then you -- and your dogless only child, unfortunately -- are lying in the beds you and your husband made. It's not all on him. He lied, but you stayed married to bad character, and you have nursed your resentment right up to posting this question. That is going to wear you down -- on top of the other predictable outcomes of eventually rotting out your marriage from the inside and deeply confusing your kid.

Please, get some counseling. Just you. Say out loud the foundational problem: "Shortly after we married, I discovered my husband lied to me about something huge -- and I thought I could get past it, so I stayed. But the anger is inside me every. day."

If I've called this wrong, then I'm sorry. But it's what I feel here throughout. And I don't see any answer to the, "What do I say to our kid?" question really mattering until you deal with the rage in the room.
Emotionally numb?
QUESTION: Hi! Love your column. I've noticed myself feeling emotionally really numb to the array of things happening in the world. our nation, etc. Almost like my emotional center said, "nope, can't take any more." Is this something others are feeling? (or not-feeling?)
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Hi! Thank you.

I think somewhere between a squillion and a crap ton of people are feeling this, yes. Scientifically speaking.

It's confusing, too, because it's both protective and unnerving at the same time. Your emotional center is taking a moment to withdraw from the overwhelm, reasonably, but overall it feels weird and wrong.

[Here's the usual disclaimer that I am not a mental health professional of any kind, and that seeing one of the licensed kind can be a real benefit when things feel haywire. If you're asking, "Should I see someone?" then my answer is, why wouldn't you? It's not a 60-month contract.]

Butanyway. Something to try for the numbness -- or just the things-happening-in-the-world-ness, numb from it or not -- is beauty. Collectively experienced, if possible, like a concert or other performance, or a walk with someone at sunset, or an art exhibit. Photo albums of people you love can be healing, too -- total waterworks here if they hit me at the right moment. Or creating art. Movement helps so much; there is a proven link between physical activity and the ability to sort our feelings. What unlocks your feelings is such a personal thing, so I'll leave you to it.

I offer for your consideration, Ned's World.

Stingy In-laws
QUESTION: I agree it deserves a follow-up if it's out of character for them, but I can completely see (in fact have seen) my in laws do this and they are just selfish and clueless. My MIL doesn't eat much food and my FIL is stingy and has no clue how to welcome or host anyone. When he's hassling us to visit, it's to serve his own interest of having my husband perform household chores for him and to check his ego box of "my kids and grandkids like me" (not true, unfortunately for him).) It has nothing to do with welcoming his kids and grandkids and making them comfortable. We avoid visiting and bring our own supplies when we do.
How do I move on?
QUESTION: I really need to dress more professionally, so when I came into a small inheritance this summer, I decided to treat myself to a pricy online stylist. I hated it and my wardrobe isn’t any better, plus now I feel worse about my body and clothes. I’d like to move on, but I find myself dwelling on it—not only the money, but also I feel so foolish to have gotten such high hopes about this experience. I’m angry at myself and now buying clothes just seems so much harder. I hate that I feel so powerless and bad at clothes, but I really do need better work clothing for my job (just got a promotion, btw, so I must be doing something right). How can I stop this negativity towards myself and put this behind me? It seems like such a stupid problem with everything else going on.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whoa, whoa. Being mean to yourself is not a stupid problem because you live with you 24-7 -- and never feeling good in your body and clothes is not a stupid problem because you're in those 24-7. So breathe. Be kind. Let yourself be validly problemed.

You had the right idea with calling in reinforcements -- it just sounds as if you need a real in-person person helping you, not an online stylist. Not just anyone, either, but one you can trust on a bunch of levels. Mainly it needs to be someone you feel you can say no to, so you don't succumb to sales pressure and buy things that don't genuinely feel great. But you also need to trust this person's eye for style, and suitability to your body and environment.

I wish I knew where to send you for this unicorn, but it's not an off-the-shelf hiring situation. It depends on the stores in your area, whether they offer this service or whether you can hire someone independently as a consultant. Or maybe it's an acquaintance with fabulous taste, who knows. Even then, when you find someone, don't go all-in. Get a few things and see how right they are for you, then if you're pleased, go back for more.

Meanwhile, take the stuff you bought that you don't like and list it on resale sites (if you have the time and the give-a-damn) or heave it into a donation bin and be done with it. Purge the regrets from your closet.

In other words, on both fronts, put this behind you by giving yourself a 100 percent do-over. You have the money, and -- "with everything else going on" -- it's just clothes, right? So instead of using that truth to shame yourself, use it to give yourself a break.

Visit to InLaws
QUESTION: I’m also concerned about this, but what strikes me is the apparent total reliance on things that didn’t require cooking. Unless this is the way the in-laws have always eaten? I’ve had several older relatives who have really lost the ability to prepare food - two because of an inability to navigate the kitchen and to stand for any length of time, and three because of dementia. One who technically still could have cooked just developed a tendency to forget that she should cook - or even eat regularly. In every case symptoms it seems like we should have seen earlier were an over- reliance on food that didn’t require any preparation (packaged chips, breakfast bars or cookies, sometimes fruit or cold cuts) and claims to have plans to prepare food (like the cobbler) that never materialized. Maybe one of the older couple in this case used to prepare all the food, and no longer can, and this is their partner’s way of compensating? It’s possible that a detailed conversation about what and how and when the in-laws are managing to feed themselves when nobody else is around is a good idea.

Just a PSA: My queue is filled with tales of parents who have gotten older and, when hosting, started serving one cracker for a family of 12. So I think we can mark it down as a Thing That Happens. Of course it comes with other adjustments, such as bringing one's own food on visits, keeping an eye on whether they're eating when no one's around, whether it's time for someone else to host, etc. I think that covers it. Thanks everyone.

QUESTION: You are not alone by any stretch. At the risk of being put on the ENEMIES LIST for advocating science, I'll suggest reading this article from Scientific American a few months ago. It addresses what happens in the brain and offers some helpful coping.

Dogs=Kids?
QUESTION: Carolyn, Thank you for your column and wisdom. I have several dogs and several children. Someone close to me has a dog but no children. They repeatedly claim that having dogs is "just like having kids". This seems so out of touch that it is not worth rebutting and yet it is driving me crazy. Indeed there is a responsibility for both as vulnerable beings but help me out here. What to say to them or how to place this so it doesn't keep rubbing me wrong? TIA.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I see the wisdom of letting it go as beneath serious notice -- the reasoning behind it is, at least. When you can crate children for six hours or board them for weeks when you travel, then maybe we can talk seriously about the comparison.

But someone who feels the need to assert this repeatedly is, you would think, working on some kind of knot inside emotionally. It's clearly front-of-mind. In a person close to you, that is worth sincere notice -- the thoughtful, non-defensive kind -- next time they make this claim. "That seems to be on your mind a lot." You can stop there to see how they fill the silence. Or serve it up: "Anything you want to talk about?"

Could be a few things -- weighing having kids, sad about not having kids, tired of someone's pressure campaign to have kids, tired of being treated as less-than for not having kids (never hurts to check yourself for ways you might unwittingly contribute).

Unfortunately, if it's nothing and this person is just super dog-smitten and a tad myopic, or this is their conversational tic, they're probably not going to recognize the secondary message, "OMG you will not shut up about this."

But if you've ruled out the possibility that you're reacting defensively to a person who's in pain, then I don't see why two people who are close can't have a real conversation about it.
Friend back with abuser
QUESTION: My friend is back with her abuser (pretty unstable dude with an alcohol issue), and now she's cutting people off a LOT. She cut off her very best friend for telling her to leave the abuser, and now she's saying that she "might" cut me off "in a few days" over a trivial political disagreement. How do I resolve this with her, and, how do I stop feeling like s--- about it? Thanks.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: 1. You don't "resolve this with her." Your friend is pretty unstable too, it seems? So your role is not to be the savior or fixer, but instead the safe place for her to go when she decides she's ready to stabilize.

2. I don't know that you're supposed to feel okay when someone you care about is self-destructing. It's awful, scary, sad.

Maddening sometimes, too, because you look at her choices and think "Omg how can you possibly not see a disaster coming here? And why do I seem to care more about you than you do!?"

It's also hard to know when to get involved and when not to. It's easy from the keyboard to say, "She has to decide when she's ready to accept help," blah blah blah (yes, I'm looking at me), but when you're a witness, it's hard to convey just how many times you ask yourself whether you'll forever regret not doing X if Y happens. It's a kind of torture.

Still. The answer is, and can only be, to make sure your friend knows you will pick up your phone 24-7 or darn close to it, and you will get her, no questions asked. This tells her she is worthwhile, and you care, and she has a place to go for help.

For the most part, clothes in a professional setting are just background, or camouflage, if you will, leaving you free to focus on your job - takes some of the pressure off.

Re: Response to Ask Dad
QUESTION: You don't even need the husband to have done a bait-and-switch to ask yourself if you're right together. I was married to a man who didn't want a second child (we had a second--a legit accident) or pets. I convinced myself it was okay because he was such a good person and we were compatible in other ways.

But it wasn't just about the kid and pets. It was about him wanting most of my attention. It was about him not tolerating a relaxed and sometimes chaotic family life. It was about his difficulty engaging with others. It was about his preference to spend money on his hobbies rather than on living things. I'm not saying those things are wrong. I'm saying they didn't, ultimately, fit my priorities.

So now I'm married to someone else, and we have a blended family and 5 rescue pets and are very involved with our community. The warning signal, way back when, was that I couldn't imagine a life without a pet and he couldn't tolerate the idea of a life with one. And it was a total tip-of-the-iceberg situation that took years to become apparent.

QUESTION: Hello Carolyn!!!

I wrote you a while back about my husband’s layoff and strange obsession with the yard. You gave me lots to consider, and thanks to your input I approached him with curiosity and empathy, instead of accusing him.

You were absolutely spot-on with your assessment that he isn’t exactly neurotypical. Apparently, he didn’t bother telling me he was involved in a whistleblower case!! That was why he was gone for long stretches of time.

dogs and kids from someone who didn't end up having kids
QUESTION: I never had kids, which was not what I imagined. I actually imagined having four kids! I did end up having step kids, who were a little older when I came along, and I have had dogs. I have totally had the impulse to relate to someone with kids about how I take care of my dog, and most of the time have never blurted it out loud. I think what could be in play is that you can feel so isolated from the world being someone who doesn't have kids. There is that whole, "You just don't understand -love - -commitment- - fear- etc" until you've had a child sentiment. And I know I don't understand. But I do kind of, as a feeling human being, and someone who has informally mentored lots of kids, and stepmothered two kids, and yes, raised puppies. I guess what I am saying is try to be generous that your friend may be wanting to feel included, that they are not some non-contributing, non-sacrificing member of society because they didn't have that experience.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Thanks for your message, it's on point and refreshing.

The one you cited really gets under my skin: "There is that whole, 'You just don't understand -love - -commitment- - fear- etc until you've had a child' sentiment." There is a huge difference between the whole having-dogs vs having-kids comparison, which is concrete, to the "you don't know love/commitment/fear" extensions of that reasoning, which are so abstract, individualized and totally unfounded.

To be clear, the whole comparison of experience thing is suspect to begin with. It's so rarely necessary to point out to people what they "just don't understand." If we're about to say that, we really really need to ask ourselves if this is about advancing the cause of greater understanding or puffing up ourselves.

But in the rare cases when someone does need to say something, the whole area of what someone feels is not a valid basis for comparison, because no one can possibly know that - vs. has actually done, facts only, which can be compared.
Fence guy update
QUESTION: Hi, I'm the guy whose neighbor kids keep jumping our fence. First off, I don't know why so man y people thought my dog is the problem and not the trespassing. Our dog is a rescue who wants nothing more than to chill in her yard and doesn't even like to leave it for walks. She deserves her peaceful backyard so we're gong ahead with a 6 foot stockade fence. Thanks for taking my question
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You're welcome, glad you wrote back with an update.

The dog vs. kids isn't a value judgment, it's a reality judgment. Kids shouldn't be in your yard. That's simple. I agree with you. Dog shouldn't be an issue. Also simple. I can even add the parenting layer: Parents should keep their kids out of your yard. Of course.

But then you factor reality into it. Kids don't have fully developed forebrains. Parents don't hover over their kids 24-7. The kids might even listen to their parents and stop jumping your fence -- yay! -- but then they have a friend over who doesn't know the rules, and jumps the fence. What I'm saying is, there are so many things you can't control about the neighbors, tweens, that side of the fence.

A dog, meanwhile, is ... well, if you've been here before, you know how I feel about dogs. But if anything goes wrong, ask cops, animal control, insurers -- there's a not-zero chance it'll be the dog's fault. Especially a big dog. Plus, you can't tell your dog the rules.

That's the long answer about my answer. The short answer is, "should" is a lousy planning strategy.

A good planning strategy is to look at what is likely to happen, then what you don't want to happen, then what forms of prevention are in your control.

Do you want the answer you want, or an answer that can work.
BTW -- stockade is a good call. Meant to say that.
Moving on from fight
QUESTION: My husband picked a stupid fight with me yesterday and I’m not sure how to move on. I’m 39 weeks pregnant and have had a cold all week, but I was making dinner for us when he got home late from a work happy hour. He started criticizing how I chop garlic, which he has brought up recently and I’ve told him to drop it. He would not let it go last night until I lost my temper and screamed at him that he’d be sleeping somewhere else if he didn’t shut up. I said that unless it’s a safety issue (it’s not), he shouldn’t be telling another autonomous adult how to cook especially since he has no culinary training. He finally let it go after I yelled at him and made him go to the bedroom so I could cool off while I finished cooking. But we never fight like this so I’m left wondering what do I do now?
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: You go back to him and say okay wt[h] was that? Because, whatever it was, it was not about garlic, and you and he need to figure that out here and now.

I'm not saying this happened here, but some people actually do pick fights when they're anxious -- it's a way of seeking release. It's also super immature, obviously. Like, find your own way to process instead of getting all up in my grill.

Now, you, presumably not one to scream? have your own pent up stress at the moment. It could just be a one-off for both of you.

But it's something to consider here. If this is in any way a pattern, then seeing it before anyone reacts can really help. Ideally the person will get some, ah, counseling to learn better stress management, but if you see the nitpicking for what it is, then you can say, "Nope what's really bugging you?" and sometimes get from A to B without the detour into the proxy argument.

Oh, and small fix: "I said that unless it’s a safety issue (it’s not), he shouldn’t be telling another autonomous adult how to cook especially since he is having dinner made for him by an enormously pregnant person while he was at happy hour."

how do people move on so fast?
QUESTION: I recently found out that my ex-boyfriend has a new girlfriend. We were together for a year, which I know is not long in the grand scheme of things, but it was a really important, special, and impactful relationship to me. And to him, from everything he told me and what we shared while together (which I do not doubt that he was lying about or misrepresenting). It's only been a few months and I cannot imagine meeting or becoming involved with a new person. Most days I am still so sad. But it seems he met this new person a month or two after we broke up, and pictures of them together are already all over his social media. (A friend told me this because she thought I already knew, which I didn't -- I've removed and haven't looked at any of his social media since breaking up, because I knew it would make me too sad.) I know logically that him being with a new person can't make what our relationship was any less special to me, but it just hurts. How do people manage to move on so fast? We're in our mid/late 30s, in case it matters.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm sorry. People are just so, so different. About pretty much everything:

-How deeply they attach is different (you may be a 10 to his 5 in capacity).

-How any two people feel about each other is different (you may have been a 10 to his 5 in this particular relationship).

-How any two people break up is different. Some people do all the mental/emotional work of breaking up while they're still with someone, and the breakup just makes it official. Others start that clock upon breakup.

-How any two people recover from a breakup is different (maybe you were equals in capacity and attachment, but you recover through mourning and he through reattachment).

-How any two people present themselves is different. He could be more upset than you are, for all you know. It's social media, not truth serum.

-What any two people create in combination is different. What you had with this guy was impactful, special to you, that's important -- for some happy memories and for what it taught you about yourself and what you're looking for in a partner. Painful as it is, maybe this is a useful look now at some differences too big to reconcile.

Or it's just a setback as you're trying to get over him. Either way, he wasn't the guy. It's okay if you're not able to draw more from it all than that.
SIL wants my parents to be surrogate grandparents
QUESTION: We live in the same town as my parents, and they are amazing grandparents to my two kids! We see them weekly and my parents occasionally take our kids on excursions to the park, movies, etc. Two years ago, my SIL (husband's sister) and her family moved to our town as well. This is also great, we get along well and see them almost weekly for dinner, etc. A few times, mostly at our kids' birthdays, my parents and SIL's family have been together at our house. My parents interact great with SIL's two young kids (now 1 and 3). The 3 yo even calls them "Grammy and Grampy" because that's how our kids refer to them, which I think is adorable. But it's now causing an issue. SIL/my husband's parents live a few hours away, and don't travel much due to mobility issues. SIL's whole family has been no-contact with her husbands' parents for years (just for context... I agree with their reasons, not that my opinion matters). My SIL recently started talking about how nice it would be for her kids to have a routine grandparent connection and she would like for us to include her kids on outings my kids take with my parents. I feel... weird about this, like it's cutting into my kids' bond with my parents. But I asked my parents, and they said they had no interest in a closer relationship with SIL's kids. Unfortunately my SIL did not take this well. I think she's working through some grief about the lack of grandparents and now she's lashing out at me for "selfishly" keeping my parents "to myself." So... advice on handling this in a way that doesn't destroy a relationship I hope can be close again?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Wherrrrrrre is your husband in this? Where. Seriously.

This was up to your parents, and they said no. So there you go.

I do feel for your SIL. If I were in your place, I'm not sure how I'd feel -- because it would depend on all the variables, like my parents' natures and their health, my relationships with them, theirs with my kids, my kids' relationships with the other kids and the SIL and husband, mine with the SIL and the husband, husband with everyone, all that. If everyone got along, then I hope I'd be in a more-the-merrier frame of mind. But I could easily see being more circumspect.

That's why the SIL took responsibility for not flipping out if she didn't like the answer. That to me was the prerequisite to such a delicate request.

Because if the parents weren't game for any reason, then she was forcing you to be their bouncer, and that role was always going to suck. "No, your babies are not on the list to be their grandbabies. Step aside."

Which brings me to my opening query. I would want my husband to absorb any lashing-out from his sister on the family's behalf. It's the right thing to do.
Worried abut litigious neighbors
QUESTION: We’re starting to have problems with our next-door neighbors. I don't want to be enemies, but I also don’t want to lose a bunch of money because they decided to sue us. My wife and I have lived here since last January and the neighbors on one side have two tween boys. Recently I saw the older boy jump our fence to retrieve his ball. I was worried because even though he was the one trespassing into our yard, the fence is rickety, we have a large dog and a lot of uneven spots (we did what we could this summer but the yard still needs a lot of work). The father of those boys is a lawyer and I know if one of them gets hurt, they’ll sue us for every penny we’ve got. I told the boy to stay out of our yard, to ring the bell and ask for the ball when that happens. He said he would but I’ve caught him and his brother both in our yard since then. I went and talked to their father, but didn't get anywhere. He didn't take me seriously and told me that I was overreacting, that kids will jump fences and it’s no big deal. I felt like he was patronizing me so I snapped and told him that he better not let his kids trespass in my yard again otherwise I would call the police to start a paper trail. I’ve put up no trespassing signs but we can’t afford a new fence and I’m losing sleep over this. My wife thinks I’m overacting but my parents got sued by a neighbor when I was young. Their kid was playing with my older brother, tripped over a ladder in our yard and hit his head on a retaining wall. My parents had to pay all of the hospital bills and their insurance went through the roof. So I know how badly these things can go. Should I try to talk to my neighbor again or just take out a loan and put up a bigger, jump-proof fence? My wife is against going into debt but says she’ll go along with it if it’ll give me some peace of mind.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whoa, wait a minute. You "know" you'll get sued because your neighbor is a lawyer? You "snapped" just because you "felt like he was patronizing me"?

It sounds to me as if your next-door neighbors are starting to have problems with you -- based on your assumptions about them that you've cast into hardened certainties based on a bad experience you witnessed as a child. Whew.

I am not an insurance expert or a lawyer, obvy, and this brings in both areas of expertise. But I am comfortable calling it when I see someone creating a problem they're blaming on someone else.

Is it great that the tweens are in your yard, no. But the parents can't possibly supervise their kids 24-7. That is unrealistic. You, however, can recognize when you're letting past results cloud current judgment.

And you can also recognize when you're worried about the wrong problem. You have a large dog and a rickety fence. That tells me you -- not the boys -- are your own reason to borrow money for a big, sound new fence. And to approach the neighbors with a peace offering and an apology for starting off on such an aggressive note. And looking into an umbrella policy if you're going to lose sleep over stuff like this to the point you can't be civil.
Moving Away/Left Behind
QUESTION: My bestie — my daily ride or die! — is working hard on moving their family to Europe. Like, selling property, getting background checks, hiring lawyers, seriously trying to leave. And while they're excited and want me to be excited for them, I'm really struggling. I'm, frankly, devastated. I can't leave for a billion reasons (primarily, kids and husband are not on board with exploring this). How do I navigate faking excitement for them while my heart is breaking at being left behind?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Have you told the truth yet about your devastation?

It happens all the time that friends' new relationships, promotions, moves, births -- obvious additions to their lives -- turn out to be subtractions from ours, of their time or presence or attention. At some point we have to find a way to be happy for them, or else we're just peevish and self-absorbed and not very good friends.

But it's hard to get to that point in a genuine, good-for-the-friendship way without some sort of honest reckoning with the loss. Like, be peevish for your moment. "I know I am supposed to be happy for you, but I need to say out loud first that I am devastated by this. I want you around every day/week like always and my heart is breaking at being left behind." You can even say right afterward that you appreciate the chance to say this, will be on message with your excitement and support from now on, and have some thoughts about the decor for their guest suite.

If you have already aired your grief to your friend, then openness about your struggle can still work and be a fair part of close friendship, as long as you're not expecting her to fix this for you. Something like: "I'm still excited for you, I'm just having some breakthrough grief today for me." Good friends have their own sense of the right mix for them, but in general too much dumping and too much faking both can be a strain.
surrogate grandparent OP
QUESTION: OMG thanks for answering my question! My SIL and I actually have (or had...) a very close relationship. We chat and meet up independently of husband, and I consider her a close friend. So it seems weird to offload this to my husband, like "whoa, this relationship got too hard for me, I'm out!" As for the dynamics... her kids are 1 and 3. Mine are 7 and 10. Both my kids love their cousins and are very sweet with them but doing the same activities is hard, given the age differences, and I think they treasure those outings where it's just the two of them. But I WANT to be in the "more the merrier camp" which is why I think I'm struggling with this... I do feel guilty, like I'm depriving my niblings of something the kids have. I think if I pushed, my parents would come around. But I don't want to push! My instinct is to just wait this out, it's out of character for my SIL so maybe she's just going through a rough patch. But it has me dreading our weekly get-together this weekend. Last time she started crying over it and I felt awful.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ah, this helps a lot, thank you.

Definitely sounds like SIL's whole campaign for surrogate grandparents is a proxy for a bigger something-else. Certainly the big feelings about it.

As for pushing your parents, agreed, not the move, for a bunch of reasons. Here's a capsule: So your SIL is going to start calling your parents and bring her kids over without any of the rest of you there? I get the general surrogate grandparent idea, but definitely makes sense to give it more time to happen organically.

But a little push to your SIL might be the right one, this weekend. A gentle, "Hey -- I hope you don't mind my asking. What's really going on?"
Re: avoiding the litigious
QUESTION: As a non-litigious ex-lawyer (there are more of us than you might think), I’d also point out that with a rickety fence and a large dog, you’re running risks from the litigious general public, not just your immediate neighbors. Even though he believed that “something there is that doesn’t love a wall,” and that we should be careful to know what we’re “walling in or walling out,” I think even Frost would agree that this is an occasion where “good fences make good neighbors.”

So much hatred
QUESTION: Carolyn I'm not sure how to cope anymore. My husband and I have been married 20 yrs with no kids. In the beginning our marriage was fine. About 10 yrs ago his mom died and mine died 9 yrs ago. It was a hard time but we got through it. We've since relocated to be near family and life got better. His attitude started to improve. He came off his depression meds.

Lately though he has so much hatred for everything and everyone. He gets so angry for little things now and things he can't control (the firing of Kimmel for example). He's become lazy at home - never helping out with chores and never picking up after himself. For the past 11 months we have not slept in the same bed (he always has an excuse - not tired, needs to listen to podcast, dog took up the bed etc). And don't get me started on the romance - it isn't there.

He's clearly going through depression issues but I don't know how to help. I've suggested counseling and he doesn't follow through, I've suggested a therapist and he doesn't follow through. I've even tried to get him to see just a primary care but nope.

What, if anything, can I do at this point? Last night I put on a netflix show but he keeps his head in the phone and when I asked him a question he literally told me to "F off". Obviously I wouldn't take it so I left the room. He'll try and talk to me today when he comes home from work but never apologizes for his words which quite honestly hurt.

I am seeing a therapist but how can I help someone who is refusing to get help?

I'm feeling lonely in my own marriage.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You don't have to live like this.

Don't just believe it -- know it. It is your baseline.

It does sound as if his depression is back with a vengeance, yes, and so medical intervention will be the answer. It also sounds as if you will need to be more forceful in your "suggest[ing]" that he get professional help. This is still going to fall short of so-called making him get treatment, which we all know isn't a thing.

But you, in the meantime, don't have to live in this reaction place to his misery and mistreatment.

You can make any one of a series of decisions on a scale of disengagement from his misery. Just to use the sleeping apart example: You cite 11 months of his excuses. That means you keep trying, right? You could instead choose to formalize the new sleeping arrangement and make your room the retreat you want it to be.

This may hit you all wrong, and I can understand that. But it's an example of using your agency and working within your current reality to stabilize your well-being from one day to the next. Instead of dragging that nightly what-if into a 12th month, you settle it, and sleep well in your nest, and decide to focus on higher-percentage issues like urging him back into care.

You can go bigger or smaller than this. Smaller would be a sit-down with him on making appointments, for example. And/or, trying on a decision to switch from reacting to acting, and then going through the next few days noticing what things would change when you do that, and how -- then starting gradually to introduce those changes.

Bigger, separation. "I love you. Too much to let this keep spiraling. You told me to F off. You can make appointments to get back into treatment for your depression, or you can pack."

However big you go, though, do take the reins of your life back. Not only will it be healthier for you, but it will actually make you more effective in dealing with your marriage, however you choose to respond.
Nights to Ourselves
QUESTION: My wife is an amateur singer. She is in a barbershop quartet. They practice one evening per week and go to regional retreats/competitions a few weekends a year. She's been doing this for many years. She loves singing, though she has told me on numerous occasions about various frustrations with her group; it often seems like she is not having much fun. Still, I support her activity because it is what she chooses to do.

We now have two kids, currently four and two. Since they arrived, I've always taken care of them on rehearsal nights. I go with her on the weekends away, bring the kids to her for nursing, and otherwise find ways to keep busy with them. It isn't easy, but it's fine.

Having two young kids in general is hard work for both of us. A year or so ago, I said that since she was taking one night a week off for herself, I should get one too. She agreed, and now I go out to do some activities I enjoy (gym climbing and poker) one evening per week.

This arrangement is fine with me. I thought it was fine with her. Recently, though, I noticed some body-language resentment. When I asked, she said that she kind of felt it was unfair that I got to have "personal time" each week to do things just for myself when she didn't. I was confused, and said I thought of her rehearsals as her personal time. She said that they did not really count as personal time because she had made a commitment to her group and, although she did not say this part, lately has not been enjoying it so much.

I think that if she chooses to spend her time with her quartet, that's great, that's her choice, that's her personal time. If she doesn't want to do it anymore, she can and should quit; other members have quit in the past, there is nothing forcing her to continue. We've agreed to disagree about this.

Her position seems absurd to me. What am I missing?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I suppose I could say, "Her quartet is her personal time," blam, and be done with it -- I want a curly white wig -- but if she needs some relaxation time, then she does. That makes sense, doesn't it? You can understand how her hobby isn't relaxing?

And maybe she isn't ready to let the quartet go -- those two things don't seem mutually exclusive to me, loving to sing and not loving the organizational headaches.

So why not two blocks of discretionary time each. Doable? Maybe get paid care for one of them, so you both get a break and it's not always paid for with the other's energy reserves. It doesn't always have to be expensive. We used community-center drop-in care for a while, for example. We had to stay on site but there was a fitness room and a pool, good enough.

Anyway -- I love the phrase "body-language resentment." And good job picking up on it and talking about it. But don't get so caught up in keeping perfect score that you don't prioritize finding ways to give each other what you need.
This morning's column
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, I was surprised at your answer to the expecting mother who is opposed to naming the baby for her MIL who detested her and said so to her. Why not counsel honesty? LW stated she didn't want to burden her husband with the truth. While his mother was dying that might have made sense, but it doesn't now.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Funny thing about that. I would have counseled honesty at the very beginning. That was the missed opportunity. Mistake, I'd say, now that we're talking about it. But that was not and is not a useful opinion at this point.

Maybe you're right that the truth wouldn't be a burden now, but I see your certainty as a failure of imagination. To some grieving children, this could be the exact worst time to be handed an ugly truth about Mother -- sainted, sainted Mother.

You see my point. (Everywhere you turn, perhaps.)

Without knowing the situation LW had to work with, there really wasn't a way to know what was informing the decision to let the mother's nasty back-channeling die with her. But I could definitely see a version of events that would make LW decide now wasn't the optimum time to drop this truth. Ergo, advice to support LW in that assessment.

Food Fight
QUESTION: During COVID, I became the de facto cook in my household (it's just my husband and me). That included all the shopping, paying for groceries, cooking, and about half the time cleaning up. At the time, my husband's job was more time-consuming/demanding/stressful than mine, so I understood and did not resent taking on the chore. But, over time, I became burnt out. I also started a GLP-1 medication and my appetite is seriously reduced. (Most nights I could have a bowl of cereal or a smoothie for dinner and be satisfied.) I went from full-time telework to five days in the office.

I continue to purchase groceries, which involves some degree of meal planning, and cooking dinner occasionally. But some nights I get home from work and I just don't want to cook. I can tell this irritates my husband a bit and then, rather than cooking the food we already have in the fridge, he will order delivery. Then I wind up feeling obligated to cook the next night otherwise the groceries will go to waste.

Am I being unreasonable? I know I can't force him to cook. Should I just buy fewer groceries every week, knowing that if I'm not up to cooking, he's going to order out?

FWIW, and I swear I'm not saying this to count my chits, I also do all the cleaning, laundry, trash taking-out, and more than half of the dog care -- most of which I enjoy, but still. Do we just need a bigger conversation about household chores?
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: "Do we just need a bigger conversation about household chores?"

👆️

And about life changes. It's bigger than chores at this point. You're not eating as much and you're at the office -- why are you still shopping like nothing has changed? And asking me whether to stop?

This letter makes a great body-language bookend to the quartet story. You're reading the irritation, too ... and then "I wind up feeling obligated to cook the next night"? That's a whole nonverbal sequence. Interrupt it verbally with your spouse: "I'm reading irritation in your body language. Since I'm not even hungry for dinner these days, and I'm back at the office, I think our division of labor is stuck in the pandemic and it's not working for either of us. Let's talk this weekend to make some new plans. Sound good?"

Re: nights to ourselves
QUESTION: I think one thing that’s missed in Carolyn’s response is: the parents should discuss and agree on how many nights they want to spend together as a family, and how many are ok with just kids + mom or dad or childcare. I know in my own family (two parents working full time, a 5yo, a 3yo, and a baby due later this year), I would have trouble supporting more than one night per week of solo-parenting, because I think our very limited time together as a family is so important. Other families will have other comfort levels. But it may be that, after agreeing how many nights per week they are ok solo parenting, there may not be enough time for the wife to have her weekly practice AND another weekly night to herself AND fulfill her family quota. Maybe she does the weekly rehearsals and then one me-night every other week, or whatever else works. But maybe THAT conversation is the one that gets her to rethink spending one night per week that she doesn’t really enjoy. The biggest issue is that when you’ve got young kids, there never ever feels like there’s enough time to do all of the things you wish you could, so you have to prioritize.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: It doesn't have to be nights. Weekend mornings, for example, were a natural break time Back in the Day. Sign the kids up for X, and one parent takes them there and the other one has ahhh time. If the family schedule is packed, then the parents trade off that Saturday breather. Saw this all the time.

There was something else we used to talk about and I put it in the column too, though it's been a while? Each parent in a co-parent situation feels like they're doing 75 percent or more -- it never feels like just half. That's when you know you're pulling your weight.

Point being, it's important to remain mindful of the value and exhaustion in what the other is doing, too. If you start getting possessive of time and accusatory with each other, danger.
Being left behind
QUESTION: As someone who grew up and now lives in a very high turnover area near DC and is also going to complete a move abroad, I will say that the letter writer feeling sad about her friend leaving struck a chord. I have lived so many places and left people behind/been left behind. One of my dearest friends lives halfway around the world (all trips from her island seem to take 34 hours) and we still consider ourselves close friends because we text every day, avail ourselves of free phone calls on different apps, and share the details of our lives across the miles though we have wildly different experiences (free healthcare and no guns anyone?) Your friend AND you will be going on new adventures just with some miles between you and I hope you continue to share those adventures because that is the good stuff in life.

How to manage annoyance with good neighbor
QUESTION: Can you help me with some mantras or perspective for dealing with a neighbor who I engage with a lot and who regularly frustrates me? We live very close and our young children are friends and we naturally deal with each other a lot. I think she’s a good person but our styles are very, very different and I find it hard to organize things with her. I will acknowledge that I am on the more organized side and work as a corporate lawyer. She is a former teacher and clearly is more of a person who jumps in and does things on the fly.

That’s fine, but it’s very frustrating when I’m trying to handle logistics with her. For example, she asked if we could pet sit and I agreed. But then she didn’t offer a walk through so I had to ask for one. I then suggested a time and she agreed but then was not around. We worked it out but it’s an example of how I feel like I spend 3x the time and mental bandwidth on any logistics she’s involved in!

To reiterate, she is a good person and an excellent neighbor and has a lot of great qualities that I have not stated here. But on this particular issue, she’s obviously not going to change so I just need some help changing my mindset!

ANSWER: Seems to me you don't need a mantra so much as a shift in methods and expectations. Actually, a shift in apps. You don't use your calendar with her -- just text. Does that help at all? The good news is, she is extremely unlikely to be a hassle for you in general.
Marriage
QUESTION: If I'm making sure that we have sex weekly, because partner wants sex weekly, can I do anything about not wanting it weekly? He says it feels like I'm checking something off my to-do list. I mean I am but I'm just trying to be a good wife. Our kids are 7 and 9 and I'm doing my best to be there for everybody and my boss. But I'm just tired.

ANSWER: Oh this super bugs me.

The correct answer to your attention to something he finds important is gratitude. Or just not freaking crabbing about it to you after you do this for him.

When he crabs that it's not good enough, think of the message -- you have to look like you aren't tired, depleted, erased? It's not good enough that you're doing it for him, you have to pretend you're doing it for you? OHHH, it's terrible you have to pretend? You should be doing it for you? Okay!! So basically you can't win. You can't have an honest feeling. You can't be tired. You can't fake it, either. You have to give him the thing but not look like you're giving him the thing.

This is really crappy and not okay, and all I can do is hope that if he thought about it for a moment, he would agree that it's a crappy and not okay thing to do to you.

Yes, I'm sure you wish, too, that you had the energy to want it. It's not like this is your first choice of feelings.

Now -- I have sympathy for him and for anyone who doesn't think their partner is attracted to them, or with a strong sex drive whose partner's drive isn't there. Difficult stuff. But think of the limited menu that hands them: They can be told they're outta luck!! That right there. Or they can talk about opening the relationship, they can cheat? A lot of not great options. or ...

Their partner can make an effort to push past the low sex drive, understanding that's a part of a long-term monogamous relationship. That it's a mutual effort to meet each other's needs, with love and respect.

That's what you're doing. I wish I could beam thoughts into your husband's head that complaining about "good" because it isn't perfect is not a great look. Everyone is taking something from you, and he's whining that he's not getting enough.

That's all rant, no advice.

Condensed version is the advice: Tell him you would love to feel like your freer self. Currently, you are this self -- offering herself to him out of love. To be criticized for that is not setting a mood.
How to manage annoyance
QUESTION: It might also help if you don’t attribute your differences to your professions, or former professions, but just focus on a solution that works for you both (speaking as a former lawyer and a former English grad student/teacher, who saw examples of organization and disorganization in both professions).

How to survive as a trans person?
QUESTION: I'm trans and the world is super scary right now. Do you have any advice on how to keep moving forward?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Find your people, and let them help you when you need it. I don't know if there are more of us who want you to be safe and happy and yourself than there are people using you to score political points. But if you can find them, then that can be a refuge from where the "world" is online and anonymous and shouty. It will be something people want to do for you, if I can presume to speak for others. Even if none of you ever says a word about it and the deal is just to allow you to live in peace.

I am sorry you have to think about this. It's not right.
Re: marriage
QUESTION: I dunno - if I found out my partner was only having sex with me because I wanted it, and not because THEY did...no shower is hot enough for that realization. I get wanting it, I truly do, but...that feels like a much bigger issue.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: It could be, but not necessarily. Esp over a long marriage, mismatches in drives are almost guaranteed -- and if they both want monogamy, then there's going to be some degree of welp-okay. Is it for the other person, or is it for the marriage? Or -- is it so bad that it's for the other person? Or, maybe the lower-drive person wouldn't initiate, but, welp, okay!

Having a fixed idea of how you'd handle "that realization" is the enemy of figuring it out.
Response to Marriage question
QUESTION: I was just listening to a sexual health expert who said heterosexual couples are nearly always mismatched, and that it is the responsibility of the higher-drive person to take care of their own needs by themselves. The lower-drive person is the one who sets the pace for joint activity.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Sure, because you extend that out -- and you get to a point of the lower-drive person having sex they don't want? Yikes.

But short of that extreme, it is valid for the lower-drive person to see the life trajectory their partner is on, and make an effort to address the low drive, if possible.

Update and new question from LW with abusive stepdad
QUESTION: I wrote to you over 3 years ago with a question about how to tell my daughter about her father (who was my abusive stepfather). I took your advice and let my therapist guide me in how best to let my daughter know about her father. What she's been told for now is that he’s not a part of her life because he wasn’t nice to me. We are doing great. Last year we moved into our own apartment. We're scraping by, eating a lot of beans, lentils and peanut butter but making the best of it. I converted a walk-in closet to a tiny bedroom for my daughter and made a fabric canopy for her little bed and together we put glow in the dark stars all over the walls and ceiling. Our little home makes both of us so happy. She's a great kid - cheerful, healthy, smart. She’s in second grade now and the joy of my life.
Now my question. Her father died about 6 months ago in a car accident. He was driving drunk but thankfully no one else was severely injured. I’m so happy he’s dead. If that makes me a terrible person, I don’t care. I feel great knowing he can never hurt us or bother us in any way. My mother started contacting me after his death. She claims that she was as much a victim of him as I was and she wants to be part of my life and to get to know my daughter. I guess she could be telling the truth but I only remember the terrible things she said to me and the ugly names she called me when I got pregnant. I never saw him abuse her or even get angry with her. I don’t know. My daughter and I are doing so well and I want to enjoy our stability and not invite trauma and pain back into our lives and that’s what my mom means to me even if she’s telling the truth about my stepfather. My daughter and I finished with therapists just last year and this would start that up again since a relationship with my mom might mean that my daughter has to learn more about her dad, especially that he's dead now. Is it okay if I tell my mom we’re not up to dealing with this right now, check back in a couple of years?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Of course it is, yes -- and would be so without the extent of the trauma. Because you decide whom to have in your life and on what terms.

That's the bedrock here. All other issues -- including what is fair or reasonable or true or healthy, etc. -- are secondary. Everything starts with the fact of you as your own gatekeeper for your time and your heart and your self.*

Now, some thoughts about "even if she’s telling the truth." Knowing only what you've written in your two questions, I believe your mother was also a victim of your stepfather's abuse. Or at least, I find it credible. It's an uncomfortable topic, to put it mildly, but there is room for grey in the reality of abusive relationships, and people who are caught in an abusive cycle with someone like your stepfather can certainly do harmful things themselves.

Sometimes it's to themselves, or to their abusers, but too often it's to others. (Or all three.) Relevantly: We've all seen it over and over in this space, in fact, in the form of either turning a blind eye to the other parent's abuse of the children, or even siding with the abusive parent against the children. Nothing excuses this -- but it's cited so often by people who grew up with an abusive parent that I suspect it's a survival response in the partner. A maladaptive one, obviously. When humans get feral it tends not to be good.

Anyway -- none of that justifies her claim that "she was as much a victim of him as I was." If that is indeed how she phrased it. She was the adult, you were the child, you were raped, and she remained partnered with your rapist till his death. So, absolutely freaking not. There is not enough "not."

And further, "she wants to be part of my life and to get to know my daughter" is only about her. She's coming to you, imagine that, to help her heal? The framing a healthy person would know to offer, as you may have spotted instantly from your own good work in therapy, is, "I understand it was unforgivable, but I at least want to apologize for my utter failure to protect you." In other words, only about you. Only. Paired with an independent effort to seek support and heal on her own time and dime.

You can't want wellness for her. But you can respond to her that you're sorry to hear she also suffered your stepfather's abuse -- and hope she will consider therapy, given how empowering it was for you. (Your own phrasing, of course.)

Losing Half My Kid's Life
QUESTION: Carolyn, My partner and I are splitting up after some terrible, grueling years. I know I cannot live like this another second - but the idea of missing so much of my (one) child's life is unbearable. Do you have any words for how to bear up with this? Tell me it's going to be ok?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: It's going to be okay.

I'm sorry it has been so bad for so long. That means, though, that you have already been missing some of your child's life to that. So in a way this is your chance to reclaim some happier time.

Plus, the reality of co-parenting under one roof includes more tag-teaming, handing off, you-here/me-there, than you may realize. And, there's another relationship to conduct (an offshoot of the above point). Even when you get along with your co-parent, you are managing that bond and the one with your kid, and the mechanics of the whole unit together. When you're solo parent, it's just you -- you're on.

So yes, it's less time, specifically fewer days, but those days are more. Meanwhile, their time to themselves is something many newly solo parents come to appreciate and learn to use to their and their kids' benefit.

Talk to some parents who have made this transition -- not all the stories will be happy ones, but I think in aggregate you will find them reassuring. Definitely useful.
Fuchsia wedding gown
QUESTION: I’m getting married next year and couldn’t be happier. During the planning I got the idea to wear my grandmother’s wedding gown. She got married in 1970 and her dress is stunning. She was in the fashion industry and had the gown custom made for her. It’s a slinky floor-length A-line gown in a gorgeous shade of fuchsia. She hates the color white as much as I do. It has a square neckline that's perfect for a statement necklace I have. I contacted my grandmother and she’s having her dress dry cleaned and says she'll bring it on her next visit. She was able to wear it as her mother-of-the bride dress when my mom got married and says it’s still in perfect condition. She even knows a local seamstress who can fit it for me.
My future mother-in-law thought it was wonderful that I’d be wearing my grandmother’s gown until she saw a picture of it. She insists that it couldn’t be a wedding gown since brides only wore white back then even though the picture is clearly of my grandparents on their wedding day. My mother-in-law to be can’t let it go, she keeps saying what a mistake it will be to be married in 'that dreary old pink dress' and that I’ll miss all the fun of picking my own special gown. My mom suggested I wear something more traditional like she did so I don’t upset my mother-in-law to be. She offered me her gown but though I would never tell her, I hate it. It’s white, poufy and just over the top with tulle and beading. My mom also keeps asking what my sister (my only attendant) will wear even though I've told her several times my sister can wear anything she wants that goes with fuchsia. She acts like that's going to be so hard when there's tons of choices. With both moms objecting, is this a stupid hill to die on? My fiancé says I should wear what will make me happy and that’s my grandmother’s wedding dress.

Permission to leave
QUESTION: Some time ago, I discovered that my spouse had never been faithful to me since our relationship began, well over a decade ago. We have an elementary-aged child together, and I think we get along pretty well on a day-to-day basis, considering that I cannot imagine trusting my spouse with my emotional well-being again. We have both done individual and couples' therapy, and my spouse continues to withhold information about social interactions despite promising transparency.

There are obvious practical concerns, including wanting to retain as much stability for our child as possible, and the costs of separate households in a high cost-of-living area. How do I know that divorce is an okay thing to do when it would upend our child's world? What reasons are good enough?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: That your spouse is fundamentally, serially dishonest seems like one of the better ones to me.

Divorce isn't a picnic for kids but in-house instability isn't, either, so you do your best.

I mean, have you said outright to Spouse, "I know you will never be faithful to me. I am done trying for that. I want you to be honest with me"? I'm not suggesting you have an open marriage, or divorce and live apart, or divorce and cohabit as roommates, or whatever other configuration might arise from this tell-me-the-truth phase of your lives. I'm merely asking whether you've removed this last remaining incentive your spouse might have to hide the infidelity.

If you've done that and the lying persists? Then that tells you something. Spinning off your own household, especially if you have primary custody, could be a lot healthier for your kid. But that's super-speculative, probably (sorry) better for a session or two with the pros.

I'm sorry.
Perceived cruelty
QUESTION: If one feels they have been spoken to cruelly, is it better for one to confront that, or just cease communications completely?

Thinking of Angelou's poem: "When someone shows you who they are, believe them."

But unsure how best to proceed.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'd prefer more context, but without it I'll say generally that it's best to respond to people directly. "What a cruel comment. I hope you didn't mean that."

When you "just cease communications completely," you don't give people a chance even to know what they did to upset you, much less fix their mistakes. Certainly there are times when people know exactly what they did and have no intention of fixing it -- but severing ties treats that as a 100 percent certainty. Meaning, you're leaving zero room for the possibility that anyone ever misspeaks, or tells a joke that falls flat, or means it but has instant regrets.

That's just not realistic, is it? I believe Maya Angelou is a beacon, but also that you're misapplying her words here. I don't think she's saying, "The minute someone says the wrong thing, they should be dead to you." Instead, it's wise guidance on character, and on trusting yourself. You do know poor character when you see it, and it's okay not to keep granting second and third and nth chances for people of poor character to keep harm you.

That leaves plenty of room for you to tell someone the effect their words had on you, and to weigh their response. Their words, your objection to them and their immediate and longer-term response to that are all, to my mind, under the umbrella of "the first time," which I believe is the omitted part of the quote/thought.
LW1

RE: Losing Half My Kid's Life
QUESTION: I'm 3.5 years into this life. It's ok to be sad right now. I'd be more worried if you weren't struggling with this. My experience has been that my mindset is everything. If you keep focusing on the "this sucks" aspects of this long term, I can guarantee you will be miserable. If you can find ways to re-frame how you view this, you can be as happy with it as you want.

At this point, I'm thankful for the days I get to rest and live only for myself so that I'm ready to be the 100% parent half the time. I've been thankful that my kids have been exposed to a variety of approaches to life instead of one pretty dysfunctional one. I love that I put my Halloween decorations up two weeks ago without being mocked, that I'll never again sit here wondering when or if their other parent is going to show up for dinner. I've taken my kids on vacations where we enjoyed ourselves the whole time instead of trying not to upset "Grumpy Bear". I get to see my friends! I have a social life and hobbies. I wasn't going to get any of that in the life I used to have. My kids see me as a whole person and not just their parent.

What to do when a guy wets the bed
QUESTION: Hi, Carolyn. You’ll understand why I can’t ask advice from friend or family on this one:
I’ve been dating a nice man for about three months, and my family and friends have met him. I wanted to take things pretty slow, so we just began talking about becoming intimate. He is excited about this (ok, good), but after we talked about it, he told me that if he stayed at my place, he would need to buy a waterproof mattress cover because he “sometimes pees the bed at night.” I didn’t react with disgust, but I was taken aback and said that he should have this checked out immediately because it could be a health issue. He was hurt by my reaction and said that many people have this problem and I shouldn’t shame him about it. Yes, many people have this issue, but we’re 55 years old, not 85!
I have since found out that even though he makes decent money at his job (he’s self-employed), he finds health insurance too expensive and hasn’t gotten the basic check-ups a 50-something should have like a colonoscopy, prostate checks, vaccines, and etc. I like him, but I’m starting to question getting involved with someone who doesn’t take basic care of himself. Not to mention, a mattress cover may protect my mattress but what about the linens, pillows, and well, me?? Should I be more tolerant of his problem and work with him on it, or is this a big red flag? He doesn’t want to talk about, doesn't want to wear Depends-type underwear it and says we can just sleep at his house. My brain is so preoccupied with this – what do you think?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yes I will understand. Oh my.

I can't believe I am typing this, but the worst part of the adult bedwetting is that he will take it as the reason you chose to proceed to the nearest exit, when in fact it will be -- please -- that he "hasn’t gotten the basic check-ups a 50-something should have like a colonoscopy, prostate checks, vaccines, and etc." and "doesn’t take basic care of himself" when clearly there is a health issue on board that has significant quality of life consequences. Even if its actual health consequences aren't significant, which I don't know and won't address because I am not qualified to.

But adults who do not take care of themselves are, it is reasonable to believe, at the beginning of their burdens and complications. If you aren't even sure you want this one, then you have your answer.

This is going to sound sarcastic, but it's not, you probably want to thank him for his candor.

Proud husband and admiring wife
QUESTION: Your answer to today's LW was a wis e response to the particular issue of the money question, but I think it failed to flag a more fundamental issue.
I 100% agree with the wife that independence and a strong work ethic are admirable traits. What is not admirable is making them define his identity to the point that he "feels shame" whenever he receives help. Sooner or later, in ways small or large, everyone NEEDS help, and needs to accept it gracefully. If I were the wife, therapy to address this would be a higher priority for me than buying a house. Otherwise, she will have to have the kind of discussion you recommend over and over again.

Turns out I wasn't the gf, I was the other woman
QUESTION: I was the other woman for months and had no idea. I met my boyfriend through a dating app and immediately felt an incredible connection. It was my first serious relationship. He was a little older than me, a widower just getting back into the dating scene. That’s what he told me. We said we loved each other after three months, he met my family, I even met his brother when he was in town for a week. The only drawback to the whole relationship was that his job required him to work every weekend. Two weeks ago, I decided to treat myself to a Saturday spa day at the best salon in our city. After I was done, I planned to stop at a café that I’d been to once with my boyfriend. It was within walking distance of his apartment. We never spent much time at his apartment since he said it held a lot of sad memories for him and a lot of his late wife’s stuff was still there. When I got to the café, I was surprised to see my boyfriend sitting at an outside table with a woman who looked like his late wife’s picture. I was immediately suspicious so I lurked around across the street until they paid the bill and then followed them back to his apartment. I knocked on the door and when the woman answered, I asked if she was his wife and she said yes. My boyfriend appeared and his face told the whole story. I felt faint but managed to tell his wife that we'd been dating for six months. As I left, I could hear him apologizing to her and saying I meant nothing to him. Later the wife called me and demanded I leave her husband alone. He must have put the whole blame on me. I learned that she works in another state and comes home on the weekends. I don’t know how I’m ever going to get over this. I feel stupid and ashamed and crushed. We were making plans for the future, I thought we would get married. What am I going to tell people, especially my family? How will I ever get over this? I can barely make it to work every day and then I come home and cry all night.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Why? Why are you being so hard on yourself, when you did absolutely nothing wrong?

I get that you feel embarrassed in a reflexive way -- the "stupid and ashamed and crushed" is the natural trio of reactions most people would have if they choose Column A reactions (with Column B being the outward-facing set, the anger family). But after reflex comes thought, and I would hope with reflection you'd see there's nothing here that made you stupid or wrong. In fact, a good deal of relief is ready and waiting whenever you're ready to swap it in for "crushed."

This "boyfriend" is very bad news. Of what exact variety, I can't know and don't care. There's no real reason for you to care, either. Maybe eventually when you're ready to review and revisit and learn, but not now.

And the idea that he "put the whole blame on me"? Like, you hunted him down and made him cheat on his wife while she was away? There's nothing he could have told her that would erase his responsibility. Nothing.

There was only a decision on her part to buy his lie. That's another thing we can't know -- what her motivation is to keep lying to herself to this degree. But 100 percent, her call to you was her committing to the bit. She can demand you stay away and this and that and blah blah blah and it was never and will never be you. Okay? It's her husband and she has to know that.

Anyway. You got lied to but good. It's a scary, creepy, destabilizing feeling. That part I get. Especially in a first serious relationship, that can make you question your ability to trust others and yourself, so talking to someone about it might be well worth it. And just that you can't stop crying -- that's a get-help scenario. If your work has an EAP, that's the most accessible care. Right now, even, thehotline.org is appropriate because it's emotional abuse, what the guy did, easily.

But as far as feeling shame, again, please don't. Tell people/family you broke up, he wasn't the person you thought he was. That's all you need -- anything more is totally at your discretion, to whom and when/if ever you're ready. To learn someone "wasn't the person I thought" is basically every breakup ever, truly. Take care.

Frustrated by wife's lack of interest in building a social circle
QUESTION: My wife and I moved to our neighborhood four years ago, and have trouble making friends to varying degrees. For some background, we have a 5 year old and 1 year old. We lived in a large city, but moved out to the suburbs when our daughter was 1. My wife had a core group of three other friends, but by the time we moved, the other friends were in the process of moving elsewhere in the area/ out of the region all together (that's not why we moved; just happened to occur at the same time). This was particularly hard as her best friend, who was the glue of this group, moved to the other side of the country.

When we moved to the suburbs, we aimed to have a strong group of friends like we had before. To that end, we specifically choose a neighborhood that we knew had a lot of young families, even though it was more expensive.

In the four years that we’ve lived here, we’ve had mixed results with making friends. I’ve been able to make friends with some of the Dads in the neighborhood/our daughter’s school. However, things have been a bit harder for my wife. She’ll get invites from people to have play dates, but rarely reciprocates. We’re both on a few group chat threads, and whenever someone says “let’s meet up at a playground,” my wife’s response is “you should go, I don’t feel like being social”. Whenever I mention trying to get together with some of the other Moms we know, her response is “eh, i don't really want to” or “they won’t want to get together with me, they already have friends.”

On one hand, I empathize with her; I’m an introvert too, and I recognize that socializing doesn’t always come easy. On the other hand, it’s frustrating to hear her complain about how she wishes she had friends, when it feels like if she got out of her shell a bit, her social life would be better, and maybe she shouldn’t be looking for this unicorn of a best friend. It just feels like she thinks that a friendship is going to appear out of nowhere, and that’s not the case, she does have to work at it.

Am I off base in feeling frustrated about this?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: No, because it's super frustrating to hear someone complain, then pass up chances to fix the problem, then complain.

However: An introvert with a 1- and 5-year-old (and maybe a touch of PPD? “they won’t want to get together with me") is a low, low percentage bet to agree to the playground meetup to start from scratch to make new friends.

So maybe you, OP, but also you, both of you, would benefit from some realism and patience. She will need friends, yes, and is lonely -- but this is going to take time. Time for her to recover physically and hormonally, time for kids to grow a bit, time for better sleep, time to pep-talk herself into wanting to #$@&! start over.

Your wanting her to get on with it won't help. You mean well but I'm guessing she picks up the vibe. Sorry for the pun, but baby steps. These years are just hard. And moving on top of that? Ugh.

College transition
QUESTION: My 18 year-old starts college in 2.5 weeks, but has been gone all summer at a low paying, extremely demanding, exhausting, somewhat risky, but rewarding (to him) live-in job far away. He left the day after graduation and has only come home once for 24 hours. His college is 1,500 miles away…. Now the summer job wants him to stay for an extra week, so he said he’ll only come home (reluctantly) for about 24 hours before his flight to college. ….He has a laundry list of things he needs to do: rest up from the job, see the doctor (for a possible medical issue), visit the dentist for a routine cleaning, haircut, buy clothes/shoes, buy things for the dorm room… He thinks staying the extra days post-contract make him a shoe-in for a “promotion” at this summer job next year. The fact is that there are guarantees and the employer probably just wants more cheap laborers to exploit … I said if he doesn’t come home one week before the flight, I’m not paying for college. My question: Is this overstepping? A mistake on my part? Yes he’s technically an adult but I see this as a really dumb decision. College transition is a huge deal and the out of state college is jaw-droppingly expensive. He refused to attend the in-person orientation so he could stay at this job. I don’t want to pay SO MUCH when he’s showing almost no interest. PS back story is he didn’t get into the Ivy League type schools that were his first picks.

ANSWER: UPDATE: I posted this answer Aug. 1, when I announced the chat was going on hiatus -- I saw it in the queue and hoped the parent would see the answer and not threaten to pull the kid's tuition.

[I'm supposed to be off, but I can't help myself.]

An 18-year-old working this hard and owning it this much can't be the worst thing.

He sees the doctor in the 24 hours. Yes.

The dentist too if possible, but that can be at school. Check your insurance. So can the haircut and all the shopping. None of it really matters, certainly not the way it used to. He can click-click-click it all from where he is for delivery at his campus, or you can do it for him if you're both okay with that. A list and a budget and shipping instructions from the school are all he needs.

What neither of you needs is a power struggle right now. That is madness and it is not going to improve his college uptake prospects.

If anything, imagine the job as a relationship you don't approve of -- resisting it will only push them together.

But again, this is work! He's working and caring. I don't know how to beg you hard enough to pick your battles more carefully. Caring is good. Hard work is good.

Okay now I will be resting.
Hello, happy September. Ned says he's rested and ready.

Family (?)
QUESTION: My ex-husband and I divorced when I was still pregnant with our third and our other two were still in diapers. We became a great co-parenting team and when we each remarried, we welcomed our spouses and their children. We vacationed together, had holidays together. When my ex became ill with cancer, I was part of the inner circle taking him to doctor's visits when his wife couldn't do it, making dinners, being the taxi driver so ex's youngest kids continued with their sports, and supporting our older kids any way I could. My husband did laundry, shoveled sidewalks, and picked up the slack in our home when I was helping. When he died, his wife wrote a heartfelt message on social media and published a formal obituary and never once mentioned me. The larger family my ex and I created was a source of great pride for him. He even did public speaking about it - encouraging families to redefine who is family for the betterment of the kids and everyone. These announcements detailed his life skipping right over our marriage, co-parenting etc. They talked about the great care team and supporting and loving their two sets of kids (older and younger) - neighbors were named and thanked, aunts/uncles, ILs - and my husband and I were not mentioned at all. Our kids noticed it. I'm confused about my relationship with his wife. I thought we were family. Not friends, exactly, but family. Now I don't even know how to be in a relationship with her any more. Bringing up that I wasn't anywhere in any announcement sounds petty but my ex meant a lot to me. Our history meant a lot but maybe now that he's gone his wife doesn't want to be in a relationship with me any more?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Well that's weird and awful, I'm sorry, and I'm sorry for your loss.

As hard as it is to override the impulse, though, I don't think it's helpful to assume she wrote you out because you don't matter to her or she doesn't see you as family or wants to sever your relationship.

I mean -- they're all possible, sure. But it's bizarre to tell you that by erasing you; it's angry. And I'm not seeing anywhere that you were reading anger on her (though grief does mess with people).

She could also, say, have some weird hangup about his having an ex-wife -- like mentioning you in these carefully curated propaganda pieces for public consumption was inconceivable to her. There is still a whole cultural subset that treats a second marriage as a courthouse walk of shame. It's bad form to deny kids but erasing an ex? Pff.

That's one hypothesis. Another is an offshoot of the first -- that she whitewashed the official stuff because she didn't want to hear it from an uptight branch of her family.

Maybe both are a reach. The highest percentage explanation? I suppose it's probably in your own words: "we were family. Not friends, exactly, but family." Do I detect a mutual not-feeling-it? Without your ex to justify being friends, maybe this was her way of ... being done.

Regardless: As for "Bringing up that I wasn't anywhere in any announcement sounds petty," I agree, if it's for its own sake. But bringing it up as an "I couldn't help but notice ..." is an opening to talk about where things stand now. If you would like to remain a blended family of sorts, if way less involved day-to-day for obvious reasons, then float the idea with her. But say that if the announcements were a hint, then you hope she will tell you straight.
Glory Days Gang
QUESTION: My boyfriend still regularly hangs out with some of his friends from college (several of whom also went to the same high school). My boyfriend himself has accomplished a lot in the decade since graduating, but some of these friends are stuck in old patterns and conversations about things that happened in school. When we hang out with them, my boyfriend regresses; he will never mention things he's doing now in his public health work or with the friends he and I have made together. Instead he retells the same stories about stuff that happened at a school I didn't attend, before he was finished reaching adulthood. It gets really boring and old, and it only happens around this particular group of people. His feelings get hurt when I don't want to be present for those gatherings. What is my obligation to continue hanging out with the Glory Days gang?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Zero.

That's the obligation. His being "hurt" doesn't take away your control of your social time. Plus, while he feels what he feels etc. and all that, the hurt is misplaced. It's not personal; it's just boring. You're not included in these conversations, so you're just an audience, and the stories are all retellings, so you're an audience to the same show on repeat. He'd be bored too if you switched roles.

Those are just the basics, though. There are other things to consider: Snobbery is one. Yours isn't even veiled, as far as I can tell. So that may be getting to him. You definitely look down on this branch of his friends.

There's also the element, if you're both willing, of trying to come up with a third option. Option 1 is that you go and get bored to tears, and Option 2, he sees these friends without you. Right? Option 3, then, is where you agree to go if he agrees to make an actual effort to have actual conversation instead of high school/college story hour.

That's his challenge: Does he want you there badly enough to do the work socially to make it inclusive? If not, then he and his feelings can zip it when you decide to stay home.
How do I begin?
QUESTION: I have had an ongoing disagreement with one of my siblings which has resulted in not communicating for months. I was really hurt by their actions and I think I did my share of hurting too. What’s the best way to start off a way back? I feel really vulnerable.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: The way back is to admit your part of the hurting, and apologize for it sincerely.

But before you do that, prepare for the possibility that your sibling doesn't do the same, and just accepts your apology as the end of it without admitting any fault. It's a tough one, because the apology is only genuine if it's not intended as the opening of a quid pro quo. But at the same time, I expect you won't feel good about their walking away with the idea they did nothing wrong. It takes courage and a real commitment to owning your mistakes to be willing to do that.

It also may mean you choose not to reconcile for that reason, which obviously is a bad outcome in a lot of ways. But taking responsibility for your mistakes is the honorable outcome that's entirely within your control, so you do that. And you hope for and work toward the best on the rest.
New college student who is working
QUESTION: I don't know if this question was meant to be posted to this week's chat, and I'm sure that family situation has resolved itself one way or another now (maybe he's off to school?). But I wanted to weigh in that what this kid is displaying is the value of pride in his work. It doesn't matter that it's a "low level" job according to the mother: This is where a career and lifelong ambition and responsibility begin. Too many people now think it's attached to college: Go to a good college et voila! You will be given the golden key to wonderful employment. Yes, it helps, and yay he's going to college. But what will make him successful are these values he is displaying. We battled one of our kids to work over the summer - when she started to take pride at last in a "menial" job we were proud and pleased. And finally, you can't make your kid want to spend time with you. Blackmail won't solve that.

Re: College Transition
QUESTION: I am a 20-year college professor, and I spent the majority of this career teaching first-year students. Telling your student you will not pay their tuition is equivalent to telling your spouse you want a divorce: you are telling them you are ending their current work/living situation and their future life plans as they know them. Threatening to do this so they behave as you want is just as manipulative as when a spouse threatens to call the divorce lawyer "unless." I have had many, many students sit in my office, weeping, trying frantically to figure out how they will stay in school because their parents have threatened to stop paying for school unless they change their major to something they hate but that the parent prefers, go back in the closet, stop dating their partner, etc. Often the students ask for reassurance that, when they start lying to their parents, no one at the university will reveal the truth (because of FERPA, the student privacy law, as long as the student is a legal adult, the answer is almost always that we cannot reveal any information about them. Students, please think very carefully before signing FERPA waivers--and know that you can revoke them at any time). Alternatively, if parents make this threat too often, students stop caring, or they act first, rejecting their whole relationship with their parents along with the funding. I strongly encourage this parent to find other ways of resolving their disagreements with their adult child. Please make sure discussions about providing financial aid are calm, accurate, and only about your family's financial situation, rather than a leash to control your adult child's behavior.

Maybe the "second wife" didn't really want all that togetherness
QUESTION: I think it is weird that she didn't mention you, but because it is so glaring perhaps it was a deliberate omission - to make the point that she did not want to be the "second" wife, but his wife. It would have been decent and honest to put your name in. But when you think about it, did she want all that togetherness? Or was it you and him and some unfinished business there? I have no doubt that your involvement was helpful, but maybe on some level it was also too much, and this is her way of claiming her space and family. So I agree that the, "Hey, I noticed..." approach is a good one. You might want to be prepared that she never liked the arrangement and maybe felt run roughshod over.

Was my daughter a great guest or a bad stepdaughter that week?
QUESTION: My wife, our 2 children (5 and 7), and my mother-in-law spent two weeks at a beach house in August. My older daughter (Tess, 22) from my first marriage joined us for a week. Tess is very fair with blue eyes so is extremely careful about sun exposure. She got up early every morning to run on the beach and swim. I joined her several times. She would then head back to the house for a shower and nap and was back in bed when the rest of the family was eating breakfast. By the time she was awake again, we were all at the beach or out sightseeing. We’d return home at 4 or 5, just when Tess was ready for more beach time so we didn’t overlap during the day. Tess would fix dinner for herself (groceries she’d had delivered and paid for) about an hour or so after we were finished (we ate dinner early because of the kids). The kitchen was open to the living area so while she ate and cleaned up we were all able to chat. Tess would then head back to her bedroom to Facetime/text with friends or stream non-family friendly shows. She joined us for dinner out once and was always in bed by 11. She kept her bedroom and bathroom spotless. I was proud that she was so clean, considerate, and quiet so was shocked when I found out my wife was upset that Tess spent so little time with the rest of the family. I think it’s asking too much of a young adult on vacation from a demanding job to keep the same hours/activities as a family with small children. A lot of people her age would have been partying, chasing guys, leaving a mess so I thought she was a great guest. My wife and I can’t seem to reach an agreement here so decided to ask you which of us is being unreasonable.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: So if your wife wins the Who's Right contest, then she wins the right to be mad?

I hope she takes a minute to think about that before pursuing this any further.

There is a chance here to think the best of someone vs thinking the worst, in an area (blended families) that is notoriously fraught with conflict and misunderstandings -- and to do so using the well-established channel of the benefit of the doubt. "Thanks, Pookie, for framing it that way for me. Now that I think about it, she was incredibly considerate of our space and our schedule." That's an example of what it looks like to make an effort to like someone, especially someone whose ways are different from one's own. Or just when there's a huge incentive to keep things warm and functional.

I could cast it in a totally practical light, too: You raised this daughter -- so it makes total sense that she'd be following your model of what makes a courteous guest under these conditions. Your wife, a different creature from I'm guessing a different set of habits, givens and customs, obviously works from a different model.

Now that your daughter's visit has exposed this difference, it makes sense to get rid of the whole "who's right" construct (yay) and have a happy "aha" moment where you realize this is what happened. Your daughter got an A+ on your test because that's the one she thought she was taking and you taught her to take. You and she didn't know, and it probably never occurred to your wife to say, that your wife was taught completely different things and so all along your daughter was getting a C- on your wife's test.

No harm intended or done. Right? (Right?) The whole point of being a great guest and stepdaughter is to contribute to the greater good of the family unit (which, in turn, promotes the health of the individuals in it -- it's cyclical). So it still makes sense to give benefits of doubts liberally and celebrate the good.

And if your wife would like your daughter to interact more next time, then she needs to learn from this to make that expectation clear to you, and you and she need to discuss ahead of time what that might look like while being respectful of her 22/23-year-oldness and thoroughly valid lack of interest in sunburns and elementary age field trips. Then you can talk to your daughter to float some ideas.

QUESTION: i am a married 41 year old trans guy, working at a very stable job at a family business. money is good, work is soul-crushing and boring, white collar industry that tends to lean to the right.

my wife and i are planning a potential move overseas (grad school for her, presumably new job for me) but i'm struggling in the interim. any tricks for 'making' myself more productive without believing in either the work or the future?

for what it's worth, i've been to a couple of marches, and have volunteered on campaigns in years prior. i plan on doing the same for the midterms but i feel like i'm part of the problem by not being a bigger part of the solution.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You are not part of the problem. You have been relentlessly targeted, singled out and bullied by the problem.

That means, among other things, that if you need other people to be the solution for you right now, then that's absolutely fine. That's how compassionate people and civilized societies work. They recognize we can't (and shouldn't have to!) do everything all the time all by ourselves, and step up for each other when needed. That's the social contract.

To help you with your struggle in the meantime, I don't recommend "tricks." You're too smart for that. You know what just working and killing time are costing you. So I suggest instead that you think in terms of what can reconnect you with life and beauty. Think as small as you need to -- playing more music or going to more museums and galleries, for example. More walks. Gloriously trashy fiction or tv. If you have the time, then go bigger -- maybe a pet, a container garden, a new craft or hobby, a volunteer gig where you have regular interaction with the people you're helping. I'm giving a range because we're all so different, and what gives one life meaning can be a demoralizing drain on another.

And of course these things are always on advice-columnists' lists in do-something columns. But it's not what's on the list so much as the nature of it that I'm trying to convey -- get out of the "productivity" and "marches" mind set. Go to the "beauty of being human" well. That's the one I think will help.

How to treat kids fairly when it’s just not in my heart?
QUESTION: My spouse and I are about to take on the care of our 14-year old nephew. His single adoptive parent is elderly and very ill.

We have a 14-year old daughter and an 11-year old son. They are wonderful kids and have always had the stability of a two-parent loving home.

The cousins do get along well.

I can already feel the tension of knowing that our nephew deserves our full efforts and love AND that I just do not love him the same way as I do my own children. Do I just fake it? The kids are clearly old enough to know, see, and feel the difference.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm sure your nephew doesn't love you the way he loves his parent, either.

Why should he?

Things like that take time, and it's unrealistic to expect it to happen the moment life puts you together, just because. But that doesn't mean you won't ever form as loving a bond as any parent and child -- and that's where you can be the person your nephew needs. Just by opening your home, heart and family to him as another child. That means in standing, access, privileges, care.

It may seem cold to define it as a class of treatment, but that is what you can do honestly -- just not treat him as a second-class kid to the first-class daughter and son. To fake that you love him like your own child seems like it would be insulting his intelligence. And uncomfortable, no? Might he not resent that, even -- having anyone presume to be instant parent, especially as he deals with what must be scary feelings about his sick parent?

It's great that you're doing this, so please don't be so tough on yourself. Don't ask the impossible and then shame yourself for falling short. Be attentive and fair, be mindful of his comfort and need for space as he makes this adjustment, and, again, be open to getting to know him better and to having him as part of the family. Give it time.

panic when the work matters to me
QUESTION: I am finally in a science ph.d. program, and the work fascinates me. I got through the grueling first year and am trying to write my thesis proposal, just a one-pager to start. I know what it is I want to say but an old panic is gripping me as I do it, imagining that everything rides on this. I can't seem to grasp the idea of allowing a draft and moving forward. Does this mean I'm not cut out for this? Is there a way to do this better?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm just an opinionated stranger so I don't know what it means. But you say it's an old panic, and when it came out of your past and tracked you down, it found you in a science PhD program -- so I'm inclined to think it means you have an obstacle you've worked around in the past, which suggests you can probably work around it again.

Since dealing with old panics over and over again is annoying, and since proposals (grant vs thesis, presumably) are probably here to stay now, this would be a good time to workshop some permanent fixes.

Some ideas: There's the psychology-centered route, where you talk to someone who specifically addresses performance. There's the writing-centered route, where you shake up your techniques -- instead of typing, for example, you can talk your words into a file, just to introduce a small disruption in the pattern. There's the vagus-nerve centered route, where you walk, breathe, meditate, do yoga before your writing sessions. There's the logic-centered route, where you look back at your career to remind yourself of your ability to manage -- to quiet the doubting voice.

You get the idea.

Most writer's block is a matter of not knowing what you want to say, so if you really do have your points all teed up and ready to go, then you're in better shape than you realize.
Trying to be Switzerland
QUESTION: My husband has had a strained relationship with his dad since husband's mom passed away seven years ago -- and his dad started dating (and having women stay at his house) literally four weeks later. Husband still loves his dad and sees him once or twice a year and they talk on the phone occasionally. The relationship is just not as close as it could be or once was. My SIL, on the other hand, has gone no contact with her dad.

About five years ago, FIL moved in with a woman (not the one he was dating so quickly after MIL's death) who is trying to repair/reinforce the relationship between dad and his children. And she's trying to enlist my help. I told her I thought the reasons for the estrangement were valid -- my husband's dad was really insensitive to his children's grief -- and I didn't think it was her or my role to broker any situation between my FIL and his children.

I told my mom this and she was appalled at my response, so now I'm second-guessing myself. Should I try to reconnect the family? Even if I wanted to, can I?

The other issue is that -- independent of everything else -- my husband does NOT like his dad's girlfriend...and that is rare for my husband. So any aversion my husband has to spending time with his dad is only worsened if it means the girlfriend is going to be involved.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: If your husband and sister-in-law learned from the experience of their mother's death and its aftermath that they really just don't like their father or think he's a good person, then so be it. Their prerogative and they've known him all their lives. This could be a simple actions-have-consequences culmination.

But if the sole basis of these estrangements is their judging him for being with women "too soon," then I'm seeing boundary issues here. His kids don't get to tell him how to grieve or when it is or isn't okay to be with another woman. They can have their opinions, sure, but it's not about them. Just as their parents' marriage wasn't about them. They grieve their ways, he grieves his way.

There's also no one conclusion to be drawn from his behavior. Some widow(er)s are so bereft without their spouses they kind of lose it, and grab the first person who walks by. Or, other extreme, it can be a sign the marriage was oppressive to them and they hung in there and hung in there like they thought they were supposed to ... and oops kind of go a little overboard a few weeks after the funeral.

Just two possibilities. Are they admirable? Hardly. But does "messy" justify seven years of not- or barely speaking as punishment for not handling his kids' feelings cleanly?

Or the other person was on the scene before the death -- which can be anything from a total betrayal to totally out in the open all along, because lives are incredibly complicated.

I'm 50 percent with you on your response to your FIL's new person. "I didn't think it was her or my role to broker any situation between my FIL and his children" is concise and sound -- but it was all you needed. There was no need to tell her what you thought of the reasons for the estrangement, and not just because I happen to think they got up in their dad's business ... disproportionately. It's not your place to be the broker whether their reasons were valid or not.

The upshot is, your second-guessing was founded and worthwhile, imo, but takes you to the same place: no to making it your job to reconnect the family. But if you ever want to broach the topic of anyone's standing to judge another's response to a death, then that might be a fascinating conversation :)

grandparents I never knew trying to give me money I don't want
QUESTION: A few years ago I went to a lot of trouble to find and meet my biological father. Knowing that he left my mom pregnant and threatened her and my grandparents with physical harm if they tried to find him, I prepared myself for the worst. I’m not sure why I even wanted to meet him. With the help of my grandparents, my mom turned her life around, gave me a great childhood and an awesome stepdad. I guess I was looking for some clarity on where I came from. It was so not worth it. There was a reason he dipped, and it didn’t have anything to do with me or my mom. He’s a terrible person who chose himself over his child and everyone else his whole life. Even after I prepared myself for the worst, the awful things he said to me still managed to hurt me. I wish the worst person I’ve ever met didn’t happen to contribute 50% of my DNA and I’ve tried my best to forget all about him. Recently his sister contacted me saying her parents (technically my grandparents though I never met them) made a lot of money from the sale of their farm (they're retiring and moving away) and want to give me some of it to compensate for what their son did because they were always ashamed of his actions. My aunt seems nice and they all seem to have good intentions but I put that man mentally in a locked box and taking this money will open that box back up. My aunt admitted that he knows about this money I’d be getting. I haven’t even been able to tell my mom and dad (that’s what I call my stepdad since he’s the only father I’ve ever known) any of this. Can I refuse this money or is that a slap in the face to two people (three if you count my aunt) who seem like they're trying to do the right thing? It’s a nice sum that would help pay off my student loans but that’s not worth possibly inviting my bio dad back into my life.

ANSWER: I 100 percent support a decision to keep your bio-dad out of the zone of peace you have created in your mind. If it means face-slapping 2 to 3 lovely people, then that is what you have to do.

However. I am not as certain as you are that is what you have to do.

If this couple were, for example, to put the money in a trust for you (or your heirs), and if you (or your heirs) were not to receive it until your bio-dad shuffled off this mortal coil -- or until you decided you were good and ready to use it -- then could the money sidestep him entirely on its way to serving the emotional needs of the decent?

Or they could give it to a cause meaningful to you. Or a person.

These are just on-the-fly examples. But it seems worth some thought, at least, to try to connect the well-intentioned people. Call it a rebuke to the person who did harm.

Or call it off, the moment the effort feels like it's costing to much. You can, like I said, refuse the money, and say why, and say it's not meant as a slap in their faces because they seem lovely. You are not beholden to them.

It's your call, but talking to your mom and dad might really help.

For today's single mom
QUESTION: You're doing AMAZING - a full time job, 10-year old, maintaining a home, I'm impressed! I did it too, I was a single mom and I know how hard that ish is - and how much I felt like I just wasn't getting it all done.

When I met my now husband though, and explained to him that therapy was just too much and I couldn't do that and then immediately jump into handling the bedtime routine - do you know what he did? He offered to do school pick up to bedtime on those nights so that I could do my appointments and then take myself out for an hour (or read on a park bench) to decompress after. When I struggled during COVID and difficult work schedules? He offered to take turns doing at home school with my child (week on, week off style). He worked to make my life easier, more doable, more manageable - he even did dishes some nights at my house, tidied up when he was "babysitting" (although he would hate to hear me call it that).

In turn, my bandwidth expanded, and I help with stocking his parents freezer when we do elder care visits. I run errands for his parents, helped find them a caregiver, etc. Partners HELP each other. They work TOGETHER to make life manageable and to take on all of the things life throws their way because they're in it together. Someone is out there who will work with you on life, until then you're better off single. Best of luck, you're still doing absolutely amazing at all the things.

My alcoholic husband rejects AA
QUESTION: After years of not saying anything about my husband's drinking, I finally asked him to go to AA. He says he doesn't believe in AA and that he doesn't have a problem. He did agree to go get marriage counseling however. Do you have an alternative to AA to suggest to him?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: He doesn't think he has a problem, so you will hit that wall regardless.

Glad he agreed to marriage counseling -- that is a great start. Have a look at SMART recovery, which has information for family and friends. And my resource page has other options -- which at this point are for you, but support for family is a legitimate start. There's Al-Anon, too, don't forget.

X is controlling our special-needs adult child.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, I read your column every morning :-)
Trying to be brief, I have a lovely daughter who is almost 30 and has mild intellectual disability, autism and anxiety. We struggle trying to find things for her to do, and her father (we are divorced for many years) gets angry about things that she wants to do if they are independent – he is paranoid about safety and will not let her use WheelTrans, he also gave her a big problem about taking vaccinations because he’s into right wing crap- and generally, I feel that he’s holding her back. We both have trouble with his anger, as he will shout on the phone and sometimes stop talking to her when she does something he doesn’t agree with, which is just awful -but because of the hassle he gives her for every new thing she tries to do, it makes life difficult and she has a lot of trouble standing up and saying what she needs and wants to him. When she tries to do so he talks over her and does not listen, and he thinks that I’m controlling her. I’ve been trying to prepare her for fighting these battles with him herself, but it’s hard for her, and I’m wondering if I should still be inserting myself to help her with him- but I feel that that is undermining my point that he should learn that she has her own mind and feelings, and he needs to start respecting that.
Also would love some tips on how to deal with his bullying behaviour on the phone towards both of us when he feels that we’re doing the wrong thing. Honestly, I don’t know why I let him get under my skin, but that shouting and abusive stuff affects me a lot as well. I feel so ashamed that I also still feel controlled by this man, who doesn’t do any of the hard work for our daughter anyway, and has no real vision for her other than keeping her in a little safe box. If I can’t stand him and hang the phone up on him when he gets difficult, how can I expect my daughter to?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Your daughter needs to hang up the phone, too, when her father is yelling and talking over her. "We can talk when you're calm." Tap.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Please go to a few sessions of counseling -- just you -- to learn some basic strategies for dealing with a bully, and to talk through the merits of advocating for your daughter vs allowing her to advocate for herself. Ideally you want a therapist who has relevant training and experience (the American Psychological Association refers to this accreditation) but that's not going to include a lot of clinicians. Maybe you have someone already?

Also, while you're there, talk about ways you can teach your daughter these strategies through role play, or adapt them for her.

You have no cause to feel ashamed. But it is time to get formal instruction on how to stand up for your daughter's needs against someone who is actively working against them. Take care.

Proud Dad
QUESTION: My parents were just 17yo high school seniors when I was born. My mom and both sets of grandparents raised me. My dad was around for taking me to the rare movie or driving me to the library (b/c I always have loved books), but the man never made me dinner or picked me up at school or visited my teacher or took me to the doctor. I played competitive soccer and went to state for track and he never, ever attended one of my events. Not once. Whenever I post something on social media or whenever I am in my dad's presence and something positive comes up about me, he says, "Proud Dad" or "That's MY girl - all the hard work of parenting has paid off!" In restaurants, he'll stop the waiter to tell her that I'm in college and my GPA and she is a chip off the old man block. I have a hard enough time being around my dad but when he takes credit for something he had zero part in, it makes me want to punch him in the face. But, at the same time, saying anything to him would crush his fragile ego, which seems just mean. Help.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: It depends on what you say and how you say it, though, doesn't it?

"Dad, stop taking credit for something you had zero part in."

Ouf.

"Dad -- you're here now. You got off to a tough start but now you're here. That story has its own kind of courage, don't you think?"

Invite him to join you in this line of thinking as an alternative to getting defensive.

If he accepts, then: "We both know you missed a lot. Talking as if you didn't can't be making you feel better. It feels uncomfortable to me. I'd rather we build on what's true -- that I'm your kid, that you're here now, that we're both doing great. That's what I'm proud of."

If his ego can't take that, then that's on him. Plus, it's yours to say. You aren't comfortable. And it's your best chance to have a relationship going forward. Staying silently angry means you just keep tolerating him at best while building up resentment.
Boyfriend needs a project manager
QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been living together for 14 months now. Previously, we’d both been living with our parents and now we’re having some disagreements about him not being proactive. Even though I lived at home, I took care of all my own stuff (cooking, cleaning, laundry) while his mom did most of that for him. He’s a claims adjuster so at work I know he can be proactive and work on his own. I have never criticized the way he does things so it’s not like he’s afraid of doing the wrong thing but I am still expected to give step-by-step instructions when it’s his turn to do things. For example, if when we're putting groceries away, I hand him the toothpaste, later I’ll find it sitting on the bathroom counter instead of in the medicine cabinet because I didn’t say, put this away in the medicine cabinet. He says that if I want it somewhere specific then I need to say so - every time. When I asked him why he doesn’t just put it where he would look for it, he says he’s not sure if that’s where I want it. When I say it’s his house too and he can decide where things should go he just shrugs and says it’s up to me. Another example would be if we’re cooking together, I can’t say, please peel four potatoes. I have to say: get four potatoes out of the bin in the pantry marked potatoes, wash them off, peel them with the potato peeler that you can find in that drawer there, put the potatoes in that pot with enough cold water to cover them and then put the peelings in the trash. And I have to do all of that every time. Same with doing laundry or even making the bed. When it’s his turn, I have to tell him which set of sheets to use, where they are in the linen closet, where to put the dirty sheets. If I try saying, use any clean sheets he keeps bringing out sets asking if that set is the right one until I give up and say, yes use those. I’ve tried saying whichever ones you want, but then he says I’m not communicating well and it's unhelpful.
I want to add that living with him is not all negative: he’s a very loving, fun person, and he does do some chores without direction like taking care of the cat, watering the plants, and doing the vacuuming. The cat and plants are his and he says those are things he feels confident in. Is this step-by-step thing just something I’m going to have to learn to live with?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: If there is only one man on earth, and if you want to live with a man, then this is something you're going to have to learn to live with.

Otherwise, I hope you never hear yourself thinking that thought again about anything of which there are about 4 billion alternatives.

I am seriously serious. The first step-thing here is to take much better care of yourself. Don't ever throw your agency away so lightly. Over potato-peeling instructions.

The second step is for you to read this Emma comic (scroll past the purchase info for the book version -- it's all there).

Then ask him to read this Emma comic. Then have a conversation to find out whether he now understands the problem with "he just shrugs and says it’s up to me." If he doesn't, or if he says he understands but then doesn't apply even a minimal economy of arse* toward figuring out how to function, then you have some thinking to do.

This?: "he does do some chores without direction like taking care of the cat, watering the plants, and doing the vacuuming. The cat and plants are his and he says those are things he feels confident in." Is an 8-year-old.

grandparents I never knew trying to give me money I don't want
QUESTION: It is sad your experience was so disappointing. My adopted daughter sought her birth family when she became an adult. Her birth mother was a disappointment but her grandmother was wonderful and has played an important part in my daughter's life. Might it help to find that your DNA also includes a share of what appear to be very nice people? The money could help you and them and it doesn't necessarily open the door to your birth father and it doesn' sound like he is looking for an entry anyhow. No right or wrong here, just what works for you.
Sisters not mending
QUESTION: I have two daughters that lost their father literally 2 days before one got married. The sister now married did not want to attend an elaborate funeral service the next day for her father. This, I might add was not something he wanted. He specifically wanted a small service in another state. Not only that but a relative got involved in a lengthy estate settlement teaming up with one sister against the other. Fast forward, i now have grandchildren in two states with siblings not wanting to have family get togethers and excluding each other from family events. Seriously can't we get over this?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Apparently not.

Plenty of families can't ever gather all at once because of geography; it's still not great that they can't, but presumably they dwell on it less, just because the reason is less emotionally fraught than a grudge. Somehow a grudge feels more fixable than geography.

But it's not. Not here, not for you. You have what life handed you. So I suggest you make the best of it and alternate seeing your kids and grandkids in the two different states, and remind yourself as needed not to waste any of this time on the futility of wishing things were otherwise. Because no doubt you've already lost enough time and joy to this feud.
Controlling special needs adult
QUESTION: I’m wondering if the daughter - who is an adult woman - lives independently. In any case, at her age Dad can’t “let” or “forbid” her to use public transportation, or anything else. I know a severely autistic man, 43, who not only lives independently (pays his own bills, shops, uses public transportation) but has acquired 2 associates degrees from a local community college. Keep encouraging daughter in all aspects of independent adult life. One day neither of will be there, and she needs to have faith in her ability to function. Also, likely she will run across more bullies like her father. She needs good tools.
RE: controlling special needs child
QUESTION: This scenario is way beyond "how do I help my disabled kid do disabled-kid stuff"- OP is a neurotypical adult and afraid of this man. Every state has some version of Adult Protective Services that ensures disabled adults aren't being abused by caregivers. Reach out to them, explain the situation, and ask for advice. Some of them have more resources than others, but all of them should be able to point you in the right direction.
striving to remain calm
QUESTION: During this time of great change, I decided to try to remain calm, while still donating and volunteering to causes I support. Essentially, I decided against being wound up constantly because of politics. The outrage, stress and anxiety certainly did not help me or my family, and I concluded that the outrage did not do much to advance causes I support either. A progressive friend accused me of only being able to do that because I am in a position of security. I was flummoxed. We vote the same way and generally agree on many issues, but I guess I don't meet some expected behavior standard? Can we all try to be more open to others way of thinking, even within the same political party? I know many people are struggling with the amount of change going on, but can we strive not to attack others who may react differently?
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: Or just strive to be less reactive? Some alternatives:

Boyfriend needs a project manager
QUESTION: I had the boyfriend (now husband) who didn't do things around the house without direction. It was frustrating. We had several task-related conversations, that, like the letter writer, didn't produce much change. However, when we finally had the conversation about WHY he didn't feel sure about doing tasks that I thought were 'common', I found he had never done them. Growing up, his mother did ALL the household chores. I was amazed, but also felt sorry for him: so much he had not learned! So, I made it clear that I was not his mother, I was not going to be his mother, and he would have to contribute. I would happily teach, but he had to learn AND then do it on his own. We set a 3 times and then you're out (I do and he watches, he does and I watch, he does it). He was great at learning and has adapted the steps (if applicable) to make the tasks easier for him.
Going on 21 years married. He's fun, loving, motivated, and we share all the tasks of daily life.

Re: Boyfriend needs a project manager
QUESTION: While understanding the frustration and not disagreeing with Carolyn's points, there could be a couple of things going on with the passive boyfriend.

Does he have controlling parents? And, since he's a man behaving this way with a woman, does he especially have a controlling mother who is the uber-boss of everything in the home? This could be a lifetime of training for him that isn't going to be undone in just 14 months.

If he feels confident with the cat and the plants, he might be better off taking full ownership of a couple of new household tasks at a time, rather than pitching in with a lot of stuff that he still feels a need to get instructions on.

Is it possible he has an executive function issue? My husband and son are both brilliant in general and in their jobs, but they both have diagnosed executive function issues (one b/c of ADHD and one b/c of autism). They lack confidence in new tasks in which I have expertise--not because of ego, but because of fear of doing it wrong. People with that issue can develop incredibly strong functionality in some areas and struggle mightily in others. Practice and consistency helps, which is why I (with behavioural science training) say the boyfriend needs to work on mastering fewer things before moving on to others.

A HOUSE CALLED TOMORROW

You are not fifteen, or twelve, or seventeen—
You are a hundred wild centuries
And fifteen, bringing with you
In every breath and in every step
Everyone who has come before you,
All the yous that you have been,
The mothers of your mother,
The fathers of your father.
If someone in your family tree was trouble,
A hundred were not:
The bad do not win—not finally,
No matter how loud they are.
We simply would not be here
If that were so.
You are made, fundamentally, from the good.
With this knowledge, you never march alone.
You are the breaking news of the century.
You are the good who has come forward
Through it all, even if so many days
Feel otherwise. But think:
When you as a child learned to speak,
It’s not that you didn’t know words—
It’s that, from the centuries, you knew so many,
And it’s hard to choose the words that will be your own.
From those centuries we human beings bring with us
The simple solutions and songs,
The river bridges and star charts and song harmonies
All in service to a simple idea:
That we can make a house called tomorrow.
What we bring, finally, into the new day, every day,
Is ourselves. And that’s all we need
To start. That’s everything we require to keep going.
Look back only for as long as you must,
Then go forward into the history you will make.
Be good, then better. Write books. Cure disease.
Make us proud. Make yourself proud.
And those who came before you? When you hear thunder,
Hear it as their applause.

Parent with IDD Adult Daughter
QUESTION: I’m not sure where LW lives but it sounds like the adult daughter is self directing her services. Dad gets zero say in how she conducts her life at this point if she’s receiving any aid from the state and she is able to advocate for herself. If daughter is eligible for self directed services and not in a program, please apply immediately. She has missed out on so much and it can now take years to get approved. You need this in place before you both die. In self direction there will be a team, that includes your daughter, and other team members like case managers, brokers, behavior specialists, nurses, etc., and together they will put together a person centered plan to outline what her life should look like and how it should be unfolding today and in the future. Stop involving Dad in this and get the daughter a team in place she needs to support her from here on out. And the state pays for all of it if you live in a self directed state. Good luck.

ex I blocked claims he's miserable and desperately needs to talk to me
QUESTION: For Christmas my boyfriend gave me the amethyst ring I’d been admiring and suggested we view it as an engagement ring. I was thrilled since we’d been discussing marriage for months. I started planning the wedding right afterwards. There wasn’t much to plan since we wanted just the two of us at city hall but I did want to dress up and have photographs taken of the day. He kept saying he wanted it to happen “more organically” but wouldn’t explain what that meant. When he no-showed our appointment for the marriage license I asked if he was having second thoughts. He went on this rant about me pushing so hard that I was suffocating him and said he needed a break. He wouldn’t talk to me, just kept repeating that I was crowding him and he needed space. So instead of moving in together like we planned, I had to remove everything I owned from his apartment and not talk to him for a month.
I was crushed but after crying, not eating or sleeping for almost 3 weeks I realized if he didn’t want to marry me after 4 years, he was never going to marry me and I needed to move on. To make a clean break, I ended all contact with him on every social media site, deleted every photo of him, sent back the ring, then avoided him in every way possible. Before blocking him, I sent him a short message saying the break was permanent and wishing him well. His sister delivered a letter from him to me at work this week. He says I broke his heart (?!) because he knows we still love each other and both needed that break to avoid “emotional codependence”. He said he never expected me to "escalate things to pretending he never existed" and now he lost his best friend and is miserable. When his sister gave me the letter she said he really needs to see me. Is this something that requires any response from me or can I ignore it all and keep on healing myself?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: So escalating to a license-appointment no-show, a blame rant and a month's suspension was okay, though?

🤦‍♀️

Both of you are emotional flame-throwers, standing on the earth you scorched and believing you're in the right.

Both of you also, for that reason, might want to take a moment to sit in gladness and sweet relief that you didn't get married. Not until your natural (or at least after a beat and a deep breath) response to conflict in your relationship is to regulate your emotions or pause until you can.

This is not to say you were wrong to end things with your boyfriend -- "if he didn’t want to marry me after 4 years, he was never going to marry me and I needed to move on" seems like the only call here to me. But then you brought out Harvey Keitel and his bleach bottles to remove all traces of now-ex-love-of-my-life DNA, and I got a little scared.

I can't talk to him (ex-BF, not Harvey), but for you all I want to advise is a big picture look at this whole thing. It is hard when relationships end, yes, it hurts, but this is just So Much Escalation. And I would absolutely tell him the same thing if I could, and nudge both of you to counseling (individual!) to work on communication. Or read about nonviolent communication and its practice, if the time/money/access is an issue for therapy.

In a basic sense, one of you really needed to talk to the other, plainly, long before it erupted. I think it's clear his contents were under more pressure, but it was a both of you thing, not just on him.

As for now, having the sister come to you is not cool. Responding rewards that. Terrible spot she put you in.

At some point, though, I think it would be appropriate to unblock him, when you are ready to talk. Not forever or at length, just when you're ready to stop this he's-not-talking, then you're-not-talking war.

Still seeking justice from the man who killed my husband
QUESTION: Two days after I told my husband he was going to be a father, he was hit and killed by a distracted driver. Because the driver was 19, he got off with probation and community service. I read an impact statement, so did my in-laws, and several friends of my husband but none of it mattered. All that mattered to the judge was that driver was young and had his whole life in front of him so he got off with a slap on the wrist. I sued for wrongful death but it was settled out of court and the insurance company paid the money so that guy will never really pay in any way for what he did. He never even said he was sorry to us. He gets to live his life and my son grows up without a father. I know life is unfair but not usually this heartbreakingly unfair. I wish I could stop thinking about how much I hate that driver but I can’t. Only my in-laws understand since they feel the same way. Everyone keeps telling us over and over: “it was an accident’, “his brain isn’t even fully mature”, “let it go because nothing will bring Don back” and so on. I posted on a grief forum how I'll never recover until we get some justice for my husband and they said I should smear the driver's name all over social media and the internet so everyone knows what he did, so it follows him forever, when he tries to get a job or date or anything. Maybe that’s mean but it will make me and my in-laws feel so much better. Is there any reason not to do that?

ANSWER: You say "I'll never recover until we get some justice for my husband."

What would you consider "justice"? How would you define "recover"?

Because all see here is vengeance. And that's neither recovery nor justice. Your solution is just taking the anger you have inside and spreading it as far as the internet can take it -- which we all know is a force you no longer control the moment you unleash it.

And all you're doing is throwing to strangers, like raw meat to wolves, what has always been the proper responsibility of both the justice system and this man's conscience. You're doing this simply because you don't think these two corrective bodies gave you enough. But for one thing, there was never going to be enough, because there never is in the case of an accidental loss of innocent life. It's impossible. There is no eye for this eye -- which itself isn't justice anyway. And, another thing, his conscience may be hard at work on this every day if his life. You don't know that it isn't.

I see every detail of your side of the story, I do, and it's awful -- I hear your grief and sympathize while still adamantly opposing what these grief forum sirens are luring you into. It's terrible and it's as far from healing as I can conceive of at this point.

Life actually is this heartbreakingly unfair. Every damn day.

You may recall former First Lady Laura Bush also did what this 19-year-old driver did, when she was 17. She ran a stop sign and the accident she caused killed a 17-year-old. She said herself she did not reach out to the family at the time to apologize, and was wracked by guilt for years. Her reckoning is one you might want to read about -- when you're ready, but before you go smearing anyone out of certainty of what is just.

My friend Ann Gerhart wrote about her in "The Perfect Wife" in 2005, and Bush herself wrote about it in I think a 2010 memoir.

I am very sorry for your loss. I hope you will -- beg you to -- address the grief, keep going, vs. succumb to the rage.

Non-Beach Blues
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,

Next week is my family's annual beach vacation. It is A Thing - my family has been doing this since I was a toddler and I'm in my early 40s now. Not only will my immediate family be there, but so will all of my relatives since they live in the beach town.

I stopped going on this vacation a couple of years ago because my chaotic, alcoholic brother often made it so difficult. Intellectually, I know I made the right choice for my mental health. Emotionally, it's really hard and I spend the week sadly thinking about everything I'm missing. Any advice on how to get through this week every year?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Counterprogramming, right? I mean -- you aren't sitting home alone, flipping through old beach week albums, are you?

Actually, there is something to this. You kind of have to go all in on distraction, or all in on your inability to be distracted. So if you have some great other thing you can be doing, so great that it can get you to stop thinking about what you're missing, then book that annually in this timeslot.

If instead your hard feelings about missing the trip will ruin whatever else you plan for the time, then make this your annual Chores of Misery Week -- attic, basement, old files, DMV, photo purge, weeding, bring your worst. Just, suffer. (Good food and music, though.)
Elderly Mom and Animals
QUESTION: My mom is an animal person. She's always had multiple pets or rescuing some animal. At this point, she has one reptile, two birds, two dogs, and more fish than I can count. She is becoming quite unsteady on her feet using a walker to get around her house. I cook her meals and she uses the microwave to reheat them when I'm not there. I'm a nurse so when I work my 12hr shifts, I just cannot get to her on those days and I don't think the animals are being properly cared for. Her animals are her only joy and quite honestly have always been her primary joy. I worry she isn't properly caring for them and when I raise concerns, she pushes it all aside getting angry and deflecting. My husband and adult kids simply are not animal people and these pets need a lot of care. Also, what happens to all these animals when she passes? I don't want to hurt my mom and I think removing animals might actually kill my mom. Feeling really stuck.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Can you/she hire someone come in? If $ is an issue, would someone from the rescue group volunteer to come in 1 or 2x a day? Her continuing to work for the rescue could be valuable enough to the organization to make the tradeoff worth it, as long as a quick check-in is all the animals need to receive proper care. Another option is to talk to the techs at her vet, to see if any are taking on side work, or know someone who is. They may be connected to reputable petsitters.

Meanwhile, the unsteady walking and the dogs could be a hazard. Does your mom have a way to alert you? A life-alert-type button, or a smart watch?
Can't say I love you
QUESTION: I come from a really dysfunctional family. My parents are at the end of their lives (early 90s; mom has early dementia, dad does not but he has some physical health issues). Im in my late 50s with 4 other siblings. I live nearby my parents, who live in an active retirement community.

My parents were never touchy-feely. And I mean no touching, no hugging, no "I love yous" with me or my siblings. Ever. Honestly, if they ever said it to me, I cannot recall it or it would have been before I was in grade school. They do not touch or hug me to this day (although their method of discipline back in the day was physical hitting up until I was in high school, same for siblings - it could be considered abusive by today's standards). Likewise, I don't touch/hug them. When I see them (pretty often), hellos and goodbyes are simply stated.

Obviously, this has impacted me through adulthood. I'm single, no kids, and have had only a few short relationships.

What do i say/do when the end comes? It would so forced to say I love you. Should I find a therapist now or after they die? So much emotional baggage. Where do i even start?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Oh. Okay. I would take this slowly.

Especially since you don't have to decide anything now about when the end comes for your parents.

And it may simply not come up at all -- the opportunity may not happen, or may slip by. The Hollywood death scene where people gather and say their goodbyes is less of a thing than you may think. If the end does come in deathbed form, then it also often comes with spotty consciousness. I'm spelling all this out mostly to ease your mind, so you don't have to fret about a big farewell pronouncement that your life with your parents hasn't prepared you for.

That said, I hope you will tend to the questions and discomfort you're dealing with for your own reasons. If you're thinking a therapist would be a good idea at some point, then the best point is now! Sure. Air some of the stuff that has bothered you. Set down some of the baggage. If you don't feel like unpacking it all, that's okay -- just set it down for now. One thing at a time.

I also wish I weren't answering this live, because your situation strikes me as one that is so good for fiction -- meaning, I have wisps of memories of novels that really get at where you are, but I can't ... get .. them. And I think the beauty of a novel is the ability to inhabit someone else's life, to achieve comprehension and feelings from an armchair.

I know there are serious readers out there. Can anyone recommend a novel or three that takes a character from an emotionally remote and inexpressive family into connection and awakening? Thank you in advance.

Anyway. These are places to start. Another place to start, quite basically, is aesthetic or therapeutic touch, like a manicure or haircut. It may seem incongruous, but what you describe sounds like fairly extreme detachment from human contact. Maintaining regular appointments is a small thing you can do.
Re: Justice vs Healing
QUESTION: As a former criminal prosecutor turned civil attorney, I want to assure you that “justice” was served here, however unsatisfying it may feel to you and your family. The state pursued the case and rendered judgement and punishment according to the law. The civil case provided compensatory damages. As a former criminal prosecutor. This is justice. Carolyn is right that what you are describing is not justice, but vengeance. And neither the criminal justice system nor the civil legal system is designed to deliver vengeance or retribution.

Having worked with many families of victims, including of horrific crimes, I have tremendous sympathy for your plight. But Carolyn is right that no amount of suffering that you or others inflict on this young man will ever make you feel whole. And that’s because your feelings exist entirely in your mind and body. The healing you seek - and that you and your family truly need - will not come from the outside. Healing comes from the inside, from processing your own emotions and grief, from learning to cope and move forward with your life as best you can.

I hope you will find your way to a skilled grief counselor or program to begin this work of healing as soon as possible. Consider individual therapy for yourself and also group grief counseling so you can travel this journey with others and feel less alone in the world.

Do this for yourself. But also do this for your son. He has lost his father. I hope he will not also lose all or part of his mother to the grief over this tragedy.

cruel but dishonest
QUESTION: hi carolyn,

how do you handle a close relative who is unbelievably, openly cruel to you while the remaining family either stays mum or enables it? i think i'd be okay with the terrible treatment (being belittled, demeaned, secret messages, thrown glassware, tangents about how me and my wife make everyone's lives worse, etc etc) but the gaslighting from the rest of the family is really changing me for the worst.

i now feel the need to justify all of my behaviors with fact-based proof, like i'm defending myself in court, and i've withdrawn from most of my friendships because it's hard to trust that i am good for anyone.

i'm in therapy, on meds, but because i work with this person and live 10 minutes away i can't escape.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Why can't you escape? There must be other places to work and live.
UPDATE:
Since I didn't see a follow up with reasons the OP can't leave, I will try to answer without it.
First, always, I will urge you to get away from abuse. To interrogate your reasons you "can't." To work with your therapist to plan your way out.
There are interior approaches too:
-Know your abuser and avoid them as much as possible. Except nothing but abuse from them.
-Expect no help from your family.
-Limit your contact with all of them to what is absolutely necessary for business.
-Keep great records. Receipts for everything.
-Assume even this won’t protect you. Don’t see documentation as saving yourself, see it as doing what you can.
-Know that this is a "them" problem – because good people don’t do this.
-Start rebuilding your friendships.
Take care of you.
Breaking up with a narcissist
QUESTION: I have come to the conclusion, after 9 years together, that my boyfriend is a narcissist who will never change and never put anyone else’s needs above his own. The last straw was I caught him cheating and he lied about it, then justified his choices as “I can do whatever I want”. I have told him I am done, done, done. He keeps texting and calling and telling me how much he loves me and wants to see a couples counselor. I have experienced the wrath that comes with expressing my feelings about his behavior. I need a strategy to convince him to let me move on. If it matters, he is 50 and I’m 70.

Justice for Accidental Death
QUESTION: I understand where you are coming from - not fully - but as much as any other person can. 15 years ago my Mom was struck and killed by a hit and run driver while we were walking across the road together. The person who hit her was never identified and thus never "paid" - they may not have even known they hit her.

It's horrible and unfair and there is no way to make sense of it. But I know my mom would not have wanted me to live a life of hate and revenge. She would have wanted me to find a way to live a life of kindness and empathy - to focus on finding joy for myself and others, not putting more anger and hurt into the world. That path will not bring you peace or honor your husband's memory.

Healing Touch
QUESTION: My family was not touchy feely, no "I love you"s, etc. As a result, I'm not that way either and am somewhat uncomfortable with it. However, many years ago I started getting regular massages. Long ago, when I was single, I was at work and someone brushed by me and I realized that was the first time I had been touched, in any way, in MONTHS. I thought that if I got into a relationship with someone that I would go way too fast because of being so touch hungry. So, I started getting massages, and continue to do so to this day. Ironically, I found getting manicures really uncomfortable because a stranger was holding my hand and looking at me directly and that felt very intimate. But whatever works for you.

You don't have to be an "animal person" to go over and spend 10 minutes making sure animals have been fed. Reframe the need, and make it about your mom, not the animals.

Mom doesn't want brother's gf on vacations
QUESTION: My brother's girlfriend of 4 years joins us on all of our family vacations. My mom has been complaining about this since we took her on a big surprise trip last year for a milestone birthday, but she complains to everyone except my brother. He and his gf usually go off on their own once or twice during these trips and Mom takes this personally. She complains the entire time they're gone and blames the gf, insisting she is the one "running the show" and pulling my brother away. She has classic "this girl is taking my baby boy away from me" syndrome.

I know that my brother is the one who needs a break from Mom, but of course I can't tell her this. Plus, sometimes they just want to do things Mom doesn't want to do. This all makes me want to travel with them (Mom specifically) less and less.

Now my brother is planning another surprise trip, and his gf is already involved. She loves to travel and would be very hurt if she wasn't invited. Although neither my brother nor I are married, we're well past the age of our live-in significant others being excluded, and I think Mom needs to accept that (I wonder if she complains about my bf the way she complains about his gf, but he joins us much less often).

I did request that we take equal breaks if we do this next trip and my brother agreed (on top of the complaining, Mom has mobility issues, anxiety, constantly loses things, etc.). I'm inclined to stay out of the rest of it because it's really between them, but since Mom doesn't communicate directly with someone when there's a problem, it's very unlikely she'll talk to him about it. So, I'm left to listen to her complaints, despite repeating, "Talk to Brother!" and leaving the room (she turned to my bf and continued the rant).

What can I do? For the record, I've become very close with the gf and enjoy having her on these trips.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You can do all kinds of things.

You can stop traveling with Mom.

You can stop responding when she complains.

You can say, "I've become very close with the gf and enjoy having her on these trips."

You can say, "Mom, if you complain to me about GF, then I won't respond. If you keep going, then I will leave. If you continue your rant with bf, then he will leave." (Make sure bf leaves -- full empowerment.)

You can start singing "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" every time she starts in.

So the question is, what are you prepared to do?

Using the word “like“
QUESTION: My bright and beautiful granddaughter is working for a corporation and very ambitious to move forward. I see an obstacle to her progress, but I’m afraid to mention it for fear of hurting her in some way . The problem as I see it is that she uses the word “like” several times in every sentence. To me it telegraphs a youngster and I know she is quite mature for her age. Do you think I should tell her?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I see some people as just the worst messengers for personal habit corrections. If the grandparent role in your granddaughter's experience has been one of acceptance, than this could land really badly. And you could be wrong, too, that her tic is holding her back. So I say butt out.

If you've been her mentor and you're corporate yourself, then I'll reconsider.

Babies in the beach house
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn - I've rented a beach house with the same five friends for 15 years, and the plans have evolved over time to incorporate partners, pets, work schedules and food/alcohol needs. We added my daughter two summers ago, and this summer another friend and I will both have baby boys. When I sent our traditional "30 days to go" planning email this week, one person responded that having babies in the house "really changes the vibe." She said the child free group had been talking and proposed the families take the house the first half of the week, then the child free group the second half, and we can all hang together on the arrival/departure day. I was really surprised, hurt and angry (the week went alcohol free to support her sobriety, which also "changed the vibe," but were genuinely happy to support her). The other parent friend and I want to respond that we're staying all week because this is our planned and highly anticipated time away, and they're welcome to skip or leave early. My husband thinks the trip will be tense now regardless and we should just agree. What would you do here? The rental is in my name, my family paid extra for a room for the kids, and we're past the cancellation window.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Babies in the beach house totally wreck the vibe. "Change" was being nice. And maybe I can say this only because I was in the no-babies camp before I was in the babies camp myself, in a beach house gathering with the same group annually, as it happens (on point life experience for this one, I must say): but I'm going to ask you to re-think the "really surprised, hurt and angry." All three.

There is no surprise here -- little kids absolutely demolish a "same five friends for 15 years" beach house experience. I love babies, they're magical nubbins. But they cry, need gear, nap on day-trip-killing schedules, get up at the crack of piss, and either go to bed while it's still daylight -- or, worse, they don't. I'm sorry, they're just anathema to a relaxed group hang unless you have a rare super chill one. Toddlers? Forget about it. Both take their parents and parents' attention away constantly, because they're supposed to. And your friends are losing that time with you. So where is the surprise in their noticing the loss and not being super thrilled with paying big bucks for your distraction?

And the hurt and anger -- let's talk about those. Your friends don't hate your kids. This isn't personal. It's just ... it changed, not for the better for them, and it sucks. And this may be one of their few vacation weeks this year, and now they're working it around nap time? Don't hate on them or -- this is so important -- take it personally. They're just telling the truth and saying out loud they don't want one of their few precious weeks off to accommodate poop and crying.

If they need you to return the favor years from now when your kids are grown and theirs are small, it might irk you, too, but maybe less.

You have some of a point with the sobriety, but not all.

If you want to have a constructive convo about this, then drop the surprise/hurt/anger, channel the experience of being babyless on a baby-centered beach week, and own up: "I get it. It is a changed vibe. All I did was add a room and assume that was that, vs think how the group was affected.

"It's way too late for big changes this summer, but we should talk about what would work better for everyone."

I suggest you ask as part of this, "Do you see our tradition continuing for another 15 years, another 30?" Because life is change. Kids are just part of it. And doing the work through these "hard" years can really pay off, but it takes commitment and communication. (And fewer defenses.)
Mother won’t stop asking to include relatives in my wedding ceremony
QUESTION: Hi, my wedding is coming up this October, and while my parents have been wonderfully supportive and loving in so many ways of me and my fiancé “David” over the past year in the lead up, every few months my Mom will occasionally drop into chats that she hopes I can have her sister, my Aunt “Rachel” as a reader during the ceremony, because Rachel is my Godmother, and Rachel’s son excluded her from his wedding (various reasons, but partly because due to a nasty divorce between Rachel and her now ex-husband) several years ago and Rachel was very hurt by it. At first, my Mom started a year ago with “Oh just a thought” suggestions about what I could add, and eventually it’s escalated to “I want you to have your Aunt read a passage at the wedding, it would mean so much to her and she is your Godmother.” Our wedding is three months away, and I know David and I are going to meet with our officiant in a month or two to discuss what we want our ceremony to look like. Earlier in the planning it was easier to brush it off with saying it’s far away and we haven’t figured out details yet, but that’s going to get harder to do now. While I am keeping my mother on as much of an information diet as possible, I’m dreading the inevitability of her bringing up yet another “Have you found a reading for your Aunt yet” guilt trip, and her freaking out when I say no or if she gets me to waffle.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: K, coupla things.

1. It's not "relatives in my wedding," it's Aunt Rachel.

2. If it's no, then say no! I read the Q once and skimmed it a second time and I'm seeing brush offs and info diets and dread, but I'm not seeing, "Mom, I do not want Aunt Rachel to do a reading." A year ago.

3. If she takes it badly, then you can explain if you want, but you don't have to. It's your mom, though, and weddings are big feelings in tents, and you've run away from her for months. So: "I understand this is really important to you for a bunch of reasons having to do with AR's divorce and her son's wedding. But I hope you can understand my discomfort with the use of my wedding as the vehicle for her makeup ceremony? It just seems off in so many ways. Please let me have this without mixing in other stuff -- even my beloved godmother's stuff." A year ago would have been nice, but now will do.

4. You could also have Aunt Rachel do a reading. Do I disagree with what your mom is doing? 100 percent, with a marzipan dove on top. But it's a wedding, and sometimes a reading can be really nice. It's not like she's asking you to fit in a Sousaphone solo.

5. Either way, just Own It Already. Or don't get married. This is not a typo or brain spasm.

Because being part of a married couple is so hard on a person's identity. You have to remain yourself while making decisions as a unit and often thinking as one. You can become overbearing or vanish without even knowing how you got there. And so your ability to say "no" to Mom about Aunt Rachel is one of the many useful drills and test runs you've been handed leading up to your marriage. You've got an F so far, but there's still plenty of time to pass it. Get to it.
And congrats! 😬

Re: can't say I love you
QUESTION: I know the questioner seems to feel bad about the no "I love yous" and it has affected their relationships, but I just wanted to mention that not saying I love you in a family does not necessarily equal dysfunction. My parents never said I love you and theirs didn't either, but I love them so much and they love me, we just show it differently. I also know families who say I love you all the time but still have crazy weird fights. If you want to say I love you to them now you can, it might be awkward, but it may also be extremely impactful as you have kept it reserved all this time. And if they were good parents and took care of you they probably feel it is implied.

Tired of LAT
QUESTION: I’m a 60 year-old who has been divorced twice, and am now in a 4 year long relationship where we are “living alone together” or LAT. The person I’m doing this with is wonderful, amazing, loving, and fun to be with. The problem is we live almost 2 hours apart, and the driving back and forth has become tedious. We’ve discussed moving in together, but every time we do, I get very nervous. I really enjoy living by myself and having my own space and schedule. The idea of giving that up, plus possibly my house, just doesn’t feel exciting. Can you give me some ways to think about this that I can share with my partner, so that I don’t upset them and make them feel like I’m rejecting them?
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: Why is it on you not to upset your partner? "I really enjoy living by myself and having my own space and schedule. The idea of giving that up, plus possibly my house, just doesn’t feel exciting."

You don't move in just to avoid a tedious drive.

You have two divorces. This is not something to feel bad about, this is something to learn from. Worry about upsetting your own equilibrium. If you have to reject your partner to do that, then reject your partner. Not the right one.

This is a really last-minute (surprised) way to drop a pretty big change request--one that more-or-less says "we'd rather not have you at all than have you and your kids" (hurt) and "a bunch of us have been talking together about how you're making our trip unpleasant" (hurt again, and together with all of the earlier stuff, most especially the last minute nature of it, angry).

My dirty lens here is that an annual group trip my family participates in has changed in similar ways over the last several years, though the proportion of families-with-kids has been higher than that in LW's group. There is one couple in particular that seems unhappy with the ways that kid stuff has been a constraint for us folks with kids and has cramped their style in general, and I am really sympathetic about that--to be honest, I was ready when we first had our son to have the broader group declare the trip a kid-free zone, which would have been fine--but also we have worked really really hard on this trip to minimize the impact of our kids and it's been tough to get the impression that our friends don't see our work--they just seem to be always thinking we should do more in some nebulous way (which, to be honest, doesn't really feel possible for us).

I will say, finally and for what this is worth, our trip (which admittedly is bigger than LW's) has had some success in recent years getting two houses and having one house be a kid house and the other adults-only. Those who don't like the kid-centric trip seem to appreciate having a place to retreat, and those of us with kids have liked being in a house where people are of course trying to be considerate, but our housemates are more accustomed to and understanding of early wakeups and bedtimes, middle-of-the-night challenges, conversational discretion in the hot tub, etc.

ANSWER: Two houses is a great freaking idea. I love this.

And you're right at separating out the specific anger at the delay and delivery.

The OP's best approach at this late date is really, "Hey, SOONER, and to our faces next time, ffs." Make the point that now everyone's stuck with either a weird half-week or nothing.

Unless you all talk it out like everyone needed to a long time ago -- which, really, everyone owns to some extent. Communicate on how to make this one go better. None of this [whisper whisper] bomb drop, or assumption that everyone's cool with everything, or scorekeeping, or whatever other dysfunction piled up here. Kind of like the fridge on the last day of one of these things 😑
Re: Using the word "like"
QUESTION: To the author of the question about the work "like" in professional settings: Sorry, no.

I'm in a professional, high-consequence environment. I'm 50. Many of the "youngsters" have these habits that people like to associate with lack of maturity or sophistication. But when I filter out the habit and listen to what they're saying, it's easy to see that they Know. Their. Stuff.

It's time for people who judge on superficial qualities to get out of the way of people who are getting work done. People who can't see a colleague's expertise and knowledge because they're distracted by a verbal tick need to work on their inability to focus!

Adult Friend Makin
QUESTION: Totally random. When adults talk about being lonely everyone suggests volunteering. I have always thought it was a stupid idea. I would love to hear some other points of view in the comments.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: How is this random? It's what we do here.

Here's the part that is not stupid. The basic, known, as-proven-as-can-be recipe for adult-friend-makin is this:

1. Interact with a blend of new people.

2. Do so on a regular basis with some frequency. (Once a year will probably not help you much.)

3. Have some purpose that brings you together. This can serve as conversation prompt (icebreaker for the shy especially) and common-interest filter.

This is optional but ideal:

4. Have some project that requires you to work together. This allows you to be parallel and not talk, or talk about what you're doing, or go for weeks observing how you contribute to a community vs. going blah-blah-blah about whatever.

So. These 3-4 elements can fit into a lot of different scenarios. ONE of those scenarios is volunteer work. But it's hardly the only one. That's why it's included so much. But any time this topic comes up, people usually throw out a whole list of ideas because it has to be something you enjoy. You, personally, would be stupid to try to make friends volunteering. I feel pretty good about that.

Also, these things are not going to do all the social work for us -- at some point, the people trying to make friends will have to take a leap and say, "Hey, do you want to go to dinner sometime?" or otherwise take a chance of face-planting. It's just how it is.

QUESTION: Elizabeth Berg’s “Durable Goods” has always stuck with me, for its portrait of a young girl who has lost her mother and whose father is “increasingly distant,” and “often violent” - and especially for these lines, near the end: “He can only go so far in a good direction. Then something happens. He is all apart broken. For a moment I see him as someone other than my father, and he seems so curious to me, and sad, like an animal wrongly tied up. *Then he is my father again and I see that he is only what I was given first. There are other places to look for things. I lean back against the seat, close my eyes.*”
((Emphasis added). That kind of clarity and acceptance, that dual vision, coupled with hope, is perhaps what we all could use, not just with our parents - but maybe especially with our parents.

Re: Still seeking justice
QUESTION: Speaking to what Carolyn said about how life is always this heartbreakingly unfair, I know how this kind of tragedy haunts a family. My grandmother’s first husband was killed in a highway collision when my aunt was a newborn. My grandmother was about 20, had no job, and had an infant to care for in the wake of the loss. My mother was born about 10 years after the accident, and her childhood was marked by an extremely unstable home life. I know that grief is something that never truly leaves us, it is scar on us for the rest of our lives. I’m sure you know that vengeance won’t bring him back, but it won’t set things right either. I don’t say this to be cruel, I only say this because in the midst of all this heartbreak is your son. Your son is a part of your husband that is going to live on. Yes, that 19 year old has his whole life ahead of him, but so does your son. Which of those lives you give your attention to is going to affect your son more than it will ever affect that 19 year old kid.
I don’t know the name of my aunt’s late father, I don’t know how the case was resolved in courts or in the court of public opinion. All I know is the generational impact this tragedy has passed onto me. I know that my aunt grew up with a despondent, emotionally unavailable mother. I know that my mother grew up in the explosive conflict between my aunt and my grandmother when the system reached its limits.
Your son doesn’t need vengeance, he needs you. Your in-laws may share your rage, but they don’t share your responsibility. They lost their son, but you haven’t lost yours.

Re Mom and Pets
QUESTION: This seems larger than caring for the pets. Your mom needs a regular check in with someone who is a caregiver, either professionally or as a caring person. It is hard for our elders to admit this sometimes, or to relinquish responsibility for things they have done for themselves. But, for safety's sake, you might be at the point of lining up scheduled care for your mom that includes helping her care for her pets.

It was always abuse
QUESTION: To the person who said their parents’ hitting would be abuse by today’s standards - it was always abuse. It was never ok. Your parents always had the option to start doing better. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized how much “by today’s standards” is a canard. There were things in my family that were extremely not ok (my brother bullying well past the point of regular sibling conflict, for example). I used to think it was a function of 1980s/90s standards compared to now. With life experience I have realized there were no “standards” in 1992 that said choking your little sister is ok. My parents were asleep on the job at best. People my grew up in homes where that would never have been tolerated. It was never ok in your home, either, and you deserved much better. Do what you have to do to take care of yourself. I personally found Adult Children of Alcoholics groups very helpful for a while when I first started processing all this. People from all manner of family dysfunction use those support groups - you don’t have to come from an alcoholic home to participate. It’s free and more accessible than therapy for many. I think you also have a lot of stories to tell a therapist, when you’re ready.

I CANNOT forgive my father-in-law for wrecking my gardens
QUESTION: I don’t know how I’m ever going to forgive my father-in-law for wrecking my gardens. When we moved into our home 3 years ago I assumed total responsibility for the yard and gardens since my husband couldn’t care less about plants or flowers. I’ve been transforming the space with native wildflowers and I planted vegetable and herb gardens. The two pollinator gardens out front drove my father-in-law crazy - he insisted they were weeds and we were going to get a citation. Same thing with my perennial herb garden that took up most of the small side yard. That garden was my favorite, anchored by large sage and thyme bushes that I inherited from my mom. When she knew she was dying, she dug them up and brought them over and we planted them together. They looked bad last year due to transplant shock but this spring they were rebounding.
We went on vacation in early June and my FiL took the opportunity to have a landscaper rip out my pollinator and herb gardens, putting in non-native plants, mulch and edging. He says he spent a fortune and expects me to be grateful. I am devastated and let him know it so he thinks I’m awful. I don’t care. I can’t stand to look at him. I called the landscaper to see if anything could be salvaged but he claims it was all trashed. I’m sure he sold my herb bushes. My MiL claims my FiL is sorry but says I have to accept he’s not the kind of man to admit he did anything wrong or apologize. My husband recognizes the pain I’m in and has offered to help me replant everything. I’m too sad to start. He says we have to move on because even though his dad screwed up badly he meant well. I can’t move on because I don’t agree - my FiL wanted to show that he was right and I was wrong. He's that way - like constantly trying to let our cat out because "cats belong outside" or sneaking hard liquor into our reception because us serving wine and beer wasn't good enough. That got us in trouble with our caterer who didn't have the right license
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whoo. This is the thing: "even though his dad screwed up badly he meant well." His dad did not mean well in the slightest. Obviously you two had talked about it and you had held your "no," so he went behind your back with purpose and forethought.

Your husband, now, he means well for sure -- he is just not there, to the point where he can see his father for who he is. (You are right; profound control issues, rooted in cowardice.) Let's give it a "yet," though. Your husband is not there yet. Because he is supporting you, not his dad, and that's so important.

In fact, my advice is to support his support: Accept your husband's offer to replant the garden with your pollenators. For yourself. for your marriage. Don't wait for him to see his father's emotional sickness to do it. That is a longer term project, but he has gotten a start on it. And hold your line on your message that people who mean well don't do this to prove themselves right.

I am so sorry. I feel sickened on your behalf.

Mom talks with food in mouth—ick
QUESTION: My mom is almost 90 and, thankfully, in great health. Over the past few years, she’s developed a habit of frequently speaking at meals with food in her mouth. It’s gross.

Our family discusses this habit with each other. But we’re stuck about how to discuss it with her. Our dad, also a healthy 90, seems not to notice. He’s not mentioned it to us.

Next month we’re taking a family trip. For a week, we’ll have most meals together. That means lots of opportunities for chewing and talking. How does a conflict-adverse family discuss this with Mom beforehand?

Thank you.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: She's (almost) 90! You can't look off to the side? Take deep, centering breaths? Focus on her active participation?

Seriously. Before you decide something must be said, do some mental role playing. The business of being 90, even in "great health," is not for wusses. Senses and reaction times simply aren't what they are for everyone a generation younger -- or more if there are grands and great-grands involved. Let's just assume a mind of undiminished sharpness, no ageism here. Eyes probably hardened into the correction zone somewhere between age 40-60 (90-ish percent chance), so we're now plus-decades on that. There is a near certainty of at least some hearing loss. Just these two in combination affect the ability of a person to stay in a conversation with younger people -- unless there's attention to different abilities. There will be muscle atrophy, too, no doubt, and tooth decay and/or dental work, which affect eating and swallowing.

So your repartee with Ma while she's eating taxes her abilities at 90 a lot more than it does yours, assuming you all fall within typical ranges for your age. Needing to focus on things she used to take for granted, meanwhile, would understandably take her focus off things she used to be careful about, such as not talking with a mouthful. Waiting could mean she misses her opportunities to jump in and says nothing at all.

So a little leeway, okay?
For the gardener with the evil father-in-law
QUESTION: Take as much time as you want to recover, but you should move on for a couple of reasons. First, assume your mother-in-law is correct that her husband will never apologize or admit he was wrong, so it's pointless to wait for some kind of retreat on his part. Nothing would rebuke him more than ripping out the offensive landscaping, and the sooner the better. Second, your father-in-law needs to see your husband helping you replant what you want, and demonstrating that between the two of you, he is backing you. Third, letting his monstrosity remain in your yard will let him think that he is right. Ripping it out and restoring your garden will demonstrate that you will make decisions about your yard, not him, and that no matter how many times he "spends a fortune" you will just rip it out. Get back up on your feet, champ.

Should I tell my daughter she’s cut out of her dad’s will?
QUESTION: My ex cut our daughter, Anna, out of his will to spite me because I divorced him late in life. He showed the will to me. He is very old, has cancer, and is still lucid, so I doubt he’ll change it. He’s leaving everything to his sons from his first marriage. He says Anna can inherit from me (I’m 15 years younger than the ex). The sons will presumably inherit from their mother, too. Should I tell Anna what I know? It will obviously affect her relationship with her father. If not, I can see her shock after his death — and my sense of remorse for keeping a secret.

Landscaper
QUESTION: I am a fellow gardener and am furious just thinking about this happening.

1. Call the landscaper again and have them come and remove everything at their cost. How on earth did they do this project without confirming that the client was not the property owner?

2. Get yourself and your husband into counseling immediately. That he does not see what a manipulative violation this is frightening.

3. Keep a safe distance from the FIL, especially if you have children. He has repeatedly shown that he cannot be trusted. This is someone who is capable of physically imposing his will on other people and repeatedly violates their boundaries.

This is not a nice person. He knew what he was doing and did it anyhow -- this was a power move to assert his dominance over you, your husband, and your marriage. .

Mommy war/Daughter war
QUESTION: Apparently the daughter of my mom’s friend believes that each of our (deceased) moms felt that the other’s career/parenting choice was best. She had a great career and two kids, I had kids a bit later in life—a cross-country move and husband’s job helped us choose to put my career on hold. We’re all in our 60s now, and that hold has held.
However, she went on about me “living in luxury and traveling the world on my husband’s income” and not using my degrees. I said that wasn’t quite right, as I had used them. She responded with her lengthier resume. And then added a message about telling other people she doesn’t know me.
This is just a message on social media, but as a former family friend, I feel not responding is rude.
But I don’t know what to say, as I think anything I do say will be taken the wrong way.

Making peace with spouse's neglect of health
QUESTION: My spouse has a medical condition that with no action on their part lead to organ failure, need for an organ transplant and/or cancer. They were told they needed to lose weight and become more physically active, neither of which have happened since diagnosis (over a year ago). How do I make peace with this?
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: Is your spouse receiving support for the weight loss? Because if not, then the doc's prescription is virtually useless. Before you skip to peacemaking, look for a doctor who specializes in personalized weight loss support. The obstacles are so much more complex than the finger-pointers ("willpower fail") would have you believe.
Pool aunt and uncle letter
QUESTION: Hi,
I read the question about the aunt and uncle who were being strong armed into babysitting and wondered if there might also be a component of their siblings trying to encourage a relationship with the kids. Of course asking for child care over a vacation is one thing but the “we’d prefer family” made me wonder if it’s a clumsy attempt at trying to make a relationship. Do the aunt/uncle spend any time with the kids?

Maybe they don’t want to, which is entirely in their right, but a teeny bell went off for me as I was reading the letter.

Or maybe I just want a pool to go sit by. I’d be no trouble!
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yeah no. Parents can be present to foster the relationship, if that's what they really want. Or they can say out loud they want the uncle/aunt to know the kids better.

Think about it. The cover story is usually virtuous for the scammy ulterior motive. So who would use the scam -- free babysitting -- as a cover for the virtuous -- closer bond with the kids?
Approaching 30 and feeling dread
QUESTION: I turn 30 this year and I have a constant feeling of dread. On paper, there is so much I should be happy about - great friends, family, super intense but fulfilling job in the best city in the world. For now, I've reached my academic and professional goals. I have a very full life. But I just feel so lonely. My work is social in that I have great work friends and a lot of my job is spent talking with people. I have plans with friends several nights a week. I visit my parents (3 hours away) 1/month. But I dread going back to my empty apartment in the evening and I dread waking up in the morning to just myself.

I recently broke up with my ex and I miss him so much it hurts. I also just miss having someone there and I miss being there for him. But I know that regardless of having/not having a relationship, I don't want to dread being alone. Everyone says "go to therapy!" but I'm trying that and it's not helping. It's mostly just me blabbing for the whole session. I feel guilty for feeling so blah when it feels like I have everything going for me. How do I reset?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I don't know how "recently" you broke up, but feeling lonely in your home as you recover from that sounds right. Healthy. Normal. It's not going to feel good, but sometimes it's healthy and normal to feel bad. It's part of the healing process.

So having social friends and good work friends and parents you can and want to see often, and a fulfilling job, and a city you love? Plus therapy as a safety net as you heal? That all sounds like good stuff to have in place as you go through the emotional hellscape of post-breakup recovery.

If I'm right that that's what this is, then there's no shortcut "reset" option. You kind of just have to feel it until it doesn't hurt so much.

Except the guilt -- that's crazy talk. There's no "everything going for you" exception when you're hurting and you miss someone. Breakups and other losses come for us all. I'm sorry. Make sure your closer friends know you're struggling so they can be there for you extra.

(If I'm wrong ... or even if I'm not, then I'm thinking more truth-telling in therapy is warranted. Admit the guilt and the "It's mostly just me blabbing.")
Garden + law
QUESTION: A person who doesn't like you yard can't simply trespass onto and destroy it. I would recommend spending an hour with a lawyer to determine if you can force your FIL and/or the landscaper to pay to return your yard to its original state. Just because FIL is related to you doesn't mean he had the authority make changes to your property (unless he owns it). He couldn't do it to your neighbor and he can't do it to you.

Walking on eggshells
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,
I’m married to a man with two teenage children; we also have two young kids together. (It’s a second marriage for both of us.) He has a high-pressure job and carries a lot of stress, which often sets the tone for our entire household. We find ourselves walking on eggshells, and his OCD tendencies—likely a way of coping—are making home life more difficult for everyone. I’ve raised this with him gently and directly several times, but little has changed. I also feel like a single parent to our young children, as he’s often mentally elsewhere, absorbed by work or stress. How can I support our family and create a more stable, peaceful and engaging home without constantly confronting him or waiting for him to change?

- Overwhelmed
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: This sounds like a couples-counseling situation, not so much in a let's-dig-into-our-feelings way but specifically for the purpose of setting up practical adaptations to get the household working better.

Think about it: He's stressed from work pressure, then he comes home and stresses out you and the kids -- and that's when he's theoretically supposed to be decompressing from work. And then on top of that, he's going to do the mental/emotional labor of figuring out how to change his coping methods into something more family-friendly -- while also stepping up to his fair share of the household labor and having more meaningful engagement with his kids.

You're not wrong (by implication) that your having to function as de facto single parent is unfair, that it's tough on the kids, that he's the one whose approach needs to change. But being right and having sympathy for his predicament are not mutually exclusive.

Getting objective, trained eyes on this can help you two figure this out. Maybe how to give your husband some room to decompress when he gets home, for example -- built into a routine -- so that he's able to be present for all of you, instead of limping along basically incapacitated. How to add hired care strategically to ease pressure points. Etc.

Making it an appointment with you and a trained pro means it's something you work on together, in a dedicated time and space, sharing the workload, instead of asking him to figure it out by himself mid-stream.

Trying to solve stress while stressed is setting yourselves up for failure, with all of the best intentions. Stepping back and treating it as a design problem, then hiring a designer, sounds more like it. Certainly less charged.
Husband's friends are a bad influence
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,

My husband and I were struggling in our 15 year marriage. We tried a 6 month separation period. We both worked on ourselves and missed each other during this time. We are both in a place where we'd like to try again.

While separated, he became part of a new social group, linked to a casual friend of both of ours. He seems to have spent some time venting about me and the marriage to these friends. The casual friend, it turns out, felt this was a time to take sides, and he took my husband's side. My husband was ok with that (ugh).

I can't see us reconnecting if these friends stay in the picture. I understand that he needed a social life during a difficult time, but he agrees that they aren't really fans of me or supportive of our marriage. However, he is very unwilling to give them up. He has even lied to me about them, pretending he has cut ties.
What do you advise??
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Of course they sided against you -- your husband was venting about you and the marriage. They got the full dump of everything your husband wasn't liking about you at the time. (You didn't have a friend you confided in?) If you were to have heard an anonymized version of the information he was dumping, then you might not have liked you, either.

I can see (but don't agree with) your "We can't move forward with them in the picture" argument. Somewhat like, newly sober person can't move forward with drinking buddies still around. But you've hit the asked-and-answered point already. You drew the line for your husband and he said nah, friends stay.

So that leaves you with three choices: quit on the reconciliation, find a way to make peace with the friends, or convert this to an unwinnable recurring fight.

There are arguments for 1 or 2. My bias, there's never an argument for 3 except a delight in perpetual suffering.

Argument for 1, the lying! Omg. What is he, 15 and sneaking out on his parents?

Argument for 2, your ask was an overreach. Telling partners they can't see someone is a this-already-isn't-working first step. Either they get it without being told or you trust them without having to control their friendships.

In this case, a viable option for you was to say to husband, "Hey, this was your dump-out friend who heard the worst about me. Not going to be an issue?" And you trust his answer. Just as he would trust you on your staying close to the person who heard your worst about him.

Gardens
QUESTION: As horrifying as the garden situation is, there is an impending tragedy with the cat if the FIL is allowed in the house. There are reasons why indoor cats live much longer. Likewise, should the couple have children, who knows what boundaries he will cross.

Also, while the MIL is not the LW, there should be concern about her well-being and safety based on her willingness to excuse the FIL's unreasonable behavior.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Well yes, and then there are the songbirds. This to me is down the road with the OP and the husband, part of ... well I'll just quote my original answer ... "That is a longer term project, but he has gotten a start on it. And hold your line on your message that people who mean well don't do this to prove themselves right." This couple have work to do.

But it does start in the garden, and it has started.

Maybe the size of the overstep will be what finally exposed the size of the problem. (A concept that has been on my mind a bit lately.)

The MIL is her own concern right now, unless OP has witnessed something that can improve the husband's grasp of the truth.
Strange email
QUESTION: I got an email from an old girlfriend saying she is in a 12-step program and as part of it she is apologizing to those she has hurt. So she was sorry for hurting me. Nothing about what might have been hurtful, just a generic "sorry." How to respond? This was so long ago and the apology is so vague and generic that it doesn't even seem genuine. I broke up with her, so it's hard to imagine what this might be about. Anything I've come up with so far seems snippy: best of luck with your recovery? what are you apologizing for? Maybe no response would be better, but that seems churlish.

90-year-old with chewing issues
QUESTION: As an older person, I second what Carolyn says. My processing is a little slower than it used to be, and I’ve found that if I can’t jump in with a comment soon after I think of it, I either lose track of it in the flow of conversation or someone talks over me. If you want participation from the 90-year-old that you presumably love, look at your plate and fiddle with your food while she’s talking and be glad she’s still able to participate. Chiding her will humiliate her and may shut her down entirely.

Exhausted Husband
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn, I love my wife of nearly 20 years. But her insomnia is driving me insane. She is approaching 50 and believes she is in perimenopause, which is contributing to her difficulty falling asleep. Her sleep routine has become more and more elaborate as she tries to occupy herself and/or coax herself to sleep. There is the white noise machine. An app that reads boring stories in a monotone voice. Or she sometimes plays favorite shows from the 90s (that I find funny, which keeps me up listening and laughing.) sometimes there is music, other times whale sounds, or rainforest…. and there is the (very expensive) hot and cool fan so she can switch from hot to cold depending on what she needs. And so many blankets and different pillows. And lavender spray on our pillowcases. And sometimes she wants the dog to snuggle and other times the dog’s breathing disturbs her and he must go. Sometimes my breathing, body heat, proximity, or the fact that I can fall asleep in about 5 minutes when she cannot, all seem to disturb her and she will wake me up to complain about it. Carolyn. I am an understanding person. I love my wife. I feel she is suffering and should speak with her doctor. She says this is just something she has to go through. But I don’t know if I can make it. I need my sleep and all of this noise and temperature changes and disturbances are now messing with my ability to fall and stay asleep. I’m starting to think Desi and Lucy had a good idea with their separate beds. Any advice for me? I hope this is coherent - I’m exhausted!
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: Totally coherent. Why not separate rooms, at least till this passes? Or, doctor. She can pick one. That's a perversely fair compromise.

Response : walking on eggshells
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,
I'm the overwhelmed wife who wrote you earlier. I failed to mention that I've requested couples counseling (I'm in counseling on my own ) and have been met with much resistance. He doesn't think he needs counseling and it feels like an additional demand on all the other demands he has. I am trying to figure it out without pushing too hard. I appreciate your thoughtful advice.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ugh. I'm sorry. It's not "he" needs counseling, it's "we." WE need help with a situation that is not tenable.

This is about lessening the demands -- or else you would not be asking.

Does he trust you enough to trust that? Because:

It is not okay like this, to have this much tension in a home.

It is not okay for you all to be walking on eggshells.

It is not okay for you to be doing the bulk of the parenting. Because he and the kids are missing out! Workload issues aside.

A workable household is not "an additional demand on all the other demands."

Again -- it's to lessen demands.

So I'm seeing stress, eggshell-walking, stubbornness, mention of OCD. Are you ever concerned he will react explosively? Because then you have a different thing, which I hope you are talking about with your therapist, if true. That would nudge this toward a safety issue for you and the kids.
Sobriety
QUESTION: Alcohol use disorder is so misunderstood in our booze pushing culture. How do I share with my far flung family that I had a bad problem with alcohol but I got online support and found freedom 2 and a half years ago? I would like to be forthcoming but I fear judgement. I have a feeling that other family members might be as hidden as I was in their alcohol addiction.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Good for you for getting yourself and your life where you want them to be.

That is what matters. Not how others respond to your sobriety, and not where other family members are in their relationship with alcohol. I understand they're family and you care, but their opinions of you aren't your business, and their substance use isn't, either.

What you choose to tell them, though, is. So I hope you will be forthcoming, if that's what you want to do -- because you want to be honest about you, not because you want to fix them. I suggest you line up support before you do, though, so you have someone to talk to about their reactions. In case there are some difficult ones.
it feels like an additional demand on all the other demands he has.
QUESTION: This is what happens when you're stretched too thinly. You get into putting out fires and lose the capacity for thinking strategically. It all seems overwhelming. I have sympathy, but he has to find the time and more importantly the energy, to make some plans for solutions.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Right. The one thing you refuse to do in the overwhelm can't be the planning session to tame the overwhelm. That just makes no sense.

What does make sense, though, is that he'd be reacting to it emotionally as one more "you're bad and doing it wrong" correction, even if that's clearly not what it is. The reactivity is doing the thinking, which is the telltale sign of a spiral.

Though one cx, I'd say the time, the energy and most important the humility to agree things must change. thanks

QUESTION: I hope your wife can find a physician who specializes in working with women during menopause, as there may be treatments that can help with her pervasive insomnia. Women tend to think they just have to endure symptoms even though they are causing distress and leading to sleep deprivation. These symptoms do not just stop on their own, they can go on for years.
Carolyn Hax

What's wrong with telling a loser that they're a loser?
QUESTION: I'm reading your response to the mom doesn't want to meet her 24 y.o. daughter's 46 y.o. boyfriend, and I do NOT understand why parents should play nice with effing losers preying on young women. My kids aren't old enough to be dating, but if my daughter showed up with a 46 y.o., I'd be civil, but privately I would tell him what he is: a pathetic man-child who needs to prop himself up with youth and beauty in order to feel good about himself. There is no way a man that age values a woman that age for her full humanity. It's all about the fountain of youth. Why in god's name should I pretend to be ok with that?
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: So you know all the things? All the 24-year-olds? All the 46-year-olds? All the ways they may have met? All the personalities, all the interests, all the conversation topics?

You won't get an argument from me that there's a general experience and power imbalance, no. Problematic, yes. But you'll get 100 percent resistance that every and all fit into that general concept and therefore no relationship with those ages can ever be okay. The range of humans is too great.
Re: Exhausted Husband
QUESTION: As a person who has suffered with insomnia for much of my life, and is in the midst of the menopause transition, I sympathize with your wife (and with you). I agree with Carolyn that separate rooms, if possible, may be the best and easiest option. I'm in my mid 50s now I find most of my couple friends have separate rooms often for this reason. It only helps the relationship. I also second Carolyn's advice that your wife speak to her doctor if she hasn't already. Sleep deprivation is extremely dangerous to a person's health. It increases risks of heart disease and stroke, can lead to unhealthy weigh gain, and can be very dangerous when driving just to name a few consequences of prolonged sleep loss. If she can get to a sleep clinic that may also be helpful. Good luck to both of you. A good night's sleep is really important for everyone. I hope you can both find it soon.
Carolyn Hax

Hold Your Horses
QUESTION: My 16yo daughter has her first boyfriend. He is a nice kid. The boyfriend's mom has taken to inviting my daughter to everything and saying that my daughter needs to go "because you are family." The mom wants my daughter to go to church with them every week and was very insistent that she attend their older child's college graduation. Daughter's boyfriend thinks right now - age 16 - that he's interested in joining the military and the mom is telling my daughter that she can live with them - if needed - while he's at basic training. Why on earth would she need to live with them? My daughter says no to many events - she has a job and other friends and us, her family - and my daughter says that she likes hanging out with the boyfriend. My daughter feels like the mom doesn't take no for an answer. The boyfriend just seems use avoidance has his best tactic with his mom. I'm very uncomfortable with his mom's behavior. They are just 16 and have only been dating for 2 months. Is it appropriate for me to talk to this mom? Is that a big no-no and I'm suppose to work through my daughter? I've met this kid's mom over the years and she has a very big, pushy personality.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: That's completely bonkers.

It's most appropriate for you to talk to your daughter -- or I should say to listen, a lot, and save your talk for when it really really matters because you want her coming to you.

With all the eye-popping lunacy going on in your letter, the biggest thing is deceptively ordinary: "My daughter feels like the mom doesn't take no for an answer." This means your daughter is talking to you, trusting you (huge) and she is not okay with the mother's lunacy. It is so, so importanrt that you keep these three things intact.

Nothing you consider doing to "stop" (ha) the overbearing mother is worth risking those three pillars of your daughter's mental health: She is talking to you, trusting you and she is not okay with intrusions on her own agency.

This is not to say that the mother is completely off limits. There may be a time where you need to let her know in no uncertain terms where her family business leaves off and yours begins. But that too is a save-it-for-when-you-have-to thing. The biggest threat to your daughter's trust and emerging sense of agency right now isn't this mother, necessarily; dragging everyone into an ill-advised power struggle is the threat. That's why your position, for now, is to focus on building your daughter's strength to remain true to herself through this pressure.

That's another reason "My daughter feels like the mom doesn't take no for an answer" is so pivotal. Your daughter is identifying the problem and opening the door to your help with it. Much of that help, again, will appropriately be in the form of listening. But it is okay to say to her, unequivocally:

"There is no such thing as 'won't take no for an answer.' I am serious: Your no is final. People of character respect that. She may not want to accept your no and feel entitled to push for what she wants -- lots of people do that, this isn't just about her. But that's always their problem, not yours. I hope you understand and trust this." [pause for absorption and acknowledgment.]

Ideally it leads to further conversation. Either way, on the way out, be sure to remind her: "If you ever need me to back your 'no,' I will. And you can talk to me any time."

Acceptance
QUESTION: Late 30s - I think I’ve finally accepted that if I won’t be enmeshed and feeding approval supply to my mother, that she does not like or even love me.

She was abusive but I was trying to make things work with gray rocking and sticking to pleasant subjects.

Now she doesn’t reach out, she doesn’t say “love you” back any more. She seems to be living her best life. While I want that for her, I still feel some grief and any time I sit still long enough my eyes just start leaking water. But I do accept it, and honestly I think overall I’m much happier than when I stuck around and engaged with her cruelty.

I guess I just would like any suggestions to speed along the process of truly getting over this. Thanks!
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I am so sorry.

Think about someone who would be cruel and abusive to their own child. Who would go through the expected demostrations of love only in return for getting what they want -- as the back half of a transaction.

Does this sound like someone who has the capacity for "love" or "like," at least as you have come to understand these things? Meaning ... let's say, based on meaningful shared history, experience, connection, time, acts of giving, the joy of seeing thing through each other's eyes, comfort, familiarity.

To me, these things are anathema to the transactional dysfunction you describe. (And of course it's not just your mom, it's a pretty familiar form of emotional sickness.)

So I think the kindest thing you can do is finish the last few stages of the acceptance process and recognize that the mechanism in her that would produce the connection you crave is just ... not there.

It is, I agree, horribly sad that you got a mother who apparently does not have the capacity to love. It is, however, no reflection on you, nothing you've done, not a sign in any way that you aren't lovable.

In my experience, the combination of allowing yourself to grieve the first part, and then focusing on the second part, is healing.
My sister's pain.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn. It would really be great if you could help me. Right as I type, my sister is typing me about our father, who is deceased. He is all that she wants to talk about these days. It started with a psychic who told her that her depression was caused by our dad sexually abusing her. She was like, "Oh yeah! He did!" No specific memories, but just a "creepy" feeling that she's always had around him. She says she went to a therapist who agrees that 100% she was sexually abused by dad. I ALWAYS want to believe the woman, but I DON'T BELIEVE HER. I feel terrible that she feels this way. But I don't know how to talk to her! HELP!
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Oh my. Even if we were given an instruction manual for life, I don't think there'd be anything about how a sibling responds to this.

What may help you here is that you don't have to have a response, per se. You don't have to believe (or disbelieve) her. You don't know what happened and presumably never will, and your father is gone, so life is not reasonably asking you to have an opinion or take a side.

Your sister, meanwhile, does seem to want to tell you about this, but you are not the appropriate person, necessarily, to help her heal. You are/were too close to it yourself -- so you're someone to be updated, if that's what she wants, and to make sympathetic sounds in response to what she tells you. But you are not the right person to bring into her reckoning process. (Check out Ring Theory. As part of the nuclear family, I see you as defensibly innermost to this issue and therefore not a dumping-in place.)

These do simplify your role considerably. You can clarify your role to your sister, too, and put boundaries around it without coming off as an uncaring or disbelieving jerk of a sibling. You can say something to the effect of being glad she trusted you with this, and wanting her to have the support she needs. Then you can say that you feel too close to it as her sib and your father's child to be the place she goes to work through it-- just too confusing and complicated. And you can assure her you aren't shutting down the topic, you just want her to know what you can and can't do right now.

Should I ask or not?
QUESTION: My partner (P) asked me to fetch them their passport from their travel wallet in our safe. It was not in their wallet where it usually is so I had to look around to try find it. Just before I called P to say I could not find it, I came across 8 pictures in the wallet, 6 were special pictures of P and their close family and best friend. 2 were of P and a particular person of the opposite sex (A), we are heterosexual. When I saw those pictures my body and mind reacted, as if I was not in control of them. I tried to override all the negative thoughts that raced through my mind. Telling myself it means nothing, my mind is just overreacting on the negative side. But this was to no avail, if not making things worse. About 9 years ago before we got married and while we were in early innings of dating, long distance, P told me that someone had asked them if their partner (me) was not worried about P spending so much time with A and sleeping over at A’s house sometimes. At the time I said, no, I was not concerned as I considered A to be a close friend who had previously dated P’s then best friend (B). And that was that. But the pictures of P and A triggered that thought from the archives. Plus I guess how P talks about A more than any of their other friends and has become close to A more than with B and other close friends. All this probably contributed to my reaction, but was never an issue (at least conscious one) until the pictures. I do not think anything physical has ever happened between P and A, they have not seen each other except maybe once or twice in last 3 years or so. Although 6 years ago P went to visit A for a week or so. A was married then and living with their family and kids. So if anything, I guess it would be emotional affair at the worst or just close friends at best I guess. However it’s gnawing at me. Should I ask P about the pictures or should I just keep trying to ignore my mind and it’s normal for one to keep pictures of a close friend of opposite sex in a wallet in the safe among other special family pictures? If you recommend I ask, how do you recommend I ask? I have never had to have such a conversation in my life before and not sure how to approach it or if I should even approach it.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: These are great questions. I suggest turning them over in your mind before you say anything, because they can really help clarify what you'd be asking and why.

I believe, for example, that you already know his having pix of A isn't "normal," or that his connection to A is ... different. That's all I will commit to, because there can be so many different iterations of this. They could be having an active affair; she could be the one who got away, with (a) some embers still or (b) nothing left to it now; he could have a thing for her that she never ever reciprocated and he never got over -- but he just had to get on with his life. Which could be something he's very glad he did! His state of mind now and when he put the pix in there could be different, who knows. And so on.

Anyway. This is not to torture you with new possibilities, but to help you map out your own mind, heart, values. You may have someone from your past who fits this "I had to give up and move on" description, only you didn't stay in touch or save pictures -- in which case incorporating it into your happy reality isn't beyond comprehension. Or you may suddenly see this is the end of your marriage. There's so much potential range.

As you sort out possibilities and what you might or might not be able to accept, also work on your knowledge -- including what you already know but maybe haven't let yourself believe/dwell on. This is usually a lot. Then think about what more you need to know.

There's also much potential range in this category -- what we choose/want/need to know. It has always fascinated me, really, how different people are about this. Some people Must Know and some mindfully choose not to, and I long ago stopped having an opinion on the rightness of any one position. Too personal.

When you know you, then I think you'll have a lot better idea whether you want to ask, and if so, what you'll ask, how, when and why. But the opening is, "I found these." Then space for his response. Few words then much silence make a powerful combo for getting an answer.

re: should I ask
QUESTION: It is my belief that having a relationship where you fear asking and being vulnerable to a problematic answer so you try to pretend not to know what you know is self-defeating. Ask. listen. Feel. Reply. Ask more. Listen more.

Risk openness.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: yes, yes, agree. Two qualifiers (not really the right word). One is that the pre-thinking process can really help with the state of mind we bring to the conversation. Coming in hot and fearful can have a truth-suppressant effect, even when we're talking to someone honest or willing to be honest. When possible, getting into a calm and open frame of mind -- even scared -- can really help.

Two, I think the "I choose not to ask" option is for when you already know except for the actual knowing, and you've decided the answer does not change anything. I don't recommend it for "the truth is too scary." "I can't handle the truth!!"

Credit card fraud and secrecy
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn
I wrote you a few weeks ago with a problem. It has since morphed. Husband's best friend's wife approached my husband with a bizarre request which he ducked completely. Unbeknownst to her husband, she took out a credit card in his name and failed to pay the bill she racked up. She asked my husband if he'd lend her the money to pay the credit card. He completely avoided her. She also said her plan was to negotiate with the company to repay them less than she actually owed. My question to you was shouldn't the husband be apprised of all of this and you, not surprisingly said yes. Wife fraudulently took out a card in husband's name and was now damaging his credit while the poor shnook is in the dark. Well, my husband is someone who takes conflict avoidance to a new level. He never returned the wife's multiple calls and never told his friend anything. Bad move, I know. The question is..me. I REALLY don't want to get involved. This is his friend. But I like the guy and don't feel right leaving him uninformed while his credit is shredded. But if I say something, I will ignite multiple explosions. The wife is a piece of work. Friend will be aghast with my husband for not telling him promptly. And my husband will be irate with me. Help.

Value of non-productive time
QUESTION: You said something in today's column - "You have value for existing — not solely for what you contribute."
Sure, in theory. I think where I get hung up is that I believe everyone should contribute what they can, and receive what they need. (Yeah, I'm a dirty pinko.)
Since I am a person who can contribute, I must. I have no limiting factors to my productivity other than the time I need to spend eating, sleeping, and like, brushing my teeth. I know many people are not as fortunate, and so the inherent value of *their* lives, even though they are not able to be as productive, means that I and people like me must work a little more to keep the whole boat afloat. Does that make sense?
Burnout is always around the corner for me. Can you help me reframe it and really, truly convince myself that it's ok to NOT?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm not sure you need a reframe as much as a closer look at your own picture:

"I know many people are not as fortunate, and so the inherent value of *their* lives ... means that I and people like me must work a little more to keep the whole boat afloat."

You don't define "more." So, more than what? What if only 15 hours a week, say, covered the share any given person needed to contribute, and you satisfied the "a little more" requirement by adding only an hour to that?

By that math, all your burnout hours would be for some vague idea that you had to even though there's no actual need for it. In fact, maybe deciding not to work those extra hours would free up a work opportunity for someone who needs the work.

You're hung up on your own construct. I suggest a construct where you get evenings, weekends and at least four weeks a year off.
Help stuck son
QUESTION: My son graduated from college, got a good job, lost the jobs after a year and a half and hasn't found another one. He's been applying to jobs on-line for over a year. He's had some phone interviews, but not one single follow-up interview. For some reason, his college is not responding to requests for help. I've suggested he take some graduate classes, but he asks, what if he gets a master's and still can't find a job? I'd like to find him some career counselling, but don't know where to find someone who will be effective.

How do I help him get unstuck, because it's clear to me that doing what he's been doing is not going to suddenly produce a better result, particularly as the gap on his resume just gets bigger.

ANSWER: I can't explain the college career office, odd, and this is definitely not my lane, but this has become (gradually then suddenly) such an issue for recent grads that I want to get something out on the record to acknowledge it.

I also think your son is right not to panic into "graduate classes" without a clear plan. This is the time for him to think of a career path that has openings and is even growing, as others are drying up. If he needs to train for it, then so be it, but specific training/apprenticeship, on the consensus recommendation of people in the field. Very targeted education.

As for career counseling, that's a yes -- first step -- and he can check here at the National Career Development Association to start looking for someone.

RE: Credit card fraud
QUESTION: You need to tell your husband, point blank, that he will either tell your friend that he's the victim of what is essentially identity theft - doesn't matter if it's someone he knows, it's still fraud - right then and there, or you will, because you do not want to be an accessory to a crime after the fact. Even if the odds you'd be legally charged are low to nonexistent, it's still not something anyone should be okay with. And if he expresses reticence, then say, fine, I'm doing it now. Whatever consequences accrue to your husband from that are on him, not you - and hopefully this is way way WAY off base, but if you are worried about his reaction to the point of feeling unsafe, then it's time to make a plan to get out.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Well, if it's not way way WAY off base, then it's an important warning.

The other warning is the milder one, but still significant -- of being married to someone so "non-confrontational" as to be virtually nonfunctional when anything gross enough hits the fan hard enough to warrant courage.

Plenty of people develop non-confrontational tendencies, for a lot of reasons. But defaulting to them isn't destiny, it's a choice.

"I have no limiting factors to my productivity other than the time I need to spend eating, sleeping"
QUESTION: Wrong! Whatever the (debatable) value of your productivity is, it also limited by your need to rest. To play. To let your mind wander, so it can come up with cool new ideas that serve your immediate community and the wider world. Operating on the edge of burnout is NOT "productive," especially since you don't know if other demands on your time and energy are in the future. You need to have some "surge capacity" so aim for, like 75% productivity and rest and store up your energy and time and talents for unexpected emergencies.

But he may be dreading best friend wanting advice on a range of questions (from why did my wife come to you? to should I get a divorce?). Having watched a few friends go through this (one spouse secretly rack up credit card), the outcome on the marriage is not predictable (divorce is not inevitable). All of which to say this is a "I think you should know" call -- and what happens after that is left to the couple (you and hubby can and should stay out).

Secondhand Dog Embarrassment
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,

I take daily 6 am walks with my neighbor, "Sarah." She is not a close friend, but we are in similar stages of life with the same constraints on our schedules. (If the walk doesn't happen before the kids wake up, then it doesn't happen at all.) Sarah almost always brings along her dog, "Sparky." Sparky is very big and very curious. He has a tendency to run right up to strangers and explore them. I am not a dog expert and can't say whether Sparky is appropriately trained, but I know that this makes a lot of people very uncomfortable, and some even get quite upset (especially those out walking with their own dogs or small kids).

Sarah does not leash Sparky on these walks (as far as I know it is not required). I have been with her for multiple encounters that turn hostile because other people don't appreciate Sparky's friendliness. To strangers, Sarah and I are both responsible. One woman yelled at us about not leashing the dog. Sarah yelled back, and I didn't know what to do other than to stay quiet. I think Sarah was offended that I did not take her side.

What is my role here? I am not a dog person and honestly I agree with the people who don't care for being approached by a big dog that way. Sparky is used to me and doesn't invade my space anymore, but I would find the walks very unpleasant if he did. Since we're in the space of being close acquaintances but not necessarily deep friends, I am unsure of how to handle this. My husband is worried Sparky will attack someone and that I will get sued as a co-defendant!
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: This question is like one of those I Spy photo-riddles where you get to pick out all the hidden objects. Except in this case it's Sarah's horrible antisocial behaviors tucked into friendly neighbors' little morning dog walk.

1. Sparky is *not* appropriately trained, ugh.

2. Not leashing a dog on walks, especially a large spelunker and kid-rusher that upsets people to the point of anger on a regular basis, is so incredibly selfish. And irresponsible. Hello. I would be surprised if there were no leash laws -- I suggest you look it up if you feel like completing the I Spy -- but at this point no one with a clue would need a law to tell them the right thing to do.

3. Okay, you just "think" Sarah was offended you didn't back her, you don't know it. So I'll go light on that sign of entitled behavior.

4. But, wait -- no apology? She and her dog force you to witness a yelling match on your morning constitutional, and she doesn't think to say, "Yikes, sorry about that"?

Your role here is to figure out what your boundaries (limits) are, say them and hold them. So if you don't want to walk with Sarah anymore, then don't. If you don't want to deal with the entitlement-off-its-leash show, then don't. And if you want to be the person who signs up to writhe in discomfort through antisocial behavior while doing nothing about it, then keep doing what you're doing every day at 6.

How you phrase the second option is a challenge because the truth is uncomfortable. But, even if it's Sarah's dog, these walks still involve your time and your comfort, which matter. So: "I want to keep up our daily walks, I enjoy your company. But all the negative reactions to Sparky off-leash are stressing me out. Are you willing to leash him for our walks?" If she refuses, then you say you're sorry but you have to opt out. Not good for your nerves. If she gets defensive and turns on you, then -- well, I hope she doesn't, but it seems like it would be on brand.
For “my sister’s pain”
QUESTION: While I can be a skeptic when it comes to psychics, in my experience people don’t have “a creepy feeling” about their own parent unless there was a real problem. And of course two people can get such different versions of the same parent.

With that in mind I do think it’s okay to say that it’s too painful for you to discuss with her and point her to support groups and things. I don’t think I would ever tell her that you don’t believe her. You can just start from a place of believing that she is in pain and something was not right.

While my sibling and I both acknowledge the same abusers, even we don’t talk to each other about what we went through without checking first if the other one is open to discussing. And we both have said at different times that we can’t right now, and respected that. There was a brief period where we wanted to talk about it a lot to each other but that is less and less as time goes on. While that time period felt necessary it was also emotionally draining and difficult in a sense that I’m not even sure if I could explain.

I would tell your sister that you can support her in certain ways if that’s helpful (for example going on nature walks together) but that talking about it further is too hard on your mental health. You are not obligated to listen to anyone replay their trauma over and over and you can gently tell people that while you love them so much and you’re so sorry they were hurt, that you’re feeling overwhelmed and where your limit is.

QUESTION: About 15 years ago, I had that moment when I realized my parents were never going to be my Parents. They were never going to be people I could turn to, or who would just love me and want what's best for me. Facing that truth was so painful, and I had to go through a literal mourning period that lasted two years.

All of this to say that I don't think there is a short cut to what you are going through. You just have to mourn what is genuinely a horrible loss.

I am so sorry. You are obviously an amazing person for having offered the grace you have, and now for facing this very difficult path. You are worthy of love and support, and I promise so many other people will offer that to you.

Re: Credit card fraud and secrecy
QUESTION: As someone who is also conflict avoidant, this is a little bit of a weird suggestion. Have the husband write out what he needs to tell friend. Keep it short and sweet. Then husband takes that note and reads it to his friend. He can acknowledge that its weird but he has something important to tell friend that he has had trouble saying. I did this once with my doctor with some issues I was having. It helps to have the thoughts already organized and then just read them.
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: Not weird at all -- we talk about this one a lot around here. It may feel weird to use the cheat sheet in front of the friend, sure, but one work-around for that is to set the conversation in motion to the point the husband can't back out of it now -- either by a cheat-sheeted phone call (don't say that too fast) or a text. "Hey, if you have some time later, I'd like to ask you about something." (funky "ask" working in case friend tells wife about it)

Value of non-productive time
QUESTION: I'm not sure that I agree with how you answered this question. The 40 hour work week is also a construct; there is plenty that our personal lives and our communities require to thrive that will take place on some nights and weekends. What I think the writer is missing is that the problem is with how they see themselves in as "a person who can contribute". If they are in burnout, then they are not a person who can contribute. You need to find a way to think of your own well-being as being just as important to the equation as other people's.

They're a cautionary tale many of us have lived so others can learn.

Re: Second hand dog embarassment
QUESTION: I'll bet Sarah doesn't want to leash Sparky because she cannot handle him on a leash. I had a cocker spaniel that could pull my arm out of the socket when he decided to go after something while leashed. I knew a couple of women who were badly hurt when the big dogs they were handling bolted afteer something.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Um. That means no public mingling with the dog, ever. Dogs we can't control stay home and apart from the public. Full stop.

And a dog that's too big to manage on leash like that goes back to dog school or private work with a trainer. Or gets a pull-deterrent setup like a head halter -- plus the proper training, for dog and handler.

This is dog-owner malpractice. They are pets and awesome and wuzzy and our "fur babies" and all, but they are animals and can do harm if not responsibly handled. People who do not know what they're doing have a duty to learn it asap. It's for the dogs' sake as much as anyone else's.
Response to Carolyn asking where post is when we need it.
QUESTION: My mom used to get really upset at what she perceived as my half-assing. I'm 48 now, have a PhD and a thriving and influential career, and I still think there is very very little that's worthy of my applying my whole entire ass.

Being able to achieve maximum economy of ass is an important adult skill. God knows there's no shortage of women out there wearing themselves to nubs because they feel like they can't half-ass ANYTHING. It might help OP's husband to understand that what he perceives as a problem in high school could be a great advantage for the many many decades his daughter will spend out of high school.

I felt like I was just finding a new normal when my husband received a message from a 26yo young woman, Ellen, who was his daughter from a one-night stand when he was early in college. My husband had no idea. Ellen had been put up for adoption. Ellen is a great person. Her adoptive family kind and welcoming. My husband has developed a good relationship with Ellen. I've kept my distance. I'm happy for them but feel intense jealousy that my husband has a daughter and I do not. Ellen is now pregnant and asking if we want to be bonus grandparents. My husband is enthusiastic and I am not. Ellen says she is excited for her child to have so much love, so much family and I see that but I don't feel that. I know my jealousy and my anger is not healthy or normal. I fear I'm pushing my husband a way. I know I need therapy but I'm afraid the therapist will judge me.

living on a golf course
QUESTION: We recently purchased our last (we hope) home in a lovely, large gated community with an 18-hole golf course. We do not play. One of the fairways is directly behind us, with a handful of trees forming a barrier of sorts. There was some golf ball damage noted on the back of the house upon inspection, but it was minor and we proceeded with the purchase because the house checks every other box for us. Surprised and unhappy to learn, however, that any damage caused by a golf ball is NOT the responsibility of the golf course, nor of the player. It is strictly on the homeowner per the HOA! So when I should be enjoying our screened-in porch, sipping iced tea and watching the birds, instead I find myself shooting death stares at anyone whose golf cart makes a beeline toward our back yard to retrieve their balls, and some even rooting around in our yard. This is messing with my serenity and my sanity. When (not if) the damage happens, given that I have no legal right to pursue these folks, how do you suggest I approach them?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: As a homeowner who didn't do sufficient homework, and has no right to death-stare golfers as if that's their fault. I'm sorry.

When I read your subject line, my brain filled in the popcorn sound of golf balls hitting your house. It also brought back memories of a lot of years of organized baseball with my kids, with everyone's foul balls hitting the decks, siding, cars of neighbors whose properties abutted the schools and parks. At least the cars with Massachusetts policies, IIRC, got their windshields replaced with $0 deductible :)

I suggest you have a sit-down with your reality, serenity, sanity, available funds and on-call contractor list, and decide which you prefer: to accept the inevitable, or move one more time to your really-this-is-the-last-one last house.

Because sitting out there in your yard thinking you should be having a golfball-free experience next to a golf course is a recipe for daily fury and stress.

Follow Up From Step Mother
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,
I wrote to you about my husband's support agreement with his ex that makes us pay $15,000 per year for extracurricular activities. We had to see a lawyer because we went past paycheck to paycheck, we were increasing credit card debt every month. The lawyer said we shouldn't worry about the college expenses clause because If my step-son picks a private college we can probably win at court to pay 1/3 of in-state rates because that is how most of these agreements are written. He said the proportion of our income to step-son's expense was high so we could meet with my husband's ex to cap expenses a bit lower. Even an extra $5,000 per year to us would make a big difference. His ex refused to meet with us, she would only discuss this in court in front of a judge. The next court date was in 9 months, the lawyer charges more for time in court, and there is no guarantee anything would change. We made two changes on our own. I picked up a side gig to bring in more money. I get out of going with every weekend to the tournaments because I am working. I will drive to and from practice when I'm able, I will go to home games and watch him. I don't like the whole weekend tournaments. If this was once or twice a year, I could go, but it is at least 2 weekends out of the month. The other thing is that my husband made an agreement with his ex that he would pay his half by paying the bill directly. Before he was Venmoing her 50% of the bill she screenshotted. We are putting all our credit card expenses on his credit and he will file for bankruptcy when our step-son is out of high school.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Oh yes this is definitely different stakes, racking up debt -- I'm sorry. Has your husband approached the coach/program? There may be a discreet way to get relief that way. Definitely depends on the quality of the program and the people involved.

In the best sense and in the worst: I'm loath to say this, because I don't want even to imply that if you aren't successful, it will be due to your stepson's shortcomings as an athlete. But the corruption of US youth sports is what it is ... and a lot of game-changing players with money issues happen to find they have secret Santas.

But there are also solid orgs that make sure any player's family, starter or bench, has adequate financial support and a quiet avenue to secure it. Including one that takes separated/divorced parents into account. [Read the original column here.]
Social Media Etiquette
QUESTION: Are there rules to this? I belong to an online forum of a few hundred users, and have ignored/blocked some others and there's a big kerfuffle going on about how blocking is rude, but is it?

The biggest griper just writes rambling tl;dr screeds too often, I don't even disagree or dislike her it's just too much. Anyway, tl;dr is blocking rude?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I think there's a Golden Rule, don't bring behaviors to a forum that make everyone instantly tired.

If there are rulebook rules. then the ones being broken here are, in order of importance, no rambling screeds; no public griping about other people's screed appreciation habits; no conflating of "block" and "ignore."

"Ignore" is for people you generally like but are wearing you out. "Block" is the dead-to-me button to enough people that it's best reserved for that.

I agree with you on the principle, though -- that no kerfuffle was ever necessary and the fact of one makes the case that it's entirely on the person griping. If I take this forum correctly, then your posts are all basically the publishing arms of your selves, so if one of you wants to pause your subscriptions to some members for whatever reason, then so be it. Nothing personal.

Wait -- did I kerfuffle by answering this? Did you by asking?
opting out of college
QUESTION: My just-graduated son and my one-year behind daughter have said they are not attending traditional college. My son was never academically inclined, so choosing trade school (plumbing) is disappointing but not a shock, But my daughter is a star student, They both believe that AI will soon eliminate entry level college graduate jobs unless physical presence is part of the job. My daughter does not want to teach or gp into anything medical, so her plan is to enter a car mechanic program where she can make use of her computer and technical ability. I'm not sure what I should do - I'm hoping to convince her to apply to college in the fall to keep her options open, But I'm also not sure that she's wrong. And advice?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whoa wait a minute. Why is your "never academically inclined" son's decison to choose trade school for plumbing "disappointing"?

I know it's not your question, but I tripped over it so hard that I think it's germane to your question. To me your son's decision looks like an unqualified win. Practical, smart, suits him -- right? So if you have a bias that prevents you from seeing that, then you'll want to take that into account and dismantle it before you make any decisions about your approach to your daughter. Certainly before you say anything to her.

And that's even before you deal with the obvious flaw in speaking up now: that you admit openly that you don't even know enough to make a reasoned counterargument.

Your kids are right that many sectors of the job landscape look like an animated Dali painting. (Then there's the economy, depending on its given day in court, holy cats.) But then, is she right about cars? You will have to do some basic temperature-taking before you presume to "convince" anyone of anything.

More important, though, I suggest you draw your daughter out on the idea of: her interests, her idea of what she wants her life to look like (i.e., what is work for, on the "enough money to live" vs "purpose" scale), where she might want to be, whether she sees herself as doing one thing over a lifetime in various stages or multiple different things across a lifetime, maybe even completely different things.

If you can get your single KOLLEGE idea out of the way of your ear passages, this could be a fascinating series of talks. (Listens, really.)

Great for your son too IF he's not already set with his choice and IF broaching the topic wouldn't come across as disappointment in his choice. If there's any risk of that, then leave it be. It really does sound like something you want to back 100 percent with 100 percent sincerity.
RE: Golf Course
QUESTION: There are some other possible options: more plants, a fence, some sort of net that won’t let the balls into OP’s yard. It sounds like this is all dependent on the HOA’s rules, but I’ll bet there are ways to mitigate this that don’t involve moving. This might be a good way to connect with the neighbors: “I was wondering how you handle golfers wandering into your yard?”

For "disappointed" parent of would-be plumber
QUESTION: I want to second Carolyn's getting hung up on the "disappointed" part of opting for a trade. Speaking as the daughter of someone who was a (smart, gifted) guy in the trades, who also kinda bought into the notion that he was less-than because of it, I want to say loud and clear that trades require smart and capable people. PLUS- we NEED people in the trades. Your kids would likely be employable for life, quite comfortably. On more of a personal level, if you let it be known that you're disappointed by your son's choice, you will undermine his success by planting the seed in his mind that he's less-than, too. It will not go well for any of you, long-term.

I say this as someone who is very academically inclined and thrived in college and grad school-- if I had any kind of technical or manual skills, I would have focused on that. I certainly would have made more money faster. Also, not for nothing... college can wait. We do our kids a disservice by expecting them to go straight from high school to college when they're not ready or it doesn't make sense.

IMPORTANT re: why are people so secretive about cancer
QUESTION: Can you continue this important discussion from the 5/16 chat about why people may not go public with the ir serious illness? As a cancer survivor, I’d like to add to the response to the person who was having a hard time understanding why people are still so “secretive” about cancer. The people, who made me feel loved and supported during my cancer treatment, understood that I was protecting myself by not making my diagnosis common knowledge. It isn’t secrecy and hiding; it’s privacy and boundaries. When you have cancer, sometimes it seems like you are being asked to provide support to other people who make your cancer diagnosis all about themselves and what they want and how they think things “should” be handled. People can treat you differently once they know. Some people have lost their job when word gets out. Also, google “cancer ghosting”. It shouldn’t happen, but sadly it happens to many people and even family members may ghost a cancer patient. Poor reactions and comments are much harder to take when you already feel so incredibly ill from treatment, and you have no emotional reserve for dealing with extra things like you do when healthy. You may not be able to see from the outside all the consequences for someone else in not granting privacy that they’ve specifically requested around their diagnosis. When I got cancer, I followed the lead of a dear friend who decided not to tell many about her cancer recurrence and terminal illness because of the upsetting things people did the first time around. Even though I shared only with my inner trusted circle, I still had some hurtful reactions after confiding, like being called “secretive” to my face by a friend. She made me feel judged, disrespected, and unsupported during a terrible time in my life. More power to people who want to let everyone know. That's great if it’s what the person with cancer chooses. But, love for you can be present even when someone didn’t confide. Don’t wait for illness to tell people that you care for and love them. I’m not advocating AT ALL for withholding a diagnosis from one’s inner-most circle and yes, those in the inner circle may need a trusted outlet too. But, it’s sad when people are not respectful about others’ privacy and their carefully thought out life choices. I am almost 2 years cancer free and hope to help cultivate more understanding toward
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Thank you for bringing this back up. Going through the outtakes was really frustrating that day, because the queue was filled with "privacy isn't secrecy" assertions -- which of course is true. People put so much work and feeling into their accounts of maintaining their privacy during an awful time in their lives -- but I was the one asking, and I was asking about secrecy. To use your words, "withholding a diagnosis from one’s innermost circle." As you may recall, this thread started because the spouse of the OP insisted on withholding his cancer news from everyone but OP. Which is more than privacy.

So I got to see it from the OP’s side and have heard from others in that position, who were sworn to secrecy. I have heard from many who did not know of a loved one’s cancer until they got news of their death. But it’s rare to hear from the people insisting on this choice. That's why I asked.

The scant response I have gotten is that people wanted to be treated as themselves, not as Sick. I do sympathize. (I would still urge allowing some support outlet for the lone person who knows, assuming there is one. There typically is, given the necessities of care.) I would still like to hear a response to my question.

So, to reiterate, I understand the decision to maintain privacy. People's repetitive, rude, nosy, me-centric, unsolicited Ring Theory violations are known to anyone here regularly, since, "How do I stop people from pushing their judgments/feelings/treatment advice on me," is a chat staple.

Also, no question, this is the ailing person's decision. Even if it's not one I'd want my loved one to make. I am not looking to argue otherwise.

I am sorry you got a big dose of people's stupid when you were in treatment -- but yay to the almost two years.

Thank you again for the invitation to come back to this. It also allows me to mention The Post’s recent reporting on the spike in cancer in young people . Tl;dr: Get checked when you feel weird, and don’t take “you’re too young” for an answer.
What do you do when you can’t do anything?
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn:

I know you’ve written about things to do when everything gets overwhelming, but what do you do when you can’t do anything?

I’ve written and called my representative and senators and attended their town halls and gotten zero response (other than fundraising requests) — not even acknowledgement of receipt.

We are beyond broke right now, so I send what I can, but it’s not much, and it can never compete with the monied forces arrayed against truth, decency, and the American Way.

My partner and I still, for now, knock on wood, have jobs that others have lost, but especially with our financial situation being as precarious as it is, I can’t risk those by protesting.

Things just keep getting more and more terrible. I am trying to keep my head above water, and although I don’t feel like the vicious and cruel will necessarily win at the end, the cost of preventing them from doing so is already high, and will only climb higher. I don’t feel hopeless, but I do feel helpless.

What can I do? I engage in hobbies to the extent that our budget will allow me. We are all in therapy, although that is another blow to the budget (and to all the therapists out there who can and are willing to work on a sliding scale — bless you!). My friends and family either are in the same or a worse boat or, worse to me, think things are either fine or good.

It’s like being sealed in a small box that is getting smaller. I will survive it, but it’s going to leave me permanently misshapen.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I am going to disagree with you, but sympathize 100 percent first. Yes it is hard to get through the contempt for the Constitution and all that entails.

Where i disagree is with the "can’t do anything." Just because there has been no response to what you have done so far (written and called representative and senators and attended town halls) doesn't mean it was or is futile and it doesn't mean you stop. It just means it's not a one-bucket fire.

Or, different metaphor, one I think I borrowed earlier -- Notre Dame? The people who labored their whole lives on that cathedral did so knowing they would never see it to completion. It took almost two centuries to build. So, you do your part, of whatever size, because it matters to the whole -- that is the point. Any results you are able to see are a bonus.

Take care. I am also going to post an amazing thing by Stephen Colbert (Anderson Cooper interview) to address your "permanently misshapen" observation. If I can find it quickly enough. I'm already taking forever.
See, I went and took way too long looking for it anyway. Here is the transcript because the videos I found were all edited. Mind you, I am a nonbeliever posting and embracing this. I don't think "gifts" need to come from a spiritual entity, nor do I think differences in or quesitons about belief in God detract from the beauty or utility of the message. To me it's a powerful framework for living with purpose amid loss and pain, which are inevitable:

"Anderson Cooper
00:02:40
"You told an interviewer that you have learned to, in your words, love the thing that I most wish had not happened. You went on to say, What punishments of God are not gifts? Do you really believe that?

"Stephen Colbert
00:02:53
"Yes. It's a gift to exist. And with existence comes suffering. There's no escaping that. But if you are grateful for your life. Then you have to be grateful for all of it. And so, at a young age. I suffered something so that by the time I was in serious relationships in my life with friends or with my wife or with my children, is that I have some understanding that everybody is suffering and however imperfectly, acknowledge their suffering and connect with them and to love them in a deep way that makes you grateful for the fact that you have suffered so that you can know that about other people. I want to be the most human I can be, and that involves acknowledging and ultimately being grateful for the things that I wish didn't happen because they gave me a gift."

College vs trade
QUESTION: I realize I have a stake in this discussion as a uni professor but can I represent a different view? It saddens me for college to get treated as working papers. In its ideal form, it's a chance -- in total distinction to the vast majority of high schools-- to develop real critical thinking skills, to learn how to learn, to follow curiosity and to grow as thinking people. Everyone should have that chance. And, sorry, but an educated citizenry is something we all have an interest in sustaining. That's why financial aid and the GI Bill and state schools and all that are important. Learning for its own sake isn't elites, I don't accept that.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yes, agreed. But stop with the "sorry"!

I do hate how this has all gotten muddled. When I was in wee school, the trades were falling out of favor -- "voke" -- for "Everyone should have that chance." It should never have been either-or, of course, that was the mistake. Stop applying "favor." But the idea was right to broaden access. Then people noticed the emphasis on college was skewed too heavily on college, and there were a bunch of students there just because they were expected to be, and lo not enough people were entering the trades. Add to that, US has its "Greed is good" 1980s and never looks back, and suddenly it's all comp sci, business degrees and ROI. Ugh.

I get it, it's a lot of time and money and people want to know what they're getting, but it does seem like two basics keep getting swamped: 1. In grade school, give kids options based on their strengths and interests, not their socioeconomic status or educational fashion; 2. In college, think broadening of experience and critical thinking skills first, not career.

Fair?
Re: root canal
QUESTION: Last year I told Carolyn that I needed to a therapist but was paralyzed, much like you were, because I didn't know what to say. She responded with a two-sentence message to send - I think it was essentially "I am looking for a therapist." Nothing else. I copied & pasted into their contact form, they emailed back almost immediately with questions to help find the right fit, and everything fell into place. I've been going for a year and am in a MUCH healthier place. Seconding the other commenters who said to just call and say "I need an appointment." Let the professionals on the other end of the line pick it up from there.

If you haven't called because you're afraid of the procedure, or you feel like you've waited too long -- I've also told medical professionals flat-out when I'm nervous or embarrassed or scared, and I have always found them to be incredibly reassuring and non-judgmental when I do.

Commenting on privacy vs secrecy
QUESTION: I had cancer twice in less than 5 years, forms that were curable by surgery but that could still come back. Now when I hear of people that have a cancer scare I always suggest maintaining privacy (bordering on secrecy). The first time I had cancer, I was open about it. People (eg, mother and several sisters) asked me how I was doing. A LOT. And long after things were resolved. Talking about it was painful, reminding of the bad times and the outcome, that I could not bear a child due to the required hysterectomy. Reminders come up often (eg, at doctor’s visits, or even sometimes at the pharmacy) anyway. Minimizing information sharing (and thus questions/reminders) is better. The second time I had cancer I was private. Even secret. It was better.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: This makes complete sense to me, thank you.
For what to do
QUESTION: The other thing I’d suggest is to read, not only about the present, but about the past. One of my favorite movie lines is from Shadowlands - “we read to know we are not alone.” Or, as James Baldwin explained it: “You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive.” All of which is to say, you’re not alone here now, even as you’re not alone in the sweep of human history. Don’t underestimate your own resilience, or the resilience if all those that stand with you now - and take heart from the example of all those who stood where you stood , where we stood, in the past.

Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: I have said my "should" explicitly in this context: The person or people being asked to keep a strict secret often need someone to talk to themselves. In the case that started the thread, one spouse was diagnosed and asked the other, caregiving spouse not to tell anyone else beyond their family. That meant the caregiver (stressed) was having to fib to friends, certainly by omission, and it was becoming weird (stressful).

Bike helmet
QUESTION: My 22 year old is home for the summer and bikes to work, sometimes in the dark. I learned he doesn't wear a helmet. If he weren't living at home I would be unaware of this unsafe activity, but he is living at home and I am aware. After taking 24 hours to calm down and think, I want to tell him wearing a helmet is a condition of living here. Yes, he has a helmet and it fits. It doesn't work when he keeps it in his backpack. In your level-headed, learned opinion, is this reasonable? Or over the top?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Do you intend to throw him out if he doesn't wear it? Monitor him for compliance?

I make no claims to level-headedness or learnedness, but all my threats have to clear the mean-it bar.

So you might want to ask him to describe for you what it looks like, generally, when the fates collect on bad helmet decisions. So you can be sure he's aware. It'll resonate a lot more when he has to form the words and mental images himself.

(Apologies to anyone who has been affected. It's awful.)
Cancer secrecy
QUESTION: Whew is this a raw topic. I just had a very close loved one pass - I was her health care POA- and didn't know they had cancer till I got a call saying life support had been pulled, asking if I wanted to say goodbye.

The amount of people who showed right after just devastated and feeling betrayed was earth shattering. They had told any who knew - a boss, neighbors- a few different stories. They were so loved, and people were hurt. I could only do a few disclosures a day. Would let them have a moment and try to gently explain that I hadn't known myself.

So while I completely do respect that it is the best wishes of the person with the ailment and their autonomy... it is truly hard for those loved ones. Would try to aim for a middle ground. Ring theory, privacy, boundaries.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Thanks for this perspective, and I am so sorry.

I hope the takeaway for all is to be extremely respectful of someone who lets you know of their illness. When you find out -- from them directly or from a third party -- ask, "How do you/does X want me to handle this?"
Plan A, Plan B
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,

My husband is 39 and I'm 36, and we have been married for two years. We are both in total agreement that we want children, but we have been in active disagreement about the timing since our wedding day. My husband has an older sister who went through a divorce in her 30s, remarried an amazing guy at 40, and naturally had two children in her early forties. Breezy pregnancies and everything. This is my husband's gold standard for what's possible, and he has decided that all the fertility/age fearmongering that goes on is just conservative propaganda. I do think there is plenty of propaganda around this topic, but I am 100% sure that trying to get pregnant in one's forties is NOT anyone's Plan A, though it might be a solid Plan B. So how do I get us on the same page about this—do I drag him into my gyno appointments? (Not ideal!)
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: So that's it, that's what he's going with -- it's possible because his sister did it? And anything else is "conservative propaganda."

Dude needs to read. Or, ah, listen to his wife?

I don't know what to tell you, but you've described a degree of resistance to information that is not promising.

If he is willing to consider a source that is neither his sister nor conservative propaganda, and doesn't involve his attendance at your GYN appointments, then I'll be happy to tell him that fertility windows vary from woman to woman -- which means some women struggle to get pregnant after age 30 or 35, some have babies over 50, and some can't conceive at any age. So if he wants you to conceive his child without medical intervention, then now's the actual best time to start trying.

And if he simply does not want you to get pregnant right now, then that is something he needs to own, knowing "not now" might well mean "not ever" -- and not deflect by saying "eh we shall do this no-worries-like when you're down to your last egg."

Also? Pregnancy punishes a body, more so as a woman ages, though not equally each prenancy and each woman. Some get through with relatively little effect and some get walloped and it's not entirely up to them. But, if you are reading, my good dude -- put an 8-ish pound roast in there, then rip it out, then lmk.

(Sorry again, everyone.)

There are so many uncertainties that come with trying for and, hopefully, having kids, that his continued use of his sister as the gold standard (for kids? marriage? life?) is not going to align with you and, potentially, reality.

So now she wants to be friends?
QUESTION: Years and years ago, my friend Evie called and said that her long-term boyfriend had just broken up with her and moved out. She was distraught. I told her I'd put the kids to bed and be right over. I didn't make it over there for 36hrs because my husband had a freak accident that ended up in the ER and the next 24hrs were touch and go - there was a chance I'd be raising my kids solo. Half-way through the ordeal, I called and left a message explaining what had happened. A day and a half later, once I was home and kids settled, I called her and she said she saw no reason for us to be friends. I had failed her. We had been close friends for over a decade. I was sad to lose the friendship but I had just been through hell - I didn't intentionally fail her! We are now in our early 60's. Her daughter found me on social media and sent me a message that her mom's health isn't great and she'd like if it I stopped by. The daughter says that her mom wants to see me but won't reach out herself because she is too ashamed. I don't know what to do with this information. If Evie really wanted to see me, wouldn't she reach out directly? And if Evie is so ashamed that she can't reach out herself, then how is it going to go sitting face to face? I am a kind person. If seeing me will help Evie in some way, I'll go but I don't want to be in a position where she expects me to apologize. Am I thinking about this all wrong?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: For someone to have been as wrong and stupid as Evie was years ago doesn't come out of nowhere. You knew the context from the decade of close friendship, so I'm guessing you weren't completely blindsided when she did that to you?

So, it makes total sense to me at least that that Evie would be ashamed for years over her own behavior, and would not be able to reach out to you herself, even on her deathbed (if that in fact is her health situation). That seems to be the level of stuntedness Evie demonstrated all those years ago.

What you do with this info is up to you. I'm just saying, Evie was showily dysfunctional then and apparently isn't a whole lot more functional now. If you want to see her, then see her, but I'm not sure it's productive to think of Evie as having ulterior motives. You're in the position of strength, if you want to look at it that way -- if for no other reason than your ability to deal with people directly as a matter of course.

1104
Am I entitled?
QUESTION: I'm pretty sure my mom would have chosen to be child-free, if that concept existed in the 1970s when she had me. Instead, as a school teacher, she faced a lot of social and professional pressure to be a mom herself. Now that I am the ages she was when she raised me, I understand my childhood a lot better. She hated every part of raising me. She gave up a lot of personal freedom, financial security, and much-needed introvert time (another concept that didn't exist back then) to raise me, and as someone who became child-free myself (no surprise why), I actually get it and feel a lot of sympathy for her.

I already temper so many of my emotional expectations of her because of her circumstances. She doesn't tell me she loves me, she doesn't express any sort of parental pride, she doesn't talk nostalgically about our departed family members or family memories, she doesn't have any photos on display at home, etc.

My husband and I buy her birthday and Christmas presents, pay for brunch on Mother's Day, invite her over for weekly dinners and a movie, help her with her taxes and repairs around her house, but she doesn't reciprocate any of this. She doesn't even call me on my birthday, though I usually call her that week and she works a Happy Birthday in then.

But there was one thing she was doing for us that mattered a lot to us: she would watch our pets while we went out of town on vacation or to visit my husband's family, about four times per year. Now she is refusing to help anymore, because she says it's too disruptive to her life. It's not a matter of age - she's in extraordinary health. I think at its core she thinks our trips out of town are frivolous, and our pets don't bring her any personal pleasure so she can't see the point in doing it anymore. I've offered countless compromises to see if she'd keep helping us, all of which directly addressed her descriptions of the inconvenience it was causing, but she just wants to stop outright.

We can totally afford to board our animals. That's definitely what we'll do now. But this was the ONE THING she was doing that seemed....generous? Caring? Above and beyond what acquaintances do for each other? I have to be honest - I am devastated by this. I already let her off the hook for so many things. I want to pull away, stop the presents and dinners, and just give up on calling this a mother-daughter relationship entirely. Am I wrong to make this the final straw?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: If you're going to frame it that way, then, yes. Because, as written, you've created the impression that this isn't so much a dialogue with your mother as a monologue where you're performing your part and your mom's. And so you're kind of getting mad at yourself and leaving.

But please let me answer a bigger question? I think giving up on "calling this a mother-daughter relationship entirely" is a great idea for both of you, dead on, so don't limit its tone and emotional possibilities with a connection to the petsitting.

I hope you see what I mean -- I feel like I'm not explaining it well.

If you say, "You stopped petsitting for us, so I'm punitively withdrawing the last few gestures that acknowledge you as my mother," then it's a tit-for-tat door-slam. I think the emotional complexity of this situation and the incredible generosity you have shown your mother deserve better. I think you and your mom both deserve better than pinning this to an artificially adopted symbol.

Free yourself of the societal-role expectations just because. Because they're merely smaller versions of what entrapped your mom in the 1970s, because they're no less arbitrary, because they're not working for either of you. (Well, maybe your mom likes the tax help and movie night, I shouldn't assume. But her big stand against petsitting looks like her way of saying she wants out of these rituals, too.)

The way I'm thinking about it, all the stuff you do for your mom gets another look, this time from forest perspective vs. tree. Do you buy her holiday gifts and do the Mother's Day dance, etc., because she wants and expects it, or have you been doing what you think you're supposed to? Or doing what you think you need, to tend to the injury of your childhood circumstances?

You make no mention of therapy, so I'll do it. You're dealing with a lot here. You've let more of it go, forgiven more, than I'm guessing most people would have been able to in your position, so I hope you don't take any of this as criticism. Anything I suggest is to help you along on the process you started.

I liken "temper so many of my emotional expectations" to anger. It's laudable progress for people to be able to feel their anger come on and then choose not to act on it. But it's a whole other step to heal the source of the anger so they simply get angry less often. Your next step is past tempering, and releasing yourself and your mom of mom-expectations entirely.

Then? You decide.

QUESTION: I am a volunteer in a public venue, in several departments, which sometimes includes leading a tour.

Chatting later at a venue event:
She: I heard your voice, but wondered what you were up to since you weren't at Venue

It is okay, though, to "redirect" more forcefully. Once you've hit the "good Lord drop it already" point: "If you're trying to say something, please say it." Or, "Your point being?" Or one-worders in the indeed, noted, thanks family, all of which cork the bottle effectively.
The kids always come first, right?
QUESTION: We’ve been together 5 years and I moved in last summer. He has 2 kids from a previous marriage and we have them 3 weekends a month. On a typical weekend he makes plans for the 3 of them that don’t include me but we will usually have a meal or watch a movie together at some point. I do my own thing or make plans with friends. I have invited them to join me many times but the kids usually aren’t interested in what I’m doing even when it’s kid friendly (e.g. theme parks) or my boyfriend doesn’t want to change their plans.
Once or twice a year I ask him to switch weekends with his ex so he can attend certain events with me. Otherwise, I do most things without him because he’s with the kids. Recently, I asked him in Feb if he’d switch for an event in May and he agreed, happily even. I reminded him every few weeks to talk to his ex about the switch. When the time came he’d never talked to her and said he’d go with me “if” he didn’t have the kids. He made the arrangements only because I got upset (not the first time something like this has happened) despite my telling him not to at that point. As we drove by his ex’s neighborhood on the way to the event he said, “That's where my kids are.” Clearly he just wanted to be with them.
He genuinely seems to want to include me in the bigger things but once there, I’m all but ignored. On a yearly trip with his family I decided to include myself by joining him and the kids in the pool. I tried joining in and asked if they wanted to play any pool games, etc. and was flat out ignored. When we got home I told him how hurt I was by that and he had no idea I’d even gotten in the pool. His brother and SIL paid more attention to me on that trip than he did. We also go on a yearly trip with my family and he decided not to bring the kids this year. He said, “I’ll spend time with you this year since my kids won’t be there.”
We’ve been doing date night once a week and we have our one weekend a month. I guess that’s enough for him but we could have continued that without me moving in. Maybe I kind of thought moving in would automatically make us a family but the 3 of them are still in their bubble. I know it must be hard not to see your kids every day and I’m sympathetic to that. But I’m not asking him to spend less time with them, I just want to be included more. Is this just how it is when one partner has kids? Am I asking too much?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: "Is this just how it is when one partner has kids?" There's no universal "how it is." This is how it is in *your* relationship. That is what matters, and whether you're okay with it.

You're clearly not, so it's time to accept that and decide your next move.

The next move includes your stating to him clearly, "I just want to be included more," because you apparently "kind of thought" it would happen "automatically," which I do not recommend.

I almost didn't bother recommending this step because it seems like you're saying it many different ways, especially by inviting everyone to join you, but that's the thing -- not saying it explicitly leaves all kinds of room for misunderstanding. He may actually think you want to do your own thing, and that you were only hurt that one time because he ignored you, not because you were left out of the bubble. You need to be clear, clear, clear about what you want.

Because that's the only way to find out whether he's willing to do the work to include you. Of course the kids will do their own thing around you, if that's what they're used to. He is going to have to incorporate you now, gradually and thoughtfully, to let the kids get to know you and get comfortable.

That is, assuming he wants you involved. If he likes it this way because it's easier for him, then you have a decision to make whether that's acceptable to you.

Again -- you have to communicate what you want so you can get to this point where you can see whether getting it is or isn't possible. It can't be asking too much if you haven't expressly asked.

You can, of course, read the whole situation as-is and decide you've seen enough; you're being ignored to a degree I wouldn't encourage anyone to rationalize. But you also seem like two people who don't communicate, so this is a chance for you, at least, to work on that.

Re: Am I entitled?
QUESTION: I think you’ve been holding on to the pet sitting as proof that your mom loves you, in the absence of other proof. I understand why it’s so hard to have that taken away, and I know it’s not about the pet sitting. It sucks that you have to deal with a Mother who can’t express affection. Counseling helped me draw boundaries in my relationship with my own mother.
For am I entitled -
QUESTION: I’d underline, too, that in addition to releasing you and your mother from “mom-expectations,”as Carolyn puts it, you can, with this process, also release yourself from your *own* “daughter-expectations,” as Carolyn also suggests when she asks why you have been keeping up with Mother’s Day and other holiday traditions. Yes, your mother may have been imprisoned, in a way, by the weight of societal or even internal expectations of what a “good” mother is or should be, but you may have constructed your own cage, based on internal or societal expectations of what a “good” daughter is or should be. Your mother’s refusal to pet-sit may just be the impetus for you, at least, to open the cage doors wide and see what freedom might feel like.

re: Evie
QUESTION: People who are deeply ashamed of themselves are often far more able to deal with something once it is passed the point of no return in dealing with it. In other words, once you are there, in her presence, in her "face" so to speak, it is a very different set of circumstances and calculus than the one which involves actively reaching out to stir a pot that hasn't been stirred in decades.

But also think about it from this standpoint: What's the worst that happens if you don't go? What's the worst that happens if you do? Which one are you more comfortable living with?
path forward?
QUESTION: I have a very close friend of many decades. We met one another even before we met and married our spouses. Once we married and had families, we would occasionally spend time with each others families. Everyone liked one another but the primary relationship was still between friend and I. Awhile back, friend and spouse began having marital difficulties. Friend confided in me a lot and mostly I was there to listen and support. Friend's spouse reached out to me during this period to ask me to get involved in fixing the marriage. I politely declined to do so. It didn't seem like a wise move (I'm certainly not qualified as a therapist.) I said I didn't want to get involved but left the conversation with no hard feelings. I subsequently learned through friend that spouse no longer wants to associate with me as I abandoned them in their time of need. I reached out to friends' spouse suggesting that we clear the air and gotten the cold shoulder. Help me understand what happened here. Was I wrong?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: No, you made a principled choice.

It's certainly Spouse's prerogative to take it badly and torch the relationship over it, but that only underscores the wisdom of your decision not to get involved. Yikes.

I hope Spouse's emotional immaturity (or, I could say, friend's poor taste in spouses) doesn't cost you your friend, but there isn't much you can do except settle in on the high ground you staked out. The moment to do so has passed, but if the word "abandoned" ever comes up again, you can assert that your support is unflagging -- you simply draw the line at involvement in anyone's marriage but your own.

We shared bean soup (saying this just in case she sees this), stroller walks, & many years of life changes, until one day she announced that she was sick of being my friend. Absolutely out of the blue; just the week before she had been talking about how much fun we always had together. I was so concerned about the possibility of a serious mental health issue that I called a friend of hers. I never heard from her (or the friend) again.

A former Evie
QUESTION: I used to avoid people like the plague when I made a mistake - especially a big one. I grew up in a house of both emotional neglect and perfectionism. This meant, if I made any kind of mistake, especially a big one, I could not emotionally handle what I did, and I couldn't face hearing a high level of disdain for another person.

While I've done a lot of work on myself over the years and I am MUCH better since I have the tools to manage these situations, there are some situations that I'm not proud of - people have every right to have a negative view of me due to past actions.

As a former Evie, I'll say this: She was in the wrong 100%. She should have reached out to you earlier to apologize. Much earlier. There are so many reasons she may not have that don't have anything to do with you. I wish that during those times, I had the hard conversation with the other person, even if I was scared to have it. I could have salvaged a few of those connections.

With that being said, you also don't owe her anything. If you think that you will benefit from seeing her in some way, then go for it. If it all feels like a big disruption, you can send a note wishing her well, or respond to the daughter saying that you will not be able to see her. People don't have their epiphanies on their deathbed, they talk about them more since the opportunity for long-term consequences are done.
Setting boundaries
QUESTION: Hi! I was diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year and am still undergoing treatment. FYI if you have dense breast tissue that mammograms can’t see through ask your doctor if you qualify for extra screening methods! It might save you from having a much bigger problem (like me). Okay, so it’s been a roller coaster for months and I kept my circle small. Just my family and close friends but in the process I came to the realization that my MIL isn’t in “my corner” and never will be. After 26 years of relationship that has been at times really challenging and hurtful (went to therapy for it 15 years ago), I really feel so much better with essentially keeping her away from me. Cancer helped me set boundaries with her. My question, and I’m embarrassed I still don’t know how to do it, how can I keep a friendly but somewhat distanced space from her? I am a people pleaser so this is really hard. She keeps trying to connect - she misses my attention.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I am so sorry you are going through this, a really taxing experience without the emotional weight of a difficult relationship. There is absolutely no need to throw embarrassment on the pile. Managing a difficult relationship is not a one-size-fits-all thing we are all supposed to know how to do by x time or y age.

Anyway. Your spouse really needs to step in here and tell your MIL that you are taking more time to rest/for yourself, or you are communicating less, or however you two decide to phrase it, and so your spouse is to be her primary contact hereafter. Period. And your spouse eats the fallout for this. Period.

That is the path to the distanced space while you undergo treatment and heal.

If you and/or spouse are unwilling to take a step this drastic, then I am going to be a noodge and ask you to think about that for a bit. Because you deserve and need this space and support. So who is not giving it to you and why? Who is treating your needs as less important than hers?

If that is too big to take on right now, then, fair. I will back off. And suggest this:

Pick a form or topic of communication with her that is easy, and live there. Errands, recipes, your spouse, a TV show, a team, books, her garden/dog/job -- by text only, or one call a week, or one narrowly defined help request per week, etc. Set it and forget it.

I know this is emotional work just to figure out, which is why it is my second option. But once it's in place, it can be magic for containment.

Take care.

Ditched
QUESTION: I'm spending a month in Paris. I should be spending it with someone I loved, but two months before the trip, he ditched me. Can I get a "better then, than while on the trip" please? Memories of things we were supposed to be doing together are killing the mood.
Carolyn Hax

QUESTION: Sibling and I just past the 2nd anniversary of our mom’s death, and are quickly approaching the two year mark on the incredibly difficult job of clearing out and selling her house. Sibling and I have had an up and down relationship over the past 30 or so years.
My relationship with mom was strong when her relationship with sibling was tenuous, but became fraught as she pulled closer to sibling after the first grandkid was born. In recent years she almost seemed to try and pick fights with me when we’d see each other and criticized many things about how I parent my own kids.

The classic saying -- if you don't like New England weather, wait a few minutes -- works pretty well for grief like you describe, especially when you're digging through box after box of memory triggers. Try just letting it all roll by. See if that helps.

Friend going through a split
QUESTION: A close friend is going through a divorce, and has taken a dive into a new relationship before even moving out of the house and legal proceedings haven't started yet. They say they are in love, but I am struggling with watching this. I think the move to start the relationship so soon is a) not fair to their spouse, and b) ripe with risk for going supremely badly since it's such a tender time. They've asked my opinion about everything else split-related except for this. Do I say anything? It has nothing to do with me except for concerns about their judgement and a dread that I'll be asked to support them through another messy split at some point. But again, no one has asked me for my thoughts. We rarely keep things from one another.

Feeling like MIL’s servant
QUESTION: No crisis here, just a repeated effort to talk myself down from resentment I’m not sure is justified, and you have such a way of bringing insight when people feel stuck. 2.5 years ago after my FIL passed we moved 80’s non-driving MIL into independent living about 20 minutes away, and since my husband still works full time while I volunteer part time now, it made sense that I take her to her appointments and bring her supplies. The thing is, I’m from a southern-ish area and am used to a certain kind of considerate treatment from friends etc, and my husband is also quite considerate. However, she’s NYC born and isn’t mean, just rarely thinks to say things like please and thank you, and is the only person in my life that would ever just tell me what to do vs asking. I just feel disrespected, especially when she’s anxious and it comes out in talking to me in a way I would never tolerate from anyone else. But I don’t think it’s anything she is even aware of, and I’m rather conflict averse. Is the problem me, and I should learn to be less sensitive and more compassionate? Or is there any way to address the dynamic that won’t likely do more harm than good?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Thanks for the kind words.

I'm sorry, too, that you're the designated driver for exactly what torments you in a person. Very "No Exit," if you're up for a little Sartre.

But you have gone 99 percent of the way to solving your own problem, so I hope you will take me up on the easier suggestion to push the last 1 percent. You are not being "disrespected," any more than you would be if your MIL spoke English as a second language and used an insulting word inadvertently as a consequence.

The formula for disrespect includes intent. From your description, your MIL is not only deeply imprinted in her mannerisms, but also the same with you as with anyone, yes? -- though let's take away the geographic markers; they're not relevant. (They may dictate manner and accent, but to suggest region determines thoughtfulness vs. self-absorption is a nonstarter.)

So there's nothing to internalize or address. You're carrying a passenger who doesn't speak your language, and you don't understand hers. The fact that she goes deeper into "her" language when anxious or upset really tracks.

The thing for you to learn, then, is more like retraining, to see your differences as stemming from communication vs. intent. Nothing hurtful there.
Couples therapy
QUESTION: My wife is has been seriously depressed for a couple months, more so than in the 25 years we've been together. In the past few couples therapy sessions, she declined to explain why when I (at the therapist's suggestion, though I had asked before too) invited her to do so. She then said part of the reason she couldn't is that I would then get upset, which would shift the focus from her to me. The therapist supported her position.

In other words, it is my fault that she won't explain why she is upset to me. (Narrator: He knows why she is depressed. It is because she doesn't like sex, he is hurting as a result, she knows she will never change but is unwilling to say so clearly, and we both realize there is no good solution. But his saying so would be speculating about her internal mental state which he's learned is a no-no in couples therapy; it is important only to talk about one's own feelings.)

Is this rational? Is this abuse? Is this therapist playing favorites?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: What do those questions have to do with anything.

Your wife doesn't like sex. Are you ready to accept this and move on to whatever is next for you -- as a couple or not as a couple anymore?

Or is it your intention to try to talk about this to some better outcome for you, when you seem to be saying you already know there isn't one?

If it's the former, then you say what upsets you is limbo and not knowing the truth, and you are prepared to accept your reality, even one you don't want, because then you at least know where you stand. Because it's not about blame it's about living honestly. (Isn't it?)

If it's the latter, then you don't belong in couples counseling, because your wife is not safe to speak freely -- because you may try to use her honesty to get something you want from her.

Spouse hasn't spoken to me in five days.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn. Late last week, my husband and I got into a big fight over a misunderstanding (that I don't even know what prompted it) which escalated to the point of me angrily telling him to go to his parents' place, which he did. He stayed there for three days, before I went down and convinced him to come back home with me. But he is still angry. I know it was wrong to ask him to leave and have since tried to apologize sincerely multiple times. But he stays sequestered in our second bedroom and I have now not seen him for five days, nor heard from him, though I know he is there. He is eating by himself and only doing his own laundry. Any attempts to engage with him are met with either silence or angry words about how he doesn't want to talk to me or look at me. I'm at a loss and I don't know what to do. I'm trying to wait patiently, but his anger doesn't seem to have dissipated in the slightest, and I'm breaking down being stonewalled in our home. Any advice?

If it's a good reason, then do the second thing.

Imposter syndrome is real, I know that, but it's also BS and here's why: It affects regular healthy people who know what they don't know, while all the "I alone can fix it!!" Dunning-Krugerite yahoos rush in and screw it all up because they don't know what they don't know.

So I'm learning as I go on things like [whatever's different about being a consultant], so don't hesitate to let me know if I miss the mark and I'll adjust." Then, as things come up, you can ask them "Do you prefer if I [A] or [B]"?

Re: How do I get over myself
QUESTION: I worked on a consultant basis for decades. At first I always felt like you do: "What am I doing here? Why did they even hire me? I don't know what I'm doing! I'm going to screw this up and never be able to work again ... " Etc., etc. After a couple of experiences like this, I realized that I ALWAYS felt like this for the first week or two on a contract -- and it wasn't because I was ignorant, it was because I genuinely did not know at first what the problems were and what I was going to do to solve them. I was being a good listener and figuring out what the client actually needed, rather than coming in with a canned solution that might not fit their situation at all. So I learned to relax and be a sponge for the first couple of weeks, maybe (as CH suggests) produce a bit of work to show the client that I was listening ... and then kick into problem-solving mode once I felt surer what the problem was. Your reaction is perfectly normal, so don't worry about it.

Ex insists my gf is toxic because she wrote a book about cheaters
QUESTION: My marriage ended 3 years ago because my wife cheated on me and left me for that guy. The whole experience was devastating but after wallowing for months, I spent time in therapy, worked on myself and carried on. My ex and I have reached a good place and co-parent our son well. We are not friends but we are friendly.
Now, I am in love with a beautiful, smart, funny woman who I’ve been dating for 6 months. Because of her I am happier than I’ve been since before my marriage ended. She was also cheated on and we bonded over that experience. She wrote and published a book about it. My ex Googled her name and read the book and told me she’s not happy about the relationship. The book is very brutal about cheaters. My ex says she’s worried about what my girlfriend will eventually say to our son about cheaters and about her. I promised I won’t let that happen but my ex says my girlfriend is bitter and toxic and I should steer clear. I read the book for myself and it’s very funny but she doesn’t pull any punches about her hatred and disdain for her ex and all cheaters. Her ex was mean and insulting all through the divorce so it's understandable. They don't have kids so she's free to hate him all she wants. Could that book be a sign of toxicity or is it a great method of coping?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Guess what. Your ex wife doesn't get to decide whom you date. She doesn't even get an opinion, not even as the amicable co-parent of your children.

If someone you are dating does or says something that either causes harm to your kids, or presents a credible risk of imminent harm or long-term damage (I think that covers it), then your ex does have standing to speak up. Arguably that's what she did, but you answered her concern so her proper next move was to drop it, not drop a "should" on you.

Cuz, sorry, ex's complaint that she's uncomfortable with your GF for authoring a book about cheaters because ex is a cheater herself does not pass the laugh test. Unless "laugh test" is literally that it makes a tired advice columnist laugh out loud at her keyboard, in which case it passes with flying colors so now I'm confusing myself.

Of course she's not happy. You can say this to her. "Of course you're not happy after reading the book. I wouldn't expect you to be."

But then you can say: "I am not dating her, though, as some kind of hired assassin to kill your standing with our kids."

Because you're not, right? You're dating her because she is her own person and you like her a lot and you like yourself with her.

So: "I am dating her because I like her. She and her ex are not the two of us. You and I are our own people and have our own history and have made our own peace."

Then: "If she can't respect that, then of course we won't stay together. But I decide that, not you."

End of conversation, no negotiating.

As for whether the book is toxicity or coping: It could be either. Or both. Her book could be a snapshot in time, maybe since superseded or outgrown, and possibly even part performance.

You have chosen the high road as your kids' co-parent, so if you and your GF are going to stay together, then first you're going to have to find out for yourself whether she is willing and able to support that choice 100 percent. No oopses.

Again -- YOU find this out. You don't preemptively walk away because your ex thinks she can exercise veto power. You do not want to grant her that.

Your ex could choose to blow up your detente over this, because that takes only one person to do. She can do more harm than any anti-cheating zealot you date. I hope she doesn't force the issue so you have to articulate things like this.

Fun fun, the need for trust never stops and keeps running both ways.
New Job
QUESTION: I've been offered a new position at work. I dont love my current role but the new job isn't a slam dunk either. They are both management roles for high profile projects, the same grade level, and I have the same relative skill level and knowledge to bring in either role. I want to keep working for my employer because of their excellent benefits. How do I choose when both options are so similar?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I have no idea, since any new job is a risk you will hate it or be more layoffable than if you had stayed in the old one, and I know nothing about the intangibles of your company (e.g., whether taking new positions is an unspoken part of a rise through the ranks, even "lateral" moves). But if I'm looking at this as more of a logic problem, then I'm seeing something you don't love as the "old" option. So why wouldn't you try the "new" option? Unless there's a not-zero risk you'd hate it.
Living with a cheater… strategy or insanity?
QUESTION: Carolyn, I’ve been serially cheated on by my wife. I have not directly confronted her. We have settled into routine and can enjoy a day without issue if I compartmentalize my knowledge of her deceit, which now comes more easily. My heart is not in it, my kids are my life, my work supports us and fulfills me, along with hobbies.

If I can take what pieces of enjoyment I can from my weak relationship, live my life finding love and fulfilment outside of my supposed partner, and let the kids have a “normal” upbringing in the midst of background secrecy, is that fantastic adaptation and coping in a tough situation, or am I just a masochistic time bomb waiting to have a breakdown?

In the thick of it I’m not sure if this is strategy or insanity.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Huh. I see your predicament -- this could be one honest conversation away from being a functional(ish) open marriage. Or, boom.

We know you're lying to your wife (about not knowing how epically she's lying to you). The question is whether you're lying to yourself about how okay you are emotionally with the arrangement.

Two suggestions -- well, one, to spend some good honest you time with that question.

But the first version of it is, on your own, to imagine a life where you tell your wife the truth and then live with configurations of that idea. Same "open" (loveless) marriage but honest; divorce; shared home but separate rooms and social lives; and earnest reckoning with the marriage and an attempt at least at repair and monogamy. At various points of your days, think where you'd be at that moment if you chose option x. Better, worse, too weird to know? Not that you'd be 100 percent in control of the outcome, you're just pushing your mind out of the "This is fine" meme you're living.

The second version is to put yourself in solo counseling to figure out what you want and feel and where your lines are between healthy tradeoffs and self-erasure.

I vote version 2 -- but getting therapy set up takes time, so try on version 1 while you wait for your appointment. (Unless your work has an EAP. Then you can usually talk to someone in a matter of days.)
At a loss for words
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,
First of all, thanks for all the great advice and the community you've created through your columns and your chats.
I'm reaching out now because I’ve had some stressful events this spring/summer, but my anxiety is resting in one weird area, and I'm hoping you have some advice. My granddaughter was born prematurely earlier this spring to my daughter who lives 1000 miles away. Fortunately, I was in a position to be able to go be with them and help out during the last 2 months. Happily, the baby is now doing well. My husband is now facing treatment for prostate cancer. So, I will be staying home with him for the rest of this summer. He is a very private person and has asked me not to share this information beyond our family. Here's my problem. Many of my friends are surprised that I won't be returning to see the new grandbaby until fall. They ask me why. I'm having trouble figuring out how to respond to that question from these well-meaning and loving people. What do you suggest?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Thank you for your kind words, and I'm glad your grandbaby is doing well.

Now can I throw things around the kitchen in frustration at people for not letting things go that aren't their business?

Ugh.

Here's all you ever need to say to people who are asking for more info than you are willing or able to give: "Ah, long story."

This one, you can cap off with, "But I'll be back as soon as I can."

Then you change the subject. Have a pivot topic ready.

Also? Unsolicited, sorry: Your husband is asking a lot of you. In my book, which is irrelevant, he's asking too much. The caregiver needs care too.

If you agree with that, then ask him for license to confide. Not everywhere, just your chosen place of unfailing discretion.
Boundary-setting with possible special circumstances
QUESTION: I've learned a lot about setting appropriate boundaries in relationships over the past few years. I recently had a conversation with a close friend which led me to look at a specific situation differently though. I have sibling with whom I have a complicated relationship. He can be verbally explosive and insulting, including cursing, name-calling, etc. Sometimes this is followed by an apology, or an "I was just angry" explanation. I told him that this type of communication is unacceptable to me. My friend's point was along the lines of "what if this is early dementia or mental illness, and he truly can't control it?" If that's the case (we're both seniors), I realize that I still have a choice, but it makes the choice more complicated, doesn't it? I'm interested in your thoughts about this.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whether someone can or can't control their "bad" behavior matters, sure -- I'd let my wailing infant smack me in the face without consequences, right? But my healthy 8-year-old, not so much.

The boundary for a sibling who is "verbally explosive and insulting" but who has dementia or mental illness would be that I don't engage with the insults at all, or leave the room or end the call or whatever -- whatever it takes to go non-responsive. I also wouldn't take it personally. Not about me.

Also, that behavior never gets "rewarded" in any sense. That can mean the threat of it never factors into my decisionmaking; I do as I intend for my reasons and if the reaction happens, then it happens. There's no tiptoeing around.

I'm answering generically here. You don't say whether your sib's behavior has deteriorated, to suggest onset of dementia, say. "I was just angry," absent context, doesn't fly. We all get angry. Not all of us take that as permission to lash out and inflict harm.

The amount of their control factors into the amount you limit contact with the person, as part of your boundary. That's how it works for me at least. And of course it's just our perception of how much control they have, because who knows. The closest we get are formal diagnoses.
Dealing with inquiries of ambiguous loss
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,

I'm so grateful for your column and am an avid reader. I'm sad to be writing you, but I hope you can help. A friend of mine has been missing for a month now. She is an adult, but it is under suspicious circumstances that she disappeared (she left behind a cat that she loved deeply and daily medications), the police are involved and every day I help with the amount of spoons I can muster. I do hang quite a few posters and talk to a lot of people at my job (I get a lot of people from many areas of Denver passing through) about my missing friend to try to create awareness and possibly recognition to generate leads for the tip line. My question is that sometimes the overwhelm of people asking follow up questions about things we (her collective of friends and warriors trying to find her) have covered 100xs gets to me and I need a nice way to say that I don't have anymore answers. I realize I'm instigating these conversations, and people want to be helpful, and I point them to the tip line and the Facebook page her mom has going to try to organize everyone. I'm also undergoing therapy, to help manage my own loss here. I really miss her. Thanks for your help.

Sincerely,
Bring Jax Home
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: Oh oh oh. This is awful.

Your question is very much like the one people have when they are seriously ill and everyone they talk to says, "Have you tried ...?" It comes from this place of real caring, and then it's over and over and over, and you. just. can't.

I have a few suggestions. One is that you release as much of this worry as you can. You are lovely to worry about how people feel when they talk to you, but I can't imagine any of them don't see your distress plainly (unless they're just not capable). So you're good. really.

Another is basic and mechanical. If you can carry a stack of little printed business-size cards with the Facebook info and the tip line and some FAQs or whatever else, then, "Thank you -- this is all of it," is a natural transaction closer.

And, you can also say: "I am so grateful you're asking. I can't be the answers though. I hope you understand."

A huge hug through the ether to you.

Feeling weirdly guilty after my weight loss
QUESTION: Carolyn, I'm glad you answered today's question to open a discussion about weight loss drugs and judgment. I have a different but related one. I've lost 70 pounds taking meds, I'm healthier (was pre-diabetic), but now I'm having an unexpected response. I really like seeing myself thin. I like shopping for clothes, something that's been torture for years. But in this era of more body positivity, I'm feeling strangely guilty and kind of ashamed that I had to make myself so much smaller to embrace my body. I have friends of all sizes, of course, and I love them for who they are. But sometimes I can hear that judgy voice in my own head (never out loud) saying I'm glad I look the way I do now. And I hate that. Is this just another way that diet culture has messed with me? What should I do with these contradictory feelings?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yeah dramatic intentional weight loss definitely brings up some interesting new ways to feel bad -- when all "body positivity" was supposed to mean was not linking body size and shape and food to punishing measures of personal worth.

I wouldn't call your experience "unexpected" though. I mean, you were pre-diabetic -- your body wasn't in a happy place. Now it's happy, or happier. where it is, and it's okay to feel good about that.

So while I don't think it was ever misguided to focus on liking yourself and wearing flattering things at whatever weight you were -- and wow it is TOTALLY right to be accepting of others wherever they are, and being open to beauty in whatever form it appears -- we are allowed to have personal, internal signals. This feels good, this doesn't feel good, this feels great. It's our metering system. The best we can hope for at this point is to grab it back from social pressure -- or protect it from, in the case of kids.
At a loss for words
QUESTION: Why are you even saying when you will go back? Oversharing = push back. When are you going back? Not sure, haven’t made plans yet. Rinse and repeat. This will be true until you buy plane tickets.
FWIW I had premature twin grandbabies and after that first longer visit I only returned when needed/requested. After that first rough period, they have grown to be happy healthy elementary schoolers.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: So, yes -- you're right. I'll say that upfront. The less we say the less we have to explain.

But. For one thing, that's a tough lesson to apply in arrears. OP may have been chitchatting as usual, and suddenly there was Husband's Cancer Embargo to deal with, and oops, suddenly OP needs creative phrasing where none was ever needed before. It's like learning a new dance step and tripping over your own feet.

And, further, this dovetails with the need for caregiver to have care: The OP probably really wants to go back to see the daughter and grandbaby. And is worried about husband, too. OP is talking to friends! So, "Not sure, haven’t made plans yet," is not just info withholding, it's emotional withholding. That's hard.

So that's why the breezy deflection you suggest is 100 percent effective and right but ... ugh. Not. For a person like OP, newly in this spot. (Maybe eventually, with time.)

And why the pushing is so hard, too, from friends. Wish they had their sensors on.

Aaaaand why "keep my cancer a complete secret all summer" is just not a fair ask. Again. I say this already spotting anyone sick a huge sympathy advantage.

QUESTION: you mentioned :Same "open" (loveless) marriage but honest;

I'd add: Same honest, open *love-filled* marriage.

I know someone with that and it's not a way to not upset the apple cart. It's a reformation. And excising of the word 'cheater.' Also, it contains deep respect for the other so that nothing is being rubbed in the spouses noses.

ANSWER: Sure, can be. As always, any answer I write is to the details in the question only. Any application beyond that is at your own risk -- meaning, subject to your own interpretation, filters and sensitivities.

But when you give me "My heart is not in it" and "my weak relationship" and "my supposed partner," then I get to say, "Same 'open' (loveless) marriage."

Personal Health Issue
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, your answer to the new grandmother with the ill husband was good. But I am a wife who has forbidden my husband to talk about my health at all, never, zero. One reason is he has no boundaries at all, so my demarcation line has to be kind of all or nothing, or else he'd tell a stranger in the grocery store. What I would tell this woman is to look as though she's going to confide and then say, "Actually, I have a little health issue I'm dealing with. I'll talk more about it when I can, but I appreciate you keeping this quiet," and then moving to the pivot topic. I love it when my husband actually protects me, and I bet her husband would appreciate her handling it this way.
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: Yes, there's that. I'm sorry.

Then of course there's the other class of people who hear, "Actually, I have a little health issue I'm dealing with. I'll talk more about it when I can, but I appreciate you keeping this quiet," and they hound you to the ends of the earth for the rest of the information!!! or you see them everywhere from then on and they're being super discreet but with The Eyebrows / \

EAP followup
QUESTION: I work at a large employer with a mental-health benefit/EAP. I've been struggling to feel productive at work, wondering if I'm burned out, or depressed, or just bored with my job, etc. I recently signed up with the EAP and did indeed get to talk with someone in less than a week, which was great. I found that the therapy she provided seemed very "results focused," with the desired results being that I was able to be productive at work. To be fair, that is the problem I brought to her that I wanted a solution for. However, I also mentioned that some of my poor mental health state had to do with some issues I am having with my wife. She did not follow up on that at all. We talked instead about attention issues, possible ADHD, etc., all very reasonable things, ... but all focused on my ability to work.

I had somewhat of a feeling that maybe the employer-provided mental health providers were mostly focused on ensuring that employees were able to be productive at work and not necessarily as interested in probing "outside the box" of what I described to find deeper issues.

Just something to keep in mind.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Thank you. Yes, that's one potential limitation. Another is literal, in that the number of sessions is typically capped. But it's what I think of as a gateway -- a trained and licensed mental health provider who can identify areas of concern and refer out if needed.

That might not be something all of them can do, will do, are empowered to do. Mileages always seem to vary. But by my understanding, because the number of sessions is capped, part of the function is to refer out people who need more care.

For Bring Jax Home
QUESTION: Two of my husband's brothers and a niece and nephew were injured in a serious car accident in which they were all injured (one brother-in-law's neck was broken, though he survived). I became the conduit of information, both to and from, for friends and family.

It almost broke me, especially when people made suggestions they intended to be helpful (but they did not themselves help). About three weeks into this, seeing that I was reaching capacity to do this while working and caring for my young kids, two friends became my "communications secretaries." I gave them information and they made the contacts with relevant people. They filtered the return responses and suggestions from others, so that I only had to deal with appropriate stuff. And because they were one remove from the situation, they could simply say, "I'm sorry, I don't have the answer to that, but I should know more when I call you next."

Maybe Jax's friend could enlist some people to do that for them, especially if they have become "information central" for a wide circle. Because it's not sustainable, especially when you're dealing with your own anxiety.

why are people so secretive about cancer?

QUESTION: Just a counter balance to the person who experienced the EAP therapist as all about being productive at work again, ignoring other issues (ug, sorry that happened).

My experience with the EAP was different. I had a crisis (called with the question “how do you know it’s time to hospitalize someone for mental health issues they don’t think the have?”). Got excellent advice, and it wasn’t about work. I also have Fed friends making use of EAP as they face the fork in the road decisions.

Evil Ex Wife
QUESTION: A decade ago, when our kids were just babies, my husband was hit by a drunk driver and the physical and emotional impacts are lifelong. My husband did all the therapies and regained a lot of physical mobility/ability but his mental health spiraled out of control and I was his target of all his anger. He was verbally abusive and when I'd get close to help him, there were a few times he was physically abusive. For years, I tried to hold it all together but when my older son heard a particularly nasty insults thru the intercom system, I knew it was time. I got myself in therapy and planned the dissolution of my marriage. I've been out of the house for six months now and several in my church and his family have asked how I could leave a man who is disabled and disabled through no fault of his own. What happened "in sickness and in health" is what several have asked. I have been honest and I've said he was emotionally and physically abusive. Is it wrong of me to be direct? It is the truth. I'm so tired of hiding and angry at others' judgement of me when he goes to church and presents as some pillar of the community when he most certainly is not. Their dad is passionate about the boys attending this church school and I didn't fight it in the divorce agreement so for now, I'm stuck with this church and its community.
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: I am here for your directness.

This is a terrible story in so many ways, I am sorry.

I'm sure you are on this already, but just to make myself feel better, I am going to ask out loud whether there are extra eyes on your boys to make sure their dad doesn't turn his anger on them. Especially given that your husband is playing the church community, acting the pillar and using their sympathy to present himself as a victim 2 x over (accident and now you). Having them in the church school means there's a full coverup mechanism in place, for people to be very slow to believe he's harming them.
Re: keeping cancer secret
QUESTION: My husband had prostate cancer, which ultimately took his life, and he wanted it kept from his family and friends, though not mine.

Secretive about cancer
QUESTION: My spouse had surgery for aggressive prostate cancer 2 years ago. Last year, he had to undergo 35 sessions of radiation. We kept it very quiet. Only our closest friends, who don't live here, and our pastor knew. He works in an industry and at a level where people are always looking for your weak spot as a way to push you out. He's also about 30 years older than the other people he works with. One is constantly asking about his age and when he's going to retire. He was able to work from home for about 3 days following surgery, and he scheduled his radiation treatments for very early in the morning before work. He only told the HR director and one other person. No one else in the office knows. We live in a small city, and info like this spreads quickly. As a side note for the chatter whose spouse is a member of the clergy, my dad was a clergyman, and we never spoke to anyone about his health for the same reason.

school fundraiser misbehavior
QUESTION: My daughter's school has an annual silent auction fundraiser. We typically do some small bids, but there was a particular piece of art we liked this year that was a little more expensive. We were the last ones to bid on the item before the auction closed. Yet, we were informed a few days later that there was a "mix up" and someone else bid after us and was considered the winner. Neither my husband or I understand how this is possible, as there was a bell and announcement, it was not unclear. My husband thinks we should ask the school to fix this, which involves physically getting the art back, refunding the other person, and allowing us to pay and take it. I have suggested letting it go (after all, the school got the funds, which was the point). We save our money, buy other art, maintain harmony - although I also believe we should decline to attend poorly-run auctions at the school in the future, and contribute to school fundraising in other ways. What do you think? And if we want to find out the details of what happened, are we just stirring the pot?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Heh. I think you definitely let it go, because there are a few reasons the auction could have been messed up but there's no good outcome to complaining.

I also wouldn't "decline to attend poorly-run auctions at the school in the future," either. Next time don't leave without it when you win :)

By let it go, I mean really really let it go. But next time don't leave without your winnings when you win :)

(Clearly there was inside finagling, right? It's just a matter of why. Was the wrong piece put up for auction by mistake? Okay, school auction, you let that go. Did someone with more juice want it? That sucks. Did they drop it? Etc. None of it matters at this point, it's over, you aren't out any money, so forget it happened and la la la ...)
Group Conversations
QUESTION: We are going on a trip with a small group (6) of long time friends. We love the group chats but a couple of them like to start side conversations during a group time. I find this very distracting, no matter if I’m the one being sidelined or the one in the larger group. I don’t want to miss any discussion! Should I make a request to the group: Can we agree to keep our conversation A group one so I don’t miss any of your stories? Or should I try to guide the side talker back to the group? Unfortunately, the most active side talker likes to pigeon hole my husband and seems oblivious to his constant chatter.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: That irritates me too. I don't think there's much you can do about it, though. You can certainly try to make your request to the group -- especially if you have, say, a hearing or focus impairment that makes following it all extra challenging -- but what if some group members dislike group talk and prefer 1 x 1?

The person being split off is the one who has the reins, and can say to the one trying to divert them off to a side comversation, "Hang on, I'm following this [main group] story." So, I say make a strong appeal to your husband.
Talking with kids about mentally ill dad after divorce
QUESTION: I have been divorced from my spouse for just over a year now and share custody with my ex. We have two teenagers - one in middle school and one in high school. Dad has significant mental illness, leading to paranoid, strange, and manic behavior both in public and private. I don't think they're in physical danger, but I'm struggling to talk to them about his mental illness; in addition to a non-disparagement clause in our divorce, I am worried I will push them away, or worse, that they would repeat what I said back to him and he would take it out on me through the kids. I'm not looking for advice on custody (I have been assured that my 5 day (to his two-day) is really the most I'll be able to get), but rather how to talk to the kids about dad's significant impairments and erratic behavior. One kid is becoming increasingly anxious and distressed, alternating between fighting with his dad and saying he wants to live with him full-time. I've tried getting the kids into therapy, but they have seen multiple therapists without opening up, and I worry my ex has warned them not to talk about him to others. I've been dealing by being as neutral as possible, never mentioning mental illness and just giving them a lot of my own emotional support, but I'm worried I'm not giving them the language to describe what is very clearly in front of them, which feels like a conspiracy of silence, and I worry I'm failing to give them the tools they need to safeguard their own well-being. Help!

ANSWER: Maybe instead of therapy-therapy, look into the programs offered by NAMI for families of people with mental illness? I know Family-to-Family is one of their more popular ones, but not sure if that's the age you need. Still -- the emphasis on education vs counseling might get at the problem from a more effective angle.

A Married Sib Picks Estrangement - the OTHER Side
QUESTION: Here's the flipside to a sibling distancing themselves from their FOO, and, no, it doesn't involve abuse or control issues. (I'm tired of your fans and columns jumping to abuse.)

I'm the youngest in my family, and I didn't have the best childhood because of it. For most of my life, my family always considered me an afterthought. The four older kids made all the decisions about vacation spots, restaurants, movies, etc. My mom was the only family member to show up to my events when she remembered. My dad cannot remember my birthday, and none of my siblings know how old I am. (They subtract at least ten years.)

By the time I was a teenager, I found my family of choice, my best friend's family. From then on, I adapted that way, and no one in my immediate family ever noticed my emotional distance and frequent absences...until I got married. My husband (the oldest in his family) was pretty horrified at the second class citizen treatment we both received because the favoritism extended to my choice of spouse and our kids. My in-laws, however, welcomed me in a way I'd never experienced from family so we don't spend as much time with my family.

But ever since my husband came on the scene, my family decided he is "abusive" and keeps me from contacting my family. They have severe amnesia of all the times I complained about being ignored and the emotional distance in the previous 20 years. I'm not sure why my husband's presence has changed their outlook, but they're convinced his behavior, not their behavior, is the reason I don't come around anymore.

My family doesn't believe me just like all the other times they didn't believe me when I expressed my feelings to them. That's the other side.

Elementary Teacher PLEADING with caregivers: A PSA
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,
Please let me advocate for caregivers to refrain from giving children phones until the end of middle school at the earliest.
I work in a small mid-westerrn town teaching 4th grade. Many of the students in my class have smart phones, smart watches, and unlimited access to the internet. On top of this, parents allow students to have phones whenever they want, so kids come to school having stayed up until after midnight on their phones (or gaming systems). One parent told me she couldn't control her 9 year olds phone usage because they have different phones, thus different operating systems! Others tell me the kids have phones so parents can have peace of mind of knowing where they are all time time (emotionally unhealthy for other reasons, but I have a soapbox for that too), in case the bus breaks down, in case they feel sick at school, in case we're on a field trip and something happens, etc. I realize there may be a very, very slight chance a child would need to get in touch with a parent because of an extreme situation at school, but even then there are overlapping systems in place to keep parents informed. Teachers spend precious hours in PD reviewing, updating, and practicing how to contact parents in many different scenarios.
Caregivers, please, please, please consider: the positive benefit of your child having a phone is so small compared to the negative impact of your child having this device on physical, social, emotional, and psychological well-being.
If you insist your child have a phone, please please, please consider the following: strict parental control through the device's system and through your authority as the parent; give your child an emergency only flip phone; set limits and enforce them.
Each year, the age of students with smart devices gets lower and lower. There are many research studies showing the negative influence these have on child development.

Thank you Carolyn for all the good work you do and for all the Nuts who contribute to making this chat a success.

Hello, happy Friday.

Don't want belly rubs from a cheater
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,

In February, my partner started cheating on me. I found out in March and immediately ended the relationship. He was upset about getting caught, but not deeply remorseful, and the woman he cheated with is still in his life and in his phone (though I don't think they are going to get together).

A week after breaking up with him and blocking his number, I found out that I was pregnant. This was not exactly planned but it was also not UNplanned. I am 36 and we pulled the goalie a while ago, feeling some time pressure. Our thinking was that we would get married soon regardless, sooner if I happened to get pregnant.

I contacted him to tell him that I'm pregnant. He asked if I want to get back together, which I considered, but the answer is no. The trust is gone. Then he asked if I want to end the pregnancy, and the answer is absolutely no. I am 17 weeks now and so attached to this baby.

My ex-partner is very upset, because he wanted to be a father and wants to be involved. I shared ultrasound photos with him, but then he was upset because I didn't invite him to the appointment. He has called, crying, to ask if he can come over and rub my belly (he swears this is all he wants). I do not want to be touched by him because I'm too angry, but I can't decide whether this is unfair.

We will co-parent in some way (we have set up counseling to start planning for it), but do I have to involve him in the pregnancy too? It has turned out to be a much more tender and vulnerable experience than I had expected, and I wanted to share that with him but not under these circumstances.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: This is an unusually intimate heartbreak, I am so sorry.

I am sorry specifically that he made such a needy and clueless ask of you. I mean. No! Okay? No. Talk about a forfeited right. It's time for him to help *you* feel better, not the other way around.

I think he needs to hear this. That having broken it, he might consider thinking how to fix it -- instead of coming to you and expecting you, the person he just devastated and is now trying to handle her own pain, to take on his pain and make it all better, too.

Plus: You are going to be partners in raising this child, and you are going to have to find ways to get along, and that is going to require levels of forgiveness you never knew you had in you -- and that might be true even if there were no cheating involved! parenting is like that -- but tender-sweet-vulnerable access to your body is something to put way down on the access list right now. If it ever makes the list again.

So to answer your specific question: Your body is the one going through so much physically and emotionally, the latter of which he's responsible for, so you can decide, without being "unfair," what lines you don't want him to cross. You just can.

If you ever eventually want to give him some access to the experience of the pregnancy, as your anger recedes, or as something you decide will be better for the child and their bond, or because you believe you might regret your hard line later (just offering these, not endorsing any of them) -- then here's a way to think about it.

First, decide on your terms, not in answer to tears.

Second, think what is about you and what is about the baby. For example: Most incremental OB appointments are about your health, so, nope. If there's an ultrasound scheduled later on to measure fetal growth, then (quietly) keep an open mind about letting him be there for that.

You've got counseling coming. It's okay just to say no now and decide to decide later. "I have a lot of anger yet to process, pressuring me on top of that is not okay."

(Plus a 17-week belly is kind of just a belly. But that's beside all the points.)

Congrats on the baby and good luck through the extensive deep breathing process ahead.
So much advice
QUESTION: My husband and I are the parents of two teens, who are generally sensible kids who share their lives pretty freely with us. In the past year, my husband started seizing on every opportunity to advise them about whatever subject the kids mentioned. It’s to the point where the kids can’t mention anything without being talked at for ten minutes by their dad. The kids zone out, exchange looks with one another and have also said (to my husband) that they feel condescended to and sometimes they’re just venting. I know my husband feels the inevitable, and normal, drift as the kids grow independent and he’s trying to be superdad in these last daily opportunities to parent. I’ve said as much to him and said I get his instinct to parent more but we need to back off and let the kids heed their own judgment before we jump in. My husband got very angry and accused me of “shirking” my duty as a parent and said the kids will get his advice as long as he’s alive (he’s perfectly healthy) and he owes them his “wisdom.” It was out of character and bizarre. I tried to raise it again weeks later and he took the same angry stance. The kids now avoid him as much as possible so they don’t constantly hear about what they “should” do or have done.. What can I do?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ironic, isn't it. He's living proof that advice is pointless when people don't want to hear it.

I'll just assume he won't appreciate it if you put it to him that way -- unless you know how to disarm him, or catch him at a particularly receptive moment.

Once you're dealing with someone so dug in as to be angry-reactive upon approach, questions and generalized concern are often a better entry point: "You okay?" Maybe a long walk, too, away from the kids. This is oddly specific, but there are reasons for that: A literal change of secenery from the source of stress is helpful to clarity of thought. Also helpful, physical activity. Movement can jar our deeper, scarier thoughts loose from their embedded places. Walking in particular, if we're able, has this power. Also, when people are facing forward, vs facing each other, they often find it easier to talk about difficult things (why cars can be such a great place for kids to unburden).

So, you have a partner who clearly is knotted up over some stuff and acting out. And not only is the path he's taking unproductive, but it's also directly undermining his own started purpose. He's pushing his kids away and they're tuning him out on contact.

This is something you might, might be able to point out to him eventually. If he does start talking a bit about this anxiety he's feeling, no doubt about the passage of time, about the kids' futures, about his own relevance -- then you can be supportive and sympathetic. The timing is pretty typical for a parent to go through a lecturing spasm.

But ideally he won't need you to point it out, because once someone gets to the point of admitting this stuff out loud, it's often self-correcting. Just saying it can reduce the anxiety dramatically. Then: "So I just need to shut up and trust that I've already shared whatever wisdom I have, and it's up to them to ask me or figure out how to use it."

Maybe way too optimistic. But keeping it in your mind as an anxiety response and dealing with him accordingly might get you there.

And the occasional: "My duty as a parent is also to recognize when something isn't working -- and if they're pushing me away, then I need to adjust my approach."

This is all Part 1. Part 2 is for your husband to talk to someone, about the anxiety and anger, if he is completely inflexible. (Or you do, if he's inflexible on that.)
Credit card fraud?
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,
I'm writing on behalf of my husband with his knowledge. His best friend's wife recently called him asking for a loan. Apparently she has a history of poor financial management, took out a credit card in her husband's name (how?) and maxed out the card. She called my husband asking for money to pay the company. Even worse, her intentions is not to pay right away and make a deal with the company for a lower amount. My husband is ducking her calls. I told him he must confront her, tell her if she doesn't come clean to her husband, he'll have to tell his best friend himself. She has put my husband in a terrible place: keep a secret from his best friend (unacceptable )which could ruin the poor guy's credit or blow up a marriage. Any advise to me, the advisor?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: If this were my friend's spouse calling me for the loan, then I would go straight to my friend with this information. Meaning, I would not apply the usual, "You have 24 hours to tell my friend the truth or I will tell," here. Here's why:

I already know I can't trust the spouse (fraud), and there's room for plenty more damage in those 24 hours. So I tip my friend off asap. And I give my friend the info for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. And the name of a good lawyer, if I know of one.

Any damage to the friend's credit or marriage already falls squarely on the shoulders of the spouse.

If there is damage to my friendship for doing this, then I will own that. A fair risk for doing what's right for my friend.

My advice to you, the advisor, is decide whether you agree with that hypothetical, and counsel your husband accordingly.

Tell it to me straight
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,
In December I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Fortunately it was caught early, is highly treatable and my prognosis is excellent. Understandably (I hope) during this time sex has been a low priority. There has been the emotional uncertainty before I knew everything I knew now, batteries of tests, and most recently surgery and radiation. About six weeks ago, when looking for one of my own medications, I accidentally discovered that my husband had a prescription for 20 mg of Cialis, with the specification that they be used one hour before sexual activity (i.e. they are the daily use ones). At the time, I just could not deal with what this likely means -- I had just had surgery, and so I didn't say anything. Since my "discovery" five pills have been used (but we have not been sexually active). There's no other plausible explanation, right? My daughter (his step daughter) is getting married in June and I don't want any drama, but eventually I have to have this conversation. Our finances are separate, but if I am to leave, what else should I be doing before having this conversation.

The "what else should I be doing" question is for a lawyer. So that's my advice, find yourself a good one and have a talk. If you want a steady source of confidential emotional support, then line up a therapist, too.

The generosity you are showing your daughter is lovely, I just want to acknowledge that.
SIL blocked me
QUESTION: My brother has been married for 33 years to “Lynn”. In those years, she built a wall between him and his family. She has held grudges and has never tried to get to know his family. She once accused me of trying to steal their tent I borrowed because my brother wouldn’t make plans to meet so I could return it. When our mother died, my brother didn’t come to the funeral because she refused to come. I recently discovered that my SIL has been blocking me on social media. I don’t know what I did to upset her, but it makes me sad that I am missing out on my brother’s life, my nephew’s life, and my SIL’s life, and I will never know why or if there is anything I can do to change it.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm sorry. This is mostly a brother problem. Lynn is the source, but he is the one who could have said this level of control and division was not okay, and instead he chose to go along with it. Who knows whether marrying her was part of his decision to separate from his family, or if the estrangement was an unintended consequence of being with her. It's a known phenomenon, though, for people who want some emotional separation (for whatever reason) but lack the strength to follow through, to find a partner who does the dirty work for them. If that's the case with your brother, then there really is very little you can do.

Either way, whether this was his choice or a slow-motion accident, all you have to counteract the distance between you is consistent, non-obnoxious effort to stay in touch -- with him, with her, with them. However you can manage it, in good faith, with as much patience as you can muster.

That may sound awful and self-erasing, but the alternative is to give up. Because that's the only one she has left you.

Her blocking you on social media is a sad thing and does cut you off from the feed of their news, but it really is just the last superficial tie. You are "missing out on my brother’s life, my nephew’s life, and my SIL’s life" already if you are not involved in it. So, focus on that -- in what ways are you still able to be involved? And try to get the most out of those.
Response to sister’s concerns!
QUESTION: My sister is going down a rabbit hole about her 4 year old’s health. He has some eczema issues and she has started banning all sorts of food and products with certain chemicals in an attempt to solve the problem. I’m a child of the 80s where we ate and played with anything and everything so it’s hard for me to understand this level of anxiety. I obviously want to validate her feelings and be supportive. Are there any generic statements that I can make, even though I don’t fully understand or even agree with?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: The first thing you can do is not equate your sister's parenting experience with your 1980s childhood. That's basically saying it's her fault for being a headcase, instead of recognizing she has to work with too many different variables to count.

I mean -- do you know for sure her child isn't reacting to a food additive? Even the word "anxiety" comes with judgment attached.

I'm from Planet 80s, too, so I get where you're coming from. But that cred didn't make, say, my kids' reactions to scented laundry products any more real. Some products and exposures are just different now from 40 or 50 years ago.

The best thing you can do for your sister is "fully understand" that, as much as humans don't fundamentally change from generation to generation, the conditions parents have to deal with can change a lot. Just the exposure to information is an enormous change. My older sisters got their parenting advice from other people, TV, radio, print. Just the 10 year gap means I started to get mine from email and online, and socials by the end. Another 10 years and parents are saturated with so much information, misinformation and disinformation that the ones who aren't anxious might be the outliers.

So maybe commit to not judging her, understand what you don't understand, know it's not your place to "agree" unless you're a stakeholder in possession of all the relevant information, and ask if there's anything you can do to help.
Auntie Smaug and the Necklace
QUESTION: Re: Tuesday's column, I'm OP. The wedding went great! I did invite the aunt (not worth the drama). She's always been a peach and would've reacted very poorly to being called out. I wrote the letter, tore it up, and moved on. My maid of honor was on high alert for bad behavior the day of, but thankfully all went well.

The ring was my paternal (step)grandfather's - aunt's biological dad - and all the siblings received a piece of the reformed jewelry, as agreed between them. Mom gave it to me with my dad's blessing. I'm not sure what her claim to ownership of my dad's portion was, but I don't much care anymore.

My dad and I walked down the aisle to the same music my mother did, and I wore that gift from her proudly.

QUESTION: Maybe it’s possible he’s using the medication solo? If there’s no other evidence of cheating that could be a potential explanation.
RE: Tell it to me straight
QUESTION: I agree that the circumstantial evidence doesn't look good for your husband. But in the spirit of acknowledging the burdens of caregivers, I have to wonder whether there might be a more compassionate explanation. It seems plausible to me that he might be freaking out about your diagnosis in his own way, and keeping it secret in order to conceal the burden from you -- and also because of his own guilt and shame. Obviously you may not have the energy to help manage his fear, but you should at least encourage him to get some kind of support -- if not necessarily the support you fear he's choosing. If he is otherwise a good and loving husband, and a compassionate caregiver, then it's essential to talk to him about it. There are a lot of missing details here, and you might be surprised by what you might learn -- and what you can forgive. By all means, talk to a lawyer and prepare for the worst -- but don't assume the worst until you can confirm it with him. Good luck.

So Much advice- here's just a little more (sorry)
QUESTION: Maybe this will help enlighten your husband- what he's doing is very counterproductive. Teenagers live in the same world we do. They know about the bad stuff, and they probably know more about how it plays out in their own personal corners of the universe than you or your husband ever will. Yes, they are impulsive and emotional compared to adults, and they aren't always great at calculating risk. But what helps them is to have an adult they can reach out to, without fear of judgment or harm, who will meet them where they are when they have a problem. This is the opposite of what your husband is doing. Yes, we venerate the image of the family patriarch imparting wisdom to their children (ideally at a hardwood table or under a tree), but... that doesn't mean that lectures actually help kids. Right now your kids know that if they have problems, find someone other than dad to talk with about them.
For So much advice
QUESTION: 2 things the kids could do

“Dad, you’re worth more to me than your advice. Just your example is enough.”

“Dad, here I’m asking for a listening ear because I want to vent. Is that ok? Next time I’ll want advice and I’ll tell you.” Then later, “Dad, can you teach me how to fill out a 1040/change a tire/tie a tie/ whatever”
Doesn't everyone deserve a second chance?
QUESTION: I had some set-backs (a break-up which left me homeless combined with job loss) that were a wake-up call for me. I deserved all of it because I cheated on my boyfriend who was supporting me and had gotten me a job with his family’s company. After a lot of therapy, I came to realize that I had coasted through my 20s taking advantage of various people. I intend to change my life for the better and so I took a new job that pays much less but one I am qualified for. My brother and SiL were nice enough to rent me a room in their house which is very close to work. That's important because the only car I can afford is not very reliable.
In the past I was snarky and judgmental about my SiL for superficial reasons and she knew it so our relationship is strained. As part of my new life I’m trying to mend fences so I’ve apologized and tried to befriend my SiL. She blew me off, saying that I’m only trying to “make nice” now that I need her and to forget it. My brother accepted my apology and we’ve become close again but he takes his wife side in this so whenever she is around her animosity makes things difficult. Do I just accept this is how it’s going to be while I’m living here? I wish she’d give me another chance, I know she doesn’t owe me that but her cold shoulder is really wearing on me. Should I try again to explain myself or am I just going to have to live with this until I can save up enough money to move out?

ANSWER: I don't think explaining yourself is the way to go. You have already explained, and SIL didn't buy it.

Instead I suggest saying to SIL that you can see why she didn't buy it. For example:

"You have every reason not to believe my apology is sincere. I spent the last [number] years taking whatever I wanted from people and not caring about how I treated them. I also wasn't kind to you. If I were you, then I wouldn't believe me, either."

I mean, would you believe you? Be honest.

Your brother probably did because he's your brother. He either wants to believe you, or he's better at reading you, so he has more than your word to go on.

After you say this to your SIL, then say: "I am grateful you are letting me stay here, even though you don't believe me. I hope time will let me prove to you that I mean it. I created this mess, so it's on me to clean it up."

Then don't try to "befriend" your SIL. Be an excellent tenant, helper, guest, sibling and general citizen. That's how you live down past mistakes.
Can’t make anyone feel
QUESTION: I’ve heard this- you don’t have control over anyone’s feelings. Okay, makes sense. But is the reserve true- that you are not accountable to anyone’s feelings? So if I tell someone “you are making me feel sad” is this wrong? Isn’t there some accountability for affecting people’s feelings? I may have been talking to someone else who misinterpreted this. I just want some clarity.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Well ... as manipulators across time have always understood, there's a lot we can do to control other people's feelings.

What you're getting at is where the lines of reponsibility go. It's a really good concept to have down, because it's what differentiates healthy relationships from unhealthy ones.

Each of us is responsible for what we choose to do. That includes taking into account its possible effect on others.

But that doesn't mean anything I do that hurts someone else is wrong. I don't have to make plans with someone I don't like, for example, just because saying no would hurt them. My time is my responsibility, not theirs.

If instead I did something hurtful just to hurt, like ... I broke something of theirs out of spite, then their hard feelings would totally be my fault.

So to take your example, "You are making me feel sad." It depends on the context, but in general, it's okay to tell someone when you are feeling sad in response to their actions toward you. "When you say these things to me, I feel really sad." Even if it's not something they're doing to you, it's okay. Like if someone moves away: "I'm sad we don't see each other anymore."

But that doesn't translate into another person's responsibility to make you un-sad. You hope the person will stop saying the things to you -- but if they don't, then it's up to you to do what you need to protect yourself from that person.

I'm taking forever on this, explaining it through examples. In any situation, though, you can reason it out by tracing the baseline responsibility. Whose choice it is, whose business it is, whose time it is, who has the last word. When you're trying to get other people to make you feel better, or trying to manipulate how others feel for your own advantage, then you're crossing lines.

Rub her belly???
QUESTION: The request by the cheating ex to rub her belly (!!!) made my jaw drop. It is so creepy. Accompanied by the unsolicited reassurances that "this is all he wants," my "yikes" alarms went off. This guy has major boundary issues. Keep your lines right where they are, LW. The fact that the LW is even asking if it is "fair" to say no to such a gross request suggests that there may have been some conditioning/manipulation going on during their relationship. LW, are there other ways this guy has twisted things to make you worry your boundaries are unfair? Make sure solo counseling for you is in the mix as you navigate this. The ex's attitude of being sorry he got caught but not sorry for lying and cheating is another red flag here. Stay militantly on your own side and on your baby's side against boundary pushing and line blurring. And thank stars you got out, as crappy as the wakeup call had to be.
re: Second chances
QUESTION: Yes. People deserve second chances. Those second chances aren't necessarily EASY. You are getting a second chance... what you do with it here is up to you. Including accepting that you broke so much trust that some people will need to see sustained behavior over a long period of time to do more than rent you a room in their home and be civil to you for the sake of their spouse.
How do I talk about separating?
QUESTION: How do I start a conversation about separating with my partner? We've tried multiple therapists for multiple years, and I don't have the energy to keep working. The straw that broke the camels back was during therapy, when the therapist said to my partner: "Your partner [me] is looking at you lovingly." And I thought to myself "I don't feel that. I'm not feeling love for this person and I don't know how to get that feeling back."
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You start telling the truth in therapy. That is what you are there for.

It sounds as if you kept your thought to yourself?

I realize that's a brutal one. But you're there, and it's time for your partner to hear it.

Or how about this, and you don't wait for the next session: "We've tried multiple therapists for multiple years, and I don't have the energy to keep working. I would like to separate."

Often saying it is the tallest obstacle.

belly rub vs. cheater
QUESTION: I know you're a dog person, but I'll use my cat as an example. Sometimes she seems like she is dying for a belly rub. Other times she instantly attacks if you even come close, despite her apparent pose for one. The point is, the person wanting to give the belly rub is NEVER the one to decide if it's OK.

In this situation I would be all extended claws and teeth. Don't give in to his manipulation.
RE Response to sister’s concerns!
QUESTION: As the parent of two kids with eczema, I would like to point out that what your sister is doing (banning certain chemicals and additive) is pretty standard advice that all dermatologists have recommended. It's definitely not a rabbit hole!!
Also, severe eczema untreated can lead to bacterial infection (my kids have had them because they were scratching themselves), so anything you can do to proactively manage it really makes a big difference.
I, unfortunately, have to go. No marathon today -- and I know I leave you severely under-Nedded. But I will be back at it next week. Have a great weekend, and thanks for stopping by.
About this live chat

Hello, more Nedball to get us rolling (ugh).

Also -- I grabbed a few things from last week's queue and threw them in this one, so don't be surprised if you see that something you posted has a second life.
Summer with Nephew...
QUESTION: My sister (single mom if that matters) is having a challenging time with her 15yo son and asked if he can spend 8 weeks with us this summer for "change of pace." We have two teenage daughters and they are excited at the prospect of his coming. My husband and I asked to talk about expectations - contribution to household chores, cleaning up after one's self in the kitchen, do own laundry, and he needs a job or volunteer thing or participate in a sport. We have these expectations of our own kids. Nothing different. He's not welcome to scroll through social media for 8 weeks on our couch. My sister was indignant saying that of course her son would help out and of course he'd clean up after himself and that we are expecting the worse in her son and if we aren't going to support them, then why even bother? I really want to provide her a break and her son an opportunity to be some place new, but I know myself and I don't do well with kids just laying about all summer. I also know my nephew right now is disrespectful to my sister leaving messes all over the house, routinely skipping school, and doesn't contribute to the household at all. Our girls work at our local pool and we can probably get nephew the check-in desk job for a few hours a week and maybe a local rec summer baseball team could take him on, but it all requires planning. Ideas for how to re-engage my sister again? - so that she can hear we are trying to support her and our nephew but not at the expense of our sanity?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You've said what you need to say about your rules. If you mean to follow through with hosting your nephew, then this is one of those things best not over-talked. Say to her that you weren't "expecting the worst" -- or the best! -- or expecting anything. You were just spelling out *your* expectations to preempt any misunderstandings. Your basic abundance of caution. So now if he and she are on board, great, then you'll start the arrangements, "let me know."

The more you say, the more you validate the idea that you're worried about him and the the deeper you dig the hole.

Dog with cancer
QUESTION: I read last week’s chat after the fact, but I feel compelled to comment on the person whose dog has cancer and the vet bills are pushing them to the brink. A lot of people suggested ways to pay for the dog’s care. If the OP can find a way to do that that doesn’t cause them irreparable financial harm, great. But I’d also like to give the family permission to say a kind, humane goodbye if they need to, without guilt. For every “my dog was cured and lived to 16!” story I’ve heard, I’ve heard three “we went into debt and got 3 not-great months and watched the dog suffer” stories. I have said goodbye to many, many dogs in my life—some when they were way too young to die. All of them were gut-wrenching and I sobbed for days, sometimes weeks. But every dog who has left me has also opened the door for another dog to come into my life. And that new dog helps to heal me, and because I always get rescues, I hope I’m helping to heal them, too.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yes, thanks for bringing this back up. I meant to get back to it but got chat tired and never finished the thought. It is a completely defensible position -- for the family and the animal, not just the finances -- to choose not to subject a pet to extensive medical intervention in the face of a dire prognosis.

We decided upfront for our pets, for example, that for a cancer, we'd do surgery if that was an option but not a bunch of cycles of chemo, because making a dog sick over and over without being able to explain what it is and why was not something we had the stomach to do. Other pet parents and their vets might go a different way for different reasons, no judgment, but that was a part of our pre-adoption conversation.

Dogs and cats have short lives relative to humans, too, so it's fair to factor that into the calculation of suffering in treatment for lifespan gained.

The more comfortable we get with having conversations like this toward humane and compassionate outcomes, the better, IMO -- about pets and people. Thanks again.
My daughter wants me to be more excited about her wedding
QUESTION: I accidentally hurt my daughter’s (“Lisa”) feelings and I want to make amends. Lisa is 24 and just got engaged. Personally, I think she’s a little young to settle down but since I had her at 21, I’m not one to talk. And I like her fiance, “John” a lot and do think they’re a great couple so it’s all good. On Easter Sunday Lisa announced to the whole family that she and John were getting married in 2026 and told the story of the elaborate proposal he’d arranged. Later my sister asked me why I wasn’t more surprised and emotional and I said that they’d been discussing marriage for months and ring shopping so there was nothing surprising about it. Lisa later told me she was devastated that I down-played the very romantic proposal John had arranged for her and wished she had a “normal” mom who would be as excited as she was. I apologized but Lisa still seemed upset. Last night we talked it out and she asked me to be excited about her wedding and behave like a “real” mother-of-the bride. It’s true that I’m pretty laid back about these sorts of things, probably because I’ve never been married or even interested in getting married. I love Lisa so much and am sorry she thinks I carped on her big announcement. I'm giving them almost half the money they need for the wedding but otherwise I’m not sure I can fake an 18-month interest in wedding details. What should I do?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I think this is a fascinating question.

Which means Lisa would probably wish I would behave like a "real" advice columnist and tell you to rally around your daughter.

Which of course I do advise, but you're only going to be able to do this well, credibly, in a way that is true. And while there's always some Lycra in that -- we can always find something new to learn about others and ourselves -- you're still you and you're never going to thrill at the idea of mother-daughter facials. (Or are you? Who knows.)

So I think the first thing you have to do is go back to Lisa to say you love her, genuinely 100 percent are there for her, and 100 percent want what is best for her in life. And you think John is great and great for her. Say you never want her questioning these things. [This is where you wait for her to nod or something.]

Then you point out that you can only be who you are. Which means if she wants a mother who is genuinely swept up in a lot of the wedding details, then you are going to disappoint her -- possibly many times over by the time the I-dos are all-dones. Which is exactly the last thing you want to do!! Truly. Tell her it breaks your heart that you let her down already. [Pause again for evidence of daughterly absorption.]

Then the message: So here is what you are proposing:

You will love her and love how excited she is about this and pay amply for it and, where it counts most, rally to be the mom she wishes you were.

And in return, you will ask her to behold you, the mother-of-the-bride she actually has, and find it in her heart to see you as "real."

(Also maybe note that if she zeroes in on a few top priorities for her Real Mother of the Bride to rally for, then this will set you up for success.)
Security person here on Tracking Stalker
QUESTION: 1. OP should do a thorough review of all their computers and devices to ensure that THEIR devices haven't been compromised in some way.
2. They should also change all their passwords, ensure multifactor authentication is on for their email and all accounts possible.
3. They should also review the privacy settings and connections on social media to ensure their information isn't publicly available and isn't leaking to the tracking stalker through a shared connection.
4. They should document this most recent encounter.
5. If there is any further contact they should clearly tell the tracking stalker clearly and simply that the stalker's contact is not welcome or wanted and they are to stop making contact. That encounter should also be documented.
6. If the stalker continues to contact the OP, they should document it regularly, contact the police and look at other physical security measures like self-defense courses.

They boyfriend can/should do all this too but at this point the OP's focus needs to be on themselves and the tracking stalker is after them as well.

Take this seriously, read De Becker's Gift of Fear, take action. Do hesitate. Do not rely on "orders of protection". Assume this person is armed, dangerous, unpredictable and will take violent action.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: This is in reference to last week's chat. I saw it only on a trip through the outtakes. I was not as concerned about the possibility of other access because OP mentioned the ex had access to the date's text messages, ergo the phone number. However, 1-2 is just good hygiene anyway, 3-4 is sensible after a weird encounter, and 5-6 apply to anyone who crosses a line more than once. I'm happy to post it.

Preemptive comment: A lot of people respond by seeing these as overreactions, but if you read carefully it's preparing, assuming, reading, documenting. I.e. not being the one who is surprised if it's the rare worst case.
Carolyn Hax chat: We were on a date. And then his estranged wife showed up.
Mental Load Backfire
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, I wrote a question about this to you a couple of months ago when it first erupted, but I don't think it ever ran. I'll try to summarize the background as quickly as possible to get to the awful new update.

Background: Husband and I both work full time, but I usually do 99% of the administrative stuff for my household, like lots of moms. Summer camp/activity planning has always been my domain until last year, when I got super fed up with it and my husband agreed to take it on for 2025. He disregarded all of my tips about timing, ignored the emails I forwarded with the kids' favorite places and their deadlines, and we ended up with 0 weeks scheduled for each one (later updated to 2 weeks of a crappy backup place that my husband's brother recommended). My husband knew he blew it and agreed that he would be in charge of keeping the kids occupied during 75% of work hours over the summer (I agreed to cover the rest). The kids, to provide all needed info, are 9 and 7. They can play together for a while but do need supervision and need help with food. Not the most fun summer for them, but doable because we both telework.

Okay that brings us to now. My husband's work abruptly called everybody back into the office effective June 1. I still telework. This means that even though we had agreed my husband would take on the primary responsibility for the kids, it's actually ALL GOING TO FALL TO ME. Our family focus right now is on my husband's frustration about the big change at work, but I am quietly seething with rage because I would have just booked the camps myself if I had known I would spend all summer being interrupted for snacks and noises. I am so mad I can hardly start thinking my way to solutions. Is there anything I can do to salvage the fairness of the arrangement?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ooh, I remember this one -- it was in my queue to answer but I never got to it. And I have to tell you, just reading it gave me a somatic stress response. Then and now, with the update.

It's not just the camp fail. It's the underreaction to the fail and what it means. Saying the equivalent of, "My bad, I'll be in charge of keeping the kids occupied 75 percent," is not enough.

This, to me, is what enough would have looked like:

"You were trying to make a point by handing this to me, not only that you are overwhelmed but that I completely take it for granted that you will handle all the intricate details of our family's management. You do it seamlessly and I just let you.

"So the one time you make it clear you've had enough, you hand one responsibility over to me -- and not only that, you spoon feed it to me, with all the instructions and warnings and necessary links and emails and secret codes. And what do I do?

"I totally ignore it. And trash our kids' summer -- and yours -- because I can't be even minimally arsed.

"So. Obviously I am on the hook for their care this summer. That goes without saying. It will be only to the extent I can, of course, with my job, and I will need your help, but I will be the Mental Load Boss of their care. That's what I'm saying. This summer and ever after too. Because I get it now.

"More important, though, I am telling you -- I get it now. I have been a complete barnacle on this ship that you have been running singlehandedly for years. And there is no excuse for that. That injustice ends now."

Right?

So the fact that your household is now focused on his RTO feelings and not on your "enjoy getting that 75 percent child-care back!" feelings, and your rage is "quiet-seethe," is proof there's a way bigger problem than his biffing camp deadlines.

Fairness can be salvaged only if he can grasp fairness. Can he? Can he? (Said like Cam in "Modern Family.")

BTW -- if any camps are available still, at outrageous late signup cost, then perhaps there's something of his he can give up to finance them. That too would be fair.
Summer nephew
QUESTION: At that age, nephew should be included in conversations about expectations, not just his mom/OP's sister. He might not want to stay at aunt/uncle/cousins home. And forcing a teen to spend the summer away from home when he doesn't want to, that's not going to help whatever "having a hard time" is about.
Also, OP might rethink the job thing. Certainly, chores around the house. But depending on what "having a hard time" has been, this might be a chance for nephew to decompress and have a [mostly] unencumbered time to get his well-being together. I was the same as OP - insisting my kids have a "productive" summer vacation. My pushiness got me a kid in the hospital because I missed that they needed to decompress. Just my 2 cents.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Well spent, thanks. The "include the nephew" part is the real value, because the job could be the best thing or the worst, depending. Maybe he needs to have a reponsibility -- or be relieved of any for a bit. It's hard for us to say what his stressors are.

I will note the job the OP referred to was quite small, "few hours" I think?

I don't want my friends to go to ex's wedding
QUESTION: My ex is getting married this summer. I know this because we have a number of shared friends, though I am closer to them than he is. (He is a very social person with a wide field of shallow friendships.) We were together for seven years spanning our late twenties and early thirties, and our breakup (2022) was lifechanging for me, a truly awful experience. A couple of friends have asked whether I am comfortable with them going to his wedding (they don't otherwise see or talk to him very often, but he apparently invited every person he's ever met). I know the right answer is to say of course they can go, continue to live my own life and worry less in general about what's going on in his, but I actually feel very sad, mad, and anxious about it. It's not ok for me to say no, is it?

Summer with Nephew
QUESTION: I wanted to reply to the letter about the summer with the nephew. In my experience, kids treat their own parents worse than they treat other people. We had a nephew stay with us when his parents were at the end of their rope with him, and he was like a different kid - polite, helpful and happy to be there. And he has great parents - he was just at that age where they were butting heads! Assuming he wants to come and isn't forced to, I think you just talk to him about how things run at your house and tell him you thought it would be fun to work a few hours at the pool with your daughters as a way to be around people and make some spending money. I think if you engage with him instead of your sister, you'll be surprised at how well it goes. Fingers crossed for a great summer!

For not wanting friends to go to ex's wedding
QUESTION: We asked our sibling if they were OK if we did the same thing (attend their ex's wedding) - sibling wasn't even married to ex. Just boyfriend/girlfriend in separate residences for 3 yrs. Sibling said "Sure, it's not my preference, but I can't stop you and I think I'll be OK afterwards". Sibling was definitely NOT ok. That was the catalyst for 2 major family eruptions and now we haven't spoken in 15 years, and all of it traces back to us attending that wedding WITH sibling's knowledge and "permission". Don't be that person. If you say you are OK with them going (which in all honesty IS the only right answer, you don't get to tell them what to do with their lives) then mean it. You cannot hold it over their heads after the fact.
excited daughter, mom not so much
QUESTION: I was that mom as well. Although happy for her and her choice of life partner, I didn't jump up and down and do cartwheels--that's just not me. And then my kid took exception to everything I said or did, even slight facial movements or tone of my voice she deemed something negative when she was planning her wedding. So I stayed neutral and in the background, and when asked for my opinion would give it, but not otherwise. Husband and I decided to give them a gift of cash they could use whatever way they chose (wedding, trip, whatever), and I would stay the heck out of my daughter's way. And darn it if that didn't work out just fine for all of us. Weddings can have weird effects on people. Deep breaths and it's their upset, not yours.
Help, I need to fire my parents
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,

We've had terrible luck with daycares and ended up without coverage for my 20-month-old daughter, so I was thrilled when my parents agreed to care for her during the workday. They are actually not quite retired, but they each only work part-time and completely from home, so they made the case that they could alternate shifts. Seemed great.

Several weeks into the arrangement, we have come to understand that they are basically plopping her in front of the TV all day, with occasional breaks for meals and errands. This is not what we discussed. We are a no-screens-until-age-2 family, which they know, but of course I understand that you take what you get with free family babysitters. However, I think the hours upon hours of TV are way past the acceptable threshold for a toddler. I asked them to please reduce (not stop!) the TV watching and try to steer her toward play and activities, but there has been no change over the past two weeks—she's still just watching TV, enough that it pervades all of her chatter and she fusses when we won't let her do the same at home.

I don't feel I've been left a choice but to pull her from Grandcare, but I dread the hurt feelings this will cause (and the impact to our wallets). Go for it anyway?

Mental Load Backfire
QUESTION: It would be so lovely if the husband so beautifully understood and followed through.
Absent that, what does OP do? Are acceptance and resignation vs Divorce the only choices?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I think there are a lot of in-between steps, all geared toward that overdue aha moment -- certainly a few that involve couples counseling.

I also think the "acceptance and resignation" side can include some bargains with reality that push it more toward a fair deal of some kind, just not the fairness we're talking about (50-50 domestic labor split). The carriers of 99 percent can extract 99 percent of something else of value in return, especially after the kids start to launch -- they get to choose where the couple retires, for example, or get to pursue a "dream" career later in life.

Actually, a version of this alternative bargain happens all the time -- the parent who does most of the work has most of the relationship with the kids. It doesn't always work out that way, but that is one of the known outcomes.

But it's super fraught. If the one doing less is actively shirking the responsibility, and also earns more, then the one carrying the domestic weight can get unceremoniously dumped into a bad financial situation as soon as their housework and childrearing services aren't needed.

So, better option is to keep talking and documenting toward that beautiful moment of understanding and follow through. If there is zero progress and acceptance is out, then, divorce.

QUESTION: It seems your husband needs to find a caregiver for the kids for 75% of the summer. For kids aged 7 and 9, a college student or older high school student (especially if driving is critical where you live) is perfect: young, cool, probably have some fun ideas. Hubs needs to get on care.com, every neighborhood parenting social media group he can find, ping his parent-friend networks. With all of the money saved in camps, this should be do-able. For any gaps, I guess he’ll have to take personal time, or maybe trade time with other parents? This IS NOT the wife’s problem. She can HELP, but she shouldn’t need to SOLVE.

Wedding excitement
QUESTION: When I was getting married, I felt some disappointment over the fact that my mom couldn't be as involved in wedding planning as I would have liked because I live 800 miles from her.

She acknowledged that the distance was challenging and asked what I really wanted to do together (go dress shopping) and also if there were any wedding chores she could help with by phone (yes, please call the photographers on this list and tell us who is nicest!)

Maybe make that part of your conversation with your daughter, at the end of the script Carolyn suggested: "Are there specific things you would really like me to be part of during the planning process? What do you want me to prioritize?"

excited daughter, mom not so much
QUESTION: My mom was not excited when I told her I was getting married (Her exact response: "I thought you were going to grad school!" (I did go to grad school. AND I got married.) After a few months, she continued to not be excited, so I just starting making wedding plans myself. At which point, my dad took me aside and told me it was hurting mom's feelings not to be included. (Mental table flip) So I think it took a taste of not being included to change her mind. And while she never was the most enthusiastic participant (all my stress dreams were about her not getting around to doing her stuff), she did make all the bridesmaids' dresses and my veil, so she did make it clear that she loved me, even if she didn't love the wedding planning.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: 1. This is such a good story of how people can love you but be so complicated and difficult and knotted up about showing it -- thank you. (And I'm sorry.)

2. Are you sure she "change[d] her mind"? Seems possible at least that she felt the same way all along (loved you, wanted to be included) but all along was hopeless about expressing it.

Maybe your dad understood that about her, gave her time to try to figure it out for herself, then had the presence of mind to step in.
RE: Mom & Grasp of Reality Again
QUESTION: It's not new-there's been some version of this going on for at least 20 years. What it's been focused on and the specific outlet for it has been different over time and seems to shift with changes in my life circumstances (college, moving out of state, getting married, having kids), but I'd say it's overall not new or worsening. I do take your point though regarding the doctor and full workup: I have asked her to get checked out or see a psychiatrist and generally the retort is that I should see one (maybe I should, but I don't think it's a reasonable response). I guess I will just try harder to get through to her on seeing a doctor? In the meantime I find myself searching for what I did wrong to provoke this, and somewhere I know that's not what this is about but I can't help but feeling bad about it.
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: (This is in response to last week.)

Please know everywhere that you did nothing to provoke this.

And no, I would not encourage you to try hard to get through to her. It's time for you to take care of you. Not a psychiatrist, though -- a psychologist. Please talk to someone about your experience with your mother. What you describe in these two posts suggests you have been subjected to a lifetime of her gaslighting and emotional abuse. I am so sorry.

Re: camp fail
QUESTION: At this point I think the letter writer should be calling camps for last minute spaces and lining up a teen helper. I don't see the husband actually following through with this even if he agrees. Then later work on fairness. But right now it seems like an emergency situation and I sure wouldn't trusy him to come through.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Fair point. A kneecap-me-twice situation.

Also? While the goal of his Actually Getting It (tm) remains in force, the intermediate goal of figuring out what the husband can be counted on to contribute reliably is completely reasonable. People are better at doing what they are better at, care about most, or hate doing less. We're just like that.

And while there are all kinds of things wrong with giving the worst jobs to the people who are selfless about getting things done, being a purist is a great way to stay stuck. Find out what he cares about most (or gets most annoyed at having undone, like an unstocked pantry or uncut grass) and there you go, that's his full responsibility now.

Seat at the Table - Follow-UP
QUESTION: Hi - I'm the DIL in the seat at the table question. Thanks for the advice and for the reader re sponses.

What did you mean by, "FWIW: Drawing the hard line when the in-laws visit was totally within your rights to do, but you inadvertently stepped into a power struggle with them that you didn't need to have."

How did I not need to have this? If you were me you would have invited them for dinner and then been okay with everyone sitting everywhere for the next 30yrs? Or just avoided inviting them for a meal ever? That wasn't going to be possible. We invited them. I served dinner at the table and both FIL and MIL got up and sat in the living room and asked for TV trays (which we don't own for no specific reason - just don't have them).

We both asked if we could all sit at the table and FIL said no, he wasn't a kid, and I couldn't force him. So, we carried our plates to living room and watched TV as we ate.

We just haven't invited them back for a meal.

And the readers are too kind - there is no reason why they can't sit at a table. They go to friends' houses and business associates and sit at their tables. This no-table eating is what they do at their house and their other two sons families houses. I think they feel judged that we won't do it, too. FIL is definitely one who takes his role as "head of the family" seriously. In many ways, his feelings are most important.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: So, hi! Thanks for writing back. This is a useful follow up.

He sounds deeply emotionally stunted. In a manner, in fact, to which we're all becoming a little too well acquainted these days.

The answer to your question is, yes, sort of -- I would have been "okay" with *their* sitting everyhere, letting them be weird for the next 30 years. You say, "So, we carried our plates to living room and watched TV as we ate," and that's where we differ. I would have let them go sit alone, then and forever. Their choice. We'd be at the table. My house, you see.

And for future meals, yeah, the menu would get super simple and I wouldn't be the one cooking -- and I and my spouse and whoever else was there would eat at the table. The invitations to dinner would also drop in frequency, sure. But not to zero if zero gave them the satisfaction of being able to complain to their friends about me.

I'm just saying my method would be to concede as little as possible and add as little fuel as possible and exert as little effort as possible. And to show as little irritation as possible, with this as my general unspoken messaging:

If you lunatics think this is your big dramatic power play, then go ahead and eat your reheated frozen cocktail weenies in front of the TV and gloat, congratu-freakin-lations. The grownups will be in here. [tight smile]

It's not for everyone, but it's a way of opting out of an overt power struggle by identifying and claiming all winnable turf in advance.
"better at doing what they are better at"
QUESTION: No one is better at the "skill" of waking up at 6 am to refresh the browser until a summer camp slot is confirmed, then plunking down $500. There are just people who know it needs to get done and others who are insulated from that knowledge.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Of course. Please refer to my original answer.

But the conversation has moved to the, "What now -- divorce?" stage of the conversation. And for that, there are two unpleasant options: Yes, and not yet.

In the "not yet" space, there can be weeks and weeks of getting by while trying to get your exact message across.

So how are those weeks going to be spent -- more exhaustion while carrying 99 percent of the load? Or trying to rebalance the load in a way that has a better chance of being successful than the camp debacle?

That's what I was talking about.

Thank you very much.

ANSWER: 💕
Should we move to avoid daughter's stalker?
QUESTION: I’m wondering if I’m going to have to move because my 21-year-old daughter is being relentlessly stalked by her ex-boyfriend/father of her baby. He was opposed to her continuing the pregnancy and got violently abusive when she decided to have it (e.g. he rammed her car with his truck when she was 5 months pregnant and drove her into a ditch). She got a restraining order against him and doesn’t want child support or anything from him but to leave her and the baby alone. That RO hasn’t stopped him from harassing us and stalking her. His father is on the police force so they do the bare minimum when we report the violations. We keep detailed logs of all his behavior, which ranged from trying to get into the hospital when she was in labor, endless harassing calls (she blocks his number but he keeps getting new ones), banging on our door all hours of the day and night, slashing her tires, vandalizing our home, following her car home from work, the latest was him trying to break into my daughter’s room in the middle of the night. Our dog went berserk and that scared him off but it looks like he’s never going to stop. Like always, we turned over the logs to the cops and they said (like every other time) “call us if he actually does anything to her.”
I talked to my sister who lives over 400 miles away and she thinks we should leave quickly and quietly, letting no one know where we’re going except my boss who is aware of the situation. She said we can stay with her until we find a new home and jobs there. This is such a drastic step - the cost of living there is much higher and if I quit I won’t be able to collect unemployment. We can live on my savings for a while but I’m worried about selling our house remotely, and what happens if it takes me and my daughter too long to find jobs. I’m an administrative assistant and would take excellent references with me and she’s an LPN who can work in any hospital or clinic but in this economy, who knows? We’ve lived in this town since my daughter was 4 months old; my husband is buried here but I don’t know what else to do. Neither of us can take this much longer. Is moving the right thing to do?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Call 1-800-799-SAFE -- the National Domestic Violence Hotline. You concerns for your ability to support yourself are real and valid, and of course this is your home where you have ties. This is one of the many reasons the stalking is such a horror. It robs all of you of your agency, your peace of mind, your security, your home -- this is the power the ex is abusing.

But being right means squat if you-daughter-grand aren't alive. So talk to the hotline and get trained support asap to develop a plan to get your safety back in one form or another.

The police inaction is an outrage. The "actually does anything to her" is a false standard if he's committing property crimes and trespassing, which are more than enough -- I don't think one needs a law degree to 2 + 2 that one.
Chronic guilt pit
QUESTION: I am crowd sourcing the group here: What is everyone doing about the guilt pit they swallowed that sits in the pit of their stomach like a weight? What, is that not normal? Just me?

I feel guilt for moving away from my family, I feel guilty for not calling my friend more, I feel guilty for not going on that jog, I feel guilty for not paying my babysitter more, I feel guilty for not taking on that extra project at work, I feel guilty for not being 'in-the-mood' more, I feel guilty for not putting more effort into my hair, I feel guilty for not enjoying the weather UGH

Any one thing I could fix relatively quickly, but it just is feeling like a game of whack-a-mole. Knock one thing out and there are just endless more guilt pits of varying sizes!
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: By whose life instructions are you living?

That's my main question.

I for one can't be part of your crowd to answer your "guilt pit" question because I don't have the pit. I am, though, upon quick inspection, just as "guilty" as you are -- moved away from my hometown (5.5-8 hour drive, depending on traffic); crappy, out-of-touch friend (too long a rap sheet to document here); chair jockey (👋); hair tragedy (attached).

But you know what? Who gives a shirt. I loved my parents, and they knew it. If I felt guilty for leaving, then I wouldn't have moved or would have moved back -- but I didn't because my reasons for leaving were better than my reasons for staying. Are yours? If they're not, then consider moving back. (This is a walk I walked -- moved back-ish 18 years after I moved away, when circumstances changed.) And if you can't, then you can't, and it's not up to you so no guilt. It really can be that simple.

I love my friends, and they know it, and they aren't great about calling me, either. They've got stuff to do.

Yes, I sit too much. Arrest me.

And what is not to love about the free time made available by this hair.

Again -- for whom are you living? Not you, currently. That's the issue. In order of appearance, you see yourself living in service of family, friends, societal standards, your employee, your employer, your partner, societal standards again, and you're at the mercy of the passage of time. Whew.

It feels like the most flippant, heartless advice ever to tell a well-meaning stressed out person, "You need to figure out who you are," but I suspect you are in fact suffering the accumulated effects of working hard at checking what you were told were the boxes of being a good person -- without having fully reckoned with who you really are and want to be. Or why anyone's opinion of you matters.

I hope I'm wrong and you're just flat out freaking exhausted. That works, too, since you're a working parent of young kid(s) with a partner and well that's way more than enough for one person's to-do list. But it's enough for a lot of people not to need any encouragement to say "erf my hair."

So that's the arcing wire -- who/what is saying you need nice hair and muscle tone and a perfect attendance award to matter? You don't. You matter as-is.
How to be positive for teen
QUESTION: I’m having a hard time balancing my own negative feelings about the state of the U.S. and the world with trying to be a positive example for my teen. He is autistic and has depression and anxiety, and has become even more negative about everything with the new administration. I feel very negative myself and don’t know how to help my kid be more positive when I am not feeling it myself. I don’t stick my head in the sand or want us to be fake happy, but I also don’t want to think about negative stuff all the time. ALL he ever talks about is very negative stuff. He is seriously Debbie Downer. Yes, there’s a lot of awful stuff going on, and yes, feline aids is the number one killer of domestic cats, but I cannot focus on that constantly. He is in therapy and on medication, btw. As am I. I feel like I am failing him. How can I be real without projecting a feeling of hopelessness.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yes, there are objectively bad things happening right now that contribute to a sense of negativity, and yes this feeling will be heavier for a teen with autism and for a parent of a teen with autism. I won't try to fake-happy you either.

I'm reading this, though, as I look out the window on one of the more dazzling May days I've ever seen.

And this part of it all is not fake: The backdrop of the things dragging you down is a big noisy complicated world that has nature, art, music, dance, food, literature, crafts, sports, movies ... and love, and family, and humor, and about a thousand things at any given time that can break your heart with their beauty.

So I don't know. Maybe it will feel "fake" to drag yourself outside to look at a beautiful thing, like a crescent moon or a cityscape or a museum exhibit. Or to put on music in your home that you can sing along to, if your son isn't noise-sensitive. Or to put a game on TV and start following a team he likes. Or to make yourselves get in the car to go to a store to buy the ingredients or materials for a meal or a project you can work on together. Or go to your local library to take advantage of the progamming, classes, materials there. Or start doing yoga with him every day.

But at some point, maybe 15 or 30 minutes in, it won't feel fake anymore. Or maybe if you make a habit of it, after a day or two the practice won't feel fake anymore, and the anticipation of your walk or meal or project or music or game time will start to feel genuine.

There is a whole lot of life out there, is what I'm saying, that was there before all this and will be there after, because that's how humanity works. We over focus sometimes and forget that. I mean -- you're probably upset in part because so many of these great things are getting squeezed right now, or threatened even, I get that. But if anything now is the time to go all in and live them to show what they mean to you. So give your humanity a kick. That's the mood lift. And that's the antidote to hopelessness.
Re: Mom and reality
QUESTION: My mother blamed us for things that we didn't do (and for things that never actually happened).

My sisters and I used to "go beige," as we called it. We wouldn't challenge her or ignore her. If she said something like, "I was really offended that you went on vacation with your in-laws again, but you never have time for me," we would say, "Oh, we're sorry that you're feeling bad. Let's plan something fun we can do together." If the in-law trip never happened, we didn't address that. If she perseverated on the phone or in person, we wouldn't cut her off mid-sentence, but when she stopped for breath, we would say, "Well, you've given me something to think about, thanks. But I have to go now."

We never addressed (with her, but we did with our dad) that she needed psychiatric care, and we didn't get angry or defend ourselves.

Our mother still went into rages and made bizarre accusations, but we reminded ourselves that it had NOTHING to do with us, what we had done or done done--and that we couldn't fix it with discussions, reality, or even love.

Dementia Breaking Boundaries
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn. My father wrestled with mental health issues for most of his life that led him to be unstable and emotionally and verbally abusive. Over the past decade, I have constructed a set of boundaries that keeps him at arms length to protect myself and my young family. Recently, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, which explains why things have gotten worse over the past few years. I am trying to figure out what to do with my carefully constructed and maintained boundaries now. My brother says that our father needs us and that I need to be there with my dad, engage with him by phone and text, and just take his abuse and let it roll off me when it comes - chalking it up to the Alzheimer’s over which dad has no control. Since my father was abusive before the Alzheimer’s, I’m having a hard time giving him a free pass on his behavior even now and feel like we cannot really tell what behavior is good-ole-dad being horrible or the result of dementia. But perhaps I am ignorant and need some education about this new diagnosis and I am willing to learn. It also feels like the impact on me and my family is the same, regardless of the cause of the abusive behavior. Having my father send me texts where he calls me a good for nothing piece of garbage hurts today just as these actions hurt 5, 10, 20, and 40+ years ago. And I do not want my wife or three children (ages 11, 13, and 16) to be exposed to someone who thinks nothing of ruining a family dinner with yelling, swearing, and name calling because there is too much butter on the vegetables in his opinion. (True story.) I do not want to be a bad son, brother, or person. But I don’t know how to be a good son while also being a good husband and father and while also keeping my own mental health in tact - under these challenging circumstances. Do I re-engage with my abusive father in service to him knowing it puts me and my family at risk? Or do I keep my guards up, protect myself and my family, and let my father and brother down in this time of need? I can’t find the middle ground here - or even any stable ground from which to approach this problem. It seems like heartbreak all around no matter what I choose.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You do not "need" to "be" anywhere or do anything. You are in charge of yourself and you make your own decisions. Your brother has no right to order you around like that.

You may decide your father's care is a responsibility you want to share with your brother, or feel you owe him, or your own sense of decency. Fine. But that's your call, not his.

You may also decide to help out at arm's length, which is valid and fair. Finding him good care, helping to pay for it as you're able, or not. Protecting yourself and family.

Here is the Alzheimer's Association. It has a help line. Lean and learn.

I'm sorry you were so badly mistreated. Don't let him anywhere near your kids.

For chronic guilt put
QUESTION: This may not apply to you at all, but it did to me - sometimes the things I felt guilty about, or the people I felt guilty about, I was actually angry with - but I turned the anger inward, because if it was something *I* did, then I was in control of it, and then I could fix it. It doesn’t apply to everything, of course, but it may be something to think about in some cases, and it’s sometimes a way to move beyond guilt and deal with what’s really bothering you - anything from unreasonable personal expectations to unfair personal expectations.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I think this is not only fair, but more common than we realize. Women especially are not "allowed" to be angry. i.e., commonly socialized away from it toward self-criticism and peacekeeping. I'd like to say this has gotten better, in that more Baby Boomer and Gen X women will identify with this than Millennial and down, but it's still pretty pervasive.

Psychiatry vs psychology
QUESTION: Why do you recommend psychologists over psychiatrists? It is true that a lot of psychiatry residency programs focus on medication rather than psychotherapy.
But not all of them—and not the best ones. Psychiatrists can be excellent psychotherapists depending on their inclination and where they trained. I think I am that kind of psychiatrist. My medical background and my expertise in medications are in the background as I do psychotherapy to be called on to rule out somatic causes for psychic distress. Also, the meds background helps me to prescribe appropriately to decrease the patient’s pain and suffering.
How do you find a psychiatrist that does psychotherapy? You ask them if they do or if they farm it out to non-medical therapists. Non-medical therapists can be good at what they do.

How do you tell if a therapist/psychologist/psychiatrist is a good choice for you?
1.) the relationship feels, on a gut level, like a good fit.
2.) Problems are on the way to being solved by 4 months.
3.) The professional understands you—on a racial/gender and background level. They should be willing to accept that your background/problems are just as severe as you say. Though, in a reversal, they may be able to point out aspects of the patient’s problems that are worse than the patient feels they are.
4.) Always, always there should be respect and acceptance.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: This is great to add to the search criteria in the caregiver search, thanks.

Homophobic Relatives
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,

In light of Everything, I am trying to get my actions in better alignment with my principles. Among other things, this means no longer tolerating bigotry of any kind from my acquaintances. If they want to be in community with me, I'm going to challenge them on it; if they don't want to change, I don't want the relationship. Even though I happen to be cis and straight, I love a lot of people who aren't, including my sister who is pan/poly and currently in a relationship with another woman. Therein lies my question. How do I handle it if my sister wants to remain on friendly terms with people I think have disrespected her horribly? Our parents are 90% of the way to acceptance, but their siblings and some older family friends are a mess.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Huh. This took a turn I wasn't expecting.

I was ready for you to ask how best to stand up for your sister.

I guess that is still the question in the broadest sense. But the reality is much more nuanced once you factor in that your sister is both on friendly terms with people you're objecting to, and not asking you to stand up for her.

Typical reality. Refusing to make things easy.

The short answer for you is to do -- keep doing -- whatever you think is right. If you don't like these relatives/friends, whether it's because their morals offend you or their politics annoy you or their conversation bores you, then keep your civil distance. That's your prerogative. If you hear them say something offensive or that you know to be untrue and harmful, then politely but firmly correct the record. Nothing new or exciting here. "That is disinformation. It's _____. I'm sorry you were misled." Or: "That is unkind and untrue." And/or: "Don't talk about _____ like that in my presence."

The longer and more interesting answer is to pay some attention to your sister. She is the one with more on the line, yet has chosen a friendly path with those who aren't respectful of who she is. Why has she made that choice, do you know? Is it a kind of Stockholm Syndrome, or is she a total badass, or ____? Have you two talked about this? If she thinks the path to progress is through converting hostile people over time with her humanity, then she might not even agree with your decision to start slamming doors.

It would be interesting to know what brought your parents to their 90 percent (presumably they started at a much lower acceptance number). Time, pressure? Did shame from the "mess" cohort slow things down? Did shame from allies speed things up? Did pressures work in combination -- the pull of your sister's grace and the push of impatience from less BS-tolerant allies like you?

Anyway. Not to get too deep into a thought exercise, which is also a risk. Sometimes you do find yourself staring down a bigot, a true believer in wiping out anything "other," and you need to be ready to declare that person dead to you. Vulnerable people don't need their stronger allies playing footsie with storm troopers.

I think all the interesting stuff is right here: "if they don't want to change." Do you trust yourself to know?

It is okay, in general, just to commit to being braver on a day-to-day basis.
How Do I handle this?
QUESTION: I've been dating a guy I really like for about 3 months. He's been separated for 4 years and is working on getting a divorce. Last night on our date, his ex-wife followed him to the restaurant and confronted him after I left and then contacted me -- with very angry and harsh words. I believe she has access to his phone text messages and some sort of app that tracks his whereabouts. How do I can handle this? I'd like to keep seeing him, but WOW ... this has never happened to me before.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Wow is right. Do you know all those specs about his separation/divorce in progress are true? That's my first thought. My second one is, I can't see dating someone who would consent to being tracked like that.

If she was just using access he didn't realize she still had, then ... okay. Easy to see how that could happen. But all of it would have to be shut down and some papers filed, frankly, before I'd venture back into the middle of that.

I.e., I would want hard proof the unfinished business is entirely on her side, not his, because one side is bad enough.
Today's column - people pleaser
QUESTION: I was the people-pleaser from today's column until a very good friend got frustrated with me and said "It's okay to have an opinion! I *want* to know what *YOU* want to do! That's why I asked you! I enjoy spending time with you, but it is EXHAUSTING to always have to pick - the restaurant, the movie, the day and time we meet - all of it. You have to take a turn, too!" and then, calmly, "I know your family and know you're used to just going along to get along, but I'm not them. You can have an opinion and a choice and input as to where we go and what we do. PLEASE speak up. Our friendship is a two-way street, okay?" - what an eye-opener!!
I'm probably a little *too* opinionated now, but I really needed to hear that it was okay to both have and state a preference.

Helping a child choose a college
QUESTION: My daughter applied to numerous colleges. Only her safety schools admitted her. She’s struggling between two similarly selective (40-50%) school, one very rural and one in a large city. She’s terribly disappointed and frozen. We’ve done the pros and cons lists. A huge health issue upset her academic Apple cart last year and torpedoed her hopes of a super selective school. We as her parents are supportive but certainly don’t want to choose. One school has offered a lot more money which does matter to some extent. Any suggestions on how to provide support here?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm sorry she's feeling so disappointed. It sounds as if she is in a pretty decent spot except by comparison to where she was hoping she would be. I know there's no cheerleading someone out of that, she is just going to have to keep moving forward until she realizes she likes where she is (or wants to transfer).

If the only way she moves forward is with a gentle shove from you, then you may, de facto, be choosing for her. It's not great but it's something.

So here are the steps I'd take in that position.

First, don't rush her. May 1, right? If she processes quietly, then her "frozen"might be thought and recovery.

Next: If there is a specific program she wants, then that of course goes to the top of the list, but as long as each has a selection then that can be secondary.

Next: The obvious is to say, "Take the money!!!" And not just because it's money!!! but there is something to be said for a school that really wants you. That's a case you can make to her that isn't a bunch of spin.

But ... agh. I'm not going to advise that. Because the difference between a rural and urban school is so huge that I think you are better off thinking hard about your kid's natural habitat -- or, if she is coming from the burbs and hasn't been in either environment, what that is likely to be. Which one is going to be right for her temperament.

Then make that case to her and say why: "You love underground art and music and I just see you in a city." Or, "You've always been drawn to quiet places." Reflect your kid back to her and see if she sees the same thing.

Last thing, an insane wild card. Does she have a seriously plugged in college counselor? Because some schools that haven't hit their numbers may take a late app.
Navigating family estrangement
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn. I cut ties with my sister about ten years ago. Sister's untreated mental illness was sucking my parents and other siblings into a spiral. The other members of my family enable my sister's disfunction, and beg me to make up with her, even if that means sweeping issues under the rug. I think I would like to be on better terms, but I want to be an enabler either. I want my sister to acknowledge the harm her behavior has caused -- something other family members don't confront explicitly. How can I keep the door open to reconciliation, but with firm boundaries? I don't want to get sucked in to an unproductive fight again.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: The way to reconcile with firm boundaries is to understand what you do and don't control, and then be very clear in your purpose for and management of the part you control.

Let's look at your list of wants and don't wants:

1. "I want my sister to acknowledge the harm her behavior has caused." That is not something you control. You control whether you ask for it, sure, but it's up to your sister whether you get it. So I caution against this, because it puts a big part of your path forward in your sister's hands.

2. "I don't want to get sucked in to an unproductive fight again." This is something you control. When you feel a fight coming on or hitting an unproductive point, then you can walk away from it. Entirely up to you.

3. "I would like to be on better terms, but I don't want to be an enabler either." This is something you control. You can make an overture to your sister to resume the relationship, carefully. You can decide beforehand what behaviors you will not enable, accept or encourage. What that means in practice is that when you are, say, subjected to abusive behavior like getting screamed at, you will not listen to it or scream back or apologize for whatever set it off. You will simply end the conversation and step away. Knowing it is a health issue, you may choose to call again at a pre-determined interval, and continue this arm's length engagement. Or you may choose to check in less often or not at all.

As for your family, you let them know you are engaging on your terms and are not seeking input on this. If they start to intrude.
Re helping a child choose a college
QUESTION: Don't forget to think creatively. Gap year? Transfer after freshman year? A child whose life has been upset by a huge health issue doesn't have to lock back in to the traditional path/timing. The options as you have presented them seem a bit narrow.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Even a child without a huge health issue does not have to lock into the traditional path/timing. Gap years and transfers are useful tools for all.

But, too, so are "safety schools." SO many people love where they go, and quickly, despite feeling meh at best about the idea the April before they go. It's a well known phenomenon.

So yes, full menu. Thanks.

Cancer dog
QUESTION: We just used the last of our savings to pay for a young and otherwise healthy dog -- our child's best, sleeping on the bed and meeting the bus with joy, buddy -- to have a cancerous tumor removed. All the signs are good and the vet believes the chances of recurrence are low. But if it comes back we _cannot_ afford to treat it again, not without taking on debt. We currently have no debt. But both adult jobs are unstable right now, and while the kids would 100% give up their extracurriculars to save the dog's life, another round of treatment would cost more than all their activities combined for a year, and I don't want to kneecap their life launch for a dog. But I'm typing this while I hold the dog and cry into his fur at the thought of killing him so my kids can what, take karate? I can't think and I'm so tired. He's such a good boy but the kids have to come first. How do I stick to my logical guns if I had to make this decision again? Husband is in the same boat as me, mentally.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Two thoughts. First, you just did this, you're stressed, tired and broke, so this is not the time to think about it. You don't have to decide now so don't.

Second, now may be the time to rethink the extracurriculars. Does everyone need all of the stuff? I mean -- I'm pro enrichment opportunities. But only if they're actually enriching, and not a reflexive signup at this point.

If you're down to no savings and the jobs are wobbly, then this seems like a great time to think about the real return on your activity investment. There's nothing wrong with being more mindful about how you do this, and seeing whether your kids' interests have evolved or come into tighter focus.

Any other cost shaving you can do elsewhere would also be good. This is the thinking to do now -- you know you may have an issue coming, so, do what you can on the money side to get ahead of it. Much better than dwelling on the dread side.
choosing a college
QUESTION: I'd recommend visiting each school--even if you were there before. We did that as my daughter was unsure, with schools that were top choices for her. A second visit showed us one was extremely quiet, even in a city, and the other, in NYC, was lively and had literally thousands of easily accessible things to do off-campus. It wasn't a choice I thought she'd make, but she still lives in NYC, years after graduation.

Mom asked "Why do you hate me?"
QUESTION: At a family gathering me and my husband were hosting, my mother got me alone and, out of nowhere, asked "why do you hate me?" I just said "what?"-I was shocked and didn't know what to say. My father came in and she moved on as if nothing happened. I don't know where this is coming from. The only thing I can think of is earlier she had asked me (again, out of nowhere) "you don't plan on selling the heirloom table you inherited, do you?" and I responded "why would you ask that?" She kept pushing until finally I gave in and said no (but I don't see why I should have to report on it, especially when there is no indication I don't want it-it's our dining room table, though I shouldn't have to justify any of this). Also, I have lately been trying to set and enforce boundaries due to past events in our relationship, like:
-I hired a photographer to take a family photo with both of our in-laws and the kids. I got enlargements made, matted, framed, and then gave them to all family members as gifts. My mother's enraged response was "how dare you-you edited the photo to put me in the back!" I did not. In fact, during the photo shoot she refused to stand in the natural position with my father opposite the in-laws and instead insisted on moving to the back.
-For our anniversary, my husband and I hired a babysitter so we could go out to have a nice dinner to ourselves. Going out just the two of us is something we have done only 3 times since our 1st was born 7 years ago. When my mother learned of this, she accused me and my husband of being bad parents. I may have overreacted, but when she said that I asked her to leave.
-My mother has repeatedly insisted incorrectly that we have somehow secretly been spending time and taking trips with my husband's parents. We have not (and though she poses it in an accusatory way, I'm not sure what her point is-if we want to take trips with someone, so what). Again, this is out of nowhere and triggered by ?.
-Every year a day before my mother's birthday, she posts on social media "my birthday's tomorrow: we'll see if my daughter remembers this year" or similar. I have never forgotten her birthday and always have a card and gifts on that day (unlike her who remembers the birthday itself but always sends cards late).
There are more... and never any apology. But that's just backstory to my real questions: how should I have responded in the moment to her asking "why do you hate me" and should I still respond now, after the fact?

ANSWER: Is this new or worsening behavior, or has she always been like this? Because to this layperson, these examples suggest a rather weak grasp of reality. The place to start is with your dad. "I am really concerned about Mom. She is increasingly paranoid and saying things that have no connection to reality." Then hope he's not covering for her. Time for a trip to her doctor, full workup and truth-telling.
Protecting my kids is most key right?
QUESTION: My cousin, 17 years older than I, has been convicted of sexual abuse to his young teen daughter. My immediate family are deeply, completely certain he’s been wronged and it’s a vendetta of his ex.

This man chased me as a small child for hugs and kisses - even when screaming in terror. I reminded my family - they told me it was harmless and to stop being dramatic.

We live in a different country but have long calls each week. My gut tells me I need to pull away and with my kids as this attitude is so wrong to me - whoever is right a child is clearly hurt here. but I’m hesitant in case I’m overreacting. I could do with some perspective please

ANSWER: Trust your experience. You lived it, you knew something was wrong.

And when you spoke up recently, they could have said, "That must be an awful memory for you. We don't think the incidents are related, but if you need to sit this one out, we will understand." Instead, they told you to stop being dramatic.

So, yes. Protect your kids.
published letter about asking DIL for travel plans
QUESTION: Hi, Carolyn. I missed the live chat where the son's mother posted about asking DIL for the family travel plans so I read it 'new' this week in the paper. Completely agree with your answer. But I wondered on the face of it why the mother-in-law thinks travel plans/planning is 'women's work'? If she wants to know the plans (and she doesn't need to) why not ask HER SON??? She wrote about how this is common among her 'mom friends'. Again, only women do family travel planning? Sheesh.

I also learned from many people that it would have been "so easy" for the DIL to just give the flight information. A lot of them, possibly all, heard back from me that it would have been just as "so easy" for the mom to ask her son for it.

In other words, I'm with you kind of people.

Apparently I also need therapy for my anger issues with my parents, because I never gave them my flight information. [Read the column here.]
Political differences
QUESTION: After much effort to build a close relationship with my dad despite geographical distance, the U.S.'s political chaos has revealed a huge wedge between us. His rule is that my siblings and I cannot discuss politics when we are together (because we are intractably opposed), but now when he and I speak on a call and I provide my perspective on an item of news he disagrees with, it's like the call has suddenly dropped. He just...doesn't engage. I feel like our relationship is becoming superficial and emotionally dishonest because we can't discuss reality. I'm not sure of my question exactly but I'm feeling loneliness in a relationship that used to provide me great comfort.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I think a ton of people are going through a version of this. It's anecdotal, but I'm seeing a lot of questions from people in mismatched coping pairs: The ones who want to process it all are coming home to the ones who want to live in a complete news blackout, and no one feels understood.

I don't think the wall you've hit is the end of it all with your dad, though. It's just a wall on the politics path. There are so many other conversational places to go.

The problem is, The Chaos (tm) means the others aren't front of mind -- and you're having these conversations by phone, so it's not like you can putter around your kitchen for a while in companionable silence until a new topic bubbles up.

So ... I'm going to suggest something that feels really artificial, but is so only in cutting out that gap time you don't have the luxury of allowing to elapse naturally. During the course of your days, any time you think of your dad, write down whatever topic you have in mind to run by him. Talk to your notes app, whatever. Even a couple of items will give you a pivot for when he disengages. It's something you had in mind, right? So it's valid -- it's just a little memory jog.

Try it, see if there's enough reality to discuss of other varieties to restore your faith in your relationship.
A seat at the table
QUESTION: My in-laws do not sit at the table to eat. Whether it is just MIL and FIL at home or the entire extended family, food is placed on the counter and people self serve and sit all over the house - some in front of the TV, others in the living room or porch looking at phones. When at their houses, I go with the flow. In our house, I want to sit at the table unless it is something like a cookout or superbowl. This was such a concern of mine that I raised it with my husband while dating and we agreed to sit at the table. We are living together now (married) and when his parents come over, they refuse to sit at the table. His dad, in particular, says he's not a child and I can't force him. So now we are in a bit of a stalemate. I don't want to have them over for a meal if it means working hard to prepare a meal only to sit scattered in our house and not talking. MIL is telling everyone in the family that I won't have them over for a meal. They like to play bingo and take their dog to the park for long walks. My husband has asked if we can join them to do these things or go to a restaurant and MIL refuses (because she knows why we are asking to do these things...avoiding meals at our house). I waffle between thinking I'm being obnoxious and should give up to thinking my MIL/FIL are really being bullies. My husband is supporting me but frustrated, too. He asked me to write you. So I am and hoping you've got ideas for me.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whoo. Good luck with these two.

Couple of things.

1. Tell your husband thanks.

2. Also tell him I'm really sorry, because his dad is such a child. He really said, "You can't force me"?

3. You (OP) already "won" a while ago. You both did. You are a gently united front against this bizarre tantrum his parents are having.

FWIW: Drawing the hard line when the in-laws visit was totally within your rights to do, but you inadvertently stepped into a power struggle with them that you didn't need to have. That was unfortunate. If time travel ever becomes available, then do take advantage by not picking this battle next time. Plus they sound like wonderful people not to have across from you at the table.

3. I used "" up there because the only victory is a happy, harmonious and loving marriage, even if each of you eats standing up in a different closet. So please work this out with your husband -- how would you like to deal with his lunatic parents, so that you both can breathe freely and not think about this ridiculous standoff ever again? That is the entirety of the answer.

4. Your MIL/FIL are really being bullies. There is no reason to concede anything except that the whole thing is so insane. But if you want it, you have room: You say, "I don't want to have them over for a meal if it means working hard to prepare a meal only to sit scattered in our house and not talking." So if they want to come live by their rules in your home, then can bring the food.

But really, I am throwing that out there because I look for possible solutions. If I were the person living with this, then I would hope my husband was talking to his parents separately in a "You have one shot at this, is this really the best you've got? Trashing us to your friends? Refusing &^%$! bingo?" conversation. After which they get told they know where to find him once they get their heads out of [places].

Margo
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, I was excited and surprised to see my letter run today about my MIL "Margo." You wanted to know how her judgments were making their way to me and about the "third parties" I mentioned—it's not as nefarious as it might have sounded like. The main third party is my husband's younger sister. I can tell you exactly how it happened. My SIL has her own (open) frictions with Margo and was venting to my husband and me about her worries that it will get worse whenever she has a child. I commented that Margo has been great as a grandmother, and my SIL responded "Yes, but then she cries all the way home because (whatever the most recent thing was)!" This opened a sort of floodgate, and also a couple of bystanders overheard and chimed in. So this is how the third parties became involved—generally everyone is discreet and I don't really consider SIL to have broken her mom's confidence (though I can see where some would).

So that is why it's tricky. No one has done anything wrong. But I don't like to think about making Margo cry, even in secret.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ah. Okay! That is good news. I can totally see that kind of floodgate-share happening organically.

But ... ehhhhh I should just be happy and leave this at, "No one has done anything wrong."

But ... I feel like I'm on a fault-finding mission.

But ... Margo is doing something wrong!!! There, I said it.

Whoo. Wrong in being sooo wound up and judging sooo hard. No? I mean, are you being that controversial as parents, to make your kids' grandmother cry? That she has her own daughter worried about ever becoming a parent is telling.

Anyway. It's a lovely sentiment that you want Margo to be okay and/or to be okay with you. It remains lovely that she at least tries to do all her most ferocious judging in private.

If others' experience is any guide, then Margo will cry less with time. No guarantees of course. But the parents of littles seem to get the worst of it. Not sure whether the grandparents eventually warm to the parents, warm to how the kids are turning out or just lose their will to fight it all so hard.
Re: political differences
QUESTION: It seems like OP’s dad set a boundary about not discussing political stuff, but OP still wants to bring up “news” he disagrees with and is surprised he disengages.

We have friends on the other side of the conversation. I firmly set boundaries that I’m not debating the latest news they’ve heard from their sources. I tell them they will not convince me of their “facts” and I won’t convince them of anything, so let’s move on to the things we have in common. If they wouldn’t let it go, we wouldn’t be talking at all anymore.

It might be more difficult with a parent if you want a relationship, but feel there is nothing meaningful left in common for you to discuss. Maybe reminiscing about childhood / family would be that thing. But, really, if he wants to avoid the conflict of endless discussions of politics, I think it’s worth respecting his request.
Feeling like a failure
QUESTION: Is it just a normal part of adult (or mom) life to constantly feel like you're failing at basically everything, or is that just depression? I can't figure out if what I feel is a normal reaction to societal pressure to be an impossible level of the perfect mom/wife/employee/other, or if it's just depression raising its stupid and ugly head.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Certainly you want to go through the steps of treating it as depression, because if it is (and it sure sounds as if it could be), then you don't want to leave it untreated.

As you have the medical side in progress, you can also have the nonmedical side going too, since those best practices are similar:

1. Tell societal pressure to erf off. It is not a contest, or a race, or a reality show. Praise dogs. Wouldn't it be awful if it were?

2. Streamline whatever you can streamline. When I'm in a state of unraveling, I sit down with a yellow pad and a Sharpie and dump out everything, all the stressful pieces, then cut it down to the have-tos.

3. Give yourself grace, breaks, forgiveness, belly laughs, deep breathing (box breathing is great), a serious reality check -- whatever it is you need or have closest at hand. The reality check is that perfection doesn't exist, for one, and that the closer people get to achieving it, the less likable they tend to be. K? So.

4. Eat nutritiously, exercise regularly, sleep on a schedule, and tend to other habits that help counteract depression.

This is about anxiety, but so much of the conversation applies to depression too. Specifically, it covers why it can be tempting to push back against "take a walk"-type advice but taking a walk is still good advice.

Anyway. Also, both are "normal" -- overwhelm and depression. Not a failure, and nothing stupid about it. Take care.

Safety School
QUESTION: ...is just a lousy term. All it does it set your kid up to feel like they're settling. YES, absolutely apply to schools with a higher chance of acceptance because no one wants to get stuck without a chair when the music stops. NO, don't inhabit the idea that anywhere you apply is "lesser". If you think it's no good, don't even bother applying.

ANSWER: Yes, so glad you brought this up. The kids know, of course, whatever term anyone uses. BUT, there is no need to scream it with the language. My kids' school used "reach, target and likely" as the three labels for their chances of admission. That did help. Plus, the counselors absolutely drove home your main point, not to apply if they wouldn't want to go. Choosing the "likelies" was some of the hardest thinking they had to do.

I get it, sometimes there is no better answer than walking away.

How about workarounds that don't involve cleaning, setting tables, shopping and cooking grown-up menus? Just bare-bones outdoor cookouts. Dessert-only evenings at the card table. Finger food while watching a TV sports event or movie you all agree to watch. Anything except real sit-down meals. And only if your husband will draw a bright line on them trashing you to the family.

For in-laws who refuse to sit
QUESTION: Personally, I would look for the solution that amused me the most, and I think it would be pretty hilarious to invite in-laws to dinner, set the table (elaborately would be even better), serve the food at the table, but say nothing if the in-laws took their plates and departed. You and your husband could stay at the table and eat as if nothing was happening and in-laws could wander around. What I would NOT do is serve from the kitchen. Make them come to the table to fill their plates then do whatever they like. Better yet, invite other people and have everyone at the table but them.

QUESTION: As someone who also had a big health issue happen in high school is is now 10 years out from finishing my graduate work. I would consider this when making a choice about what school to go to. What resources will she have for her health? What physical and mental health resources will she need/possibly need going forward? I have needed to consider this due to my health. I know as someone young it is not what she would want to think about. But as mom, it might be helpful for you to look into.
Sit down dinners
QUESTION: agree the in laws are being childish. And also want to add, i had a medical condition once that was invisible and made sitting on a hard surface painful. I carried a donut cushion with me, but lots of folks are embarrassed to do something like that. Maybe FIL is in that category? It’s a possible explanation, not an excuse for his petulant, rude behavior.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Right? So, might need a donut (sorry bout that) ... I was thinking about a back issue, or restless leg.

But sheesh, tell your kid! Or be as vain as you want and hide it from everyone, but don't be rude.

Cancer dog
QUESTION: I keep a separate savings account just for the dog. I pay a manageable amount into it monthly like a bill. I've been paying into it for all of his life. When my dog got cancer, I had enough to cover the entire bill. Maybe you don't have enough to spare to do that and I get that. But I find that treating it like a bill keeps me consistent.
Flight info straw that broke the camel’s back?
QUESTION: The DIL suggesting therapy to the MIL asking for flight info to me says there is more to the story and that the MIL has other anxiety-based behaviors that she failed to mention. I grew up with an anxious mother who told me not to cross my legs in the passenger front seat of the car because if we were in an accident my legs would be horribly mangled. It is exhausting to deal with. So maybe asking for the flight info was the straw that broke the camel’s back.

ANSWER: That was my impression for sure. And wow, that example you gave. I didn't have an anxious mom but I have been anxious-mom-adjacent, and that has the exhaustion of truth to it. I'm sorry.
In laws at the table
QUESTION: I wonder if one or both of the in-laws suffers from misphonia- a condition where certain sounds are literally intolerable (like chewing sounds)? While this is in no way an excuse for such rude behavior, it could be an explanation and a way in to come to a more amicable arrangement. I know that the sounds of chewing drive me into a panic and I have to do anything necessary to get away from it- again, not an excuse for a tantrum! But I do use this knowledge to either guide my choices of interactions with others, whether it’s suggesting other activities than a quiet dinner (uuuuhghhhhh) or quietly discussing alternate arrangements if at family gatherings.

QUESTION: I’m going to take issue with the premise that we’re seeing people at “their worst” in Carolyn’s columns or chats. I think, instead, we’re seeing people struggling to do their best, and see the best, in a world that can be incomprehensible, filled with people doing the impossible or inconceivable - what Zorba called the “full catastrophe” that is life, and striving to do better, love better, and hold on to hope.

Emotional turmoil
QUESTION: How do I stop hiding things from my husband and my family? I walk around terrified all the time. I always think I have to handle everything myself, that I can never ask for help. But then I end up not dealing with things in the best way sometimes and I get in trouble. I am trying to fix everything, but I am drowning. I'm sick to my stomach all the time, I can't sleep, and I think about running away a lot. I'm so scared I can't breathe. And I don't know what to do. Everyone expects me to take care of everything all the time - my job supports everyone, I pay all the bills. I take care of everyone but no one takes care of me. I don't know how to break out of this circle of hell.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm going to give you this first: It's information for the Crisis Text Line, 741741. It's an immediate place to get help when you're terrified and thinking you can't ask for help. You can. It's right there.

Of a similar nature, if you want to talk, is the 988 Lifeline, though you can also text or chat with this service as well. Use it, please.

As I'm sure you understand on some level, what you're doing is not sustainable because it wouldn't be for anyone -- meaning, it's not your fault or your failure. People just can't carry everyone and everything indefinitely without support. But the thing is, the longer you put off getting help, the more help you will end up needing.

That's why I urge you please to interrupt this cycle asap. Use these free resources. Therapy is where all roads lead in your scenario, but that can be hard to find, arrange, pay for and make time for privately -- so here's a possible shortcut, also a free resource. Even better would be if your employer offers an EAP, which could get you some counseling sessions right away. Let the focus of these first couple of steps be very narrow, just on getting someone to help you take the bigger steps. Take care. Check back in too if you can, if it's not another burden to deal with.

Tired of being Google for my Husband
QUESTION: Something snapped in me the other day when I realized my husband of 30 years tends to use me as Google instead of doing the research himself. "You want to hire this contractor, is there a better one?", "What are we going to go and what are we going to do on vacation?", "Where should we go to dinner?" and even better "what should I do after I retire?" On the one hand, I appreciate he is asking my opinion, on the other my opinions are most often then rejected out of hand or I am inundated with follow up questions about WHY I made a particular choice or know a particular fact with requests for followup reasoning. Maybe it's analysis paralysis, but I'd just like him to switch shoes and do some research and make a decision! How do I maintain my cool now that I bristle every time we have an exchange like this.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You keep your cool by recognizing that you both pitched into this dynamic for a long time without noticing either your contribution or what you were creating.

And you recognize that if he were the one who had the sudden snap of unpleasant recognition, not you, then you would feel awful if he went from being his normal self to bristling and losing his cool at you without explanation, when for all you knew everything was the same between you as it was yesterday.

I'm not saying you aren't right to be annoyed about some/many/most/all of the things that now annoy you. My point is separate from justification. It's about the fact of long relationships and, in your case, 30 years of slowly building something together. Even if you didn't take active part and just contributed passively with your consent.

If you're going to pivot, then say so, and say why. And the less irritated you can sound about it, the better -- again, because that's what you'd want if your husband were the one abruptly waking up to his unhappiness. Ideally you want to make this a joint project toward a better quality of life together.

Just to give you an idea of what I'm thinking: The nuisance behaviors of his that you describe could stem from habits both of you have developed over the years. If, for example, you've always done the research on X or Y for both of you, year after year by default, then his abilities in that area may have atrophied without either of you realizing it, and now you're tired of always having to research X and Y and he's a weird combination of helpless at it and annoyed he has no agency. Again, just a riff.

The answer is not to be annoyed with each other. It's to say, huh, we let this slide to a place neither of us seems to want, let's try to correct it.
Forgotten grandchildren’s birthday
QUESTION: My mother in law is a sweet, quiet woman who has begun to have some memory issues. We live far from her and see her once or twice a year. For the last two years, she has forgotten my twin son’s birthdays (they are 10). My kids don’t need gifts but it makes me sad that they don’t even hear from her . I know if she realized she had forgotten she would be sad and embarrassed. Should I say anything to her? Or just let it lie?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Contact her before the birthday every year (and before every other milestone she would want to mark) to "help" her "figure out what they'd like." It's the kind thing for all involved.

If she has already missed it this year, then, sure, let it lie -- because you're the one who's sad, right? If the boys are sad, then put them in touch ... but regularly, not just for their birthdays, because, really, who cares about a birthday. The point is for them to have a relationship with their grandmother, isn't it?

I don't know. Seems to me the issue is not where's-the-once-a-year-contact-for-my-children-on-an-arbitrary-day, but how can I make sure this sweet, quiet woman who raised my spouse (now living far away from her) isn't completely detached from her child's family as she slips into memory loss?

If she is the one holding herself apart, then I'll merge safely back into my lane, but "sad and embarrassed" suggest she does care about staying in touch.

Why do some women only wear a wedding band?
QUESTION: Women usually want a nice expensive ring, when someone proposes to them. I have noticed that after being married for a long time, some women only wear wedding bands? Do you have any idea why?
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: Because big rings (and little rings, and any rings with stones) catch on things. A lot of times I don't even wear a band. They catch on things, too.
LW Somebody that I used to know
QUESTION: Earlier this week you had a letter from somebody who, when she runs into her ex-fiance professionally pretends not to know him. The ex has called her out and wants her to knock it off. You do, too, and I think you were too harsh. Her little game of pretending never to have met him when a work acquaintance tries to introduce them is petty af and I am here for it! Not that long ago it was accepted etiquette that divorced people were considered permanently estranged and need not recognize or acknowledge one another if they met socially. It's taking it a bit far to pretend never to have met him, but it is less awkward for the person trying to be polite by introducing them than an icy "we've met" or God forbid the actual truth. Maybe it would be healthier for her to get beyond it, but in the meantime her behavior is merely annoying to the ex (to whom she owes nothing) and neither impolite not truly hurtful. Hurtful is leaving someone at the altar and then expecting them to be okay with it.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I agree with you on one point -- that the LW's charade is "not truly hurtful." Certainly not on the level of walking away from an engagement.

But that's it.

Because I maintain that, while doing so clearly causes pain, walking away from an engagement is the right and brave thing to do if the idea of going through with marriage doesn't feel right. Because that half-hearted, "It would hurt her too much not to follow through" marriage will cause so much more pain over time. So I will not jump on any bandwagon to vilify someone who pulls the plug on an engagement.

Ideally people will face down their conflicted feelings sooner rather than right at the edge of the aisle runner. But even leaving someone at the literal altar is better than going through with a wedding with doubts.

So I'm supposed to cheer on a, what, decade-long campaign of pettiness because it supposedly gives a guy what he richly deserves? No. No no no. It perpetuates that whole terrible "he's the villain" mind set that actually pressures some couples to go through with marriages they really shouldn't.

I wish LW hadn't been hurt. I wish for LW's sake that the fiance, as I said, had come to terms with his doubts way sooner. But that's not how things always play out, and sometimes things end messy.

When they do, our best response is to have the tears and/or the fury and/or the dissection of recent history to see what signs we may have missed that this was coming, then square up and say to ourselves, "You know what? I wish it hadn't ended messy but thank the merciful dogs it ended before we got married." Then regroup, then rebuild, then say when you see your ex at a business conference, ice-free!, "Yes, we've met. You're looking well." Because you can say that, because you've recovered -- or at least you grasp that sounding as if you've recovered seamlessly is really, if this is what we're doing here, the pettiest play of them all.

QUESTION: Are many teenagers sullen, messy, and completely annoyed by everything the parent says? Just feeling like I am the only parent right now....
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Did you miss every teen movie and book ever? And your own 12-17-ish?

Sorry, I still have some adolescent in me I guess.

People that age are a roiling mess of self-doubt and feelings and huge new thoughts and they take it out hardest on the ones they trust most to love them through anything and not abandon them. So, you. Plus you annoy them so much you make their cells vibrate with annoyance when you're within two rooms of them. It's not personal.

And it's not only not just you, it's pretty much everyone in your spot at some point.

Be present but not up in their business unless you have to. Be open to talking when the need to talk strikes them, even if it's midnight. The better you are at not taking it personally, the better you will be at the availability part. Getting defensive tends to escalate things needlessly. Last unsolicited thing, "don't take it personally" is not the same thing as being a doormat. Good luck!
Re: tired of being google
QUESTION: Just something to consider. My ex-husband and I had a similar dynamic. At one point we did have a conversation in which he pointed out that I tend to be controlling and often dismissive of his ideas. It was a real eye opener for me as I could, in hindsight, see this behavior in myself. He also had a tendency to not speak up for himself. The combination resulted in a lot of hurt feelings. Once we examined the dynamic it was easier for me to spot when I was being dismissive and I could stop myself, or at least apologize and be a better listener.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Great stuff, thank you. It's so hard to do a self-inventory like this.

I appreciate the example, too, because it's easy to see how this could develop into a lopsided situation over the years without either of you realizing it, like in the OP's case. Years of dismissing his ideas in favor of yours turns into his not offering any ideas at all anymore, and you're doing everything, and ... there you go.

Took guts for both of you to be honest.

QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, I was let go from my dream job at NIH as part of the so-called April Fool's Massacre. I loved our mission, my projects, and my colleagues. Now all that has been torn away and I'm on the outside, looking in. My friends have been amazing, so supportive it just blows me away. My family, not so much. (MAGA really is a cult.) But I have a lot to be grateful for, including severance pay, which I realize those in private industry don't always get. What I'm struggling with is just how passive I've been. I always thought when I reached retirement or otherwise had a block of free time I would do amazing things with it. Instead, I pretty much just... Sleep. And time is ticking by, along with my life. I'm already on medication and working with a counselor for depression and anxiety. How do I get out of this funk and do something instead of just stagnating and wasting the time I do have to try to find work or at least do all those projects I'd dreamed of? Obviously my job was just an excuse before. I have no motivation or ambition. Advice and strategies welcome! Thank you for your light during this dark time for our country.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: First, I am so sorry this is the way your country thanked you for your work. Even if this were about saving taxpayers money, which it never seemed to be, since there were such obviously better ways to do it, and even if it were actually saving taxpayers money, which it pretty glaringly is not, this is just a despicable and inhumane way to go about it and I am horrified it is being done in my name as a taxpayer. Rage.

Second: Whoa, slow down. Barely a week so far is "ticking by" since this all went down. You went through a wringer of uncertainty for months before that, no? Then very abruptly showed up to your new reality. Meanwhile, people who retire or just leave a job with agency (!) and the usual preparation time typically find themselves sleeping a lot and drifting in that big open sea of unstructured days.

So, please be kinder to yourself and more forgiving. Allow yourself some extra sleep. Let the work with the counselor unfold. Let your dreams reconstitute.

The one thing I will say is not to allow yourself too much extra sleep, because that can be a trap. It's a depression accelerator.

And I will also suggest that you spend some of this recovery time outside, walking, if you're able. It can be a surprisingly therapeutic but still unstructured use of your newly free time. Plus if you live near the NIH mothership then you're in the peak moment of earth's renewal, which is a well-timed bit of counterprogramming.

15 year old LW with college and career plans???
QUESTION: Carolyn, the LW this week who is a 15-year old planing on being a vet and going to college in the UK… left me with my jaw on the floor as the parent of 14-year old twins. Are 15 year olds planning their college years already? Do they really know (like actually) what they want to be “when they grow up” with such specificity? My kids are pretty good students, play sports, hang with their friends… and could not tell you what they want to do as a career or even name a college (unless it’s sports related). Am I way behind all the other parents and their ambitious kids in getting mine focused on college and career in their early teens?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ack, no, please don't take that message way from the column!!

A couple of things to keep in mind. First, the obvious, but reminders never hurt: People have their own developmental pace.

That means some 15-year-olds are thinking college and do have a career goal taking shape. And good for them! That doesn't mean there's something wrong with other kids that age who haven't progressed to that point. (I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life till I was 30.)

What is wrong is when kids push themselves to have it all figured out by X point because they think they're supposed to, and burn their best exploration years checking boxes for the college-admissions chase and/or for a major and career path they think will have a high ROI. What a waste. Worse is when their parents push it on them.

The best thing you can do in this situation is love your kids and give them room to figure it out. If one or both of them catches onto a passion or ambition, then, great -- follow their lead in feeding it. If neither does, then instead of panicking, be grateful for how long that keeps the window of wider exploration open. Both outcomes have their advantages.

It's important not to get sucked into the zero-sum thinking -- that because there are kids like this one, your kids will get squeezed out. There are places for all the kids who want educations.
Re: Forgetful Grandma
QUESTION: Also, you can facilitate your kids reaching out to their grandmother on their birthday, too. It was not until I became a mother myself that I fully realized that my birthday was actually pretty big day for my mom. (I mean, she did a lot of work that day and I don’t even remember it!) So if grandma forgets to call, go ahead and call her! Be warm and wonderful and do a video call if she can work that technology - “Hi Nana! It’s Sally’s birthday and we wanted to give you a call to say we love you on this special day!” No reason to put the pressure on your MIL in cognitive decline to do something that can easily do with the same result.

rings
QUESTION: hoo boy: "Women usually want a nice expensive ring..." Maybe broaden your circle and your thinking a bit. Sure, some women want a big ring, some *men* want to give a big ring for their own ego, and some women don't give a hoot about a ring and just want to plan a future with their beloved.
What women "usually want"
QUESTION: I'm sure there are many women who want a nice expensive engagement ring. But among my cohort, I don't know a single such woman. When they got engaged, they wanted a ring that felt meaningful, whether it was their fiance's mother's ring, or a non-diamond ring from an antique store, or a diamond ring they chose together that suited their style and budget. There is no "women usually want." There is only what individual women want.
Wanting an expensive ring and wearing it
QUESTION: Hm, if you're wondering why you bought an expensive ring that isn't getting worn, then ask your person. If it's anyone else, not your business.
I almost never wear my INexpensive engagement ring, that I helped shop for because 1) not a huge jewelry person 2) it's not attached to my wedding band and that's awkward but if it were attached 3) it would catch on things, get dirtier and be harder to clean, etc.
4) sometimes I don't feel like wearing my band, either.
BUT you made a number of assumptions, too. 1) that folks want expensive rings AND asked for them 2) that they even HAVE an engagement ring.
Again, check your assumptions with the only person who matters here- yours.
Mad at friend; who's at fault?
QUESTION: (online only) Hi. I asked a friend to put me in touch with her adult child for a personal project I'm excited about. She said child is busy. I said "Four minutes, literally. Any of these days/eves/weekend days. People tell me they're happy to share a sentence or two." She just stared and said nothing at all when I asked her to let me know, and we haven't spoken in a week.
She probably thinks I was pushy. Maybe. She knows her child could add something helpful, but if she didn't want to pass along the message, she could have said she didn't want to be a go-between. Fair enough. Instead she clammed up and never responded, which I see as rude. And dropping the rope of conversation is a hostile act. Can I get your perspective?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm going with: both. But mostly you. There's no "maybe," you were pushy AF. You knew it was a hint and you didn't take it because you wanted what you wanted when you wanted it. "People tell me they're happy to share a sentence or two"!?

Yes, you were excited, and she could have said, "I'd prefer not to be a go-between." That would have been preferable to going silent on you, for sure. But she ended up there because oh wow you pushed. So apologize to her for pushing. (And don't expect anything in return, because an apology just to get one back isn't an apology.)
Forgotten birthday
QUESTION: Good advice regarding advance reminder. But if this is a woman who always remembered without fail, then take it as a warning sign that things will degrade from here. Take it from someone who has gone through this with two beloved family members within the last couple of years. Assuming this relationship is important, not just to your kids, but to you and your husband, make more time for it. Increase contact, increase visits. Make memories while you can.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I don't think there's an "if." There are signs of memory loss, so that is the warning sign that things will degrade from here. Unless the spouse intends to have zero involvement in the mother's future life and care plans (which would be pretty unusual), this couple needs to look down that road now and start preparing.
Snide sister
QUESTION: Today's question about the snide sister constantly putting down her brother really hit home for me. We have a sibling like this in our family. Sibling was clearly one parent's favorite and got far more than the rest of us not only emotionally but materially. When parent did this, parent would rub it in our faces and then demand to know why we weren't happier for sib. It felt like emotional waterboarding.

Sib also feels that need to share harsh and unkind observations, and is accustomed to having the rest of us 'be the bigger person,' or 'let it go, as we were brought up to do. After getting counseling (thank you, couple of excellent therapists) I've gotten better at calling it out. Your 'wow,' and 'that was a really hurtful thing to say' help too.

A couple of years ago, though, sib accused me of something that was not only unkind but also blatantly untrue. Sib had all the evidence to know this was not true but still accused me of going behind their back and plotting to hurt them. I was deeply hurt and massively offended that sib would think I was capable of any of this, let alone fabricate that I'd actually done it.

Sib, when asked to consider the facts, provided an 'I'm sorry if I hurt you' cursory apology followed by a lot of explanation that they were under stress, so I couldn't hold it against them. Sib then whined extensively to favoring parent that I wasn't behaving warmly towards them and parent tried to extract a promise that I'd work things out with Sib. I declined to make the promise, A year ago favoring parent died.

Sib now apparently wants to have a relationship with me but says 'I don't ever want to talk about the past.' I just can't do it on those terms. I think I've forgiven sib--I understand that all the favoritism very much set them up to feel they were never wrong, and much of my anger is at parent. But I also believe forgiveness is one thing but walking back up to the person and saying 'thank you sir, please sir may I have another,' is an entirely different matter.

My rational mind knows it's fine if I believe I also have a say in any terms of reconciliation, but I can't quite get past the suspicion that I'm being horrifically unfair and unforgiving. How do I let go of the idea that it's on me to make this right when I have zero trust or affection left?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You sound remarkably clear-headed about it all, so I don't have much to add.

A few things. First, this seems right, that "all the favoritism very much set them up to feel they were never wrong"; it's been a long-running theme here that favoritism stunts the favorites. Still, some do recover, even to the point of apologizing to the unfavored siblings -- so your sib is not without agency here. You need to hold your healthy boundaries for your own reasons, but it would be a nice side benefit if smacking into them delivered a clue to your sibling.

Second, your rational mind has it right: You have a say in any terms of reconciliation. Period. "I'd be open to the possibility of a relationship, but honest discussion of the past is the only way forward for me. Let me know if you change your mind."

Third, your last sentence is the emotional garble from all the years of cluckery, so just ignore it. Here:

It's on me to make this right but I have zero trust or affection left.

It's not about responsibility or trust or affection. It's just about your sib's offer: You aren't okay with the terms. For reasons. So, you decline it, and propose the terms you would accept. Your sib is free to accept them or decline them. That's why it's really really okay to strip it down to that, without guilt.

As for when "it's time," to me the answer is, when you're asking whether it's time. Might as well go. It takes some time to set up anyway, so better to go now than when you're in full blown crisis -- and, why not take steps to feel better sooner?

When people don't have access to counseling, that might be the option they're stuck with -- knuckle through it till they can get help. But if help is available to you, then accept it.

Judgmental family
QUESTION: My daughter is getting married soon and my very judgmental family has me on edge. I am helping her with planning details etc and I find myself only looking through the lens of “what will they think “ - how can I stop worrying about their opinions which will inevitably be snarky and snotty and focus on my daughter’s happiness instead ?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: People whose opinions will "inevitably be snarky and snotty" are rude. Don't plan your daughter's joyful event around rude people.

Do you have to invite them? Seriously. That might be the ultimate wedding gift to your daughter, to show her she doesn't have to sell out her joy to unkind people just because they're related.

If for some reason you decide that's harder than it's worth, then, Plan B, do you have a good friend to help you through this? Someone fun who will actually enjoy ... shopping for rental tablecloths, and can remind you at key points that if these relatives snark at your plans then you're doing something right?

It can't be your daughter, you want to "dump out" here. A place to de-stress, have some giggles.

You do know, I hope, this decoupling from people's opinions of what you do is a bigger project than this one wedding? I mean, who gives an everloving floof what the shriek chorus thinks. The how-to-start-therapy link isn't just for anxiety, it's also for people who've been emotionally ground down to the point where they think they have to pass everyone else's tests.
Re OP recently let go from the NIH
QUESTION: First, my true condolences. I spent 5 years early in my career a5 the NIH and leaving abruptly has to be a huge blow. Second, recently retired involuntarily last summer, after 3 weeks of a trip down the coast to “just do something fun” I started and continue to begin every day by doing something, anything, productive. I built raised garden beds, played tennis, got on my bike and more. Just something to start everyday on the plus side. Right now, I have been lying on the couch in the rain, just enjoying things that I couldn’t have when working every day. Good luck

re: Reality Check
QUESTION: This part of CH answer made me howl: Plus you annoy them so much you make their cells vibrate with annoyance when you're within two rooms of them But the payoff, is when they get to their 20's and they acknowledge how unbelievably annoying THEY were to us parents! I will never forget my youngest son sitting me down and saying "Mom, thanks for never giving up on me, no matter how much of a jackass I was to you"
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Aw, yay youngest son.

This is my chance to say again that it is necessary for them to differentiate, to push off from parents so they can see who they are without their parents hovering over them. That wave of annoyance they feel for their adults is really effective and important. Their secrets are important, too. It just gets white-knuckley for parents as they hope it all stays reasonably under control ... as they resist the impulse to dive in to try to control it. Which usually makes things worse. Good times.
Re: AdRIFt
QUESTION: I’m so sorry for what you are going through! Please be kind to yourself. Many of us who haven’t even been as directly affected as you by this administration's cruelty and chaos are struggling. Furthermore, I remember what it was like for me when I retired from federal service two years ago. I planned for it; I was excited by leaving; I had a new, part-time endeavor to step into; yet I felt incredibly depressed for about 2 weeks. All that emotion and a big change was just incredibly draining. Your situation is way more jarring.

So, please heed Carolyn’s advice and get outside every day. Find one other small thing to take care of each day - clean out a closet; contact a friend (and/or other colleagues who are in a similar situation); look into volunteer opportunities; research opportunities for classes; harness those emotions in ways to help protect others - whatever. Allow yourself time to grieve, heal, recover, but don’t give up on yourself or what your new life could be. Hugs and good luck.
About sleeping too much
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,

Just had a question about your response where you said sleeping too much can be a depression accelerator. Can you say more about this? I have struggled with depression for years, and when it is bad I am just exhausted all the time and can barely function without sleeping in or taking naps. Without the extra sleep, how are you supposed to get through it?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I am going to refer you to a licensed health professional, which I am not. The caution not to sleep beyond a typical night's sleep is passed along from best practices I discussed with a doctor recently, in the specific context of things people with depression can do outside of medical treatment to ease their depression symptoms and boost the effectiveness of their treatment.

So -- medical treatment would be things like medication and therapy.

These other things included regular exercise; social interaction; attention to nutrition; regular, short (ie not overwhelming), structured attention to keeping spaces clean and uncluttered (e.g. 2 x 15 minutes a day on clearing workspace, doing laundry, basic management); connection with purposeful activities. That last one is a broad category, but covers hobbies, causes, arts, music, etc. Among these was a regular sleep schedule; sleeping in and napping were considered disruptive to the overnight sleep schedule, which contributed to nighttime restlessness and anxiety, daytime grogginess, sense of sluggishness and futility.

Again -- your care plan is personal and that's why the medical consult is your advice.

I spelled out my backing info for context. I also want to say these non-medical things are not depression cures or treatments -- there's often a conflation problem when careful life management is helpful. If anyone tries to use any of what I'm saying here as a justification not to treat depression as an illness or not to go to a doctor, or to yell at me for implying that people can exercise their depression away, or that they can't! then allow me to state here these are all willful misreadings of my point. Not cool. Thank you.
RE: AdRift
QUESTION: Structure is your friend (now and always) and when you lost your job your structure went away. I 100% agree with Carolyn that you need to be patient with yourself and keep expectations reasonable. BUT you can also use structure to help manage this. Plan lunch dates with friends, or even better, walking dates. Set small goals that are low expectation - read a book, watch a movie, or listen to music rather than get lost online. Commit to a yoga class once a week. Figure out what time of day is most productive and do an hour's worth of chores, then let the rest of the day go. Make a checklist of those chores and check off one per day. Give yourself several months of not doing anything bigger than managing your time (you can even set an end date on the calendar) and then let yourself just observe what it all feels like. This is HARD work, so be kind to yourself!
"dropping the rope of conversation is a hostile act"

Petty Ex Left at Alter
QUESTION: I feel you, Carolyn. But like this person, I suck at moving forward once someone has burned me. It’s much more natural (for me) to hold a grudge and ice people out. I don’t like this quality about myself and wish I could be more forgiving or understanding or whatever the quality is you’re channeling. How do I develop it?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: It's right there in the framing -- "burned me."

It's great that you want to develop a more forgiving and understanding mind set. The quickest path is to familiarize yourself with the "fundamental attibution error." Here's one explanation that seems to cover it, but you can plop it in your browser and read a lot more. It's basically the rationale for getting out of the victim mind set and applying the "we're all just people trying to get by" framework to other people's choices. It's quite freeing. It's nice not to think everyone is a jerk, attacking us, making us carry yet another grudge.

And it takes some practice. If your mental pathway goes right to grrr, then you'll need the mental override to, "Wait, I break up with people sometimes, and I'm not 'burning' them when I do that and I don't deserve to be iced out as if I don't exist." Or, when you get cut off in traffic, say -- instead of getting enraged, remind yourself of the handful of times you did something rude witout realizing it because you didn't understand the merge pattern or you didn't see that car in your blind spot, really! If you keep doing that, then it becomes reflex (except maybe when you're hangry and frazzled and the old reflex breaks through).

Some people will be actual jerks, sure, and acting with malice. It's not all fields of daisies.

Re: concerned about 15 year old letter writer with college plan
QUESTION: This parent’s concerns about kids being on track hit me. My son (2 years ahead of his sister) had no idea what he wanted to do for many years. His sister knew from age 10. But they both ended up on long tracks to get through their late teen years. My daughter was ill and lost two years of school. My son developed issues with alcohol / marijuana dependence. We were fortunate that both recovered. They both went to community college, then transferred to 4-yr universities and finished grad school at age 27. And, yes, she did end up studying the field she picked as a 10 year old.

This wasn’t our dream path for them. We were very tied up in helping them achieve our idea of success, until life happened and they did it on their schedule. With our support, and without us comparing them to where they “should” be.

As an aside, my son lost a brilliant friend to a fentanyl overdose and another in a car accident where my son was a passenger in another seat of the vehicle.

A promise is a promise
QUESTION: When my wife and I were dating, I told her I'd only wanted to have kids if they didn't consume my whole life and I was able to still do things that are important to me like go to the gym before work. My now-wife promised I'd be able to maintain my morning gym workouts. We have an 18mo and an infant. My wife is complaining that my days are too long. They are long. My routine includes leaving the house to get coffee, check email, workout and then work. I get back in time to kiss my 18mo before bed and then spend the rest of the night cleaning up the house and packing for the next day. My wife is complaining she is exhausted with two kids all week and needs some help. In a few months, she is returning to work for the first time since we've had kids and pushing for change from me. I'm feeling cheated and angry. How can I get her to understand that she promised and a promise is a promise is a promise?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yep, a promise is a promise.

You are you and you have your needs and you foresaw them, I do get that. But a reality like this -- how much work kids will require -- is not 100 percent foreseeable. So to enforce it as if it is, at the expense of your wife and kids, is pretty spectacularly selfish and crappy.

So. What are you ready to say about yourself, your child, your wife, your priorities and the variables of life in defending the territory you staked out with this promise?

Do you think your wife agreed to this in bad faith -- i.e., knew full well it was unrealistic to add two kids to your life without making any changes to your schedule, but expected you would change, because who doesn't change to spend more time with his kids?

If that's the case, then you need to say that to her: "I believe you entered our original promise knowing I would have to give up things that were important to me eventually, and figuring I would eventually do so willingly. And I am struggling with that right now."

Or, alternately -- if you don't think it was bad faith, just bad foresight: then you need to be willing to hire out some help to make space for the things you value, instead of expecting your wife to absorb all the extra work displaced by maintaining your routine. Or just pick your priorities and let some other things go.

Because, damn.

Don't want to give them the satisfaction
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn—

My husband and I tried for two years to conceive naturally, got nowhere, and through counseling finally learned that IVF would be our best recourse. It is not covered by our insurance, and we are not wealthy. However, my parents are affluent and comfortably retired, with low overhead and grown children who are all living independently. So I swallowed my pride and asked whether they would be willing to contribute to the out-of-pocket costs of 1-2 IVF cycles. They took months to get back to me (meanwhile remaining completely warm and chatty on unrelated topics!) and then finally said that they had decided against it, partly because they don't want to lose their financial security—but mostly because they "don't understand" IVF, feel that it's a little bit "unnatural," and vaguely believe that God would give us a baby if it were meant to be.

The hurt and disappointment I felt is hard to express here. I don't feel entitled to their money, but they have helped me and my siblings pay for other things they approved of (college, weddings, expensive grandparent gifts for my nephew).

My husband and I wound up saving aggressively for the next two years and funded our own IVF. We were successful on the first cycle and I'm 18 weeks pregnant. We have shared the news with our family and my parents are jubilant, which really irks me. My mom texts or calls every day to ask about the pregnancy and to squeal about how excited she is to have another grandchild. But I feel that she actively stood in the way of this happening or at least let us twist in the wind, and I don't want to share my joy with them. How do I forgive, without letting them have the satisfaction?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Are you up for a conversation?: "Mom, you turned down our request for financial help -- which of course was your prerogative -- saying you felt IVF was unnatural and that 'God would give us a baby if it were meant to be.' But now that we conceived through IVF with our own money, you're jubilant without any qualms. I hope you can understand why I'm having mixed feelings about your response."

Think about it. It's a fair complaint, for one. Plus, leaving it to harden into a grudge denies the whole family a chance to get past it.

But think about it -- see if time does anything to move you past it naturally. For example, if you start to see this reflects who your parents have always been, committed to their way of seeing things whether there's any integrity to it or not.
Pets
QUESTION: My husband and I are missing our elderly cats who both crossed The rainbow bridge last December. We are elderly as well and wonder whether we should just enjoy our kids’ cats and dogs from time to time. Ever since my husband developed mobility problems the litter box task was mine and was somewhat overwhelming as the cats developed issues associated with aging. Also we don’t have a fenced yard to accommodate a dog—yet! Just looking for advice about 75 year olds adding a pet to our family because we miss their company every day!
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Since I am not there to assess the situation, I can only advise that you bring 100 percent pragmatism and foresight to assessing the situation yourself to counteract any wishful thinking. Wishful thinking can be harmful to animals especially, since they are so vulnerable, but also to the humans who care for them.

Lots of things to consider, but first I wonder if your husband is still ambulatory. Someone with difficulty walking + a pet may = an increased risk of falls.

Second, because you already mentioned overwhelm with prior pet care, I would say the minimum would be to have backup care in place before taking on a pet. By that I mean both daily drop-ins from a paid dogwalker/catsitter (great job for a reliable neighborhood kid) and a backup place for the pet to go in the event the animal needs a new home.

Third, think cat, not dog, unless you're sure you can meet the exercise and socialization needs of a dog.

Possible fourth point, if you have a person in your life (adult child, neighbor, other quasi-caregiver) to whom the care of or responsibility for this animal might devolve, then talk to that person, too, as a courtesy.

Of course the easy answer is not to do it, for all the reasons, but animal companionship is so rewarding that it is worth considering if you can pre-answer all of these questions and issues -- especially if you can afford to.
Letting go of my brother due to politics
QUESTION: Is it common nowadays to completely end a relationship with an only sibling? He is 70 and I’m 65. He became more and more combative in our weekly phone conversations. (We live in different states so we only have phone visits.) I feel a little sad, but I think it’s healthier for me.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Things don't have to be permanent. The conversations are too combative, so you send the message that you won't continue to take part in them on these terms. You do that by taking a break and saying why.

You can check in again in, say, a month to see if pulling back was effective. If he brings up the same stuff and gets combative again, then you remind him you're not interested in this experience with him, you're hanging up now, you'll try again in a bit.

Repeat, once a month, see what happens. If you feel you can be healthy as you maintain this schedule, then keep at it. See if he can shift to other topics with you. If it's still too much, then try 6 weeks, then 2 months. Etc.

The "completely end" may happen, but there can be a lot of interim steps before you get there, if you want there to be. That's what I'm saying.
Divorce
QUESTION: I was married for 40 years and just filed for divorce. I was expecting to feel relief, but am just feeling sad even though I think it was the right decision. Also, a little fearful of the future. Any advice or input from anyone who has been there
And how to move forward.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: This is definitely one of those YMMV situations, but I think this part is pretty common -- that when you have been in a certain place or status for a long time, the first days of Something Else have an element of fear to them. It's just hard to envision what the new thing will be. It's kind of a big gray blank. And when we can't envision things, there's a sense of low level animal panic. In my experience at least.

The best advice I have for that is to take deep breaths and trust yourself and get through the days the best you can -- making good decisions for yourself, being your best advocate. Because the other thing that's more than common, probably universal, is that we are built to adapt. You will get used to this as your normal, and before you know it your ability to envision a future will come back to you.
Re A promise is a promise
QUESTION: Man, I was SMDH through the entire question. What you asked for, per you: going to the gym before work. What you're doing: running out of the house first thing for coffee elsewhere where you sit and quietly read email, then go work out, then go straight to work and then home? Those are not the same requests. If I were your wife, I'd be mightily upset at you, too. Can you maintain your gym workouts by then coming home afterward? Make coffee at home and take it with you to the gym so free up a little time? There are ways you can make more space for your family but failing to compromise, or believing that your children are somehow a scheduling bait-and-switch on your wife's part, is a selfish viewpoint.

Nosy or helpful neighbor
QUESTION: Our neighbor’s trash can was knocked over by wildlife a few days ago. They picked up the can but left a large mound of trash in the alley (I walk by this every day). Would I be a helpful neighbor if I picked up their trash (wearing gloves)? Or a nosy neighbor because I can see that the trash includes empty prescription bottles and other personal items? (The trash is technically in the public right-of-way in the alley. Not on their property). I don’t know them. What is the “I want to be a good person” thing to do?

Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: I can't argue with much here, nice touch of John Mellencamp.

A couple of things before I make a huge ask. First, well, maybe it's the only thing? The money hit to people like your neighbors is getting the big attention, but the flouting of due process is what I wish had been the universal Find Out from the "{redacted} around." People getting grabbed off the street by unmarked, sometimes masked law enforcement, spirited off and locked up (do I need to specify inhumanely?) only on the administration's say-so, without their presenting any case/evidence before a judge: That is the death of freedom for everyone. Especially when the judge says "You can't do that" and they don't turn the planes around. That means anyone, literally anyone, can become the next person they decide doesn't have rights because the administration welp just doesn't like what they said. We are kidding ourselves if we think people who smirk about acting with impunity toward Group A will suddenly color within the lines with their treatment of Group B. If one set of papers doesn't matter, then no one's papers matter. This is the 2 + 2 of the past few weeks. A couple of links:

Are you freaking kidding me.

Robin Givhan has a roundup here.

But I could post 20 if I had time.

Okay, here's my ask. I'm going to zero in on your "yet." Take your time and do some breathing or pillow-punching or whatever it takes, but: There can't be a "too late."

There just can't.

Anyone who "now feel[s] lied to and apologize[s]" needs to hear, "Apology accepted, thank you, welcome." That's because the cruelty is killing people, and we need a way out of the cruelty, and that means making it as easy as possibly -- appealing even -- for people to walk away from it. Which means not punishing anyone with the courage to regret voting for it.

Re Promise
QUESTION: As a family lawyer, when I hear someone casually complaining in this way, I sometimes share what a judge would think of their complaint during a divorce proceeding. And I can assure you that this “promise” has absolutely no validity. Zero. You have not a single leg to stand on, are being ridiculous, and you would get laughed out of any court in the nation. You are a grown man who fathered not one, but two children. Those children are your legal responsibility. You cannot claim that you were tricked into having these children. You cannot shirk your duty to your children because you want to go to the gym instead. You can choose to be a good or bad father, but you don’t get to choose not to be a father at this point. You either make this work with your wife and keep your family together. Or your wife will come to her senses and hire someone like me who will make you take responsibility in a court of law - with your time and/or money.

ANSWER: This is a satisfying read, thank you. But it still leaves me so sad for the kids whose dad is just so angry they exist as an obstacle to his old routine.

So, OP. Were you loved as a child? Do you know how that felt?

If you do know, then please, move heaven and earth to give your babies that same feeling. Make sure they never doubt they're loved and have that certainty to keep them warm into adulthood, even on their worst days.

If you don't know, then please move heaven and earth to make sure they don't grow up wondering, as you did, how different their lives could have been if they had been loved.

I think this is a fair offer.

Another change can be a decision not to "try" anymore to "convince him to forgive and forget." If he wants to stew in his old resentments, then let him. You can live your life breathing the clean air of forgiveness.

If he's trying to, for example, keep you from seeing friends because they're on his grudge list, then that's something else -- but you do have agency, right? You don't need him to give you permission?

Or is that the real issue, he uses his resentments to limit what the two of you do as a couple. If so, that's more than just grudge-holding. That's control, and another point in favor of your talking to a therapist yourself.

Pets
QUESTION: My 80 year old aunt solved this by adopting a 10 year old dog. They knew they'd only have the dog a short time, but also felt that was all they could commit to at their age. Also, an elderly dog is slower, less need for exercise, etc. They also felt good about adopting a dog that most likely no one else would adopt.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Thanks, I am seeing a lot of posts like this, for senior cats as well. Just one caveat that senior animals can have higher needs, too, like higher vet bills, or an older dog might have to go outside more often. Still -- better than a puppy or kitten for sure. Thanks.
Video Shorts
QUESTION: Loving the new video shorts, you're great! When I saw them for the first time before even watching them I thought "fun!" and then immediately "poor thing" because I thought I remembered that being on camera was not your favorite and assumed somebody had twisted your arm into it. How do you feel about them?
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ha, thank you for the kind words and for feeling my pain. I still do not like being on camera but I also understand that my happiness is directly proportional to my willingness to adapt.
Re: IVF
QUESTION: My mom did the same thing except it was about my husband. She didn't think I should marry him, and she hated our wedding choices, but you'd never know it now. For the last 15 years, my mom sings my husband's praises and goes on and on about how our wedding was the best wedding she'd ever been to. Both of us saw my mom for what she was doing: backtracking after she saw things were going to work out and she was terrified about not being able to see her daughter and grandchildren. She was right! My mom has never apologized or explained herself, not that it would matter if she did, even though I asked her. I can't forgive her. Give your parents a chance to explain themselves, but don't wait until the baby is born. Don't push yourself to get past it either. If you can't, you can't. No one would blame you for not letting them see your child.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whoa, wait a minute: "not that it would matter if she did"? Really?

I can see being skeptical of the just-backtracking-for-fear-I'll-never-see-my-grandchildren non-apology-apology.

But a genuine apology, to my mind, deserves to matter. If not always, then darn close to it.

Even over something stupid and bad-faith like hating your wedding choices, which is pretty much the surest way to squander a lot of parental goodwill for zero potential return. (Objections to a choice of spouse are more complicated -- still not a great idea, but heartfelt concern is at least in play there.)

Idunno. You asked her, so maybe you think this too, and you're just really (deservedly) angry?

I'm sorry she's too small a person to admit fault. Sounds like all her praise gushing is the best her ego can do.
Re. IVF
QUESTION: Would she prefer that her Mom reject her baby because it was conceived via IVF? I would take the win that your Mom is now happy.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Well, if you put it that way. But that's not the either-or. It's either the parents get on board with it when the couple are asking for needed financial support, or the parents say, when the couple conceive via IVF after two years of scraping their pennies together: "Oh, we get it now, assisted or un-, a pregnancy is joyous news of a coming grandbaby. I'm sorry we balked at helping you with IVF" ... and ideally will, say, help with other expenses, or open a college account for the baby, etc. Since the couple probably did put a hurting on their savings for this effort.
Tired of being polite
QUESTION: This has been building for years now, but I feel nearly depleted by the lack of consideration and basic manners in society. I’m forever stepping off the sidewalk so people can walk two abreast, or saying “thank you” to cashiers that literally don’t say a word to me, or waving the other person through when there’s confusion at a 4-way stop. And it feels like no one ever does any of that for me. I let the person with a few items go ahead of me at the store, or wait patiently when someone has trouble parking. No one lets me go ahead and I get honked at. I’m in my 50s and certainly not a saint, but I’m so tired of giving others consideration that’s rarely extended to me. How do I not throw up my hands and just become the type of person I resent? It sounds more appealing than being walked on all the time.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I feel you. But the alternative doesn't make much sense (except maybe with the sidewalk-stepping). Thank-yous and other kindnesses to people, especially those in service work, are never wasted. Even when not reciprocated, they are a net benefit to the system. I liken it to a 20-minute walk. Even if you're not doing it every day and getting in shape from it or making progress toward your fitness goal, you're still better for having done it than you would have been if you hadn't.

Waving people through intersections and letting people go ahead in checkout lines involve a small sacrifice from you, so carry a different benefit. I think those can actually send someone off into their day a teeny bit more optimistic about humanity. A wee smidge. So even if it's not coming back around to you, I think it's a great practice to continue, if you can remain forward-thinking enough to bear it. Maybe that person will be less angry with others a mile down the road. And that's to your credit.

The parking situation? Not stooping to impatience is purely for you. You gain nothing from honking except reducing yourself to an angry troll and knowing you inflicted more stress on the person just trying to park. So don't even think about it.

(And note to anyone out there who does this: Just freaking stop. Thank you. It never once in recorded automotive history ever made anyone park any faster, just more anxiously, at the likely expense of neighboring cars' paint jobs. Yours, at some point, if there's any cosmic justice.)

Last thing, the sidewalk: Don't step off. That's excessive deference to the entitled. Plowing through them isn't ideal, either, tempting though it may be, so I've settled on standing still to allow them to flow past. I'll post others' ideas if you send them in.

Anyway -- I hope this approach > "fork it."
Aunt in white jeans at wedding
QUESTION: I still think the aunt was issuing some kind of (bleep) you, perhaps to the couple but maybe to the whole family.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Maybe so, but the only play was to ignore it and be exactly as gracious a host to her as to everyone else.

Here's why. If she left her home thinking this was the right thing to wear, then of course the thing to do is to treat her as if she fits right in and looks lovely. Right?

If she chose her outfit as some kind of [bleep] you, then what better response than to be unfailingly gracious to her? Then she gets to feel one of two ways: 1. Nobody even noticed her big bird flip. 2. Anyone who did notice was too polished or kind (or too wily) to take her bait. It's the [bleep] you falling in a forest, with no one there to hear.

Win-win.

Another farewell
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn.

I'm not writing this with the intent of it being published in the chat, but I certainly don't mind if it is. Like numerous folks before, this is a farewell. I cancelled my subscription just before the election, and my access is coming to an end in a few days.

I kept hoping ... SOMETHING ... would happen that would make me change my mind. Instead, as the current administration has been even worse than I could have imagined even in fever dreams, the Post's ownership and editorial leadership has increasingly bent the knee to the current occupant of the people's house, who seems to want nothing so much as to punish the entire country for daring to reject him in 2020. The constant exit of bright, talented, passionate writers, hitting its peak (nadir?) with Eugene Robinson's resignation has cemented my decision.

I've not ever had a question for you, but reading your advice over the decades (!) has helped me along the way - before needing to ask them in many cases. Even before I subscribed to the Post, I followed you back in your syndicated days, and I will miss the daily dose and (especially) the holiday and wedding hoots and the weekly Ned fixes. My best to you and yours, and a fervent hope we all survive the next four years (somehow we still have almost a full four years of this ... insanity left) mostly unscathed.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Thank you for the note. I too am heartbroken to see Gene go; he is not only a great columnist, but also a remarkably decent human being. He led the Style section back in the early days of my column and his support was invaluable. Best office holiday parties ever, too.

I will also say this: Given the announced changes to the Opinion section, I expect there will be more turnover. If you had said to me before that you were looking to this part of The Post for your "SOMETHING," then I would have suggested you look instead to the news side.

That is where The Post ownership is not directing coverage. Instead, it news side is behind the same wall it has always been -- which means the owner and publisher hire top editors and then let them do their jobs.

I never know when a reader asking about the changes at The Post is aware of the difference, so I err on the side of over-explaining, because it's such an important distinction: News side is its own thing, and is covering the administration and everything else it covers under the direction of editors, not ownership. The Post's news coverage has borne this out.

On resistance
QUESTION: My New England husband had this to say about the current times "Not losing our [shiznit] and taking care of our mental health during these times is in itself an act of resistance."

Re: another farewell
QUESTION: Carolyn - thank you for explaining the news side of the house at the Post. I've been confused by people who balk that I get my updates from the Post (they don't) and it dawned on me that all they are hearing is how controlling the owners are, but haven't actually read the quite informed and facts-driven reporting. I am lucky in that as a federal employee I have access to the Post for free, and if I'm being honest, I probably wouldn't pay for a subscription on my own given the uncertainty in my job status. Here's to hoping the administration does not take this perk away from us and thank you for your wonderfully direct advice and much needed candor as the world gets a bit more insane each day.
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You're welcome, and thanks for the anecdote, because I'm never sure where my information is landing.

Here's another thing. I'll link to my colleague Erik Wemple on the fact that 3,200 newspapers have closed in the past decade. Do you know who loves this? People in power who want to get away with stuff without being held accountable. People who love low-information voters.

So as long as The Post is fighting to hold people accountable, I will support The Post. I support other news outlets, too -- the narrowing of the business is catastrophic. It is part of why we are where we are.

Also, there is great stuff coming out of the Opinion side too. Monica Hesse is a must-read. Dana Milbank was born to bring black humor to the end times. Just for two because all this linking is taking me forever. As I said, that part of the paper is in flux, but they're there now and I read every word.

Update from LW with adopted daughter
QUESTION: I saw my letter this week. Things are okay. My daughter and I went to family therapy together and worked some stuff out. It can still get a little weird between us sometimes but we accept that. My parents abstained but we accept that too. They said they were going to tell her all when she was 18 and she seems to believe them. Her bio-dad started all of this because he told his fiancee about our daughter and the fiancee wanted to meet her. He went directly to our daughter because he figured my parents would say no. He thought maybe he still had some rights since he never signed any papers but my folks sent notices to his work place and his sister's house (his last known residence) and the judge said 'good enough' and terminated his rights. Our daughter didn't want to meet his fiancee or him and that's the last we've heard from him. I think things worked out as well as can be expected
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: Thank you for this. I'm glad you and your daughter are working through the weird. In fact, that you're both committed to doing it is the best possible outcome, really.
QUESTION: UPDATE: My [24] boyfriend [25] of 3 and 1/2 years hasnt proposed and I'm starting to worry. I just want that promise.

The original link is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/50ihkx/my_24_boyfriend_25_of_3_and_12_years_hasnt/?utm_source=reddit-android)

I wanted to give an update on this post I wrote about 2 years ago. I got some great advice, I got a lot of tough love advice and some terrible advice. I know he was already committed by all of his actions and that I really needed to focus on college first before having to plan a wedding.

Well, it turned out my boyfriend at the time had been planning on proposing to me for a long time. He wanted to wait until I graduated college. A little after I graduated college, he took me on a hike. I knew this was a special hike because it was the same place we went for one of our earlier dates.

The first time we went on that date was magical. I always teased him that he never kissed me on the date. There was this perfect moment he was holding me in front of a beautiful picturesque lake as we were just enjoying each other's company in an embrace. I thought he was going to kiss me but he didn't.

I later kissed him first but always teased him that he didn't kiss me in that moment we had. He confessed he wasn't sure if I wanted to be kissed. He said he wanted to kiss me more than anything.

Well he took me back on the hike 4 years later, and when we got to that lake, he told me this is when he knew he was first in love with me. Then he got on one knee and proposed to me. I just kissed him and even forgot to say yes! So he asked, "Are you going to marry me or not?" And I said of course. We got married about a year later and we just celebrated our one year anniversary in October.

I've never been happier and I'm so excited to continue our life together!

Thank you for reading 😁

QUESTION: Update: My(M26) wife(F26) is not happy

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hm1wdi/mym26_wifef26_isnt_happy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Thank you everyone for the advice from the original post. I just wanted to give the community an update. My wife finally got back yesterday from leaving to go see her sister. We talked for a little bit yesterday, but still came to the same thing she has been telling me. She doesn’t want to be with me because she doesn’t feel in love, emotionally connected, or intimate towards me. She views me as a friend. I told her she needed to choose either we work on this and go to counseling or it’s a divorce and we cut ties. She couldn’t decide and said to give her the weekend.

This morning I woke up early, made her breakfast and brought it to her in bed. Then took her out to eat for lunch and desert trying to just spark anything to see if she would agree to work on it. Well we sat down again after getting back and she said she wanted a divorce and she was 100% on that.

It was tough. A lot of crying, sadness, hurt, and all the emotions one would feel. I ended up just going to my room and she left for the night. I decided to get out and do something so I jogged and listed to some music for a bit. It helped.

I came to the realization that we all have such little time on earth and I don’t want to waste it moping around. I want to improve myself physically, emotionally, and mentally. I want to just enjoy life and find myself again. So I’m going to do that and one day I might meet someone who is perfect to continue the journey of life with me.

So I’m still sad and hurt, but all that to say I’m moving forward and trying to be positive. Thank you all for your support.

tl;dr Wife wants a divorce. I’m trying to stay positive and move one.

ANSWER: The end of a relationship is hard but it’s also such a great opportunity for growth, self compassion, and fun. The initial part of the separation is hard but just know that you will be okay, slowly things will get better. 
You’re still so young, you’re going to find someone that’s a better match for you. Just give yourself time to grieve and take care of yourself. When my bf and I broke up I listened to “Breakup Recover Podcast” by Barbara Stevens, she’s so calming and has a way of making you feel cared for and safe. There were days where I felt like shit but I would force myself to listen to it and I never regretted it. 
Hope you find happiness within yourself soon!

Hi everyone, my last post wasnt super popular or anything but I just thought I'd update you guys anyways!

About a month ago, I went back to school a week after my dad died, and obviously the last few weeks have been super hard.

QUESTION: UPDATE : I (46F) have hurt my daughter (16F) by giving her friend(16F) a few books

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n7jcfj/i_46f_have_hurt_my_daughter_16f_by_giving_her/)  
I found the perspectives and guidance I received really helpful. I decided to just spend some time with her. She loves to bake and we baked together and we had some movie nights. her comments melted away and she became happier.

we were baking yesterday when she came out to me. I didn't make a big deal out of as I felt she didn't want me to. I just told her I loved her before continuing to bake as if nothing happened. We did have a conversation later on.

She told me that she and her friend had been together ( scary, how well kids can hide things.) Her girlfriend wanted to come out but she didn't and it had strained their relationship. It seems, they had a fight before we gave her the books to her (ex?) girlfriend and that had hurt her. Their relationship is in the limbo and she doesn't want to come out to the world right now. My husband ordered a small pride flag to keep in her room. The world is a bit crazy right now and we want her to have a space where she can be herself.

TL;DR : My daughter came out to me, her friend was actually her girlfriend and they had a fight.

ANSWER: I wish I had you as my mother. No I'm not gay but to take the time to learn from others on how to take care of your daughter lovingly is a really good trait and she is lucky that instead of you responding back in kind or from a place of negativity, you are responding with love.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I [26f] opened my husband's [32m] snapchat and it was a very explicit picture and caption from a girl. He's sitting not 20 feet from me & I don't know how to handle this.

Link to original post: https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4z9cgn/i_26f_opened_my_husbands_32m_snapchat_and_it_was/?ref=search_posts

Again, I am overwhelmed by the support and love I've received from everyone. It feels great to be comforted and cheered on by you all. Thank you so much.

So, husband cheated. He has been since "maybe two weeks before last Christmas", according to him.

I was very calm when confronting him and took the advice many of you gave me by telling him that he needs to explain to me who Roxy is and why she is his "best friend" on Snapchat. His face gave him away immediately but he still tried to lie to me at first.

He said that she works with his friend and they met when his friend invited her out to lunch with the two of them. At first, he claimed he only met her about two months ago. He said that they're "best friends" because he doesn't receive many snapchats from others and she is extremely active on the app. He said she just sends randoms and is really into fitness, so she sends a lot of "inspirational" snaps on being healthy and living a better life. He said that every once in a while, he'll send her something back, like a picture of a cheeseburger or something just to tease her about her level of health-consciousness.

First, I asked why he didn't just tell me about her. He said he didn't even think about it because she's just an acquaintance, not even a friend. Then I asked if he'd ever received anything even remotely inappropriate from her.

He answered with, "Not on purpose". I'm assuming he went with that because he knew I opened that snapchat and he probably knew it was a bad one.

I asked what "Not on purpose" means. He got very defensive. Started raising his voice and saying he doesn't need to explain what that means, that sometimes people accidentally send the wrong snapchats to the wrong people. Then he had the nerve to say something along the lines of, "I feel like I'm on trial here. People warned me that you'd get crazy when you're pregnant but I never thought it'd be this bad."

Now. As some of you mentioned in my last post, it seems amazing that I'm able to keep such a level-head. That is because I was raised by a mother who always told me that you never accomplish anything with anger. That you can be emotional, passionate, upset, etc. without ever raising your voice. Messages received quietly and concisely are just as loud and clear as messages received through yelling and screaming. That is how I have lived my life for 26 years, with the exception of just a few blow ups (I am human).

This moment was an exception. I didn't exactly yell and scream, but I became furious. For him to try to blame this on me being pregnant? How unoriginal and offensive. Long story short, he said he'd never seen me this crazy and I told him that I'd never seen a picture of another girl's pussy on my husband's snapchat before. He came back with that I shouldn't have looked at his snapchat. I came back with that it was an accident but even if it hadn't been, there shouldn't be any reason he's receiving snapchats like that for me to see- accidentally or not- in the first place. I told him that I may be pregnant but I'm also an intelligent person and I am his wife, so I knew he was lying and I deserved to know the truth. I asked if I could see his text messages to see if he's been texting Roxy. He said sure. No messages. Then I asked to see his Facebook messages. He looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He told me no. I asked why.

He finally broke and started to cry. Told me he couldn't let me see the messages because they would hurt me. Because they were inappropriate.

Then it all came out. They screwed in the backseat of her car the first night they met.

This is already long so I'll spare you all the details. But it's been an ongoing affair for months. No, they did not always use protection. Although I was recently screened for STIs, I'll be getting checked again in light of this information.

My uncle already assured me that if he was unfaithful, we would cream him in court. Really the only thing I'm willing to fight him tooth & nail for is our home; I put a lot of effort and money into making this home my dream space. I won't be seeking spousal support but I will seek child support.

I'm obviously heartbroken and told him to go stay in a hotel or with Roxy for all I cared (I confronted him last night). My mom & sister stayed with me last night and let me sob all over them for hours. Right now I'm sort of numb but I'm also thinking very clearly. I know what my next 10 moves are and I feel supported and secure in my decision to leave him and keep my baby.

A few things I just wanted to clarify: My husband is not a lawyer; his good friend is. There was some concern for my success in court if my husband is a lawyer. His friend is in environmental law so, while I'm sure he can provide some advice, he will not be my husband's divorce lawyer.

There were suggestions of me terminating my pregnancy. I fully support the right to choose and I would probably terminate the pregnancy if I was in a different financial position and lacked a support system. However, I work as a marketing manager for a large company. Not only does this allow me the privilege of working from home about 50% of the time, but it also grants me financial independence. I do not rely on my husband for money and I really never have. He works in tech so, while he makes a good salary, I will have no need for spousal support. I have a phenomenal support system; this baby will be loved so dearly by so many. Yes, I will have to deal with my husband for the rest of my life if I have this child and it will make future relationships for me more difficult, but it is worth it. I've wanted this baby since day one and I am her mother, which means that I am strong enough to raise her alone because I have to be strong enough.

Here's to hoping for a speedy divorce. I'm ready to be done with this marriage. Which is crazy because just a few days ago I thought my life was as close to perfect as you could get.

tl;dr Husband admitted to an affair. I will be proceeding with a divorce and will keep our baby. I'm numb but calm and feeling good about my decisions and how I handled the situation. I know there is a long road ahead of me and this will all probably really hit me soon. When it does, I'll mourn and grieve the end of what I had thought was a happy union. Right now I'm in self-preservation mode and much more focused on how to come out of this in the best position possible. Thank you so much for all the advice and support, Reddit!

Edit: Formatting

UPDATE: I know it has been only a short time since I posted this update but I need to tell you all how amazing all of you are. Wow, this much support is just... wow. I wish I could reply to all of your comments and messages but because of the volume, I'm just going to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to each and every one of you who read my posts, who commented, thought of me, wished my baby & me the best, messaged me, and anything else. I am currently at my parent's condo, sitting outside at their pool, sunbathing my little baby bump and reading each and every one of your amazing and empowering comments. I just want you all to have that image; that you have made me happy and content in a time when I am short on both. This is proof that love does exist, even if it doesn't within my, now over, relationship. And that is a powerful thing.

Love to you all.

Me again: I was going to post more details on what happened during the confrontation with my husband, etc., but then I decided against it. I should keep some details private; it's likely my husband has seen this post.

I will leave you with this:

My dad and I were up late talking last night and, as usual, he had the perfect thing to say to me. He told me that weak people are afraid of strong people. He told me to keep on terrifying the weak ones. That way, the only people who won't fear you are the bravest, strongest of people and those are the people who are worthy of you.

Then he said my husband is a spineless turd who couldn't kick it with the strongest woman in the world.

Just thought I'd leave you with that and encourage everyone to "be terrifying" by being strong and not standing for nonsense.

This is the last I will post on the matter. I have a lot ahead of me with everything and will probably go quiet on Reddit for a while. Time to get ready for court and to "be terrifying". :)

Thank you, thank you, thank you again. Love to all of you and best wishes.

Love,

-T

ANSWER: I've been thinking of you since I saw the original post a few days ago. It broke my heart to hear this, you deserve a thousand times better than a man like him.
You've handled the entire thing with utter grace by the sounds of things, I for one could not keep my cool especially if I had pregnancy hormones whizzing around my body. I am flawed by your measured response and strength to leave someone who quite clearly doesn't deserve you. That is true strength. Your child is lucky to have such a strong mother and role model. All the best for the future, you deserve happiness x

QUESTION: [UPDATE] Me [31F] with my husband [35 M] married 2 years together for 10. He doesn't want his kids to be like me.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2i34pr/me_31_f_with_my_husband_35_m_married_2_years/

It took me 3 more years, but I finally left him last year.

This post helped me see how much was wrong in our relationship, but I was still so hesitant to leave.

We had pets and a beautiful home together and I loved his family and we had so many inside jokes and plans for the future.

But eventually it was all just too much for me to take any longer. The day after his parents' 50th anniversary party, I told him I wanted a divorce. I just couldn't see myself living like that for 50 years.

I moved from the suburbs to the city with a friend. I rekindled some old friendships from high school and made a bunch of new friends who I am so thankful for. He kept the dog, I took the cats.

I thought my life was ending but it was just beginning.

I told my (very religious) family and they were all understanding and supportive. I've maintained friendships with a good number of our mutual friends, friendships I was worried about losing.

I'm working on my masters degree and volunteering and experiencing life and love and art and beauty like I never thought was possible.

I met a guy at a friend's punk rock show and we hit it off, but we are taking things very slowly. He is wonderful and so kind to me.

If you are in an abusive relationship, please don't be afraid to leave.

It gets so much better. I still miss him from time to time. I feel guilty about getting divorced, guilty for wasting my parents money on a failed marriage. I miss his parents. I miss my dog.

But I am SO MUCH happier. My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.

Thank you so much to everyone who offered advice and sympathized and even had harsh words for me deciding to stay.

tl;dr: Left my abusive husband. Life is much better.

EDIT: for those saying it didn’t sound that bad or abusive, you should know it got worse. It did escalate to physical abuse, us sleeping separately/no intimacy for a year.

If you think you are too old or too much trouble or have too much baggage or are too much anything, please believe that it is possible to find love again. Both loving yourself and having someone else love you 💕

ANSWER: >My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.

Yes! I remember reading once that what human beings are scared of most is uncertainty. So in a way, staying with your abusive husband -- while awful and full of emotional abuse -- was the safe option because you knew what you were in for. Leaving him was an act of bravery and I hope your future is full of warmth and love.

QUESTION: [Update]I [30f] want to discuss moving in with boyfriend [34m] but we have a significant difference in income.

OP:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i\_30f\_want\_to\_discuss\_moving\_in\_with\_boyfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i_30f_want_to_discuss_moving_in_with_boyfriend/)

Thanks for all the advice, I ended up broaching the topic last week.

As mentioned in the first post both my boyfriend and I have been hinting around the topic but hadn't directly discussed it. I was still on the fence about bringing it up myself when my boyfriend made a comment about how he's excited for us to live together (one day). I just responded with, "Well did you want to? My lease is up in July." and he said that he did.

It was before work when it happened so we left it at that for the day and got together that evening to work out details. I expressed to him at that point that while I would love living with him that my concern was that I wouldn't be able to contribute equally and I didn't want him feeling taken advantage of. He in turn expressed that he'd never want to put me in a bad position financially and that we could easily figure out something that would be fair while still putting me in a better financial position.

We ended up deciding we'd go with a lump sum monthly that I'll pay to him to cover all the costs, rather than splitting bills. The monthly amount he offered at first I actually upped because I didn't think he was being fair to himself, and it was still less than what I pay now. He seemed happy with that and it definitely works for me!

He keeps mentioning how excited he is to move in together, and came to my apartment last week to help me clean for photos to show it! We're deciding together what we'll keep out of my furniture vs. his, what we'll get rid of and what we're going to store. He's also mentioned a couple renovations he wants to get done around the condo so we're going to go together to pick stuff out and make it a summer project. :)

TL;DR: Boyfriend gave me an opening to ask about moving in so I seized it. All went well and we'll be moving in together in June!

Edit: Wow... this really blew up! Thanks to everyone for the super kind words. To address the most common comment here; we did discuss splitting proportionally but ultimately decided to go with a lump sum. I definitely see benefits to proportional splitting but for where we are right now and my financial situation I prefer a lump sum. It's still significantly less than what I'm paying now, and it wont fluctuate as the weather changes so I can count on what I owe monthly not changing.

Many people have mentioned chores as well. My boyfriend and I tend to do chores together. I mean right now with two separate places we each have our things that are more our responsibility but when I've stayed with him for a stretch of time we've just balanced together. He doesn't know how to cook but wants to learn so we cook meals together and then clean up together. We will each have our own washroom at his place (I've already taken over the main washroom and he uses the en suite). He volunteers at a local animal shelter once a week so those days I clean and cook if I'm around. But generally speaking we just treat doing chores as an opportunity to spend time together and be productive. :)

ANSWER: Aw, this is adorable! You guys sound like you communicate well and really care for each other, good luck!

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (30F) caught my husband (31M) in an affair and I don’t know how to move forward.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i7wkqu/i_30f_caught_my_husband_31m_in_an_affair_and_i/

First of all, I just want to thank everyone here for the support I received following my first post back in August. At the time, it truly felt like my world was ending. It was important to me to make this update because I need to tell anyone who’s currently going through the same thing—IT GETS BETTER. You will get so much better.

I had one conversation with my husband since everything happened—by his choice. It lasted maybe five minutes and was like talking to a robot. I know from others that he cries to people about how he ruined his life, but I have never once gotten an apology or the same show of regret. At this point, I don’t care. I know him and the other woman are still seeing each other and frankly, they deserve each other. Good for them.

While I still feel angry occasionally, I no longer mourn what I once had. Instead, I’m so excited for the life I now get to live. I moved to a small walkable city and gave myself my dream apartment. It makes me so happy to see how I’ve decorated it and to just live in a cozy place instead of our old dreary house.  I was the breadwinner in our marriage, and he would make me feel awful about wanting to pay for nice meals or do fun things. Since moving here, I’ve done a ton of foodie fun stuff and don’t feel guilty. It’s so refreshing.

I have dipped my toe into the dating pool again and had plenty of mediocre dates from dating apps. Recently, I found someone who I’ve really clicked with and am enjoying how appreciated and desired he’s made me feel.  It’s definitely early and we’re moving slow, but overall, dating has made me realize that I’m a catch who doesn’t have to settle.

Therapy has done wonders and I’m so happy I immediately dove into it. My therapist is proud of me. I’m proud of me. I’ve stopped looking at being divorced as a failure. He failed—not me. I’m genuinely happy and excited to wake up each morning and no longer feel like this terrible weight is sitting on my chest. The holidays were surprisingly easy and I found myself so happy to spend time with my family without having to compromise anything.

So all in all, life is good and there’s so much of it ahead. Looking back, I can’t believe I wasted so much time thinking about how I could get him to come home. I’ve made my own home and my own happiness and that is worth so so much more.

TLDR; Husband left me for another woman. He sucks, but things get better.

ANSWER: Thank you. I forgot to mention above, but I also got a new job offer and am happily busy with fulfilling work again as well!

QUESTION: Update to the pettiest question ever

Update to this petty thing: [https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3hi08p/stupidest\_question\_ever\_is\_there\_any\_polite\_way/](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3hi08p/stupidest_question_ever_is_there_any_polite_way/)

It  took 5 years and a marriage and he curled his eyelashes last week. He found my eyelash curler and asked what it was for and I told him how to test it on himself. He said he didn't notice any difference but his eyes sparkled for the first time.

He's not going to keep doing it but at least I know what his pupils look like now lol

TL;DR: I didn't ask him, he asked me.

ANSWER: Thank god, I've been on the edge of my seat for the last 5 years. Glad you guys got married and things are OK.

Give us another update in 5 years when you've got a house and a couple kids?

QUESTION: [UPDATE] I'm [28F] unsure if it's time to draw boundaries with my boyfriend [28M] and his coworker [late 20sF] who he got close to very quickly

Original post is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9cx874/im\_28f\_unsure\_if\_its\_time\_to\_draw\_boundaries\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9cx874/im_28f_unsure_if_its_time_to_draw_boundaries_with/)

TLDR of original: My boyfriend has become fast friends with a female coworker. She and her fiancé are now moving into our apartment building, and my boyfriend is seeing and talking to her more and more. I don't know if it's time to set boundaries or if I'm getting ahead of myself.

&#x200B;

A lot has happened since my last post, and I got some good advice there, so I wanted to post an update!

After I made the last post I came home from the trip with my family a couple of days later. I told my boyfriend that I wanted to talk to him about something and I brought up his friendship with Liz. I basically brought up all of my concerns from the post. I told him that I didn't want to discourage him from having a friend, but I also felt like they were talking quite a lot and spending a lot of time together, and that it was starting to make me feel uncomfortable.

My boyfriend took it really well! He immediately reassured me that he only saw her as a friend, and that he hadn't even realized how it could look to me. When I brought up how I felt like he wasn't being forthcoming with information (like how he didn't mention the phone call from her), he said that was 100% unintentional. He then immediately asked what he could do going forward to make me feel more comfortable. He offered to stop carpooling with her and to cut down on contact with her except for work-related stuff. I told him I didn't have a problem with the carpooling because financially it does make sense (he spends a lot of money on gas), but maybe he could try to text and call her outside of work a little bit less. I also told him I would really love to meet her and her fiance, and he enthusiastically agreed.

He set up a hang out for the following weekend - the two of us and Liz and her fiance all went out for drinks at a bar by our building (they'e moved in by now). It was actually really fun! It turns out we all have a ton in common. Liz and I do very similar work, and we all have common nerdy interests. It was a little awkward at first as meeting new people often is, but once we all got comfortable we had a blast. From there, we have all become fast friends, and Liz and I have developed our own separate friendship too. We text often, go over to each other's places for dinner sometimes, and hang out on weekends. I can honestly say I really like Liz (and her fiance) as a person and trust her 100%. I no longer have a problem with her friendship with my boyfriend at all. They do still carpool sometimes, but they've never hung out alone outside of work - it's always the four of us. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Finally, I have a separate - but slightly related - update: my boyfriend is now my FIANCE! Less than a month after I made my last post, he took me out for a really beautiful and romantic dinner. When we came home, our apartment was covered in roses and candles. I was so shocked I could barely move as he got down on one knee and proposed. I said YES and then cried for about two hours as we called all of our friends and family. It was absolutely perfect and we are getting married next year!

It turns out that Liz actually helped him plan the proposal and that was part of why they were talking a lot too! Since she lives in our building now, he had all of the flowers, candles, champagne, and accessories shipped to her and kept at her place until he was ready for them. He even had her hold onto the ring the week before he did it. After he proposed she came upstairs and took photos for us and cried with us. That was the moment I realized what a great friend she is to both of us.

So communication saves the day again! We're all great friends now, and Liz and I have regular girls nights to plan our weddings together :)

TL;DR: I talked to my boyfriend and he introduced me to Liz and her fiance right away. We're all great friends now and I'm no longer uncomfortable - but I am engaged!

EDIT: Wow, wow, wow!!!! I know this is stereotypical, but I never expected my post to blow up like this. I started reading the comments last night and planned to reply to some but then I got busy, and then this just got out of control! So let me just say here, thank you all SO MUCH for the support, advice, and well-wishes! You guys rule 😭 And thank you for the platinum, gold, and silver?! I’ve never gotten any of that before and now I’m a little sad that this is a throwaway and not my main, haha. I’ll pay it forward and gild someone today :)

ANSWER: Awww this is the kinda stuff I’m here for! I’m so glad the situation was resolved healthily and congrats on the engagement! 🤗☺️

QUESTION: UPDATE: Me [36 M] married to my Wife [36 F] 11 years, and I can't stop thinking about a girl I dated for 1 month 16 years ago.

Original Post 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lqpshq/me_36_m_married_to_my_wife_36_f_11_years_and_i/

So I mentioned to my wife vaguely that I was having a bit of a midlife crisis and ruminating on my past a bit too much. That I miss how I was physically at my peak in college.

She said she is also having a bit of a crisis, worried about longterm health and missing the shape she was in before kids.

We made a commitment to each other to get into shape and have changed our eating habits and bought a treadmill. I have been working out daily and my rumination issues have really dwindled. We also planned a nice vacation, and a few get togethers with frends in the next few months.

---
tl;dr: Told wife I was having a crisis without much detail. We are making strides to better ourselves and each other.

ANSWER: That’s a great update. I can promise you that the one month relationship would have never worked out, because it didn’t. And how it ended suggests that it never had staying power.

I hope that getting into shape helps you both. I think the pandemic also makes relationships tough because you’re likely no longer getting out and doing the things that brought you together (or, simply having time apart and separate interests). At least that’s been the case with my marriage! I think that would make it tempting to fantasize about some other reality that “could have” been (but really, it could have never been).

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My (28F) colleague (30F) didn't invite me to her wedding, and it's completely unravelled our friendship

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bctq5b/my_28f_colleague_30f_didnt_invite_me_to_her/)

So it took me a few days to decide the best way to approach this, but yesterday I had lunch with her again and had the conversation.

I started by saying: "So you've sent all your invitations out now, haven't you?"

She looked immediately panicked by my question and I knew right away that she didn't want me to go down this road.

When she said she had sent them all, I asked if that meant she could show me her venue now.

She showed me the website of it, including the photo gallery, and talked me through all about where everything was going to happen, all the flowers and decorations she was going to add etc. It's a nice enough country hotel with some pretty gardens, but I'm not sure what all the secrecy was for.

I probed a little more, asking who she's invited from work (the list didn't include me), said I was looking forward to seeing the photos so I could see how everything looked (she didn't correct me that I would see it on the day) and then I was completely sure that my lack of invitation wasn't an accident. She looked so relieved when I switched subject and asked if she's excited about her honeymoon and having a rest from all the wedding stress.

So I'm definitely not invited. I thought it over carefully and I have decided not to ask why, for three reasons:

1) The reason is already fairly obvious. She clearly doesn't think we're anything more than colleagues and I've misread the situation. (There were some other theories suggested e.g. jealous husband-to-be, associating me with her past grief, but considering everything I know about her and our history I'm sure it's not that.) I'm not sure why she didn't cool it on the wedding talk with someone she had no intention of inviting, or even just bring it up with me and explain why I'm not invited, but never mind.  
2) Having an awkward relationship at work is the last thing I want. I'm worried that if I push this and turn it into an "issue" that I'll look pathetic and needy, or it will just be unprofessional. I also run the risk of her badmouthing me to colleagues and mutual friends, and I will find it much easier and less messy to handle my own feelings quietly.   
3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down.

And you know, I'm fine with not going. It was never really about getting invited to a wedding, it was more having to face the fact that I'd been naive and taken for granted, and I felt silly that I'd invested way too much in this relationship. That's not all on her, because she was never obligated to be my friend.

Talking it through on my previous post actually really helped me work through my feelings. When I went back to work on Monday I felt much calmer and more detached from it emotionally.

I have looked back on our whole relationship and honestly she's always been self involved, entitled and narcissistic. Being a bride has just made it more obvious, but it's always been there. She's also never given back to me (besides helping me get my job, which of course I'm grateful for), in that she's never been willing to talk me through any problems I've had, and although I help her happily with her work, she says no if I ask her for help in return.

She has a few office enemies and even though I saw her negative traits that caused her to be disliked by some people, I overlooked them and defended her anyway. Now I have put a little distance there it's quite apparent that she's not a very nice person, and I'm genuinely OK with just moving on.

She hasn't really noticed the distance between us so far (or she has noticed and doesn't care/is relieved that I'm giving her space), so I intend to just continue with doing that. If she eventually asks why, or I get the sense that she's trying to rekindle our friendship, then it will be time to clear the air with how I've been feeling. If she doesn't and we just continue drifting, then that's probably for the best.

It's sad to lose a friend, and it will probably take me some time to get over it and to become comfortable with the change in our relationship, but I have other genuine friendships, and plenty of colleagues who are lovely people who I can get to know better now.

The main thing I really took from my original post, and I'm so glad I did post because I needed some tough love on this, is that my fear of confrontation really needs dealing with.

If I can learn how to better speak my mind as things are happening, that will stop things from building and building until I have to have a Serious Conversation and it makes what should have been a molehill into a mountain.

I also need to figure out how to have difficult conversations without having an anxiety attack, which not only weakens my message but is extremely distressing and puts me off dealing with things and being honest with people.

I had a couple of books on assertiveness recommended to me, so I've bought them to start me off. I'm also looking into going to a coach, or maybe a couple of therapy sessions at least, to try and better myself. I don't want to hurt other people by doing this, so this has become top priority for me.

Thank you so much everyone who pointed that out to me. I was aware of it but I didn't think it was a problem and figured I'd just be that way all my life. Now I know better. Thank you for being so honest with me.

Also thank you to those who talked me through the one-sided friendship issue. I'm a good listener and have always attracted people who need to vent, but I only ever noticed the one-off conversations, and didn't think I was being taken advantage of as a long term listening ear.

I have been examining my other friendships in the last few days, to see if anyone else is using me in the same way, or if I've even been doing this to others and not had the self awareness to realise. There are a couple of changes I need to make, including a friendship that I need to set some boundaries in, and another one where I've not been giving back to the other person as much I should have. I have learned a really valuable lesson from this about maintaining healthy relationships, and I'm very grateful for that.

&#x200B;

TL;DR So I'm definitely not invited, our friendship is likely over (but that's actually OK) and I'm going to work on my assertiveness so I can handle things like this better next time. I'm also going to move forward having learned a good lesson about friendships being two-way.

Edit: A few people have been asking about the books I was recommended:
Nonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg
When I Say No I Feel Guilty by Manuel J Smith
Why Men Love Bitches by Sherry Argov

ANSWER: > 3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down.

Jesus christ kudos for having that kind of outlook on things.

QUESTION: update to: Husband and I are having our longest fight ever and I don't know what to do

link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/abayxw/husband\_and\_i\_are\_having\_our\_longest\_fight\_ever/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/abayxw/husband_and_i_are_having_our_longest_fight_ever/)

Soon after I made the post, my husband called me. He was babbling and I couldn't understand him, so I kept asking him to slow down. Then he started screaming (not yelling, literally just screaming). I freaked out because I thought he was being murdered or something. I tracked his phone to a park in town and called 911.

Turns out he had a complete mental breakdown. He's in the process of being diagnosed with a mental illness that usually shows up in people's 20s but for some reason manifested later in him. He's currently in an inpatient mental health program and already doing a lot better.

Thank you all again for the responses and advice on my original post.

&#x200B;

ANSWER: The onset of mental illness posts are the ones that I hate the most.

Often nobody is really at fault, but its likely the start of a long and difficult road for all involved.

So yesterday he took me to run errands but he "randomly" decided to we should just have fun instead. He took me around the city, we tried all kinds of food, had honestly the most fun I've had since I was a kid, made memories off of little moments, I didn't think that much of it. I realized that the whole day had basically been an all day-date, I knew it had to be coming and I had the ring with me and I was going to try and propose at the same time (someone suggested this in my original post and I thought it would be cute)

He opened my door, walked me down a beautiful pathway and just looked me in the eyes and I said yes. He laughed and dropped down to one knee and I started crying and forgot that I was supposed to be proposing too. I don't even remember what he said, he was on his knee for a while saying what I'm sure were the sweetest things, but I was too busy crying. I'd already said yes before he even got down on one knee so he put the ring on my finger.

We went home and and I realized I didn't propose, he wanted to shower and we sometimes shower together so I proposed to him in there. He smiled and said “I wonder if when our first kid is born will it top this moment” then because I was on my knees in the shower he had to make a sex joke 😂

After we got out he held me while we called his parents (I'd already called my whole family in car ride home)

Yesterday was amazing and now I'm laying next to him while he plays video games and he's talking about our engagement to his friends and I couldn't be happier and I don't know how to contain all this and just ugh! I love you Nathan!❤️

Edit: Thank you to everyone congratulating us! I appreciate it very much 😊

TL;DR: He took me on a romantic all day date and popped the question. I was supposed to propose at the same time but was too busy crying form happiness, I proposed to him in the shower when we got home😂 I'm overjoyed right now!

ANSWER: I needed this positivity. This may sound weird coming from a random stranger, but I'm happy for you. Wish you all the best and your SO as well.

QUESTION: My (30F) husband (32M) impulse bought a dog. [update]

Update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cmu75w/my_30f_husband_32m_impulse_bought_a_dog/

Thank you all for the thorough responses. I read every comment you guys sent.

A few months ago I read a post where a woman sat down with her husband and outlined everything she takes care of at home in a list format. Like, kitchen: trash, dishes, wipe counters down. Etc. That way of communicating really stuck with me and when we went to see our therapist, I used the same format to express how much I do for the dog.

My husband told me that owning a dog was a joint effort and since I’m home all day it shouldn’t be a problem.

Which is when I realized that has been his excuse for everything. Cooking, chores, cleaning. I’m not sure how I became blind to it. I don’t know when I started bending over backwards to accommodate him.

We used to be a solid couple who helped each other out. I remember when I was still in school he’d come over to my apartment and clean the whole thing for me during finals. Or he took care of my elderly cat when I was away for a week and a half. He used to help me dry the dishes and it was always fun. We used to have so much fun and laugh all the time. At some point it all stopped.

I started crying right there in the middle of a sentence and he got concerned. I’m not a cryer the only time he’s ever seen me cry was when I had to put my beloved cat down a few years ago. But he held me for the first time in what felt like months and we had a serious heart to heart about how he made me feel. Not only with the dog but how stressed I’ve been with my job, how lonely I am, I don’t feel important and how we don’t feel like a team anymore, that I’m worried about us.

I guess it clicked for him because he really stepped up taking care of the dog. He started going into work earlier so he can come home early and hang out and make me dinner. It happened slowly over the course of the last few weeks and the routine suits us a lot better. We hired a trainer to make sure we can understand the dog’s boundaries together and the dog sleeps in a dog bed. Our bedroom life has slowly gotten back to where it was when we got married. We’re watching our favorite shows again and going out more. I’ve been putting my foot down more about my feelings and he has been receptive. We are still going to therapy for now.

As for the dog, we’re going to keep him. Is he a No List dog? Yes. But is he a good puppy with a big heart? Yes. We have the money to afford him and he took off after training. It’s nice having a dog again.

TL;DR: husband and I went to therapy, we talked through our problems, we are giving our marriage the time and attention it needs to mend. We’re keeping the dog.

ANSWER: Good job on the communication. Things can sneak up on people and unfair routines can creep in. I'm glad that you two seem to be correcting course for your relationship and it's a big positive that he's putting in a lot more effort now.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] I [29F] am traveling overseas to meet my online "boyfriend" [38M] in a week. He just said he had to cancel

So many through comments and PMs requested an update from my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9vlueu/i_29f_am_traveling_overseas_to_meet_my_online/) and so I thought I'd do one!

After my post I FaceTimed him to say my what I wanted to say and end things. He tried to get me to post-pone my trip and even tried to give me money to make me less mad at him. I told him whatever we had was over as I could no longer trust him. He cried which made me feel weird. I wished him and his ex the best and ended the call.

I went on my trip and had a top class time. The Reddit community really astounds me sometimes. I received a lot of PMs of suggestions of things to do and see and the trip to Ireland became a trip of a lifetime. In Dublin I did meet up with a very kind Redditor who showed me around the city and came with me to a bunch of museums during my stay. I saw amazing sights, met a bunch of really cool people through my travels, and met a few really cute Irish boys. (;

I learned a lot about myself on my first solo trip abroad. I am pretty self reliant and I did a lot of self reflection. This "relationship" was my first "serious" one after my ex and I split up. I think in my desire for closeness with someone I ignored a lot of red flags and downplayed my self worth. I am now focusing on making real connections with people I meet in real life and have decided to stay away from anything long distance indefinitely.

My first night in Belfast I did message him after I had had a what was probably too many beers (damn you delicious Irish beers!) and he said he was sorry but it was what it had to be. It didn't really seem sincere and it extinguished any romantic notions I had.

Thank you to everyone who commented and PM'd me. It really made me excited for my trip and it was the best time!

TLDR; Online BF backed out but after some logistical rearranging I still went on my trip and had the best time ever. Glad I cancelled the bf and not the trip.

ANSWER: > Glad I cancelled the bf and not the trip.

I love this, lol! I'm glad I caught the update post, and am so happy that you went through with the trip! Wishing you oodles of happiness and success in the future, OP. ♥

QUESTION: Update: My wife [28F] found out that my mother [59F] and I [28M] have been lying to her about our (me and my wife's) baby [0M] for months

Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/az648p/my\_wife\_28f\_found\_out\_that\_my\_mother\_59f\_and\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/az648p/my_wife_28f_found_out_that_my_mother_59f_and_i/)

Don't think anyone would particularly care about an update but I all appreciated the insight anyways. So here's an update:

After I wrote the original post, my mom took my son to stay overnight with my wife's sister so that the two of us could have the house to ourselves.

We pretty much just talked for an hour while constantly reaffirming that we love each other a lot and want to sort this out. I apologized and explained why I did what I did. She said that feeling like she was there for our son's milestones was really just a band-aid solution that didn't actually convince her she was present. She said that if she actually had been using the milestones to feel like she was present, this would probably have felt worse for her. But since she wasn't, in her words, "deluding herself into thinking she's actually home", her main issue was that I lied which hurt her feelings. I apologized and explained that I honestly thought that she would prefer the lying if given the choice. She said she understood where I was coming from and that she felt betrayed when she realized, but she sees that I was doing it because I love her and she thinks we'll probably laugh about it with our grandkids one day (yes, I am very aware I don't deserve my wife).

Some things came out on my end that I wasn't going to tell her and didn't mention in my last post- namely, that I'm scared she's going to become suicidal. My uncle committed suicide when I was a child, in part from working in a high-stress job where he made a huge and costly mistake. One of my wife's colleagues attempted suicide while she was on mat leave. Being a working mom is bad enough, being a resident in this program is bad enough, both combined are a recipe for trouble. Since our son was born and the incident with her colleague happened, I've been afraid that if her home life wasn't perfect, it would push her over the edge. Anyways, she reassured me that that's not happening and I think saying it out loud also made me realize it's a pretty irrational, groundless fear.

We ordered takeout and sat together watching the real videos I have of all our son's firsts. I also have a special folder of pictures/videos of my son with my wife, so we went through that after. She almost choked from laughing so hard when I tentatively revealed the beanbag trick. I am the laughing stock of her friend-group chat. So I guess we're already at the stage where we're laughing about it.

Thank you to those who responded to the last post! The stereotype of someone in [r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships) advocating divorce every time anything happens is true.

tl;dr: marriage is work. I am stupid. We moved past it.

ANSWER: I've always heard that NO firsts ever happen in daycare. Until Mom sees it happening, it didn't happen. Many grandparents feel the same way.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (34F) feel unattractive and my husband (41M) of 5 years has low libido

I posted last summer about [struggles with my husband of 5 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/), our longest dry spell being 9 months.

I felt unattractive and undesirable, and wanted to have sex more often, but he was happy to never have sex again (aside from how that would affect me). I wanted to feel like a sex Goddess again. Reddit advised me all kinds of things, from checking testosterone, to therapy, and even that there was no hope and if I wanted to feel like a Goddess again, I'd have to leave him. The [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/estjlke?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that hit me hardest was jimmyjrdanceparty's who pointed out that I was allowed to feel the way I did.

Well, I feel like a Goddess again, everyone! :D

What happened? I decided to go to individual therapy, and focus on myself, work on myself. My physical self-image was a symptom of a larger problem. Troubles at work, troubles at home, a storm inside. During counselling, I opened the door to a cellar where I had been keeping my true self locked in the dark - ashamed of her. I was bullied as a kid, and I had no idea I had accumulated so much self-loathing since then. Releasing that was amazing and so freeing!

And so, by the time I said goodbye to my counsellor, I was stronger and more self-assured. I realised I had been sacrificing so much of myself for the sake of others (especially the important men in my life - my husband, my boss, my father, my manager, etc). I was constantly seeking approval, trying to please them. My relationships had gotten completely out of balance.

Things started to get complicated. I developed a crush on a colleague, and because I am demisexual, my attraction to my husband started to diminish. The more time passed the more I felt like I just didn't care anymore what he thought of me.

At a low point, I said to my husband: "You know, you always keep your thoughts to yourself. I used to find it mysterious and interesting - like a puzzle I could unwrap. But now I realise that there's actually no mystery to unravel. There's just nothing. And the silence is boring." It was hurtful and unkind. I'm not proud of it. Something changed after that. Both for him, and for me.

Over the course of the next few months I gave less, and I took more. I went to conferences, I left the kids with my husband, I took time off work, I stopped making up for the mistakes of my superiors at work and let them deal with the consequences of their actions. I felt like I was coming home to my true self - my no nonsense kickass self.

One night my husband and I were watching Alien, and he confessed that ever since he'd seen the original as a boy, he'd really liked Ripley. She was the kind of woman he had wanted to marry. And so he married me. You should've seen my face, the tears wouldn't stop. I felt like he had finally told me what I needed to hear the most.

I got rid of my attraction to my colleague. It's actually not that hard as a demi, I just focused on everything I didn't like about them, and within a week or two the crush was totally gone. I find them a total turn-off now.

Do you remember I mention I wasn't able to initiate sex? That's because it was a huge turn-off for my husband. One evening we discussed why, and you know what? He felt too much pressure if I initiated, because he thought he'd have to perform. Once he realised that he can safely turn me down if he's not in the mood - and also that's it's OK for us to kiss and cuddle without it leading to something more - he's been OK with me initiating. You'd think you wouldn't get to age 40 without having figured that out, but hey... I guess people never cease to throw surprises!? Haha!

Our sex life improved a lot. I no longer needed his praise to sooth my self-loathing, so I was less needy about it. He initiated a bit more often. But more importantly, with greater enthusiasm and quality! He chooses what I wear sometimes - and I feel so beautiful when he looks at me like I am the only being that matters. And he compliments me! We even got into a bit of light D/s, which has spiced things up a lot!

Even though I had fallen out of love with him for a while, I have fallen back in love with my husband stronger and harder than ever before!! I couldn't be happier, I love myself, and I love him so SO much!! He's just the best partner I could ever wish for! <3

Thank you reddit for helping me through one of the hardest lows in my life, and thank you especially jimmyjrdanceparty for your advice and encouragement.

TLDR: I felt unattractive and my husband didn't want sex. I went to a counsellor. I stopped self-loathing. Husband and I fell back in love again & have great sex.

Update: OMG thank you thank you thank you for all the comments and awards! I have no words! I thought maybe 5 people would care about the update, not this amazing amount of encouragement! Thank you so much, so glad to have been on this journey with you. <3

ANSWER: This is the best post I have ever read on here. You changed your thoughts about yourself, which is the secret to life (IMO). Congrats and thank you for this empowering and amazing story!

QUESTION: UPDATE: My [24 F] boyfriend [26 M] of 6 months told me that I need to "unlove" the men from my past before I can love him.

Link to original post [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ccl1gt/my\_24\_f\_boyfriend\_26\_m\_of\_6\_months\_told\_me\_that\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ccl1gt/my_24_f_boyfriend_26_m_of_6_months_told_me_that_i/)

Figured I'd update my post from about a month ago. Unfortunately, there wasn't a happy ending, but I am very grateful for a lot of the advice I received here. Thank you, reddit, for helping me keep my head on straight!

After I made my first post, I read all the comments and thought about everything for a few days. A lot of people mentioned that they would not be comfortable with the frequency of my communication with my ex. I thought that was very fair. People also mentioned that Mark's behavior was pretty controlling and not ok. I also thought that was fair.

I went to talk to Mark and told him that I understood if he was uncomfortable with me being in touch with Eli weekly, and that I would be totally willing to cut that down. I also reiterated again that I was not currently in love with Eli and hadn't been for a while. Mark was understanding this time and seemed happy with the fact that I offered to cut down my contact with Eli.

But then I told Mark that although I was willing to do this, I wasn't happy with how he approached the issue and that I found his behavior controlling. I basically told him that I want him to approach issues in a more rational way and I would appreciate if he opened a dialogue rather than just telling me what to do, and that I wouldn't put up with him trying to "command" me to do something (especially something so ridiculous). I said everything in the same tone as I used for the first half of the conversation - I wasn't yelling at him or admonishing him, just trying to let him know where my boundaries are.

You guys - Mark. Flew. Off. The. Handle. He started SCREAMING at me. I obviously wasn't having it, so I got up to leave. He started throwing dishes and random kitchen items at me, and grabbed me and slammed my head into the door jam. I ended up with a nasty black eye and a busted lip. Luckily for me, a neighbor heard the commotion and called the cops. Mark was arrested and I was taken to the hospital. Yes, I'm pressing charges and filed for a restraining order.

Overall, it was a horrible incident but I'm glad this happened earlier in the relationship rather than later. And I am forever grateful for the neighbor who called the cops. Im also grateful to (most of) you guys for telling me that I wasn't being insane in my first post and for pointing out the early warning signs. It wasn't the best ending, but I'm ok and I'm just glad it's over. Take this as a cautionary tale, I guess!

TLDR: tried to have a rational conversation with Mark, he gave me a black eye and busted lip, it's over (thank God).

EDIT: I've gotten a lot of concerned messages (which I appreciate!) telling me to watch out for Mark now and that abusers are often at their most dangerous right after a breakup. Just to ease everyone's mind: I'm staying with a classmate (who Mark does not know) for the time being, so I'm well-protected! Thanks everyone!

ANSWER: Him: WOULD A CONTROLLING PSYCHO DO THIS?!

Him: (Smashes dishes and your head)

All of us: ...yes?

I’m really glad you got out of there. I hope you heal quickly.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My best friend (20M) asked me (20M) out. I said yes. I didn't know it was a date.

The original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9du198/my_best_friend_20m_asked_me_20m_out_i_said_yes_i/

First of all, I wanted to thank people for responding. I was majorly panicking when I wrote the post, and the comments I got helped a ton to get me to relax before talking to Noah. I wasn't expecting such a huge response at the time and I was amazed, but looking back now I can see why it got so much attention. It was a pretty weird situation.

Next, I want to say we are both men (apparently this makes a big difference for some people in terms of advice). Some of the people who assumed I was a woman also made some weird comments and sent me some pretty gross messages. If you did this, please stop. That's not cool.

I gave a bit of an update as an edit to the original post, but now since it's been 3 months I thought I'd give you all an update about how things have been going since then, since it seems like there's been a bit of interest, and I'm still really thankful to all of you for helping me out.

Noah is doing really well. I could tell he was still a bit embarrassed for the first couple weeks, but after that he told me again that he was still happy he asked me because now he knew how I felt and he could get over it. He also thanked me for taking it so well, which is definitely thanks to what a lot of you said, so I guess I'm sort of passing his thanks on to you :P

One of the commenters said I should be careful not to do anything that seemed like flirting with him, so I tried keep that in check (we used to hug a lot, sit really close together, and tell each other flirty jokes, you get the idea, but I toned those all down a lot to give him space and not mess with his feelings). I honestly think I see now why he thought I might be into him, because my relationship with him was very affectionate. It's been a lesson for me on how to be more aware of how other people are interpreting my signals.

About a month after he asked me out, he asked me if I wanted to go to a gay bar with him. He made it super clear that it wasn't a date, but he did it in a really sarcastic way, which was a little embarrassing for me but also I think it was good that he could joke about it. So we went to a local gay bar together and we had a really good time. He's a bit introverted, so I played the wingman, and he ended up flirting with this really cute guy and he just seemed really happy.

That was like two months ago and we've gone to the same bar a couple more times since then. He's been getting a bit more comfortable putting himself out there which is really cool to see, and he's just been more open and happy for the last two months, always smiling and eager to go do stuff. Not sure how it's related but it's a noticeable change from before he asked me out.

I'm doing great too. I'm just really happy that I didn't hurt our relationship and that he's so happy. I also learned some important things from this whole situation about communication and being aware of how I present myself. Important lessons. I actually think I feel more confident now too, since he asked me out. Getting asked out feels good man.

It sounds kind of weird, but I think it made us closer. We've started talking about relationships more, which isn't something we really talked about before. He's gone on a few dates and he tells me about them, and the most recent guy he went out with he was really excited about, and I think he might be headed for his first serious relationship, which is amazing! That's actually what made me think of this post and decide to give you all an update.

TL;DR: So yeah, our relationship wasn't ruined and I still have my best friend. He's doing really well and I love seeing him so happy.

Thanks again for the help!

ANSWER: What a lovely happy update - and I had to go back and check your ages because the maturity and self awareness you have both shown is pretty impressive. Big smile from this mom 🙂 Happy holidays!

QUESTION: (Update) How do I (28f) break up with someone when I’m their (31m) everything?

[Link to original post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aab0wm/how_do_i_28f_break_up_with_someone_when_im_their/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Straight to it: I broke up with him a day after I made my original post a few months ago. I was emboldened by the support and, strangely enough, even some of the negative comments. I came home from work and blurted it out, straight and to the point. I told him that I wasn’t happy, I hadn’t been for a while, and that we would be separating. We agreed that he could stay in the extra bedroom for a few months while we got everything sorted but when the lease was up we would be going our separate ways.

The last few months have been hard. He went into full blown panic mode, promised to change in the ways I had waited years for, and had several actual melt downs begging me to stay. It was painful, but my resolve to live my own life never wavered.

I just signed a new lease (by myself) and have begun to casually date someone in the same field as me. Life has an excitement to it that I haven’t felt in years, it’s like I’ve taken my first deep breath in a long time.

So, if you’re on the fence about leaving someone but your lives are so enmeshed that you don’t see how it is possible: put yourself first, there is always a way out. Thank you!

TLDR: I broke up with my codependent boyfriend and am the happiest I have been in years.

ANSWER: Amen.

Leases, shared bills, mutual enjoyment of GOTs or Survivor while everything else is terrible is no reason to stay together.

I’ve told my sons. Keep an emergency fund that you NEVER touch. Don’t bail on relationships, but NEVER stay in a relationship because you don’t have first months/last months rent and security deposit.

EDIT - thanks for the gold!! Just trying to share some hard-earned wisdom.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My [27F] boyfriend's [27M] old crush returning after a few years away. I was worried he would leave me for her, sadly I was right.

Old post - https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xgz9v/my_25f_boyfriend_25m_had_a_crush_on_a_girl_25f/

He ended up breaking up with me about a month after she came back and got back with her. It's been two years since this all happened and I heard through the grapevine they got engaged last weekend. I've moved on and it's alright, but my heart breaks when I think of how insecure and self-conscious I felt when all this went down. I know I'll eventually find a guy who I won't have any worries about, until then I'm chilling.

TL;DR: I was right to be worried.

ANSWER: I get you. I was supposed to be getting engaged and married to a guy who I thought loved me. Come to find he was cheating on me. They have since gotten married and had a family.

The biggest thing that stung wasnt the fact that he cheated, but the thought that I wasn't good enough for him but she was. I had to realize that I was good enough for a good man.

You are good enough. You are worthy of love and affection. You are 100% worth it and there is someone out there who will see that. I promise you.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] Me [32/F] with my husband [39 M] 6-years, our sex life disappeared; he swears he's attracted to me and I'm not sure what to believe or do.

[Here is the original post.  It is from over two years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40tuc7/me_32f_with_my_husband_39_m_6years_our_sex_life/)

I know my original post is so old, but the biggest update only recently happened.  My therapist suggested I post about it here to help sort out how I feel right now and also as a warning to other people.  I feel like I have grown so much in the last few years and maybe I'm a bit less naive (or a bit more bitter... however you'd like to put it).

Through interacting with the comments, I came up with an ultimatum I would give my husband.

1.  He needed to get his medical stuff tested.

2.  He see someone psychologically.

3.  Couple's counseling.

I decided ahead of time that he'd have to do the legwork for this already.  I had already done so much legwork for this relationship and I wanted to make sure I didn't hold his hand through this either.

He took it surprisingly well for what the conversation was.  There were tears on both sides but he agreed that yes, he would be willing to do these things for the sake of the relationship.

And then days passed.  And a week past.  I finally brought it up again and it caused a minor fight where he told me he needed to do this sort of stuff on his own time.

A few more weeks past.  I realized that he did not care enough to do something about this.  It was a hard thing to realize, but it was clear as day.

I headed over a friend's house to talk things out, clear my head, and come up with a plan for divorce.

I drove home and a few minutes before I arrived, he got a phone call that his sister was in a coma and dying.  I booked him tickets to go see her.  She passed away a few hours after he saw her.

She left behind two late-teenage girls.  Who we were now partially responsible for.

So I pushed my pain down and decided to be the best aunt I can to these two girls.  I also got myself a dog (best decision ever in this situation) to keep my own spirits up.

I worked really hard at this and felt like my husband and I were getting closer in the process.

More recently, I started realizing that everything we were doing for the girls was initiated through me--not him.  So I started paying more attention.  He was getting annoyed at me making a big deal over surprise care packages their school suggested we send in and other things like that.  I was starting to resent that he wasn't caring for his nieces in the same way as I was.

On the youngest niece's graduation day, I asked him if he thought the other parents there would be getting flowers for the graduates and if that's something we should do.  This is when he totally lost it at me.  It was a string that started with him yelling about how I get too concerned about these sorts of things and ended with a rant about how I buy too many crackers when company comes over for dinner.  This started changing the lens I was looking at him through again.  Also, at this point, I felt like my nieces had launched into the world with lives of their own.

I started re-seeing the eyerolls when I talked.  The cutting remarks about my intelligence.  Oh, and the utter lack of sex.

So I started talking to people.  I started seeing a therapist.  And together, we all came up with a plan to discuss everything with him--probably ending in divorce (though I never took that as a definite).

I decided we had a different view of what a relationship and marriage should be.  My plan was to present that to him calmly and let him give his opinion of how he sees things.

I had a work trip so I took the time to recoup.  I went on a long hike, and even though I'm not really religious, I prayed the whole damn time about this.

So when I got home, in the calmest and most even way I could, I explained the situation as I saw it and asked for his feedback.  My friends and I rehearsed what would happen if he cried and begged for a chance to change--or what to do (or rather, where to go) if he got really angry.

But nothing prepared me for his reaction.  He agreed with me.  He said that everything felt "forced" to him and that this wasn't a natural relationship.  That he married me because that was the path he was on, and since he wasn't planning on having kids, it's not like that mattered all that much.  In fact, he prefers being alone generally.

He then finished by asking if I thought we should get couple's counseling.  I calmly said that given what he just said, I didn't think that was an option.  He immediately started trying to talk next steps, who gets what, etc.  He brought up that he could probably technically fight for alimony but that he wouldn't.  And said he wouldn't fight for my dog if I don't fight to go after his seperate finances.

I think this was the most painful in the moment reaction I could have had from him.  I told him I would give him some space that night, so I drove to my friend's house and cried my eyes out.  Him not fighting it is ultimately better for the long run, but it's really hard to realize that your husband of 5 years (and partner for 8) never really loved or cared for you.

I should have listened to my gut all along.

We had that talk last night.  I'm currently sitting in a coffee shop, typing this all out.  I'm a relatively attractive person and I channeled my frustrations over the last few years into lifting and working out almost every day.  So I'm hopeful when it comes to love in the future.

I don't really know what my next step is.  I might drive to my brother's.  I might look for a storage facility.  It's a bit overwhelming to think about.

Overall, I'm so grateful this is happening now and that I won't be looking back at my life when I'm 85 years old, disappointed that it never really started.  I have my life in front of me and it's a big scary place.  But after I finish crying my eyes out, it's one step in front of the other.

And thank you everyone for all your help.

tl/dr:  Put off divorce due to spouse's sister dying and despite everything we worked on together, found out he never really loved me.

ANSWER: I am so sorry..

I wanted to come here to say, specifically, thank you so much for being an amazing aunt to those girls. I lost my mom when I was 15 and my aunts were hands-down the biggest blessing during that time. I don’t know if I would have chosen to continue living if it hadn’t been for their support. So thank you for being so incredibly selfless and supportive for your nieces.

QUESTION: UPDATE: recently found out that I (17M) got into my brother's (19M) former dream university which he did not get accepted to last year, feeling guilty about really wanting to go now

Update to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95s4ri/recently_found_out_that_i_17m_got_into_my/)

On Saturday I was able to speak to my brother and tell him that I got into the university. He was really happy for me, like a lot of people said he would be. When I told him I got in he gave me a huge hug and was really excited. It was such a huge relief.

He asked me if it was my top choice, since he didn't know I had applied. I told him it was and he said that we have to celebrate then. He told me I didnt seem excited enough and I should be really proud of myself, and he asked if it was the shock of just finding out.

When I told him I find out a few days ago and he was the only one that knew he asked me whats going on, because I wasnt reacting to the great news like it was great news. I admitted that I worried about telling him because I didnt want him to be mad.

We talked about it and he basically said what everyone in the comments said, that he's proud of me and happy for me. I mentioned that I got into a different program than his and my requirements were lower, and he told me to not downplay my success and to stop worrying about him being mad because he wasn't. He told me that when I told out parents he wanted me to be more confident and proud of myself, because I did something great.

Yesterday while we were hanging out at his buddy's house he told me I should tell them the news, when I didnt want to because I hate talking about myself he asked if could tell them, which I told him was OK. they were all happy for me too. Honestly, he's reaction was better than I even hoped for, but looking back I should have expected it from him because that's always been the type of brother he is.

TL;DR told my brother I got into the university and he incredibly supportive and happy for me. He told me not limit my success to make other people more comfortable, and that he was proud of me (which meant a lot to hear).

ANSWER: Respect to the brother for being 19 but behaving like a real adult here. Setting a great example for little bro.

QUESTION: Update: My [25f] boyfriend [26m] of 10 months is best friends with his ex [20s?f]. She refuses to meet me and it's getting weird

Link to OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6mql7n/my_25f_boyfriend_26m_of_10_months_is_best_friends/

I wrote my previous post over a year ago, and a lot has happened since then. I wanted to give everyone an update, since the advice on this sub was really helpful at the time.

For a few months after I wrote my OP, nothing much happened. Jeff and I continued dating, and he continued being friends/partners with Jenna. I never met her, but everything else in our relationship seemed to be going so well that I decided I'd try to deal with it.

Things got really hard, however, when I had to take a work contract 12 hours away from home for three months. I hardly saw Jeff the whole time, and I looked at Jenna's instagram almost every day to see if she'd posted more photos of them together. More often than not, she had. Since I wasn't physically present, I felt like Jenna was his real girlfriend. I felt completely worthless and constantly stressed out, knowing my boyfriend was spending all his time with another woman who I already had suspicions about.

While I was away for work, I decided to break up with Jeff. I broke up with as soon as I came back, and I made it very clear that his relationship with Jenna was intolerable for me. I told him he was going to have a hard time dating anyone who wasn't her as long as she was still in his life. He kept saying he didn't understand why it was such a problem. He told me he couldn't control her behaviour, but he promised me he hadn't cheated on me. I explained to him that by allowing their friendship to continue, he was condoning her behaviour. I told him I didn't really even care if he'd physically cheated or not, since he'd already shown disrespect for me and our relationship.

I didn't speak to him for a few months and I went on with my life. I took another contract out of town and even considered moving permanently to another city. One night, though, Jeff called me and apologized. He said he had been thinking about our relationship a lot and realized he had been in the wrong. He said his relationship with Jenna was beginning to feel toxic to him, and he'd made arrangements to dissolve their business partnership. After that, I decided to meet up with him (not necessarily give him another chance) and discuss the situation further. When we met up, he promised to stop talking to Jenna and unfollowed her on all social media.

As of now, he has not spoken to her in six months, and we've gotten back together. We actually ran into her at a concert a few weeks ago, and they didn't even say hi to each other. I feel much more respected and confident in my relationship now.

TLDR: I broke up with my boyfriend. He ended his friendship/partnership with his ex and we have gotten back together.

ANSWER: Wow. Good for both of you that the communication ended up working and you're happy together now. Congrats and hope it works out.

QUESTION: Update 2: I (30F) caught my husband (31M) in an affair and don’t know how to move forward.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/vfJzYwOX6V

Update 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/uMVTyBbusT

Wow. I can’t believe this happened over five years ago now. In some ways, it feels like it happened to me in a different life. I still get messages asking about this and figured I could add some insight into how life can look a few years down the line after everything gets completely and utterly wrecked. Good news—If you put in the work, it looks pretty fucking great.

First of all—where is my ex husband now? I haven’t had contact with him since September of 2020 and largely don’t keep track of things but I can see that this man still follows me on Instagram and watches all of my stories. I considered blocking him, but just let it be. I think it’s the petty part of me who’s living a full life that’s fine with rubbing it in a bit.

He and the affair partner did get married after a whoopsie kid and I’m pretty sure they had another. But they also both lost their jobs as teachers (he got her a job at his school, so she was working with an entire staff that knew they had an affair) and had to move to the middle of nowhere. Last I heard of them, the affair partner had been texting his former best friend unhinged rants about not including them in get togethers or allowing my ex-husband to be a groomsman in his wedding.

But enough about them, because they already took up way too many pages in my story.  When we last left off, I think I had just moved to a new city (shoutout to Richmond, VA!) and was largely just finding myself again. I think the change of scenery was the best thing that I did for myself. I was never meant to live in the suburbs and moving to a beautiful little city where I can walk to coffee shops, bakeries and bookstores honestly helped my mental health as much as the therapy. I bought a house here a couple years ago and have really settled in.

Then I got my puppy, a corgi named Bilbo Baggins who really is the true love of my life. He is the greasiest thing to happen to me and is just such a fantastic chonky guy. We go to a local dog park with a bar all the time and he even has his own lil’ dog social group. Kids aren’t something I plan on, so he is basically my son.

It hasn’t all been perfect. My dad died, my best friend moved across the country, and I largely haven’t really been dating much the past couple of years.  Dating hasn’t been a huge priority for me and my friends say that I’m probably too picky. I say that I know what it’s like to be in a marriage with someone who might love you but doesn’t like you and it’s worth not settling.

But while I may be single, I am fulfilled and busy. My birthday is Saturday and I’ll be spending it in Paris at a Lady Gaga concert. I saw Sabrina Carpenter in Amsterdam, Taylor Swift in Lyon, Springsteen in Edinburgh, Noah Kahan at Fenway Park. Earlier this year I was able to visit Katmai National Park and see the brown bears in the falls. I have a DnD group and a really amazing village of people I love.

I would not be in this headspace if I didn’t go to therapy and work out the why of me settling for this man in the first place. True story: When planning our honeymoon in New Zealand, I, of course, had to plan the entire thing despite him picking the location. He refused to do any driving, so we had to do a guided tour that left on specific dates. He pretended to not be able to get a day off of work when we needed to leave until I started crying and begging him to just ask his boss for it because literally no other flights worked. That’s when he said he actually always had the day off but wanted to make sure I was actually working hard enough to choose good flights.

Anyway, I chose to marry… that and it was a lot to unpack in therapy.  But I’m glad I did because without it I don’t think I’d have built this life for myself. At the end of the day, what happened set me up to live a happier life than what I was living so in some ways, I’m thankful for the experience, shitty as it was.

If you’re in the middle of something terrible, unfair, and world-shattering to you, just know that it’s not forever. While this experience has made me a bit of a believer in karma, I also know that there was a lot of work to get myself out of that big black mental hole. Sometimes it seemed that I would slide back in it but by looking forward and figuring myself out, I eventually clawed my way out. I think you can too—and that you’re worth fighting for.

TLDR: Got therapy, life is good, ex-husband stalks me on Instagram, and maybe we should all get dogs for our mental health.

ANSWER: I feel like following this story and you having this be your current chapter is the best thing I've heard this year.

I'm so happy for you!

Never settle, know your worth. And give the Sir some skritches!

Also, Richmond is a beautiful city. I grew up as a teenager there.

QUESTION: I (22F) just found out my boyfriend (38M) lied about his age for a year—what do I do?

I (22F) recently found out my boyfriend (38M) lied about his age for a year. We met at work, got along, and became official 6 months ago. This is my first relationship, and now I feel completely broken.

He claimed to be 31 years old the first time we met. I was unsure about the age gap, but after seeing how well we connected, I decided to give it a chance.

This morning, we went to do some legal paperwork where I needed his ID. At the office, he kept handing his ID upside down to the staff and refused to let me see it after asking nicely, claiming privacy. By then I had my doubts, though I wasn’t exactly sure what he was hiding.

I finally confronted him saying that I needed to see his ID or I wouldn't be able to trust him anymore. It escalated to, "What are you hiding from me?" He never answered directly. Back home, after much insistence, he gave up and told me the truth:

He lied about his age because he felt bad about being old and wanted to feel younger. He said he knew I wouldn’t accept being with him if I knew his real age, and that he “was planning on telling me” eventually because his guilt was getting hard to manage. He admitted that what he did was wrong, then tried to reassure me that it wasn’t my fault, that I was an excellent girlfriend and person, and that everything we shared was real. I closed the door in his face after telling him I needed to process everything.

This feels like a nightmare. And hurts like shit.

I trusted him, shared my life and my love, and even planned a future together—moving abroad, traveling, building a new life. Now I feel so betrayed, angry, and heartbroken.

I can't believe I was lied to for so long, something so fundamental. I don’t know what to do next. Should I try to salvage this, or just walk away?

Edit: About the “legal paperwork” part, I think I worded it wrong. It’s nothing that really binds me to him in any way. Nothing I can’t undo. He just helped me with some documents that I needed to show for my residence certificate.

TL;DR: My first boyfriend (38M/22F) lied about his age for over a year. I just found out he’s 38, not 31. I feel betrayed and don’t know if I can trust him again.

ANSWER: He wanted you to move out of country before telling you the truth.

That would terrify any reasonable person.

QUESTION: Bf left after seeing ex's engagement post

Okay so, I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (30M) for a little over two years now. We just moved in together a few months ago. Last night we were doomscrolling on insta reels and his ex's post popped up abt her getting engaged

I don't rly know much about their relationship in detail other than her cheating on my bf with her current fiance while she was engaged to my bf (they were together for 5 yrs and it's been 3.5 yrs since they broke up), so ik that it didn't end well with them and it's just a sour topic so i never rly bring it up. I don’t follow her but she's kind of famous on insta as she is a food vlogger and I watch a lot of that content that's y she popped up.

Anyways when he saw it he like froze and became tense i asked him if everything was ok and he said yeah but i asked if that he looked tense because of the post he just brushed it off and rolled over to go to sleep and then thing is we didn't even rly cuddle when we cuddle like almost every night when going to sleep.

I woke up around 2 a.m. and he was gone. Like, completely gone.  he was nowhere in our house. I called him, like, 10 ,15 times. No answer ,Phone was switched off. I even called one of his friends, and they had no clue where he was. I was thinking of calling his mom but ik she would have blown his phone up so i decided to wait and call my frnd she also suggested to wait a few hours so i did

Then around 3:30 ish  he finally calls me back,i ask him wtf is he doing And he just says I'm fine pls don't call me rn ill explain later and he hangs up b4 i could say anything properly

I tried calling again obviously bcoz what does that even mean like I don't get why he would even be upset about that post seeing they broke up so long ago I can't imagine leaving your gf over this at night. He didn't explicitly say anything abt the reason he went off but I'm pretty sure it's bcoz of the post. I stopped calling him after a few times as hes not going to pick up i rly don't know what to do.

Things have been good with us until now this is the first time i have ever felt like I'm being betrayed by him. I don't even know where he is . Should I leave him alone and give him space I just feel sick abt this situation.

Tldr- bf left in middle of night after finding his ex got engaged and is not responding to me

Update-
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/BBZhLPoYPW

Posting again bcoz previous update post got removed for some reason.

Hey guys,
First of all, thank you to everyone who commented , I didn’t expect so many people to respond, and honestly, reading through your messages kept me from spiraling even more.

I tried to go back to sleep after the post. He did come back around 6 am .he looked like shit cuz ig he hadn't slept. He had just been driving around according to him. I didn't even know what to say to him luckily he was the one who talked first. He apologized a lot of times for running away and for ignoring my calls. I obv asked him wtf happened and why he would ditch me like that and abt his ex. He told me he had a panic attack and he didn't want me to witness it so he went to his car and after that he drove off . He explained that it wasn't bcoz he wasn't over her and that he never wanted her back(i asked him if he was still in love w her). He said it just happened after seeing that pic of them together and happy, he said he depressed after everything went down w his ex but he thought he was fine when he started dating me and that he has been rly happy.

But he panicked bcoz it hit him that she was actually happy and their break up hasn't affected her like it has him seeing she was with the guy she cheated on my bf with and he started overthinking that what if he could never be happy like that when  getting engaged again and getting married to me.

I was honestly a bit shocked at first bcoz we had talked abt how he would love to marry me someday and I didn't rly understand how to comprehend this info but we talked for like 2 hours and he was genuinely sry and he doesn't seem like he's not over her.

He did say he wants to find that kind of happiness with me and he wants that future with me and he apologized again for being an asshole. I made it clear to him if he ever runs off like that we r done and he agreed and honestly we were both kind of crying by the end of our Convo and i also blocked his ex on my insta (he already had her blocked b4 anyone speculates)

I think i could forgive him. Thank you again for all your help the comments helped a lot. We might try therapy.

Tldr- he came back and we talked abt how he had a panick attack thinking if could be as happy as her and we resolved it out.

ANSWER: i dont understand why people are attacking you in these comments. if i had made it to the stage of moving in with someone and one night they left out of nowhere, id be concerned too, no matter what happened the day before. and while yes he probably just needs time to process the engagement, it wouldve been easy to tell you that. he didnt even have to say it in person or on the phone, he could leave and then send a quick text right after to let you know that he just needed some time alone and that he was alright. you're valid to be upset about this

i understand his distress but it's been 3 and a half years. the least he can do is give you the courtesy of telling you he was leaving to be on his own for a bit instead of letting you wake up alone in the middle of the night and leaving you to panic

QUESTION: UPDATE- Married within a year, and now I’m seeing red flags I ignored before — how do I handle this?(27F/33M)

Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/t08KmdcFxt

Update:

27F/33M

I had a conversation with my husband yesterday and gave him an ultimatum. I brought up therapy again, something I’ve suggested in the past, but he said he can’t do it right now because he’s looking for a job and wants to be financially stable first, which I can understand. However, he also said that even after getting a job, he would only consider therapy, then went on a rant about how therapy is useless.

I told him that if he’s not open to therapy, he could at least speak with a pastor or counselor at our church since that is free. He refused again, saying he has too much on his plate. I even suggested having just one conversation and not committing to anything long-term, but he said he’s tired of me bringing it up.

At this point, I’ve decided to leave. I’m currently looking for a job and hoping things fall into place so I can get my own place soon. I feel scared and heartbroken, but I know it’s necessary. I wish I hadn’t ignored the red flags, but I’m choosing to give myself grace. It’s a terrible feeling, but I know I’ll be okay.

Thank you to everyone who commented on my original post. Your words gave me clarity and courage.

TL;DR: He refused therapy or help, so I’ve decided to leave and start over.

ANSWER: It seemed very clear from the post that he didn't actually want to change, someone who recognised their own insecurities and wanted to change would stop making it yours manage and go to therapy, he's done neither. You've made the right choice.

It sounds like neither of you are currently working, I don't know how you sustained that situation but do you have family or friends you can go stay with so you can leave immediately? Even if that involves moving, it's not like you have a job tying you to your current area - which obviously isn't great financially but freeing in terms of leaving and starting afresh.

QUESTION: My (35f) mil (60f) only wants provide childcare for our daughter(3 months f) not our son (3m) and my wife (33f) and I are not on the same page as how to handle this.

Hi everyone,

My mother-in-law initially offered to help with childcare one day a week and seemed enthusiastic. However, after our daughter was born, she made it clear she only wants to care for her. She claims it’s “fair” because she didn’t help with our son when he was a baby and my mother did.

For context, we did offer before our son was born and my mother offered, but when we asked, my mil reacted like a deer in headlights, so we dropped it. We’ve had multiple discussions since, explaining that we don’t agree with her only wanting one child, and she seemed to understand—but a week later, she goes back to only wanting to care for our daughter and pretending we agreed to that.

We’re unsure why this is happening. It might be because we’re a lesbian couple and she only wants to bond with the child she is biologically related to, or maybe she wasn’t ready before but is now. Either way, she has said multiple times that she doesn’t want to take care of our son. She has said this in front of our son.

I feel like the weekly childcare arrangement is off because I don’t trust her to care for both children equally. My wife feels that we haven’t explicitly said she must take both children or none, and that we should give her a chance.

This argument is devolving in my wife saying I'm trying to isolate her from her parents and I'm treating her like she is a bad person. I just want to protect our kids. I don't know what to do anymore. Should I truly offer her another chance?

tl;dr my wife and I heavily disagree how we should handle my mil wanting to play favourites with childcare

ANSWER: Why do I feel like because your wife gave birth to your daughter and you gave birth to your son, your MIL thinks daughter is her grandchild while son is NOT?

Have you ever asked your wife, what would she tell your son when he asks “Why Grammy never let me stay” or “Why Grammy doesn’t like me” or “Why Grammy always prioritize little sister”?

This is something you should clear with your wife first, because she is enabling her mom’s favoritism and her way of not counting your son as family. What if she escalates? What if she tries to exclude your son in family activities? What if resentment builds between your children due to Grammy?

QUESTION: My boyfriend (33M) keeps saying “Have fun on your date” whenever I (32F) leave the house — how do I get him to stop?

Almost every time I leave the house, my boyfriend says something like “Have fun on your date.” Sometimes he’ll even text it to me after I’ve gone.

There’s absolutely no reason for him to think I’d be seeing anyone else. Nothing’s ever happened that would make him suspicious — he just says these things out of nowhere. I find it really disrespectful and gross. I’ve never cheated, never given him a reason to doubt me, and I don’t even have anyone else in my life I could “go on a date” with.

We’ve lived together almost the entire year we’ve been dating. He didn’t used to say things like this, but now he’s constantly making passive-aggressive comments if I’m on my phone, like:

“If you want to talk to someone else, just do it.”
“You don’t have to hide that you’re talking to another guy.”

I’ve told him many times how offensive and damaging these comments are, but he doesn’t care — he seems to truly believe that what he is doing is somehow harmless.   I feel my respect for him slipping every time he does it. I’m honestly at the point where, if we didn’t live together, I’d already have broken up with him. Unfortunately, it is not going to be easy to separate from him at this point or for awhile due to financial reasons.

How should I handle this behavior when he refuses to take it seriously?

Also, how can I articulate the reason why this feels so gross ? I am struggling to find the words.

⸻

TL;DR:
My boyfriend keeps making sarcastic comments like “Have fun on your date” whenever I leave the house, even though I’ve never given him any reason to distrust me. I’ve told him it’s disrespectful, but he doesn’t stop. What should I do?

ANSWER: “If we didn’t live together I’d already have broken up with him”

You answered your own question about what to do next. It just requires the additional step of also moving out.

QUESTION: My mom found out about my private life and says she’ll never forgive me. I don’t know what to do.

I (27F) come from a conservative religious background.  I live abroad now, but recently something happened that completely broke my relationship with my mom (55F).

I gave her my old phone because hers stopped working. Before giving it away, I deleted WhatsApp, thinking all my private conversations were gone. Unfortunately, when she reinstalled it, all my old chats were restored — including some very personal messages and “flirty” conversations.

When she saw them, she was devastated and furious. She said I had brought shame, that I was no longer her daughter, and that she regretted giving birth to me. She blocked me, then unblocked me just to say hurtful things like calling me names. She even told me not to tell my relatives that we don't talk anymore, or she'd show them everything so they'd know the truth about me.

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. She had warned me that if it happened again, she would cut me off — and this time, she did.

I feel destroyed inside. I keep blaming myself, but at the same time, I feel like her reaction is too extreme. I know what I did isn’t acceptable in her eyes, but it hurts to lose my mom like this.
I’m far from home, I feel ashamed and empty, and I don’t know how to move forward.

Has anyone else gone through something like this — especially in a strict religious family? How did you cope with losing your parent emotionally, even if they’re still alive?

EDIT : For context, these messages were related to my active sexual life, so she's hurting for knowing that I'm sexually active.

TL;DR: My mom (55F) found out about parts of my private life that go against our religious background, feels deeply betrayed, and refuses to forgive me. I (27F) love her but don’t know if I should try to contact her again or let her go.

ANSWER: >I keep blaming myself,

The worst choice here is to blame yourself for living your own life.

Your mom is hateful and willing to drop her own daughter because she sent flirty messages. Someone willing to do that is a shameful, awful person.

To move forward, you have to understand exactly this, that your mother is not a good person and that you may be better off without her, even though it hurts now.

QUESTION: My, 40F, husband, 45M,been living with my dad for work. I think he’s cheating.

I, 40F, have been with my husband Brian (fake name), 45M, for almost two decades. We have four kids. A few years ago, we moved from our hometown, a major city, to a smaller, quiet town about three hours away in another state. At the time, we only had our two oldest children, and childcare wasn’t an issue.

Brian was able to find employment fairly quickly when we moved, and I worked from home full-time, which gave me the opportunity to care for our kids, the home, and our marriage. Things were great until I became pregnant with our now third child and developed some health issues.

Because Brian had to call out frequently due to my hospitalizations during the pregnancy, he was eventually forced to resign from his job due to attendance and performance. During delivery, there was an accident and my baby and I almost didn’t survive. The baby was in the NICU for months recovering. She is now a happy and mostly healthy baby. After she came home, Brian worked odd jobs to bring in money, but his primary concern was making sure the kids and I were okay.

A few days before our youngest turned 1, we found out that we were having our fourth and last child. That pregnancy was tough as well, but things went relatively okay until delivery. During the delivery, I was injured by my surgeon, which prevented me from caring for my newborn and our other kids. I was on bed rest for a few months recovering from the C-section and the injury.

Brian waited on me hand and foot and worked reduced hours. We lived off savings and my disability checks from my employer. My father also sent money to help us out. Once I recovered, I returned to work full-time, but Brian wasn’t able to find steady employment. We made things work for a while, but unexpected expenses in the home and with our taxes drove up our costs.

Eventually, Brian found a full-time job back in our home city; great pay, benefits, and room for overtime. My father offered to let him live with him so he wouldn’t have to commute six hours a day or pay any bills while there. Brian was hesitant to leave because I’d still been dealing with health issues since our last child, but I assured him I’d be fine.

At first, things were great. When he moved in with my dad, Brian would call and text frequently; during his breaks, lunches, and in the evenings. We’d video chat for hours while he talked to me and the kids. On Fridays, he’d come home and visit until early Monday mornings. I’d drive him to work with our two youngest kids, then drive back home. Sometimes, the kids and I would go up Friday afternoon to visit him and my dad and drive back Sunday so he wouldn’t be burnt out.

But then the calls started to slow down. I figured he was busy or tired. One night, because we share locations, I checked the app around 10 p.m. and saw he was at a bar. I texted him, asking what was up. He responded around 3 a.m., saying he’d gone out with friends after work. I felt uncomfortable but told myself not to be insecure. I told myself that Brian deserved to unwind after everything he’d done for me and the kids.

The late nights at bars and restaurants continued for a few weeks. The money in our joint account started depleting from his outings to the point where I had to remind him we needed the money for bills. He stopped coming home on weekends, and when I visited, he seemed distant and glued to his phone.

I asked if everything was okay with him and with us. He said it was. I asked about his new friends, but his answers were vague.

One weekend at my dad’s house, Brian was in another room when his phone rang. The name “V” popped up with no picture. I’d never heard that name before. A few minutes later, my dad’s phone rang. I heard him briefly say something to the person on the phone, then tell Brian to “check his phone when he gets a chance.” Brian picked it up, sent a text, looked at me, and set the phone down face-first. I asked who it was. He just said, “A friend.”

My insecurities got the best of me, so I looked through Brian’s Facebook. He doesn’t post much, but suddenly, all his profile pictures had new “likes” from someone who had me blocked. Using my old unused account (under my maiden name), I found that person. It was a woman named Vanessa, 33F.

On her public page, I saw photos of her and Brian at bars, restaurants, and, heartbreakingly, in my father’s living room and building lobby. In every photo, Vanessa was hugged up on Brian or wrapped around his arm. His wedding ring was off. She tagged him in the photos, but the tags didn’t appear on his profile.

I was devastated. Instead of confronting him right away, I packed up the kids and went home. Brian didn’t protest and seemed clueless. My dad asked if I was okay; I said I didn’t feel well and wanted to leave. Brian quietly helped me pack.

I took screenshots of everything. That was three weeks ago.

Since then, I haven’t talked to Brian much. When he calls, I hand the phone to whichever kid is closest, even the one-year-old. I’ve focused on work and the kids, but I keep checking Vanessa’s page and taking more screenshots as she posts more pictures.

Last night, Brian texted asking why I’d been distant. Furious, I sent him all the screenshots. For about ten minutes, I saw the typing bubble appear and disappear. Then he finally replied: “She’s just a coworker.”

I asked him how he’d feel if I were constantly out with a coworker, hugged up in photos. No reply. I asked why he brought this coworker to my father’s house. He said, “Just to introduce them.” I asked why he hadn’t introduced any other coworkers. Silence.

It’s been about nine hours and I haven’t heard from him since. I’m heartbroken. I don’t want to be a divorced single mom, but I refuse to live in with this kind of disrespect.

Advice needed: What should my next steps be?

TL;DR:
My husband (45M) and I (40F) have been together nearly 20 years and have 4 kids. He took a good job back in our hometown and moved in with my dad to avoid a long commute. At first he called and visited often, but then he got distant, started going out drinking, and stopped coming home. I found Facebook photos of him with a younger woman (33F) out at bars, restaurants, and even at my dad’s house, with his wedding ring off. When I confronted him, he said she’s “just a coworker” and hasn’t spoken to me since. I’m heartbroken and unsure what to do next.

ANSWER: Idk what’s worse about this story. Everything he’s doing or the fact that not only did the dad cover for him the whole time, he is also communicating with this woman on behalf of your husband, and right in front of you.  Im sorry, that’s fucked up and I hope you find your way through it. You should not let yourself be treated like that no matter if it makes you a single divorced person.

QUESTION: Found my partner’s old divorce case online — don’t know what to believe now

I (27F) have been seeing a man (35M) for about four months. He’s divorced and has a young daughter. He told me that his marriage ended because of his ex’s accusations and that she was a narcissist.

I just found their divorce case online. It matches what he told me but with details that shocked me: ICU stay, which I knew about, but it mentions seizure from alcohol use, bottles hidden around the house, and his ex claiming he wasn’t safe around their kid.

He told me those things were exaggerated and that the judge ruled in his favor for 50/50 custody, which is true. But now I’m stuck between believing that he’s genuinely recovering and worrying that he still drinks or minimizes it. We smoke weed together sometimes, and he seems totally functional—steady job, great dad, responsible—but I can’t shake the fear that I’m missing something.

I don’t want to judge him unfairly, but I also don’t want to ignore red flags. What’s a fair, healthy way to ask about this without sounding accusatory or controlling?

Tl;dr: found the court case for the guy I'm dating. It mentions that he's an alcoholic to a dangerous level. He's told me that his ex accused him of different things to get full custody, but I'm now concerned.

ANSWER: I say trust your gut. Like, easy as that, trust your gut, girl. Think about it since you’re having to ask reddit.

I once met a guy who seemed okay, but then he got kinda stalkerish and I tried to brush it off because he was very good friends with my friend group. It wasn’t getting better and I looked him up; turns out he was on probation and parole for breaking a girl’s jaw after she broke up with him (and breaking that no contact order). That was shocking, but the biggest shock was that my other friends knew not only how uncomfortable he made me, but they knew about that incident and never told me. Stopped all contact with all of them immediately and called his parole officer.

QUESTION: My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) live together: I found out how he sees the world, now I don’t know if I should stay.

(Re-upload with edits: my previous post was removed for formatting.)

My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been together for two years. I live at his house and don’t pay rent (it’s one of his parents’ properties).

Over the last six months our relationship has been slowly deteriorating. I’ve had multiple conversations with him about how his communication style hurts me and others, and how little effort he puts into understanding me.

A few examples:
1 Once, I mentioned seeing a male friend and he spent the dinner spiraling into topics like calling himself (grandparents immigrated from Italy to Aus) as “ethnic” as my Asian/Middle Eastern best friend, saying “no one should be friends with Germans, we’ve moved on too fast from the Holocaust,” and “old people don’t deserve respect.” It was bizarre and uncomfortable.

2 When we need to solve small domestic issues (like fixing a drain), he often derails the conversation into his own feelings rather than focusing on the task, getting visibly upset at me.

3 When I’m overwhelmed and trying to self-regulate by being quiet or still, he panics and asks what he did wrong, which forces me to comfort him instead of calming myself.

4 I’m autistic, and my tone can be flat. He often misreads it as hostility, especially around practical or “adult” topics.

5 The other night, he made fun of the way I walked and looked, even doing a hurtful impression. I said “that’s not a nice thing to do to your girlfriend,” and he exploded into, “what about thank you for cooking dinner? Why is it never thank you?”

The breaking point came this week when we took our puppy to be de-sexed. I filled out the vet consent form while he watched. Because I’d be at work during the procedure, I made sure the clinic knew to call him first. I signed my own name at the bottom (as the form requires) and added his details below. Later that day, I discovered a private ChatGPT thread where he described the whole event with anger and resentment, accusing me of being controlling and writing my phone number in its required section (above his) to “belittle” him. Reading that was shattering. It showed me how warped his perception of me has become.

That’s been our pattern: I act from practicality or care, he interprets it as attack or disrespect.

I wouldn’t call our relationship abusive. Most days are neutral, some are lovely, and about 10–20% of the time things get really painful. He’s affectionate and loving, and I truly love him and the life we’ve built: our home, our routines, our puppy. But when anything serious happens, he becomes reactive, defensive, or mean, and I end up feeling small and unseen.

Logistically, leaving is hard. I work part-time (four days a week) and study at university. If I rent, I’ll have around $400 a week to live on. That means shared custody of the dog, major financial stress, and losing the most comfortable home I’ve ever had. But staying means continuing to feel unheard and distorted.

My question: How do I decide whether to stay or leave when the relationship isn’t entirely bad but feels fundamentally incompatible? What concrete steps can I take to make the right decision?

TL;DR: My boyfriend believes I am antagonising him when I’m taking care of logistics or myself. He’s great most of the time and I love the life we share beyond these issues, but I’m worried I’ll never see him the same. I’d appreciate advice on how to move forward and protect my peace.

ANSWER: Your boyfriend is mentally unwell OP.  Take the dog and find a place of your own. There are reg flags all over the place with your BF.

QUESTION: Husband recycled a proposal from the previous relationship.

tl;dr husband proposed in the same exact way, word for word, location etc as he did with his previous relationship. How do I get over this?

I '33F' just found out that my husband '35M' of 7 years, proposed to me in the same exact way as he proposed to his ex wife. 
Same day, Xmas eve, same exact location and used the same shpiel. Thankfully he didn't use the same damn ring too.....

It's not a situation where he wasn't over the ex. I truly think it's just pure lack of originality or imagination. 
Idk if I'm being dramatic but I am hurt and sick over this. I've cried non stop. Can't look at him or even talk to him. I gave him the ring back and told him to do it over and make it special. I wanted my own. But honestly, if he does, idk if that would make me feel better. How do I move passed this? 
This isn't something I would leave him over but it is something that has definitely hurt our relationship. 
Any suggestions on how to work through this?

ANSWER: He lacks originality.  I found out my husband took his second wife on a honeymoon on the same vacation that was the only out of the region vacation the two of us ever went to.  While he was having an affair with her, he was introducing him to the same restaurants I had introduced him to in this city, and my favorite restaurant became "their place."  I would not really move past that myself, to be honest with you.  In fact, he's married to his third wife, and they own a hobby shop based on the only hobby I ever had when married to him, a hobby he used to make fun of me doing.

QUESTION: How do I tell my husband I’m uncomfortable with him staying with a female colleague on work trips?

I was going to post this on AITAH but since I’m 95% sure I’m not the asshole, I guess I’m looking for relationship advice instead. Soooo… would I be the asshole if I \[38f\] told my husband \[40m\] I don’t want him to stay with a colleague \[45F, single\] when they travel together for work?

My husband and Colleague are part of a dozen independently contracted people within a professional creative group, which manages projects with clients. Husband and Colleague find their work to be complimentary, so they’re hoping to work on more projects together. Husband and I live in City A, we’re from City B (where both sets of parents live), and City C is where Professional Group and Colleague are based.

Last time Husband was working in City C he stayed on Colleague’s couch. Fine, whatever, not a big deal for a one-off thing. Then he had a job in City B last week that she worked with him on, and they stayed at his parents house together Tues-Saturday. To clarify: City B is my hometown, where my family also lives. I didn’t know about this until he was on the way out the door Tuesday. If he had mentioned it I probably would have said “oh, wouldn’t everyone be more comfortable if she was put up in a hotel?” Granted, budget was a consideration, but my feeling is that if the group, client, or husband can’t afford an assistant on a project, then it can’t be a requisite for the job. And this isn’t a one time scenario, he plans to keep working with her, so this will definitely come up again in some iteration.

Relationship background: Husband and I have been together for 4 years, married for 6 months. We were actually together for a while 15 years ago but our paths diverged. In a crazy full circle way we were brought back together and I’m happier than I’ve ever been in a partnership. Our relationship is based on mutual respect and admiration, and he is extremely loyal when it comes to friends, family, and me. I want to make it clear that I trust him 100%. This isn’t about infidelity, it’s about boundaries and respect and how he shows that he cares about my feelings.

All week I’ve been dealing with icks and ughs about this. It’s been occupying a huge portion of my thoughts. I was by myself while they were working together every day, sharing meals, presumably hanging out until bedtime? And then of course there are my irrational, neurotic thoughts like “did he make coffee for her every morning? Did she use my MIL’s shampoo? Does he think she’s cooler than me? Is he going to run off to City C because it’s way more rewarding than our life together??” I hate that I’m this insecure and jealous and prone to ruminating on this stuff. Yes, I have a therapist, yes, we talk about this sort of thing.  It might be different if I had met Colleague or knew ANY details about her at all. All I know about her is that they have a lot in common and she’s apparently comfortable with this level of familiarity with a married colleague.

I’m already prepared for how it will go if I bring this up. His reaction at best is going to be invalidating my feelings in the guise of reassurance (“you’re being silly! That’s ridiculous, what are you worried about?”) or defensive (“why are you admonishing me when I’ve done nothing wrong?”) He bristles when it comes to personal critique, which makes it hard to express my feelings sometimes. He’s not one to conform to the conventions of society, so me saying “this is objectively inappropriate” or “this simply isn’t done” would not be useful arguments. He usually means well, but can be really blind to how his actions affect me. I’m really hoping that me saying I’m uncomfortable is enough for him to agree to the very reasonable request of getting Colleague a damn hotel room next time.

Ok, so here’s a part I was on the fence about adding in, because all of the above is enough for being upset, but it’s important in the context of my emotional needs not being prioritized (and it definitely adds to my sensitive emotional state). My mom died 3 months ago, so I drove up to City B on Friday to prep for my mom’s Sunday memorial celebration. I thought Husband was going to join me at my parent’s house across town Friday night, but I guess there was a miscommunication and he had to do a bit more work on this project Saturday. We talked about this on the phone Thursday and he told me he was probably going to stay with his parents Saturday night too, so Colleague wouldn’t be uncomfortable at the house without him there. I basically told him no, I needed him with me. I honestly can’t even believe he entertained the idea of prioritizing her comfort over my need for his support during a huge emotional life event. A few days before the memorial.

I love this person. I trust him, but I’m frustrated and sad. Why is he such a dummy when it comes to all this shit?? The big work job is done, and we got through the memorial. Now I guess I’m looking for some communication advice, some validation, and maybe personal experience. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this.

tl;dr: Husband is overfamiliar with a female colleague. He doesn’t think it’s a problem, but the real issue is that he's oblivious to how this makes me feel. I’m not sure how to raise it without him getting defensive.

ANSWER: Okay so this

> Our relationship is based on mutual respect and admiration, and he is extremely loyal when it comes to friends, family, and me. I want to make it clear that I trust him 100%. This isn’t about infidelity, it’s about boundaries and respect and how he shows that he cares about my feelings.

Does not jive with this

I’m already prepared for how it will go if I bring this up. His reaction at best is going to be invalidating my feelings in the guise of reassurance (“you’re being silly! That’s ridiculous, what are you worried about?”) or defensive (“why are you admonishing me when I’ve done nothing wrong?”)

There’s some cognitive dissonance going on here and tbh I think this perfect marriage full of admiration and respect is a story you’re telling yourself. Because I’m not seeing much respect coming from his side. And I think you’re being naive to say there’s definitely no infidelity going on. He’s having this woman stay at his parents’ house, that’s so far beyond the boundaries of a work relationship it borders on hilarity.

And now he’s trying to abandon you in your time of need to make her more comfortable? At best this is an emotional affair. At worst it’s already turned physical.

QUESTION: My bf (M23) stood me (F22) up on Halloween and doesn’t know why

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years, and he’s always been amazing, but on Halloween, he stood me up and can't explain why. I want to forgive him, but I am still so upset.

We both had different events to go to first, but we agreed that we’d meet up later at a club, which is something we had discussed all week. I knew he was with friends, so I told him he could invite them, but that regardless of what his friends where doing we were going to go out. I texted around 9 PM that I was ready, and he replied saying he was picking up his friends and would meet me at the club. I told him it was a 20-minute walk for me, so he should let me know when he was heading out.

I didn’t hear back from him until 11:40 PM when he texted saying he was finally on his way. By then, I would’ve gotten there around midnight, and I wasn’t comfortable walking through downtown that late. Plus, he and his friends ended up not even going in because the lines were too long. So, basically, I spent hours doing intricate makeup and dressing up all so that I could be stood up by my own bf.

What made it even worse was that the next day was Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead/ celebrate the dead), which was really important to me as I’m Latina, and I just lost my grandpa. My boyfriend was supposed to help me set up my grandpa’s shrine and make food, but he completely forgot.

He came over with gifts to apologize, but his only explanation was, “I’m sorry, I don’t know what happened.” When I asked if he thought it was okay for a woman to walk alone downtown that late, he lied and said he would’ve gotten me an Uber, but nowhere in his messages did he mention that. He also tried to play it off as “miscommunication,” when it was really just a lack of communication on his part. I told him I needed space and sent him home.

Later, when he apologized again, he kept saying that thinking about what he did makes him upset and sick. Normally I appreciate when he expresses his feelings, but I told him that in this case, I truly didn’t care how he felt because I was the one who was wronged and upset. I don’t know if that was too harsh, but I genuinely don’t understand how him being nauseous was supposed to help me feel any better.

The next day, after some pushing, he said he’s been emotionally checked out because of how stressful his doctorate program has been and that he forgets things easily when they’re not “in front of him.” I don’t really know what to make of that.

He’s always been supportive and kind before this, especially when my grandpa passed. I don’t think he’s cheating, which I know is always possible, but cheating is one of his biggest fears, so I doubt this is the case. This whole situation isn’t typical for him, but his explanation feels weak, and I’m not sure how to move forward. I want to forgive him, but I also feel really hurt and disappointed.

How would you handle something like this? Should I try to talk to him again, or just give him more space?

ANSWER: He was out enjoying himself with his friends and totally ‘forgot’ he was supposed to be meeting up with you. He doesn’t want to admit that, so his ‘I don’t know what happened’ isn’t true, and is flimsy at best. And the fact he thought it would be okay for you to walk to a club at that time is absolutely ridiculous plus, and I’m just guessing, he was too hungover to help you the following day when you really needed his support. All in all, he hasn’t exactly covered himself in boyfriend glory, has he? Updateme!

QUESTION: I want to divorce my husband. But he wants another chance. Am I being heartless?

Hi reddit. Like the title says, I (f31) want to divorce my husband (m32), but i'm afraid I may be acting too quickly? For context, we've been together for 12 years, married for 3. He's always had a strong temper and frankly, my parents never fully approved of our relationship because of it. I'm the complete opposite, shy, eternally optomistic, a little too nice (husband says I'm a pushover). Anyway, while we dated he would often be rude to me but his excuse was that he was stressed out from college or he was tired, or he had something else going on. And I believed him.

Fast forward to our first year of marriage, and I found out the hard way that it wasn't college or any of that. It was just his actual personality. He hates talking about, well, anything. We never talk about money which is outrageous to me because we're married, I can't talk to him about family drama because it annoys him, can't talk about my feelings because he'll get mad, insult me and walk away. He's not only rude to me now but to my parents too. Despite the fact that they've given us a house, a piece of land, helped us get out of a debt, etc. And I could not be more embarassed.

Mostly, I feel stupid. My parents warned me again and again. My dad especially, because he noticed early on how different we were. But my husband always said opposites attract (sounds kind of stupid now). And he wasn't as mean then as he is now, in fact, he got along great with my parents back then. He even got them gifts and things. Now, he's moody all the time but even moreso when we go over to their house. He won't even engage in conversation, all he does is look down at him phone the entire time. It honestly feels like he doesn't care about being part of the family. Whenever someone tries to give him adive, he doesn't take it well, like he's smarter than everyone else and there's nothing you can say to him that he doesn't already know. The few times we do talk, we end up arguing because everything I say is always wrong and "i don't know what I'm talking about" or "I'm ignorant". Mind you, we both have college degrees. All in all, I'm just so disapointed and embarrased by the kind of person he is. Btw, he's not like that around his friends.

I brought up the possibility of getting a divorce during an argument and he's been nicer to me ever since. But I've seen this side of him before. He's promised to change in the past and has said that he can't live without me. This is the only time I've truly seen him so remorseful though.

TD;LR: Am I being too rash in suggesting to my husband that we divorce because of how he treats me? Should I give him another chance?

ANSWER: No, you're not being too rash to divorce someone who is not nice to you or your family and has never been, who insults you and who you can't communicate with. In fact, I have no idea why you've stayed with him this long.

QUESTION: How can I (21M) make my Chinese dad (61M) get a life?

The title might sound a bit harsh, but I honestly don’t know how else to phrase it.

There’s a lot to unpack here, but here I go (TL;DR at the bottom):

My dad is a Chinese immigrant who moved to California in the early 2000s. To this day, he hasn’t learned much English, which has really limited his ability to explore new things — even simple stuff like trying non-Chinese restaurants. Over time, that’s made him more closed off and unwilling to try anything new.

He’s naturally introverted, and with his difficult personality and years of working tirelessly since coming here, he’s struggled to make friends. As a result, he doesn’t have many hobbies or much of a social life.

Now that he finally has more free time, I’ve been trying to get him to enjoy life a bit more — to go out, meet people, or pick up a hobby. But whenever I suggest something, he just says things like “There’s nothing to do here in America” or “Nothing interests me.” I know those are excuses — I think it’s hard for him because he can’t read or speak English, so everything outside his comfort zone feels impossible. Still, it’s tough watching him just… fade into routine.

I’d love to know if anyone has gone through something similar or has advice on how to help a parent like this.

Some background that might be helpful:  
My dad doesn’t have the best relationship with our family (my mom, sister, and me). He wasn’t really a great husband or father figure when I was growing up. He and my mom fought a lot, mostly because he’d spend so much time at the casino playing poker — which he insists “isn’t gambling” because it “takes skill” and “helps him relieve stress.” But back then, we were struggling financially, living in affordable housing, so it only made things worse.

He also had a lot of anger issues and poor communication skills. He couldn’t empathize or see things from my mom’s point of view, which led to constant fighting. My sister ended up developing lasting trauma from it, and I’ve always had a hard time talking to him too.

That said, something changed earlier this year. We visited some old family friends — people who somehow have stuck by him despite knowing his flaws — and they had yet another intervention with him. This time, it seemed to click. Around the same time, I broke down in front of him and told him how all of this affected me. I think that really got through to him, because since then, he’s been trying to change, little by little.

Honestly, I’m still conflicted. Writing this all out makes me realize how complicated it is. My dad isn’t the best person, but he’s still my dad — and I know he did what he could with what he had. I just want to help him find a way to live more meaningfully instead of wasting away.

TL;DR:  
My dad isn’t perfect, but he’s still my dad. He doesn’t have many friends or hobbies, and I want to help him find some so he can live a fuller, happier life. Any advice or similar experiences would really mean a lot.

ANSWER: Your best bet is probably to find out where other senior Chinese guys hang out and take him there. He'll be able to communicate and feel a lot more comfortable. Maybe he'll make friends.

QUESTION: M55 How direct can you be to ask relatives to invite you for the holidays?

I (M55) am suddenly without immediate family: no spouse, no kids and nobody at home with me.

I am dreading the holidays.

I have (1) an aunt, uncle and cousins in one city a few hours away and (2) a brother and his family in another city a few hours away.

I’ve usually just waited for invitations and if they didn’t come, I’d spend holidays with immediate family at my home, but immediate family is now gone.

My sister-in-law has said “we’ve got to get you to come out sometime” and I said, “sure!”, but I don’t know if that was just a general statement or if it was supposed to be an invitation.  My aunt said, “we need to stay in touch” but it would be kind of weird to invite myself to their house.

How do I get an invitation for Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas dinner?

That’s all I need; I can stay in a hotel.

TL;DR: how direct can you be in asking family members for an invitation for the holidays if you’re all alone?

ANSWER: My brother reached out for a thanksgiving one year, he hadn’t been to family events in years. He just said “hey sis, I really wanted to spend the holiday with family, do you have anything going on that I could come to?” damn near broke my fucking heart that I didn’t make it clear enough to him that he’s ALWAYS invited, I didn’t ever think I needed to invite him to these things.

I’m really glad he asked, because now I always invite him.

QUESTION: My (23F) BF (23M) said he’d consider breaking up with me if I changed my appearance and now I can’t look at him the same.

TL;DR:
My BF hates all forms of body modification and has made it clear he doesn’t like when I change my appearance. When I mentioned tattooing over a fading mole, he sternly told me not to “Do that to my face.” When I asked if he’d break up with me over something a bodily change I made he didn’t like, he said yes. He apologized afterward, but I can’t shake how disrespected I feel or how hard it is to be affectionate again.

I (23F) have been dating my BF (23M) “Andre” for a little over 2 years. It’s both our first relationship. Andre has always hated any kind of bodily change: tattoos, piercings, dye, even getting a hand stamp at the bar. He scrubs it off the second we get home.

I’m the opposite. I love tattoos (I have 3), I’ve dyed my hair ginger (naturally blonde), and I have a few piercings. Since we started dating, though, I’ve only added one ear piercing and changed my hair tint slightly. Whenever I bring up wanting something new (like tattoos or piercings), he gets visibly uncomfortable. His voice goes high, eyebrows raise, and he starts asking, “How much of a change are you thinking?”

His facial expressions alone have always felt like a subtle threat to our relationship. if I go too far, he’ll stop being attracted to me or even consider leaving. That’s honestly a big part of why I’ve stopped changing my appearance at all.

Earlier this week, I mentioned that a small mole on my nose is starting to lose pigment, and I brought up maybe tattooing over it with brown ink kind of like a freckle tattoo or microblading. His response was instant and firm: “Do not do that to your face.”
That hit me hard. He didn’t even ask why I wanted to do it or how I felt about it just completely shut it down and told me what to do.

Later that night, I texted him and asked, “If I did something to my appearance that you didn’t like, would you break up with me?”
His reply: “Yes, I could see it playing a factor.”
My stomach dropped. I called two of my friends to make sure I wasn’t losing my mind and they both said that was insane. I ignored him for a bit, and when he called back, I ended up yelling at him for almost an hour (which is unlike me). That’s when it seemed to finally hit him how serious this was. He started crying, apologized, and admitted he was being inconsiderate and disrespectful. The next night, he told me he realized how entitled it was to act like he has any say over my body, and that he needs to work on his reactions. He said he understands I’m my own person and that my choices have nothing to do with him.
I told him straight up that he needs to always speak to me like an equal, and that just because he gets to see my body doesn’t mean he gets to control it. I made it very clear if he ever does this again, I’m gone.

I also told him I’m not applying to jobs in his area anymore. Someone who would consider breaking up with me over a freckle doesn’t deserve me moving states for them.
We’re still together, but now I feel… icked out. I don’t want to be affectionate or sweet toward him. even though he’s apologized and seems to be reflecting. I feel like he doesn’t deserve that from me right now, but I also feel mean with giving him nothing to work with.

How do I forgive him? Will that natural affection come back with time? Is it harder because we live far apart? I get forgive but don’t forget, but how?

ANSWER: Relationship aside, please be careful about tattooing over your mole. You want to be able to monitor moles for changes and tattooing over it could get in the way of that.

QUESTION: How do I (26F) break up with my fiancé (28M) of 7 yrs without destroying him? The timing feels cruel.

See my last post about why…

TL;DR:
I love my fiancé but know the relationship needs to end. He lives with me in my family’s home, is struggling in school, and has a birthday/holidays coming up. Ending things now feels cruel, but pretending until the end of the year also feels wrong. How do I break up in a way that causes the least damage?

I (late 20s F) am at the point where I know I need to end things with my fiancé (late 20s M). I love him, but after reading the feedback on my last post and really sitting with the things I didn’t want to admit, I know I can’t continue this relationship.

The problem is… the timing feels awful.

He currently lives with me in my old family home. It’s not technically either of our places—my parents don’t live here, but two of my adult sisters do. Asking him to leave feels like kicking him out to nowhere, even though he does have family he could go to. I just know it’ll shake his sense of stability.

He’s also really struggling in school. I don’t want to pile this on while he’s barely hanging on academically. College is rough, I’ve been there and completely understand. I’ve told him multiple times that I’m unhappy, but I know this will still blindside him.

Part of me wants to end things now because living like this—acting like I’m not completely torn—feels emotionally draining and dishonest. But the other part of me wants to wait until the semester is over… except then it’s his birthday in mid-December, and then Christmas. It feels cruel no matter what.

I’m torn between doing what’s healthiest for me vs. trying to protect him from more stress.
Do I need to end it now, or should I let him have the end of the year without adding this pain?
Any advice on how to do this in the least damaging way is appreciated. Honestly I’m not sure if I’m mentally prepared for it now - please give me your honest advice I’ve never had to break up like this before

ANSWER: The only reason to delay ANYTHING about this would be to give him a chance to get his bearings and find a better living situation.

Which would sorta mean breaking up with him and then giving him a week or two or more to sort of figure out his next living situation.

There's no point in delaying through Christmas just to wait until the ball drops on New Year to shout "Surprise, we're breaking up! Pack your shit!"

Also... you need to brace yourself for being the "bad guy" here. There is only so much you can do here to soften this landing. You are about to wreck this dude's whooole existence. The odds of getting a handshake and a thanks for the memories card is... low.

QUESTION: My gf (F23) is trying to move in with me (M31) way too soon

I (M31) started dating his new person (F23) back in July. Things were going great and we decided to make our relationship official after a vacation a few weeks ago.

The problem happened as soon as we got back from vacation. She lives with her mom and apparently when she got back home, she got into this big fight with her mom's bum ass boyfriend. Now she refuses to go back home until homeboy moves out. I'm trying to be a good boyfriend and let her stay with me for a while, but "a while" is starting to feel permanent. Her mom's boyfriend doesnt even have a job and theres no sign of him moving out any time soon. It doesn't help that my apartment is tiny and I hate not having space to myself.

A couple days ago she asked me if we could get a place together when my lease ends in February, and since she's already living with me, that would mean she permanently moved in 2 days after becoming my girlfriend. Thats way too fast for me and tbh it feels like shes taking advantage of my kindness and resources. I genuinely don't know what to do because I don't want to kick her out with no place to go but I also don't feel comfortable with her moving in on such short notice. How can we resolve this problem?

TL;DR girlfriend of 2 days is trying to live in my tiny apartment now

ANSWER: Well, first of all, if you date a woman eight years younger than you she’s gonna be in a different place in life and have different expectations. That should be a no-brainer. You want a grownup, date a grownup.

That said, you’re going to have to have a conversation with her and however you put it, she will feel rejected and upset. Just be prepared to remain calm and kind. Explain that you’re not ready to live with someone. That you need her to have a plan for her living arrangements that isn’t just live with you.

QUESTION: Update: How do I (27 M) get my gf (24 F) to understand that I can’t do it all on my own. Is this the end?

My last post on this [(can be found here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ok0qa9/how_do_i_27_m_get_my_gf_24_f_to_understand_that_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) got a lot of responses so I wanted to give a recent update.

A couple days after that post, on November 1st my family had a Halloween party. We attended as we have been staying with my parents. It was fun, it was going good. I allowed myself to just relax, had a few drinks which I don’t often. I “let loose”. This all came crumbling down though when my gf made a comment/joke about getting married. She asked “Do you want to marry me?” I said “Yes!” She asked “so when are we getting married?” I said “When we get married!” she responded “So you don’t want to marry me” I responded “That’s not what I’m saying” and then it got quiet. Now mind you, this was a few hours into the party, after we had a good bit to drink. So it wasn’t really the time or place to have a serious conversation about our future marriage.

Later we are in our room, to escape the party for a bit. She says sorry. I tell her thank you. She says something about how it was just joke. I tell her that the joke isn’t really funny given we’ve had all of these conversations regarding issues we’ve been having, how before we even really think about getting married I’d like for us to be out of my parents house again. She says she wishes joking about marriage wasn’t a stressor. I said that it isn’t just about the marriage, it’s about the accusation that I don’t want to. When I’ve been trying so hard to get us to a point where we have our own place, where I can afford a ring, where we have finances to plan a wedding. And know we are having a good foundation for our shared future. And the fact I reassure her nearly every week. I do so many things to show her I love her, care about her, and want a future. So when she says things like that, I feel unheard in how much I am struggle to carry all of this by myself.

The rest of the convo is a bit of a blur (alcohol and it being late doesn’t help), but it turns into a fight. It went on for about 2 hours. Which really sucks, because I’ve said time and time again I’m really uncomfortable having these conversations while we’ve had drinks and when it’s late. But nonetheless there we are.

I tell her that I don’t want to get married until I feel like I can depend on her. She says that I can, that she listens to me when I talk about work. I tell her that I mean like seriously depend on her, like what if I lose my job? What if I get deathly ill? I want to feel like we aren’t totally fucked, because she will be able to be there for us. I tell her about how we were supposed to have a check-in mid-October, to discuss her progress on things we had talked about fixing in July to keep the relationship going. That we never had that check-in, and it is past that but she hasn’t done these things. I told her I was glad that our conflicts had become less, but that these things were still not being met. She immediately got defensive and said “so how long were you going to wait to talk to me about this if I didn’t joke about marriage?” I said “not long at all, I was getting my thoughts together, and deciding when we should sit down and talk. October just ended.” She ends up telling me about how she has looked into a program at our old university and how she has had two phone calls with them that led nowhere. I was aware of one of these. I asked if she had ordered her transcript and applied to FAFSA like we talked about. She said no. She said it’s all confusing and she doesn’t know what to do. That it’s “hard.” I tell her “You can ask for help when you starting do it and I’ll help. you know when I was looking at going for my masters recently, I applied to both FAFSA and got my transcript in one day. It isn’t hard too hard.” she then brings up us having different capacities.

It some how derails and we are talking about the past. It’s hard to remember all that was said or how we got there. But I do remember telling her how it’s hard to trust her, because she hasn’t done these things, and because right before her psychosis this year, she admitted to me, that early in our relationship she had been posting nudes on a secret Snapchat to try and sell them, browsed Tinder, and apparently had her coworkers thinking I was abusive, that we were in an open relationship, etc. She justified the nudes by saying she was trying to make us money (which we didn't need to do, as I had a teaching job at this time. Also I don't have an issue with some posting nudes online, it's that we had talked about it early on, as she used to do it, and I told her I just didn't want the one's she sent me to be the same one's she posted, because I wanted to feel special, and then SHE decided she didn't want to do it anymore), and that she only did it like once a month, and didn’t do it for that long. And also that it never came up. As if I was supposed to know and ask?? She didn’t respond to the Tinder thing. She also said she didn’t know why her coworkers thought that of me, that she always told them how great I was. She said she speculates it’s because they thought it was odd she had a job and needed to work while I had a teaching job. I told her that, the point is she kept that all from me, while I took my first “grown up job” to try and start building our future, and she was doing all of that, and kept it from me for years. She said she was super supportive of me during that time.

We end up back to the original topic of what we had agreed she would do. I said something about how she has had 3 and a half months to make real progress and figure these things out, and she has done less than what I managed to do in a single morning. She got upset and she said very angrily “so what you want me to get my transcript, apply for FAFSA, and start applying??” I said “well yeah, that’s what we agreed to. It was either that or find another job.” She was upset that I didn’t see her having a phone call with a university about a program as enough. She said she needed me to see that as a good step. I said it was a good step, but it isn’t what we agreed to by this point. She was upset and said something about “so the conflict being less isn’t good? Because I haven’t done this?” I said “No I’ve said the conflict being less is good, it’s just that this was an important part of what we agreed to.” I had said several times in the conversation I was happy about that. I also around this point reminded her what I said last time we had these talks, which is that if she didn't want to go back to school or get a better job, that it was fine, we would just be wanting different things in life, and I wouldn't hate her for that, I would still love her, we would just not be compatible which happens sometimes. She stated multiple times this is what she wants, this is what she wants to do.

Honestly, this whole thing for me is in fragments. I remember points at which she kept trying to change why we almost broke up in the past. She tried to say she is worried to talk to me because I’ll just “break up” with her. And I had to tell her the reason we have almost broke up, was the first time, it was because I told her I got tremors and heart rate spikes when I felt like we were going to have conflict and she belittled me for it. The second time it was because she continuously ran over my boundaries, and had a whole meltdown that started from her tripping and falling when hanging out with family and being embarrassed. Which then went from me supporting her for being embarrassed and trying to make her feel better, to somehow being accusations that I didn’t love her, and she spiraled for like 4 hours, until nearly 5 AM, threatened to not go to my nephews birthday party with me the next day because I told her I think it’d be best if we continued talking about it in the morning, since we were both tired and have had a few drinks. Which she refused to do, and she blew up my phone and criticized my therapy for “changing me.” These weren’t light hearted moments for me, these weren’t just any conversation leading me to think it may be best for us to part ways. This is the second time she has tried to reframe these scenarios as me casually wanting to leave. Instead of what they truly were, which was her pushing me as far as I could go. She also said it’s my fault she has the job she has. That I “made her take it.” Because I’m the one who found it, and told her to apply to there, to get out of the other job that was making her absolutely miserable. Like that job made her seriously depressed. And that we had agreed it was something she could do while she figured something more long term out. But I never made her take it, I suggested it because the other job made me very worried for her and her mental health.

I had 5 heart rate notifications from my Apple Watch from the stress of this conversation. By the end things had settled, she apologized for not doing more, and asked me to promise I wouldn’t break up with her the next day, the next week, and this year. The party was over and everyone had gone to bed, so I missed out on seeing my aunts for longer as they left before we even woke up the next day.

Since then, I’ve just been feeling very confused. I feel sad, angry, confused, and kind of numb. I feel like I don’t remember everything, so if it seems like it doesn’t make sense, I’m sorry.

I just don’t really know what to think. Part of me really feels like this is the end. I just felt like all of our issues are not being dealt with, and that every issue we’ve had, I have to fight against her rewriting what happened. It’s just so confusing. I love her, I really do, so my heart hurts, but I just feel like things shouldn't be this hard. She's been extremely kind since this conversation, and she submitted to get her transcript. But yeah I just don't know. I am really just exhausted of things being like this, and I really wish we didn't have to have an argument for something to happen.

TLDR: Update from my last post. We had a chat, under not good circumstances. I feel very confused and lost. I think maybe it’s just time to throw in the towel. Is this something that can be fixed? Am I being reasonable?

ANSWER: Hon, she is never going to grow while you’re taking care of (frankly enabling) her. She needs to be on her own to figure shit out, and you deserve better than this. Break up, make it a CLEAN break, no contact, and recover. Once you are outside of the situation, you’re gonna realize how unhealthy it is.

QUESTION: My (30F) boyfriend (28M) doesnt have a job and just got kicked out. Im concerned about him staying at mine. What should I do?

Hey humans, I need perspective. Help a friend out. I (30F) have been dating a guy (28M) for two years.

At the beginning of our relationship I was struck by the depth of our conversations, his (verbal) support of my painting, and how he turned his life around (gave up drugs and alcohol 3 years ago). He took practical steps to show up for me—changed the litter box for my cats, took the recycling out, took my car to get the tires rotated. In the past I dated guys who talked a big game, but never did anything, so I felt so hopeful.

(For extra context, both of my parents are mentally ill drug addicts so there’s lots of pain there and kinda… hope for care? Which I know I need therapy for).

Anyway, while we’ve been together I squared away my first year of a social work masters program and it was the hardest thing Ive ever done. In the meantime, he lost his job 8 months ago and has been playing music on the weekends to scrape by. I told him the high risk of that (lack of savings, etc) was making me nervous. He also really wasnt scraping by bc he didnt have enough money for food… so I started paying. Now I buy almost all of our groceries, and Ive been pleading with him to get a more secure job in addition to music… just a bookstore or something 2 days a week! (or something).

Anyway he wont. He is working really hard to make enough money with music, but he wont get another job. And yesterday he got asked to leave his living situation so… He needs somewhere to land. He’s not from this town, so there aren’t a ton of options. I want to be a good partner and show up, but my nervous system is terrified.

More context: He was asked to leave bc his landlord wanted to move his daughter & her fam into the property. He never missed a rent payment.

He did say he may have found something for work this week, and with losing his housing maybe he’ll be more open to change?

When I question him about the situation I feel like our conversation always ends up with my “trauma.” ie: clearly Im having a big reaction bc I have trauma and it’s not fair to him bc Im not seeing all he does for me.

On top of all of it the uncertainty and anxiety makes me heartbroken bc Im yearning for a “forever home” with someone.

Extra context: before he was asked to leave his place, he was spending most nights at mine anyways. But, it feels different if he were to not have a place of his own.

My question is: If I were a friend, what would you advise me to do? Is it amoral to tell him he cant stay with me? (or maybe to stay with not just me? me part time and his moms part time?) If he does stay here, is there anything I can do to stay sane? (make a chore chart, or something? and have a timeline?). If Im telling him he cant move in… what should I tell him yo do? Im open to the thoughts

TL;DR My (30F) boyfriend (28M) doesnt have a job and just got kicked out. Im concerned about him staying at mine. What should I do?

ANSWER: I think that your gut is telling you something and you should take some time to listen to it. It's not a moral to see that someone isn't willing to really put in the work and effort to build a life and be a partner and want to keep some distance and safety. The fact that you are expressing these concerns and he's chalking them up to "trauma" is really manipulative

QUESTION: How can I help my husband understand that appreciation in marriage should go both ways?

I (29F) and my husband (29M) have been together for 10 years and married for 1. Lately, we’ve been arguing about household responsibilities — but for me, it’s less about chores and more about feeling appreciated.

He often tells me that I should be grateful he helps around the house because he’s the “breadwinner.” I do appreciate everything he does, but I also work full time — 10 to 12 hour shifts, 5 days a week, as a pet groomer. I handle most of the cooking, cleaning, dishes, and general organizing at home. He handles laundry more often, manages the yard and finances, and does most of the grocery shopping.

The grocery part has mostly fallen to him because we’ve been sharing one car. We moved from Philadelphia about two years ago, and until recently, I didn’t have my driver’s license (I used to be really anxious about driving). I finally got my license last week and am now looking for my own car, which will let me help more with errands and take some things off his plate.

Still, when I try to explain that while I’m thankful for what he does, I also deserve gratitude for working and keeping up with the home, it turns into an argument. He takes it as me being ungrateful or trying to “one-up” him, which isn’t what I mean at all. I just want mutual appreciation — not a scoreboard.

How can I bring this up in a way that helps him see that appreciation should go both ways, without it turning into another fight?

TL;DR:
29F married to 29M for 1 year (together 10). My husband says I should be grateful that he helps around the house since he’s the main earner, but I also work full time and handle most housework. I just want him to understand that gratitude should go both ways — how can I communicate that without starting another argument?

ANSWER: You're explaining your reasoning extremely clearly here, and it's a totally reasonable ask - so if he's not "getting" it, it's likely because he doesn't want to. There are a few reasons why that may be, unfortunately none of them are great.

QUESTION: My (21F) partner (21M) just came out as transgender, and I feel confused.

Me (21F) and my partner (21M) have been dating for three years, right before we graduated high school, when she identified as a male. Yesterday, she called me for a serious talk, and told me that she was transgender.

Of course, I want to be by her side and help her with her transition. However, I don’t know what to do, as I see myself only being attracted to men. I don’t want to hurt her because of my sexuality.

I am still so in love with her, and I don’t want to end our relationship, but I see myself as straight. As of now, I can’t see a future with a woman. I don’t know what to do, and I need advice. Should I stay? Should I break up with her? What do I do? The last thing I want to do is hurt her.

TL;DR - My partner just came out as transgender, and I don’t know if I should stay or leave the relationship, as I identify as straight, even though I’m still in love with her.

ANSWER: check out r/mypartneristrans

if you’re not attracted to women, it’s okay to break up - you can support her without being in a romantic relationship

QUESTION: My husband (37M) blames me (35F) for our child being on the autism spectrum

In the pre diagnosis phase he started to shut me out and drink more. She is now officially diagnosed and is a beautiful and happy 3 year old who lives life in her own way. She is minimally verbal and requires a lot of extra support (we are level 2 for those familiar with the level stuffs).

I tried to bring this up. He rejects the notion but isn’t himself. He was my rock and best friend. But I went through a period of time that I couldn’t trust him to take care of her. He let her elope multiple times while I was at work and had to have a home visit from CPS.

I think he is drinking too much and putting us in financial trouble with his drinking and reckless spending. I don’t think divorce is something I want but don’t know how to fix this. How do we move through this? Please do not just say therapy because I have tried.

TL;DR!

We have been friends/ dated since high school. He is a reliable and good person. When I unexpectedly got pregnant with our son (now 8 years old) it was the logical thing to get married and build a life together but now all of that is in jeopardy.

ANSWER: I think the better question is it safe for your child to be in the current environment rather than do you want a divorce. If he is an unsafe person, then you have your answer.

QUESTION: We were ALMOST perfect for six years, bought a house together... then everything fell apart. (Me 25M.. Her 25F)

So me and her been together for 6 years! Everything was great! Even perfect! In my head she was the woman I was going to live my whole life with. We just bought a house and it’s been 2 months we have it. I recently had a harder past 2 months. All my friends were moving some place far so I felt a certain way like I was losing them. So I was a bit more distant, in a mini depression, wanted to do nothing all the time and was always refusing her (let’s say for small activities like walks, etc). I was in my head a lot and was more distant from her and did not really talk about it to her. So she was a bit disconnecting from me.

She, 1 month ago, started to game with a work colleague that she discovered liked playing WOW. They started playing every night and me, not naturally jealous, started to feel things were strange… like she was just watching movies with him online and you know doing stuff she normally would never do.

At a certain point, 2 weeks ago, I asked her if everything was great between us and she then said that she was loving me less. I asked her, shocked and a bit hurt, if she is in love maybe with him or maybe she’s having some feelings for him and she then said yes. My heart shattered… my heart EXPLODED…

We then came to the conclusion where she would stop contacting him. She told him and they stopped talking. The day after she came home and I saw that she was distant. I asked her if she was doubting us and if she still wanted to try working on stuff. She said no, so then we broke up. She moved to her parents’ place...

A week after that she decided that she loved me and wanted to work on us. She came back, I left her as much space as she needed. The first night she spent it on the couch and then the second night she gave me a hug and touched my arm a bit, nothing too serious, and then slept in the same bed with me asking me for a kiss before going to sleep.

The third night I unloaded my bag so I let her know that I feel the guilt, like I fucked up everything by being closed off and being stupid to leave her and not being as much present as I used to be. She after this came in my chest and cuddled me “sensually” and kissed me deeply.

The day after, she came back from work and I saw in her that she was different, a bit weird, bizarre, like she was hiding something. I then asked her if she had something she would like to tell me. She then sat down and told me that she’s not loving me anymore and that she has difficulty trying to work on our relationship and seeing me giving my 2000% for her and she could not give that much to me. She also told me that the whole week she was giving me love not because she wanted to but because she knew I wanted it.

We then had a big conversation, a rough one, and concluded that it’s maybe too early to take the big decision to completely cut off the bridges. The night after I exploded, my heart is destroyed, I don’t know what to think or do anymore, so I go for a car ride alone. She then started texting me a lot. She started asking me where I am and if I want to watch a movie with her. I said yes. We watched the movie, she asked for my hand, I gave her. We then went to bed, she asked me “can I cuddle with you? I need reassurance.” I said yes. We then did some adult stuff...

And now we are 2 days after the movie night. She didn’t tell me I love you or cuddled me since... but this morning before leaving to work she came in the room and kissed me goodbye and said I love you. I love her so much. I have no idea what to do anymore. What to think... I’m lost... I’m hurt... and I want some advice and some exterior advice on my situation.

TL;DR: Been with my girlfriend for 6 years, just bought a house. I went through a rough couple of months and got distant. She started gaming and connecting with a coworker, developed feelings for him, and said she loves me less. We broke up, then she came back saying she wanted to try again, but now she’s unsure and says she doesn’t love me anymore. I’m heartbroken, confused, and don’t know what to do.

ANSWER: Could 2 months of you withdrawing cause this much damage to a 6 year relationship that you describe as great and perfect?

I wonder if she saw it as great and perfect the way that you did.

QUESTION: [UPDATE - 7 years later] For years, my [35F] husband [37M] said that if I want stability in our life, I have to make it happen. I did. And now things are worse than ever. Help?

I was recently cleaning out my bookmarks and [found this old throwaway](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9tdkqa/for_years_my_35f_husband_37m_said_that_if_i_want/), and obviously the two posts I made with it. I'm not sure why now, but I feel compelled to write a followup. Maybe it'll give people the bravery to change or at least an example of how sticking with what you know isn't always the best choice.

An obviously very long story short, with the help of those posts and a lot of long nights of thinking, I left my husband. In fact, it took him going away for a long weekend to realize how much happier and at peace I felt without him around... At first the split was amicable, but looking back I think he was just waiting for me to come rushing back to him once I "realized my mistake." When that didn't happen and he could see I was actually serious about building a new life for myself, a switch flipped. We only spoke when he needed something from me and eventually that stopped too. Enough about him.

I'm now 42, happier and healthier and more satisfied than I've been my whole life. I picked me and that was the best choice I could've ever made. I lived alone for the first time and my god, the peace of having my own space... unrivaled. I ended up staying in that apartment for 5 years, not a moving box in sight. I put art on the walls, I knew my neighbors. I made a home. I grew my career and went back to school. Made friends, built a little community.

I've done a ton of therapy and realized that the abusive patterns my parents created in childhood were just repeating with my ex. I fell in love, a real love, a supportive love that encourages growth and security. I'm doing new work, work that helps people and is so much more than just chasing money. All of those things have created a life that's more rewarding than I ever thought possible for myself.

I've gone through some really shitty times too, illness, cancer scares, deaths, loss... but I have no idea how I would've come out the other side without the community I'd built around me. Even something as simple as people at your local coffee shop recognizing you is a comfort after feeling adrift and alone for so long. Anyway, if I were to respond to myself from 7 years ago, this is what I would say.

>Leave the loser. He doesn't care about you, never did. He only cares about what you can do for him and now that you aren't serving him... well. Just go. You are capable of doing difficult things, and you are worthy of the work it takes to accomplish them. Trust your abilities, trust your gut - it's been screaming at you for years now, honey. Life can be so much more than you've experienced, but you have to make it happen for yourself.

TL;DR: Left my husband, happier than ever.

EDIT: I'm surprised but happy this found so many people! I genuinely thought I was going to bookend this story and have it disappear into the ether. But whatever urge I had to write it, and whatever brought you to reading it... who knows? Maybe it was meant to. Thank you for all the messages and comments, I feel so grateful to have this perspective and experience.

ANSWER: It's really ridiculous the mount [edit: amount] of women I know who leave marriages and blossom, thrive, are so much happier for it. You don't see that much talked about in the outside world. It's really remarkable.

QUESTION: I am considering leaving my husband over keeping a lock on on of our doors and refusing to open it

Hi everyone. Very sad to be posting this but I F29 am considering separating from my husband M33 of 5 years over a big issue we just had a couple of days ago. My husband has always cared about his things, and he puts all his valuables in his office where he works remotely 3 days a week. He put a lock on the outside of the office door 6 months ago to supposedly keep his things safe from our destructive toddler. I let it go, but found it a bit odd since the key is usually no where to be found.

Anyways, I recently went in the office to get our bird's perch out the room, and he was hovering acting really suspicious. He defensively said what do you need in there? And I said the bird's perch...but then instantly felt he was hiding something from me. I also noticed he locked the door after that. After we put our toddler to sleep, I told him I needed to go in the room to change the sheets on our guest mattress because we have visitors soon. He was acting defensive again and said he would do it another time. That is when I said what are you hiding in there? You are getting really defensive, and its weird that I am locked out of a space in my own home and have to ask permission to enter. He got more defensive until I eventually said you need to unlock the door and let me see what is in there because you are hiding something.

Long story short, he admitted to hiding weed in the room and playing video games when I go to sleep. But he REFUSED to open the door. I told him i'm going to sit by the door until he unlocks it because I think he is hiding something worse since those things aren't that big of a deal. You guys, he literally refused. I tried begging, I tried getting the lock open, I tried everything I could think of. Not only would he not unlock the door, but he was gaslighting me the entire time telling me i'm crazy and it must be my pregnancy hormones thinking there was something else in there? He said that if he opens the door, he would be giving in to my pushiness. He also kept touching my leg and telling me he was sorry i'm going through this like I was making all of this up in my head.

Unfortunately, I got too tired around 2am (keep in mine i'm pregnant having to deal with this) and told him i'm going to sleep and whatever he is hiding in there he can get rid of in the morning, but i'm done. In the morning, the room was perfectly staged with his little weed pen out and switch game. He has changed the lock on the door to a normal one that only locks when someone is in the room, but still seems to see no problem with what he has done. He is still adamant that it is perfectly normal to lock a door from the outside if you have important things in there. He also said there was nothing else in there and he just couldn't for the life of him let me in after I said we needed to go through his stuff. He said that was controlling behavior and giving in would be saying that was okay.

I guess what i'm asking is...is it normal to put a lock on an office door even on the outside? Would a separation by the best next steps? I have a toddler and a baby coming, and really don't want to have to do this alone if I don't need to.

ANSWER: Yeah he was hiding something in there. If you’re lucky it’s something he’s just embarrassed by that he doesn’t want to share. But if it’s not that, I’d guess hard drugs or a porn habit that’s borderline cheating, since apparently he needs somewhere private to indulge. You could try asking him for a drug test to see how he responds.

QUESTION: My boyfriend turned me into a baby and I don’t feel like myself anymore

I (30F) used to be a very independent person. For example, I’ve travelled to over 30 countries all by myself by age 25. I knew how to survive anywhere in the world. My parents were abusive, so I escaped home and lived on my own as soon as I became an adult. I enjoyed living by myself and doing everything by myself.

Then I met my boyfriend (27M) a few years ago. Despite being younger than me, he treats me like a baby and started doing everything for me. He always takes me to work and picks me up after work since I don’t have a car. Without him, I would’ve walked or taken public transport. I’ve always been grateful to him for doing this. Not only that, but he also does all the housework. He does most of grocery shopping and cooking and cleaning and laundry. When we go on a trip, he plans everything.

Life with him was so convenient that I got used to doing nothing by myself in a few years. All my friends say they are jealous that I have such a good boyfriend who does everything for me. I thought so, too. But suddenly I realised that I can’t do anything by myself anymore? When he goes on a business trip and leaves me alone for a week, I find it so stressful and exhausting to do house chores like cooking and cleaning, which I always did by myself before meeting him.

I became much less independent than I was 10 years ago and I don’t feel like myself anymore. On the other hand, I feel like I’m finally receiving the love and treatment I didn’t receive from my parents and it’s compensating my miserable childhood. He says I need to be treated like a baby now because I didn’t have the chance in my childhood.

I’m aware that this isn’t healthy in the long term. What should I change?

TL;DR: I used to be an independent person, but my boyfriend treats me like a baby and does everything for me and now I can’t do things like house chores by myself. I lost the independent person I was and turned into a baby.

ANSWER: Girl you got a guy like this. Start picking up the efforts and put in 50% rather than him doing 90%, and you both are SET. If he continues doing all this, he's gonna be burnt out sooner or later.

QUESTION: Bf (19m) and I (17f) were mugged. He ran away and left me alone with the mugger. I can't see him in the same light anymore

Yesterday I was hanging out with my bf and we were in a not so great part of our city. Suddenly a guy approached us to ask for indications and asked us to help him get there and we helped him (stupid i know). After getting there he pulled out a knife and asked for all our money.

Bf ran away and left me alone with the mugger. Lucklily he just wanted my money so i gave him all the money i had and then he went away.

After that i went inside a bar and called my parents. My parents were furious with bf and tried to call him but he did not pick up. We then went to the police and then returned home and after maybe 2 hours i received a call from bf asking me where i was and telling me he alerted the police. I exploded on him and he did not even apologized but kept telling me he did the best he could.

My question is: is there any way to recover from this? My image of him is shattered

TL;DR: boyfriend left me during a mugging. I can't see him in the same light anymore

ANSWER: >>  is there any way to recover from this?

I personally do not think so. I am so sorry this happened to you.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (26F) think my boyfriend (30M) is exaggerating or faking his illness

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jefjhu/help\_i\_26f\_think\_my\_boyfriend\_30m\_is\_exaggerating/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jefjhu/help_i_26f_think_my_boyfriend_30m_is_exaggerating/)

Thank you to everyone who responded to my post and was so compassionate and kind. It was incredible to hear from so many people who actively battle chronic pain/illness and those with loved ones who do. I hope to continue deepening my empathy towards anyone who is struggling with an invisible illness.

On to my update. Armed with some fresh perspectives (and some fresh frustrations, lol) I talked to my boyfriend and told him that he needs to see a doctor or I will no longer be able to support him financially and stand by while he remains unemployed and unmotivated to get the help he needs. I also addressed the idea of managing/balancing his energy levels differently so that we're able to share household responsibilities more effectively, spend quality time together, and keep him doing the things he loves with his friends.

His response was...really bad. He told me that if I'm not willing to "step up and clean around the house" (something I'm already doing) that there's no use living together and that my efforts to clean are the bare minimum and not good enough for his standards anyway. He was also really mad that I haven't taken initiative to take care of yard projects and car repairs. He sat there and spouted off a whole list of things I'm not noticing and cleaning. And, once again, he was focused on this idea that I don't like his friends/am jealous of them and want him spending less time with them, which isn't true at all.

This really stung. He basically brushed over everything I said and focused on my perceived faults. This told me everything I need to know and I told him I was leaving. He was just...mad. Not sad or hurt at all. I'm still crying excessively over his whole reaction. I still don't know how real or unreal his chronic pain is, but I guess it doesn't matter anymore.

Thank you again, everyone, for your support and kindness. I'm truly at a loss.

TLDR: My (26F) boyfriend (30M) of almost two years and I have separated over his inability to address his chronic pain.

ANSWER: OP, I remember your first post. I know you’re very sad right now, and you have a right to be. But don’t let grief overstay its welcome — you are so much better off and he just lost his bang maid, expect him to come crawling back when he realizes you’re serious. Don’t believe anything he says.

This internet stranger is proud of you. You deserve someone who can be your partner regardless of whether they have an illness — that doesn’t mean they’re critical or cruel.

QUESTION: My Husband Told Me He’s Filing For Divorce Today

My Husband (34M) told me (32F) that he’s fed up and going to file for divorce.  We’ve been married for 1 year, together for 4 years. He is very angry, and I feel depleted and numb.

Backstory: 
My husband suffers from a type of OCD called Relationship OCD otherwise known as Retroactive Jealousy. It is where he fixates on my past sexual relationships, particularly on one person, a person who I have not even spoken to in over 8 years.

He can get triggered anytime, anywhere. We could be watching TV and a character will have the same name and he will get triggered. Last weekend, we were at a concert celebrating our one year wedding anniversary and someone came on stage wearing a jersey that is for the same sport this person used to play. He wanted to leave the concert immediately, we ended up fighting and our anniversary was ruined.

Anytime he is triggered, his energy completely shifts from warm, goofy and loving to ice cold and bothered and he shuts me out. It is a very sad, confusing, frustrating and isolating experience for me and for him, it’s mental turmoil.

Pretty much every single fight we have had in our relationship has stemmed from his retroactive jealousy. Other than that, we’ve been extremely happy. Unfortunately, every time he gets triggered it chips away at my happiness. I walk on eggshells and feel anxiety sometimes because I never know when he will get triggered next.

I thought he might get better with time / after marriage because he would finally see that I want him and only him forever, I was wrong.

Ever since he was triggered on our anniversary last weekend and we fought, things have never been worse. Something feels different about this time, like I finally realized this isn’t going away or I’ve hit my breaking point. We’ve been cordial to each other all week and sleeping in the same bed but no sex.

Yesterday, he asked me if “I’m ready to go back to being loving again”. I told him my concerns and how he needs to seek support / medication for this RJ. I also thanked him for giving me space (which literally just meant not initiating sex) and he got an attitude and say “yea well I was upset too”.

It felt clear to me in this moment that he wasn’t really listening to me and to be fair, I sometimes have a difficult time seeing things from his side as well. Sometimes his aggressive approach and victim mindset in conversation makes me automatically defensive.

He ended up storming out of the room and slept in the guest room (where he always sleeps when he’s upset or for his everyday naps) and has been slamming every door he walks through ever since.

At this point, there is so much tension that I told him I will move his things from the master bedroom to the guest room so that we both can have space to process what we’re feeling.

He left for the day to go golfing, a new hobby he picked up that he has trashed for the last 4 years.. While he was away I moved his stuff. I did not move it to upset him, I truly feel broken and anxious when I’m around him now and just need a little space to process everything.

He came home from golf and was livid. He said he wasn’t interested in being roommates and this was no way to live. I told him once again that I need space to process everything and he said rudely “you’ve had enough space, you’ve had a week of space. Instead of moving my belongings all day you could have instead come up with a way to communicate.” I told him I did try communicating with him yesterday and he got upset. I told him that the way he is currently speaking to me is with an aggressive tone to which he replied “Because I’m angry! This is ridiculous. I won’t be married to someone who can’t resolve simple issues, I won’t have kids with that person, I’m filing for divorce.”

I responded that I don’t want a divorce all I am asking for is a little space for us to work through this. I don’t remember what he responded but he didn’t care that I said that and I think again he just repeated he was filing for divorce.

After he said that he left the house. The crazy part is I still don’t feel much? I don’t feel angry or sad, just numb. Perhaps I’m over it or it could be some kind of coping mechanism to protect myself.

I’ve never spoken to friends or family about his RJ because I love him and didn’t want them to think negatively about him. I think it’s finally time I open up to my mother about it. I feel very alone.

I’m not sure what to do or where to go from here. I’ve never been more in love with anyone in my life. He was caring, made me laugh, bought me flowers, supported me when I was laid off from my job, etc. but I am just not sure I can be in this relationship anymore now with how he’s acting. Not taking accountability, being rude to me and instead of giving me the space I need, threatening to divorce instead.

REDDIT: It would help to hear from you (an outside perspective) on this. I am too in it to think clearly at the moment. Even if no one responds, it felt nice to be able to type this out.

TL;DR: Husband has ROCD (retroactive jealousy) that causes most of our fights. After a bad trigger on our anniversary, he’s now threatening divorce because I asked for space, claiming I am incapable of solving issues. I feel numb and don’t know if this relationship is salvageable.

____________________

UPDATE: I am blown away at the amount of support this post has gotten. Thank you to everyone who has responded and to the mod of this post for giving me a great book recommendation. As many of you guessed, his threat of divorce was not real.

For the first time in 4 years I truly put my foot down and told my husband that I will no longer put up with this treatment. I told him that if he continues to choose not to seek help and instead continue to hurt me, then I’m not staying (and he knows I mean it). I told him I love him, but I love me and my mental health more.

Since this long conversation he has set up an immediate plan:

Daily plan: 
 Morning reflection / meditation
 Medicine / Vitamins: Fluoxetine, magnesium, omega 3
 Workout

Weekly plan:
 Meet with therapist / start ERP (first session is scheduled for this weekend)
 Read 50 pages of self help books: 
     The Art of Letting Go - read by 10/1
     The Happiness Trap - read by 10/1
     Overcoming Retroactive Jealousy - read by 10/15
     Brain Lock: Overcoming OCD -  read by 10/30

I told him that I support him, but that he needs to do deep reflection and work on himself before we can start rebuilding our relationship. I plan on leaving town this week to spend some time with my mother and will be working on an exit plan to have just in case the day comes.

I have found a lot of strength and growth within myself throughout this process,  and am very proud of myself.

I can’t describe how it felt going from feeling so isolated and alone to feeling like I have a community who supports me through this post. So if you’re scrolling and see someone who needs help, just know that your comment can make a big difference. <3

ANSWER: This divorce would be a gift, honestly.

I don't know if this is genuine, but its absolutely wild.

QUESTION: UPDATE:  My boyfriend [M24] and I [F24] have too much sex and I can´t handle it anymore. How do I explain it to him that it exhausts me and how do I negotiate new intimacy with him?

Original post: [My boyfriend \[M24\] and I \[F24\] have too much sex and I can´t handle it anymore. How do I explain it to him that it exhausts me and how do I negotiate new intimacy with him? : r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ge7l3a/my_boyfriend_m24_and_i_f24_have_too_much_sex_and/)

I spend a lot of time reading through everyone's replies and looking inwards about how I feel. I gathered my thoughts and spend a few days making a list of what I wanted to say when we have the big conversation. On a weekend when we had planned to spend the day together I sat him down and told him the following points:

I love him to the moon and back and want to show him that I love him, make him feel desired, loved and appreciated

BUT

Having so much sex with such frequency is physically exhausting to me which causes me to avoid sex and even sex acts I enjoy because I don´t have enough energy and motivation to do it. This also causes me to orgasm not as often anymore. I also need time to physically recover before it may even start to become painful. I feel like sex has become the single defining aspect of our relationship and many other parts like doing activities together, romantic dates, just talking and cuddling have taken a backseat. I also feel exhausted emotionally and underappreciated from giving as much as I can (which I gladly do for the people I love) while little comes back from the other side of the relationship.

I then proceeded to explain the things I like during sex and what makes me go wild, hoping to show him that I still want to have sex with him. I also made a few more compliments just to keep the vibe positive and because I meant it.

He reacted pretty well all things considered. He listened and let me finish, but asked for a little time to think about it. Obviously I gladly agreed. We spend the rest of the day together without him initiating once. At the end of the day he said that he wants me to enjoy sex just as much as he does and that he loves me.

I was really hopeful for the next week and a half. We spend our time together like usual and he asked for sex about one half as often as before our talk. We even had days without sex at all. He also started to ask "Do you want to have sex with me?" instead of physically initiating like he did before, like touching me somewhere, hugging me from behind and similar things. He also stopped asking for pictures of me and when he did it were just selfies. I was so happy that I even took the initiative once and he seemingly loved it when I asked for sex.

Then one day he sat me down with a stern look and said that he hated what this relationship has turned into. To him it feels like we are now just roommates or platonic friends instead of lovers. He told me that the one time I initiated after he was overjoyed to finally "fuck me again" his heart was broken because I suddenly wasn´t as submissive as usually (I asked to be eaten out and was on top with some more dominant dirty talk) and that all of that is not what he signed up for. He doesn´t want to walk on eggshells waiting for when I am finally in the mood, but have what he deserves in the relationship.

Basically he gave me an ultimatum: either we return to how it was before the talk starting right now or he leaves me. Guess who doesn´t have a boyfriend anymore?

I spend the last few days bawling my eyes out and eating lots of ice cream and watching some shitty shows. What he said hurt me a lot and I do not love him anymore, but still the feeling of loss and sadness is all too real.    He was my first relationship and for the past two years he was my entire world. No I have to gather up the broken shards he left behind.

TL;DR: I took your advice and talked with him about my feelings. He pretended to be ok with it for a while and then left me after demanding more sex again.

ANSWER: Yeesh I'm sorry, but I'm so glad you stood up for yourself, because the way he reacted exposed even more red flags.

Do not take him back if he asks, he may try to manipulate you with the breakup so that you're more submissive next time.

QUESTION: I don’t want to relocate to India with my husband

Tldr: I, European 26, f doesn’t want ro relocate to India with my husband Punjabi 29, m due to cultural differences and lifestyle changes being too much for me to handle.

My husband is a Punjabi and I am a European NZ. We have been married for three years and he has been living in New Zealand for 10 years. I have been to India many times for three months at a time each go.

My husband has decided he wants to relocate us to India permanently, I really don’t want to. I would never force him to distance himself from his roots but I honestly don’t think I could cope with India for atleast 6 - 8 months a year, he said we could visit NZ yearly apparently. I made a compromise with him that I visit India for three months  a year and he can stay 6-8 months a year. He says life in India would be better for us because we would have more money and he has more connections in business there etc. My husband didn’t agree to this and said where ever and whatever the husband says the wife should follow. He said he Weill buy me a car in India and I can get a job teaching English to pre schoolers. I can only speak the basics on Punjabi and no one in Punjab but his parents and a few of his relatives who don’t speak English anyway.

I am really conflicted and cry about this often because I feel like I’m going to be giving up my freedom and individuality.

The times I have stayed in India have been hard at some points as my husbands house is rural and I can’t leave or go anywhere without him. I don’t get to wear what I like and to be honest if I say I don’t want to eat or drink something that is culturally Punjabi I found his family judged me so much. His parents also told me to stop watching English tv shows in the house. I followed their instructions and turned it off but felt super sad after wards.

I think that maybe I am being selfish for not wanting to live in India but I don’t want to be trapped with no where to go. I think I will go mad. Any insight on my situation would be appreciated. Sorry my paragraphs and words are all over the place, my thoughts in my head and just a mess at the moment.

ANSWER: “Whatever the husband says, the wife should do.” He’s telling you who he is. Just wait until you are isolated and surrounded by this belief/culture.

QUESTION: UPDATE: Boyfriend slept with someone else while we were on a break

Origional post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Z9RsQy6S1Y

Firstly, thank you for all the useful advice I was given on my original post. I was unable to reply because it was locked but thank you all.

Since I found out my (39F) boyfriend (40M) of 14 years slept with someone else, I broke up with him. He stayed living in my flat for 2 months (on a tight deadline) so he could find a home as he is jobless. He didn't. He is now homeless.

His mum pressured me to have him for longer as there is a cold snap here and he's on the streets but I said no. His mum can take him in if she is so worried.

I found out it was the lady he has been spending time with at the gym. I think he wanted to try that to see if it was better.

That is all. I now live alone (with dog).

TLDR: I chucked him out. He's homeless.

ANSWER: If he knew he was going to be homeless that far in advance and didn't sort out any income then that's on him. Who would want to have anything to do with someone who behaves like that.

QUESTION: My husband (63M) goes cycling way too much leaving me, his (60F) wife alone. How do I help him understand he's losing me?

Good people, I need some help.

My husband (63M) and I (60F) have been happily married 30+ years. Five or so years ago he started cycling. He loved it and I was happy he found something he enjoyed and was good for him although I felt he was spending too much money on bikes, tools, supplies, rides in races and weekend trips.

The last few years have been bad with the time he spends riding. It’s getting unbearable for me. He’s gone all the time. He takes two cycling classes a week at the gym, he rides there when he’s not taking classes and he’s out on the road or a path 4-6 days a week for 4-6 or 7 hours at a time coming home after 10 at night on weeknights. Oh, and works a full-time job on top of this.

Last month we went to Florida for three days to visit my family and of course he had to rent a bike and ride. In the last 5 months he’s left me alone to ride on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, Easter and Mother’s Day. He probably went riding on Valentines Day too, I don’t remember. As I post this, he’s in Chillicothe Ohio on a weekend ride and visit with friends.

This is not a communication issue as I have joked, talked, complained, yelled and cried and cried all many many times. I love my husband dearly and don’t want a divorce. But I can’t take being alone anymore. I'd rather be separated and alone than married and alone. But if I leave him, I feel I’d be letting our kids and grandkids down. I’m so lost and don’t know what to do. Nothing I do or say makes a difference to him.

I'm hoping a few people are willing to comment so I can show him this and maybe we can both learn something, or I can gain some insight. Thanks ahead for your helpful comments.

TLDR, My husband rides his bike and leaves me, his wife alone way too much and I have no idea what to do. Can you please offer some advice?

ANSWER: I'd sit down and talk about this and focus ENTIRELY on you and what you need. Do not say the words "you are cycling too much" or it will become an argument about whether he is cycling too much. Instead, say 'I need to spend more time with you" or "I need to know that you'll be physically present on holidays and vacations" and ask him how he's going to make that happen.

QUESTION: Wife is a whole new person after giving birth. I’m scared i’m going to lose her.

My wife [30F] gave birth to our daughter 4 months ago. She doesnt work so she is a sahm. She is NOT the same person she was before the baby. Before birth we got into a serious argument maybe once every few months, now it's almost every weekend for almost no reason. Monday we were supposed to have a date night (drinking wine, watching movies, playing games, ends with sexual relations usually I'm (32M) holding her while we're watching a movie and she randomly blew up on me for no reason. Said she's sick of me and doesnt ever want to have sex again then storms out and locks herself in the bedroom. I prioritize her wellbeing. Make sure she's fed, hydrated, doing well mentally when she's with our daughter. She doesn't even seem happy to see me anymore when I'm home from work. Past fights recently have been about how she's not happy with me anymore after i snapped back one time about her nitpicking everything ive been doing recently (she has never once mentioned this before the baby), she's snapped on me because the baby was crying and I couldn't get her to sleep fast enough, also screamed at me because i ran a yellow light with her in the car. When we fight it's really hurtful things being said to me and I'm always saying sorry trying to defuse. I've done maybe 95% of the feedings at night so she can get about 7/8 hours of sleep consecutively and take baby from the moment i return from work so she can get alone time. I also do a lot of the household chores for her and it seems to land on deaf ears. She refuses counseling and won't talk to me about it and doesn't think it's a big deal. It seems like our marriage is close to an end and I'm scared. I care so much about her I hate seeing her like this. Can anyone relate?

TL;DR: wife gave birth 4 months ago and now randomly hates my very existence.

ANSWER: It could be postpartum depression or anxiety.

Four months post birth is a difficult time regardless, she may also be struggling to adapt to her new life. I remember there were moments where I felt like I hated my husband, especially in the early days.

I would try and get her to speak to a doctor.

QUESTION: Update: I told my boyfriend I loved him right after we had sex. How badly did I mess up?

Sl I (33f) made a post the other night (which can be found here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/TvHzNz4WpV) about how I’m with my first ever boyfriend (37m) and told him right after we had sex that I loved him and he didn’t immediately say it back so I freaked out and tried to backtrack before shutting him down and saying I wanted to move on. I left shortly after and just shut myself out from him for most of the next day. This morning I got a text message from him that said he misses me and was really loved to go out tonight, so I figured what the hell and we went out. While we were out, there was a moment during dinner that I reached over and held his hand and told him I was sorry I ignored him and told him about my abandonment issues and how self-destructive I can be when I’m scared people will leave me. I’m sure it’ll come as absolutely no shock to anyone that he was lovely and patient with me. We went back to his place and were snuggling and I was starting to fade away to sleep…

…then he said “love you, beautiful” (“beautiful” is his pet name for me. Corny but he says it’s very fitting lol). I stopped and then looked over at him, and then he said “you don’t have to say it back.” I said “but what if I wanna say it back?” and he told me to go ahead and I said “I love you too.” I rolled over on him and gave him a nice long kiss and then put my forehead on his before I started crying a little bit. I cannot tell you how badly I’ve wanted to say that to someone since I was 14 and it doesn’t even feel real. Feels like some dream I had that was nice but didn’t happen.

Riding this emotional high I can’t sleep so I’m writing this while he’s sleeping next to me. I have to get up in four hours to have enough time to go back home and get ready for work, but I don’t care. One bad day of crap sleep is forgettable, I’m gonna remember this night for the rest of my life. It’s way too soon for this, but I’m already getting giddy about putting my name in front of his last name.

So yeah. I’m in love you guys <3

tl;dr: follow up to the situation with me telling my boyfriend I loved him. He forgave me for shutting me out and later told me he loved me too.

ANSWER: If we're talking about silly crap we did after only two months... I had a psychotic episode and ran down the highway trying to get away from a guy I met on tinder screaming he was trying to kill me.

We've been together 4 years.

QUESTION: I (43F) read my fiancee's (56M) journals and don't know if I can marry him now

I (43F) am using a throwaway for obvious reasons here. Before I start YES I know I am a huge jerk for snooping in his (56M) email and I definitely found trouble, I accept that. I was working on his computer and his gmail was open and I saw my name so I opened it and it was a Word doc that he journaled. Curious of course I searched his inbox with my name and saw his entries and read them. Some of what he said has devastated me and shaken me to the core. We have been together almost 3 years, the first year on and off and was rocky. We have been living together since the summer. He is not home and I have not brought this up yet. I think I might faint and need some space. Should I get some distance and go to a hotel for the weekend? I thought we were in a great place. Over the past 10 months these are some of the things he's written about me: For reference i put \\\\ in place of my name.

"There are moments, in my dark thoughts, where I feel like being with her is a compromise for me, like this somehow diminishes me and that I am settling for her because I have ruined all of my other prospects and I’m too old to find someone else."

"At times, I wish she had stayed out of my life.  I wonder if I had stayed on my own if someone better would have come into my orbit.  There is so much to deal with, so many bad feelings and darkness.  I find that I am thinking about Lauren a lot but who’s to say that she would be any better.  The reality is that I met her on tour and fucked her a day later.  What kind of woman is that? I feel like I have pissed my life away and this is all that I am entitled to.  I have pissed away all of the good things in my life."

"Someone like \\\\ would never have been able to get to me. When I was younger, I had many opportunities to be with women like her but declined. I am uncertain about whether this is a good thought pattern to have."

"My mind wanders to places, like what it would have been like if someone like Lauren could have been in my life instead of \\\\.  Lauren has the advantage of existing in my mind as an ideal.  We never really got the chance to know each other outside of two nights and a week of texting and talking on the phone.  I know that she had a drug past but has been sober for over a decade.  I don’t think she was promiscuous; most guys that I know that knew her in the old days indicated that she didn’t have a lot of men in her life.  That’s not to say that there hasn’t been a lot of darkness in her life. It would have been easier to be with her.  There weren’t all of these men in her orbit like \\\\.  She was never married, so there was no divorce.  She’s not as emotionally damaged as \\\\.  In some ways, I feel like being with \\\\ is some sort of karmic thing, like this is what I deserve for being non-committal for most of my life.  I have my own damage.  Everyone likes to think that they are a good person but there are moments when I am not so sure about myself."

TL:DR I am not sure if I can go forward with this relationship after reading this.

ANSWER: One: if he could get with Lauren, he'd soon be finding fault with her, too.

Two: run as fast as you can. He doesn't even like you, at all. Don't be a placeholder. You're not even second best here.

I'm sorry for how you feel atm, but it's good that you know so you can make your own decisions.

QUESTION: Update: husband has a new chosen family he prioritizes and sees every week, I’m jealous and frustrated

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/JwBnrT9EL9

It’s been a while since- our little boy is 2.5 now. Thank you to everyone who commented - it was the kick in the butt I needed to lay down the law. Esp the folks that rightly pointed out I was a passive doormat without self respect — that stung but was true.

After my post, I had a big sit down with John on my the things I was upset about. My husband was traveling to be a groomsman for a good friend — I told him to stay out there for an additional week and decide: 
1. if he wanted to stay married and wanted to be a family
2. If he wanted the above, think about what needed to change on his part (not just Pam but other stuff too), how he was going to be a good husband/father going forward
3. Arrange to go over it with me and our marriage counselor on his return

Alternatively, if he didn’t do the above then when he got back we’d start logistics on separation and co-parenting.

And surprisingly, he did all the above. Apparently he reflected a lot at the wedding (his friend and his wife are such an in love couple) and thought a lot about us and our relationship and what he wanted.

He came back and proposed changes (immediate break from Pam/company and stop to their hobby — he’d play some dnd / mtg online but that was it), he’d take over remaining baby prep (nursery, logistics), and   promised to lay out a post-partum care plan for me and baby. He stuck to his word and also worked hard to regain my trust.

Then we had our son and my husband was over the moon in love. He and baby have been inseparable ever since and have an amazing adventure filled life with all the hobbies (baby/toddler swim, gym, soccer, co-op, and a great local parent community). After our kiddo was born Pam lost interest in my husband anyway (she doesn’t like kids) and shortly thereafter cheated on her poly relationship. Kevin and John have actually become good friends since then, but John is straight so I have no worries there.  And as I’ve reflected — I think I also just actually hated Pam — she’s everything I don’t like relying on men for affirmation, no job/life ambition, frivolous and stupid. And apparently (according to Kevin) the feeling was mutual - she thought I was a controlling, stuck up, robotic ivy league workaholic who didn’t appreciate or support my husbands hobbies/quirks. I was also a lot more emotiobal during pregnancy than normal. My husband- upon reflection liked being needed and admired

We had a lot to work through with us, but two years later we’re in a great spot (I also had a weird shift in hormones post-partum which made my sex drive really really high which for us helped a lot with our relationship). Didn’t want this to be too long, but there were a lot of changes we implemented to get back to a loving place. John feels a lot of purpose in being a dad and supported me as my career has taken off. Sometimes things are still hard (my job is really high stress, toddlers are a lot of work, etc).

But we’re pretty happy. We spent this morning snuggling in bed with our toddler and dog pretending we were on a boat, making hair dryer sounds, and giving hugs. We live a pretty boring suburban kind of life - but it works for us.

Thanks everyone for the push for me to stand up for what I wanted and needed.

ANSWER: What a great update. I'm so glad your husband honestly reflected and chose you and the baby. Hope it stays that way!

QUESTION: Friend's [34M] Girlfriend [33F] Called Me [36F] A Pick-Me And Now My Friends Want Me To Apologize?

Hi everyone, I need some advice. I (36F) have a group of five friends. We hang out together a lot, playing video games, going to Friday Night Magic, watching movies, D&D, and just generally being nerdy. One of the friend group \[34M\], Bruce, has recently gotten a new girlfriend and we've tried to include her in our get togethers. The girlfriend \[33F\], I'll call her Silver, really seems to hate me, and I'm not sure what to do. I didn't notice it at first, if I'm honest. She came along to our May the 4th/Return of the 5th party/sleepover, one friend Peter \[35M\] helped her make a paladin to join in on a D&D one-shot when she said she wanted to learn, she's come along to FNM multiple times, etc.

However, the other night, while I was having a passionate debate with another friend, Steve \[36M\] about the atrocity that was Hush 2 from DC Comics, Silver absolutely lost it at me. She started yelling about how I was a 'Pick-Me' and how I was mad that she was in the group and that I wanted to sleep with all the boys \[?!?!?!\] but especially Peter. She yelled for like five minutes, while I just sat there like a deer in headlights, because I didn't know what to say? She accused me of making my Warlock sexy in D&D to make the boys want me, that I picked a "Pretty girl card" for my deck in Magic, that I tried to "dress sexy" for May the 4th. \[I wore an Ahsoka sleeveless tank top, no straps, just sleeveless.\]

I tried to tell her I have no interest in sleeping with Bruce, or any of my guy friends, and she just burst into tears. Peter said that maybe I should go, for now, because she was upset, so I did.

Now, on Discord, a bunch of them \[Peter, Bruce, Steve and Michael (33M) have all said I should apologize to her, with only Clark \[35M\] saying I have nothing to apologize for. There's been a lot of talk about 'keeping the peace,' but I'm not sure what I should apologize for? I didn't make a move on anyone. I haven't slept with or tried to sleep with any of my friends.

I'm not sure what I should do, or what I can do. I don't know what to apologize for and I feel like my friends are siding with her.

TL;DR: Friend's girlfriend called me a pick-me and went on a rant about how I'm trying to sleep with everyone and now my friends want me to apologize to her.

ANSWER: Sounds like she has major insecurity issues and sees you as a threat without really knowing you.  I would hold my ground and hopefully your friends come around since it seems like you are a decent person.

QUESTION: UPDATE 6 years later: I (F26) am in love with my best friend (M26) but he thinks a relationship is doomed to fail

Original post can be found  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dzdykr/i_f26_am_in_love_with_my_best_friend_m26_but_he/)

6 years ago I was here lamenting the feelings I caught for my fwb turned best friend (let’s call him Franky).

After the initial pain of rejection, we both agreed to stay best friends. We moved in together with 3 of our other friends, and lived as platonic roommates. We confided in each other all our dating woes, cooked together most nights, and continued having fun nights out. During that time I grew equally close to my other roommates, and had a casual Covid lockdown fling with one who is now one of my closest friends (shocker).

After 3 years of living together, I had finally (mostly) gotten over my feelings for Franky. We were both casually dating other people and in a good place. I had spent many holidays with his extended family as his best friend, and was content knowing that I had a life long friend. Then he had a big health scare. It ended up not being anything major, but at the time put a lot of things into perspective for the both of us.

The night Franky returned from the hospital we had a heart to heart. I cried as I told him how scared I was during the emergency and it ended with us both deciding to try dating seriously.

We moved out of the group house with our friends to a small condo together. It took some time to change from an awkward platonic relationship to a truly romantic one, but we allowed the relationship to take its own time and course.

It’s been 3 years together now. He is currently cradling our shared cat as we plan a romantic weekend get away to New York. He was right, after the one year mark we sat and had a big talk. We talked about what each of us needed to work on to continue the relationship. Instead of it being a relationship death sentence, it lead to both of us getting therapy, making positive changes, and brought us even closer.

We now have such open communication that even after 3 years we have not had a fight. I could not be happier to have my person, as well as the wonderful family that I now get to be a part of.

TLDR; after 3 years of remaining besties, a mortality check pushed us together. Celebrating 3 years of bliss and hopefully more to come :)

ANSWER: Love this for u both. also a good reminder that love doesn’t have an expiry date, it can come back around when both ppl are actually ready.

QUESTION: My (21f) bf (25m) is going on a week long trip to Italy. How do I not resent him?

So my bf of 2 years along with 7 of his coworkers got invited by his work to go on a one week trip to Italy. Everything is completely paid for. Meals, flights, excursions, they are renting a private yacht, they’re staying on a mansion on the beach. Literally a trip of a lifetime and he didn’t have to pay a dime

When he first told me I was honestly I was anxious because 7 months ago he had previously did something to break my trust and we were trying to build back. Come about a week away from his trip to Italy I found out that he had an option to bring a +1, expenses all completely paid for as well. literally all their other guys who were going invited their gf/wife. I was the only one left out.

That completely changed how I felt. It wasn’t just a work trip anymore. It felt very personal and left me wondering why he didn’t want to invite me while all the other men had no problem bringing girlfriend along?

When I brought it up he said “he didn’t know it would mean that much to me” and he views it as a “networking and making connections trip and doesn’t want to have to worry about keeping me entertained while he is busy networking and building connections”. Or something along those lines.

He told me I would basically just be sitting in our room the whole time which at least id be sitting in our room in a huge mansion on the beach and private yacht getting fed pasta every night. Instead I’m just sitting at the house.

I feel so hurt and excluded and now he is living his life across the world with him and a bunch of other happy couples while I’m at home trying not to spiral.

I honestly feel a lot of resentment building. He knew I was anxious of him going because of him previously breaking my trust and he knew he had the option to invite me but didn’t. He said he “never considered how id feel and was thinking of it from a different perspective.” Outside of him breaking my trust we have an incredible relationship. We never fight, he pays for my all school/bills, anything I want. Most importantly he is my best friend. And I don’t want to destroy what we have.

My question is am I being over emotional or is this a real red flag? How do I process this and not let it turn into long term resentment?

TL;DR: My bf of two years is going on a two week work trip to Italy along with 7 of his coworkers. All of who brought their gf/wife. I was the only one left out. Now I feel hurt, excluded, and unsure how not to resent him

ANSWER: Come on. He had the option to bring you and chose to spend the week in Italy without even asking you. That’s not someone who wants to spend time with you. Without knowing the details of breaking trust it sounds like Simone who wants to spend his vacation with another woman or at least keep his options open.

QUESTION: Dad (60m) is giving all his money to a 21-year-old he met while driving Uber. I’m at a loss.

My dad (60m) met a 21-year-old while driving for Uber and now I’m watching what looks like a slow-motion trainwreck.

She told him she was homeless, so he started paying for her hotel, got her a job, bought her a car, and in total has given her around $20k… in just two months. The worst part? He doesn’t have that kind of money. He’s borrowed some from me under false pretenses (which I now know went straight to her), and his credit score is in the 300s.

People have tried to warn him. Her friend called him saying she’s still with her ex and using him. Her ex’s mom said the same thing. Every time, she tells my dad they’re just jealous or dislike her.

It’s beyond surreal. He looks like Danny DeVito (no offense to the man), has nothing in savings, and yet thinks this 21-year-old is with him for love. They’ve known each other two months and he already tattooed her name on him. He’s even had the police recover the car he bought her multiple times—until the last time, when she got him to sign it over to her officially.

He swears she never asks for anything, but somehow he’s hemorrhaged $20k since meeting her. I don’t know how to make him see it. I’m torn between trying to intervene or stepping back until he crashes and then helping pick up the pieces… but it’s getting worse fast.

TL;DR: my dad gave 20k to a girl he met in 2 months and thinks she loves him, idk how to get him to realize she's 99% likely using him

ANSWER: Sometimes there's just nothing you can do. Don't give him your money, but on some level the attention this woman is giving him is worth the money to him.

QUESTION: My husband (33M) just asked me to quit my hobby and say goodbye to my hobby friends. I really don't want to say yes to that. What should I do?

Deleted

ANSWER: Are you currently being actively treated for your depression? That’s the root of the problems here. I don’t know if your husband is making your mental state worse, but I have a strong suspicion that your dynamic is.

But no, don’t let your husband isolate you from the only social outlet you have left. Isolation will make you feel even worse.

QUESTION: [Update] I [27F] don’t know how to deal with insecurities from dating bf [28M] who is much more attractive (7 years later)

Ok, a brief, mostly sad update. Previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bbvhkg/i_27f_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_insecurities/)

We got engaged a year ago, which felt like one of the best days of my life. The universe decided no, and earlier this year I found out my fiance cheated on me in the first months of our relationship and slept with his ex model fling a few times even though he had denied there was anything other than friendship between them. Found out because she still shares mutual friends with him and is in the same field, we were all at an event and she made a snide comment about it after a friend heard about our engagement and congratulated me.

I can't really put into words how betrayed I felt, our entire relationship built on lies and years of insecurity being validated after I finally put them to rest. We tried working through it, but I decided to break things off because I don't think I'll ever be able to trust him again. He made sounds about how it was an early mistake and that I'd be throwing away 5 years of our relationship, but tbh I felt like they never became a thing because she wasn't interested in more, not him. So yeah, I wish I could say all of the "but he picked you" comments were correct, but clearly it was too good to be true.

\\tl;dr\\ Starting over at 34 after finding out my fiance actually did cheat on me with his ex fling at the beginning of our relationship

ANSWER: > So yeah, I wish I could say all of the "but he picked you" comments were correct, but clearly it was too good to be true.

Just want to mention that him cheating has absolutely nothing to do with him being "more attractive" than you or even his ex being "more attractive" than you. Men cheat on beautiful women all the time, often with less attractive women and often when they themselves are unattractive.

Cheating is a character flaw. He would likely have cheated on the model too if they'd gotten together for real and will probably cheat on his next partner. I hope in all this you don't internalize that you were right to think he was too good-looking for you because that's absolutely not the problem.

QUESTION: (UPDATE) How do I (47M) tell my boyfriend (35M) that I'm a virgin?

Original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Rrnwj7gcmp

Hey everyone. I'm really greatful for all the advice and support I got on my original post. I posted another updates on the comments of the original.

Summary, I (47M) have been with my boyfriend (35M) for a little under a year. He wants to get physical, and I haven't told him that I've never had sex, because of my history of abuse. After getting advice in the comments, I ended up writing him a letter explaining that I'm a virgin, and touching on some details of my abuse.

I left the letter on the nightstand before I left for work. (My boyfriend works from home) when I got home, his daughter (2F) ran up to me for a hug like she always does. I scooped her up in a hug, and pretended to eat her little fingers.

We had dinner and put her to bed like usual, then my boyfriend asked me to sit on the couch. My stomach tied up in knots, and part of me just wanted to run out the front door.

I have to admit, you were all right. He immediately held my hand and told me he's not disappointed at all. He asked me a bit about my past and the abuse I suffered from my mother. I don't feel comfortable going into detail here, but I barely scratched the surface and I ended up crying in his arms. I never want to be without those arms in my life. His hands rubbing my back, resting my head on his chest to listen to his heartbeat, the smell of his cologne. It's the safest I've ever felt in my entire life.

Once I calmed down, we started looking for therapists near me, then the night went on like normal. Watching our favorite shows while cuddling on the couch, doomscrolling social media and showing each other funny posts. Then we went to bed.

I feel like a weight has lifted off my shoulders. I don't have to hide this about myself anymore. I don't have to live with the fear of my amazing boyfriend seeing me as a lesser man. I won't lie, I'm still anxious about not being able to satisfy him in bed, but we'll work on it together.

I have a therapy appointment for later this month. So things are going good!

Tl;Dr, I wrote my boyfriend a letter, we talked, and now I'm gonna go to therapy.

ANSWER: This literally made me tear up. I’m so glad you found someone who is empathetic and very understanding of your situation. Dealing with trauma in your past, does not invalidate you! You are more than just a body. You’re a living human being, who has gone through so much and deserves the world! Thank you for sharing this, and I’m glad to hear you will be going to therapy. Hopefully that helps you with your mental state, and overall well being. 🫶

QUESTION: Should I [F30] warn my coworker [M24] that he is alienating himself socially?

I [F30] work in a project-based profession. The projects take anywhere from six months to several years and you’re typically working with the same small group for the entire duration.

As a natural consequence of working closely with the same few people, friendships usually form, and we’ll all take lunch together sometimes or go for drinks after work, that kind of thing.

We have an especially copacetic group on my current project. We’ve been working together six months and we go out socially, we talk and joke around during the day. We’re not “friends” but it’s a tight knit group as coworkers go.

We have one coworker [M24] who is alienating himself from the group and I feel awful because he doesn’t seem to be aware of it.

He’s losing the good faith and camaraderie of everyone in the office and he doesn’t seem to understand why it’s happening. I can see that it’s upsetting to him and it’s unpleasant for too.

That being said, I don’t know him well at all, and I feel uncomfortable approaching him about the issue. He’s an overall nice guy and has some excellent qualities but they’re overshadowed by his tone deaf conduct.

The result is the entire team is spending less time together because we wouldn’t host an event with everyone except him, but most people also can’t stand to be around him more than they have to.

Should I say something to him and if so, what should I say?

His behaviors include but aren’t limited to:

—Acts like he’s the most experienced despite being one of the least; constantly interrupts or gives unsolicited advice to other specialties.

—Minimizes coworkers’ complaints; e.g., when someone said “the client keeps calling me on weekends,” he replied “maybe work harder so they won’t need to.”

—Gets angry if anyone uses a nickname version of his (very common) name, even from people who barely know him.

—Went to a bar with us and other teams then spent the whole night lecturing everyone about how he doesn’t drink because he’s healthier and has more willpower.

—Proudly and conspicuously tattled on coworkers for bending the dress code when no clients were around, leading to a companywide memo.

TL;DR: Younger coworker keeps alienating our tight-knit team with tone-deaf behavior (know-it-all, minimizes complaints, lectures at socials, tattles). He seems unaware. Should I say something?

ANSWER: The only thing I could see doing is questioning his inappropriate behavior in the moment. Addressing his interrupting- making sure the person who was interrupted gets to finish their thought, questioning if he thinks an unhelpful suggestion is actually helpful etc

Calling out behavior that shouldn't be happening may make him see that it's unpleasant, or at least give everyone else the license to also call out his inappropriateness.

QUESTION: I [29F] have lost attraction to my [27NB] disabled partner and I'm at a loss for what to do.

My partner and I met and started dating 6 years ago. When we first met they didnt identify as non-binary, and we started our relationship as a lesbian relationship. I am a lesbian and I am not attracted to men. I have tried, many times, it just does not happen for me and I cannot force it. That being said they were the love of my life. We fell very very in love and I have never experienced the acceptance they showed me. The love they showed me was magic and I look back with very strong fondness at that time of my life.

They started to transition in earnest 3 years ago. They were very hesitant to do so initially. They knew I'm a lesbian and was not attracted to men. And they didnt want to transition for that reason. I encouraged them to do it wholeheartedly, because being trans is something you do for yourself, not for anyone else. I assured them that I wasn't considering leaving them over that,  and that it was men i wasnt attracted to not non-binary people. I told them that they had to do it for themselves. That it was crucial, even. And they did, they've been on T for quite a while and are much more masculine and in general pass as a man. They're non-binary, but yeah even so we get read as a straight couple and theyre often referred to as my boyfriend (a term they like). Over time though... its just not the same anymore. I struggle with intimacy with them, I am still deeply attracted to who they are. But their body has changed and their demeanor has changed and it's just no longer within what I'm attracted to. Its starting to hurt me to force myself through it. I want them to be happy but I am unsatisfied in several ways and have had a lot of feelings that I'm not voicing because I do not want to hurt them in any way.

They are also disabled and reliant on me for a lot of things. I rely on them for a lot too, as I am not always in the best mental state. Neither of us has a relationship with our families. We both experienced a lot of abuse growing up so we're mostly by ourselves. I can work and am working but they aren't as they have been going to therapy. They wouldn't have anywhere to go if our relationship ended. They don't have support to fall back on. And their mental health fluctuates and at somewhat routine times they are suicidal. I'm so scared of what would happen if I did decide to leave.

I don't really know what I'm looking for. Someone who has been in this situation I guess? I feel so much guilt and fear. I'm semi-sick today because of how anxious this whole thing is making me. I'm so scared of being alone too. They do provide emotional support to me, which has been very helpful for me at times. I just don't know what to do. I feel like no matter how I look at the situation I'm in the wrong. That I'd be throwing away the life weve built together and that its my fault.

TL;DR my partner transitioned and I'm losing attraction to them but they are disabled and we are very dependent and I have no idea what to do.

ANSWER: This is pretty common for partners of people who decide to transition. There's no shame or harm in deciding that you are not attracted to their new self (with absolute respect for your partner — I am saying this as a transgender woman!).

You're allowed to feel the way you're feeling. I know it hurts and feels awful and it does not at all reflect how you feel about your partner. But you need to do what is right for you — just like they did for themself (with your blessing).

Edited to add that I'm rooting for you both and wish you peace and light.

QUESTION: My boyfriend (27M) stays over almost every day but never helps with groceries or bills. How do I(25F) talk to him without sounding rude?

I(25F) need some advice because I feel stuck. My boyfriend(27M) and I have been together for a little over a year. He has his own place, but for the last few months he has been staying at my apartment almost every day. Sometimes he goes home only to pick up clothes or do some chores then he comes right back.

I love having him around. I really do. The problem is that my expenses have quietly doubled and I did not notice it at first. Groceries go way faster. The water and electricity bill are higher. I am the one cooking most nights because he is already here when I get home. He never does it on purpose, but he has slipped into the routine of treating my place like our place without the responsibilities that come with that.

Last week I realized I spent more on groceries than I usually do in an entire month. My rent and bills are manageable when it is just me, but not when I am basically hosting someone full time. I do not want to resent him, but I am already starting to feel irritated when I see the fridge emptying twice as fast.

The hard part is that he is not a bad person. If I asked directly, he would probably help. But I do not want to sound like I am charging him for staying with me. I also do not want him to think I am keeping score. I just want things to feel fair because right now it feels one sided.

How do I bring this up without making him feel attacked or unwelcome? Do I ask for a set amount each month? Do I tell him we should split groceries on the days he stays? I honestly do not know how to word it in a way that does not feel awkward.

I care about him a lot. I just want to find a healthy way to talk about this before it becomes a bigger problem. What is the best way to have this conversation?

TLDR: Boyfriend (27M) stays at my place almost every day and my expenses have increased a lot. He does not help with groceries or bills because we never talked about it. I (25F) want to ask him to contribute but I do not know how to bring it up without sounding rude or making him feel unwelcome.

ANSWER: If he is already there when you get home, why are YOU the one that has to cook? He could at least pull his weight by preparing meals for you if he is already there when you get home from work, like a decent partner would, even if you are paying for the food. I’d be pissed if I got home from work to find my partner had let themselves in, was using my water/power, eating me out of house and home, and still expected me to cook for them while not contributing anything financially or otherwise.

Do you want to live with him full-time? If so, it’s definitely time to have that conversation as he’s making himself very comfortable. Let him know that you care about him and enjoy his company, but if you are going to continue the relationship and build a future together, you need to have a conversation about splitting costs, division of labour and living arrangements. Show him copies of your bills before and after he started spending all his time at your place, and how much you are having to spend on food, and ask him to help you with the costs, because the increases are due to his presence. If you do want to live together, tell him that whatever you both will save in rent could be put towards the shared expenses.

If he is not willing to chip in, then you may want to reconsider this relationship, or at least start spending more time at his place so he can wear some costs. Why is he at your place so much? Do you live alone, and he has roommates or lives with family? Right now, he’s treating you like a free hotel with catering. What exactly is he contributing? He’s living his best life and probably saving himself a fortune by never being at his place or having to buy his own food. I’m guessing you also get stuck with cleaning up after him too?

QUESTION: My (36M) bf has made 0 friends or maintained 0 friendships since high school. I'm (31F) his only "friend" and it's wearing me down. What should I do?

As the title suggests, my boyfriend doesn't have any friends and relies on me for all social contact. He can also be really moody which makes it hard for me to know how I can help or respond to this.

For example, yesterday morning I got up for work. He was still asleep and I didn't want to wake him. I went out into the kitchen to start boiling the kettle and when I came back into the room his eyes were open and he was looking away from me and frowning. I smiled and said "oh! good morning! How did you sleep?" And he said "fine yeah" and still wouldn't look at me. I could already sense something was wrong and asked "is something wrong?" He said "why didn't you say good morning to me when you got up?"

I explained that I had thought he was asleep, and of course I would have said good morning if I knew he was awake but didn't want to wake him. He was angry and wouldn't speak to me, saying he couldn't believe I had ignored him when I got up. This turned into an argument and eventually I left to go for a morning walk.

I understand this is a really micro-level interaction, but it happens a lot and I'm getting so tired of this. The moodiness really gets to me. He also won't see a therapist even though he's been saying for almost a year that he will at some point. I see a therapist monthly and try really hard to keep on top of myself and my own emotions etc.

He doesn't have any friends, I mean actually zero friends. He never has had any friends since high school and this puts enormous pressure on me to be everything in his life (I'm 31, he's 36). And I try hard to keep my own friendships going, but it's gotten so hard since I started dating him 3 years ago. Every time I say I'm going out to see friends, he gets moody and gives the same reaction as above - he goes quiet, won't look at me and then says nothing is wrong, but then later on will blow up and say he doesn't understand why I'm seeing xyz, why I feel the need to go out etc. But equally when I ask him to join me, he either says no or goes further and asks why I don't just stay home or do something with him. Then whenever I try to broach the subject with him, he becomes incredibly moody or angry/sad.

I feel like I'm you crazy and I can't take it anymore. I'm feeling so isolated and just...sad. I don't know what to do. I want to leave but every time I say so he gets angry, then cries, then I end up deciding to stay. Meanwhile every time I do, he doesn't change anything and just continues with the moody behaviour. I don't want to be someone else's entire social life, whilst also missing out on my own social opportunities. But I'm scared of losing all the really good things about our relationship, and there are lots of them. I just can't imagine staying with him and getting married or having a kid (he really wants kids whereas I'm more on the fence) - I'd just rather be alone even though I know it'd be hard. Am I crazy? Help?

TL;DR I'm feeling responsible for my partner's emotions and entire social life, given he has no social circle and hasn't made any friends or maintained any friendships for the past 17 years. I have my own friends and social circles but am feeling like he doesn't want me to have friends. I don't know whether to leave or if I should  keep trying to work on the relationship. Any advice on what I can do?

ANSWER: There's a reason why he doesn't have any friends and it looks like you're finally seeing it.

Just because you've had a few good moments with him doesn't mean you have to stay with him forever.

QUESTION: My (29) boyfriend (30) is deeply enmeshed with his  parents (70 F, 72 M) and he’s an only child. It’s very difficult for me.

I (29F) am in a year relationship with someone (30M) who is very enmeshed with his narcissistic parents (70F, 72M). Our relationship is wonderful,  but it has been absolute hell with his parents, to the point I’ve had to hold boundaries and have gone no contact with his parents. He feels he can’t do this. He often says “they’re all I have” because he’s an only child.

He’s an only child and I’m his first really serious relationship where we live together, are planning a future, and we’re serious about getting married one day.

It’s like his parents have always hated me for this and have seen me as taking their son from them.

His parents financially abuse, verbally abuse, and heavily manipulate my partner… he’s basically like their servant.

They have made a series of poor financial decisions; overspending, luxury trips, clothes, spending over their means, expensive housing they can’t afford, etc…. They always tell us “we deserve to enjoy life”…..

They’re in a really bad spot now financially in their 70s and it’s really hard for my partner. His parents are desperate and basically in survival mode now. They’re guilt tripping him and being straight nasty about it all… basically telling him it’s his fault and guilt tripping him constantly to do things for them, financially support them, etc.

My partner already gave up the house he owns so they can live there for low cost, and I just feel they will always come first. We now pay $3200 in rent together, and while we can afford it, we keep having to make ourselves uncomfortable for his parents, or they throw a tantrum. We have a lot of financial goals we had to adjust now to accommodate for his parent’s poor life decisions.

It’s directly impacting me now, sometimes I feel it’s time to leave. His parents will always have a hold on our relationship as long as they’re alive and it’s just going to get worse as they age.

He’s starting to see how his parents are the more he interacts with my healthy family dynamic, and his parents resentment toward me has grown to the point I’ve had to cut them out of my life….. they try to put a wedge between us…..however, I know they’ll always impact our relationship as they are his parents even if I have no contact. Also….his programming runs deep of course over many years.

Any advice please?

TL;DR: my boyfriend’s parents are very difficult and use him for everything, but do not treat him or me well to the point I’ve cut them off completely. I feel it will never get better.

ANSWER: >(29F) am in a year relationship  
It’s been absolute hell,  
are planning a future, and we’re serious about getting married one day.

I cannot understand why you are planning a future with someone with whom it has been hell with and you've been dating for only a year.

QUESTION: My girlfriend (19F) cancelled my Thanksgiving flight during an argument, and now I’m unsure how to move forward. I’m (21M).

My girlfriend’s mother bought plane tickets for both of us to visit her family in Virginia for Thanksgiving. This would’ve been my first time meeting them, and I was genuinely excited.

A few days after the tickets were booked, my girlfriend and I had a disagreement about something related to her sorority process. She left my apartment upset and we didn’t speak for several hours. We made up the next day, but the following morning she told me she had cancelled my flight during the argument.

She didn’t pay for the ticket herself, and her family already knew I was supposed to come. She still hasn’t talked to her mom or anyone about what happened, so I don’t know if I’m still expected to come or if her family plans to rebook anything. I don’t want to pressure anyone or make assumptions, but the situation left me confused and disappointed.

I’m trying to approach this maturely, but I’m not sure how to communicate my feelings to her or how to move forward when the plans changed so suddenly.

How should I handle this conversation with her, and should I still go if the family decides to rebook the ticket?

TL;DR: My girlfriend cancelled my Thanksgiving flight that her mom bought during an argument, hasn’t talked to her family about it yet, and now I’m unsure how to move forward or whether I should still go.

ANSWER: Maybe next year. They won't be able to rebook for the same cost now, and honestly I would not want to meet her entire family with this hanging over your head.

QUESTION: 43/F Married 13 years. 46/M Husband betrayed me in multiple ways. I’m trying to figure out if people like him actually change or if I should walk.

Tl;dr
My husband lies to avoid conflict. How do I trust him to keep going thru this betrayal torture?

I’m using a throwaway because the details are embarrassing and honestly I don’t want anyone in my life connecting this to me.

My husband and I have been together 15 years, married 13. We have a 9-year-old son. Until recently, I thought we were solid. Not perfect, but solid. Turns out the foundation was rotting under my feet.

Here are the facts, and I’m trying to be fair about my part too. I want real feedback from people who have gone through things like this.

1. The strip club incident.

About six weeks ago, we went to a strip club together after sexy talk at dinner for his birthday. I’d never done anything like that with a partner, but he’s been venting about not frequent enough sex for a couple years so I thought this might spice it up and give us content to fantasize to after. We had a blast the first night though my feelings were a little hurt when he got too into her. He apologized and swore he’d stay sober and keep me emotionally safe next time. The next week, he went way over the line. The stripper touched him, he got “too aggressive,” and he orgasmed during a lap dance. This shattered me. He had just promised me emotional safety the week before. I felt stupid for trusting him.

2. His past and what he downplayed.

He worked in the club scene before we met. Always claimed it was “I worked in the office, just had a few dozen dances, nothing crazy.” Now I find out he’d been sucking strippers’ breasts and doing a lot more than he ever admitted. He has since estimated 50-100 dances over his lifetime when pressed. I’m sure that’s downplaying it too. I didn’t marry a saint, but I did expect the truth vs a picture of an innocent kid. He hid the real story for years. Yes I now know how naive this was of me. But he reassured me of the things that go on at the club when I asked before we went and I felt I’d be safe and he’d just be watching.

3. The money lies.

Twice he pulled money from a line of credit behind my back. The first time was 2022–2023 which almost led to us divorcing due to the risk, the amount, and the way he wouldn’t take ownership and said he was just “leaning into his business”. He promised he’d never do it again. Then he did it this year—$40k—for a sponsorship he couldn’t afford. Hid that too. Being in finance, I’m held to a high fiduciary standard, so it hits extra hard.

4. The porn and social media.

Hours a day. While I was drowning in work and parenting. He wasn’t cheating physically, but he was checked out. He deleted a few text messages with a woman he worked with (non-romantic from what he says, but hiding anything at this point hits hard). He has given multiple excuses.

5. The unnecessary lies.

This one killed me. Our son mentioned a conversation with us all together cuddling in bed about a conversation he had with his dad about my husband’s 4-5 ex-girlfriends. My husband instantly denied ever having the conversation gaslighting my son in the moment. Even when our kid said it happened last week. Was proud my kid held his ground and said “Dad you did say this.” It was such a low-stakes thing to lie about, and he still did it. I confronted him. He doubled down. When cornered, he backpedaled with “I didn’t think it was significant.”

6. Emotional stuff.

He often says he “doesn’t lie,” even when caught. His crying performative. Voice shakes, no tears. It’s hard to explain, but my gut screams he’s faking empathy instead of feeling it. He gets defensive instead of owning his choices. And when he does “own” something, it feels like he’s reading from a script.

Where I’m culpable:

I’m intense. I’m direct. I have a big career and a strong personality. I’m sure that has been intimidating for him. I’ve also been overwhelmed with work, parenting, and philanthropy. That said—none of this justifies lying or betraying someone.

Where I’m innocent:

I didn’t betray him. I didn’t lie. I didn’t do anything that required secrecy or cleanup. My “crime” is being successful and busy. His is breaking trust in every direction.

Therapy:

We’ve been in a therapy marathon for weeks. He journals now because his therapist told him to, not because he chose to. He says he wants to change, but his actions come in short spurts and fall apart fast. He has admitted he doesn’t know know how to show me empathy even after seeing all this pain. That was gutting.

My question:

Do people like this actually change?
Has anyone stayed and seen their partner do a full 180?
Or is this one of those “you already have your answer” situations?

I’ve read about people who are compulsive liars, people who can’t tolerate shame, people who crumble when confronted with their own behavior. I don’t want to raise my son in a home where his dad lies over small things and big things. But I also don’t want to blow up his world if there’s a real chance my husband can actually change.

If you’ve been the betrayed spouse or the betrayer who actually changed, I’d appreciate hearing your experience. What signs were real? What was fake progress? What should I be watching for?

I’m exhausted. I’m hurt. I don’t want to waste another year waiting for a miracle that won’t come.

Stay or go?
What do people like him actually do long-term?

ANSWER: Are you tired yet? I am just reading it. This dude lies at every single opportunity, how can you trust him about anything at all? And if you can't trust him, what's the point? Cut the weight and feel free and happier.

QUESTION: My husband (34M) has started talking down about my (27F) exercise habits, not sure how to approach the conversation

We've been together for 4 years and married almost a year. I was diagnosed with PCOS at 20 and spent my early 20s learning how to manage it. I take medication to manage insulin resistance and I do some form of exercise 5/6 days a week. Usually walking a mile, around 45mins/1 hour on my exercise bike, and I got really into squats this summer so they have been added in. I do the stairmaster when I'm able to physically go to the gym.

When we got together I had dropped around 80 pounds and was below my original goal weight. He was always very complimentary of this, saying it was impressive that I was able to stick with it and get the results I wanted. I easily maintained my weight the entire time we were dating, it does take time out of my day but I almost always got it done while he was at work so we could hang out. We tried to walk the mile together but he almost never felt like it and I preferred to get it out of the way earlier into the day anyway. My husband isn't massively overweight but he is definitely insecure about his weight, I think he looks great and am happy to support him wherever he's at.

Since we've married and moved in together he has slowly become less approving of my working out. It didn't happen at first but now it's like he views my very mild exercise as "excessive" and also done incorrectly apparently. He tells me I should do the bike for "15 minutes max, anything past that is not helping you", that my mile walk that takes me 20/30 minutes is "too long, you don't need that much", and finally to me proudly telling him how many squats I did was "You'll need to show me how you're doing it because I know you're definitely doing it wrong" (not even a "great job", also someone taught me years ago but he "doesn't believe it").

I've been getting annoyed about this new behavior but trying to push it aside for some reason. I finally got frustrated a few days ago because I was getting dressed to take my walk and he got very upset with me. Pouted and said "You don't need to do that, why don't you want to spend time with me?" We spend almost all of our free time together!!! Plus no one told him he couldn't walk with me, I just knew he was going to have an issue with it.

I've literally been gaining weight and his criticism is making it hard for me to stay motivated. I've always been so proud of getting on top of my health and I've felt so much better, but lately it feels like punishment. I'm not sure how to approach him, I think he feels unhappy with his body and habits and is pushing these things to me. I want to be kind but I also want to defend myself. My quality of life was so much worse before and I feel hurt and annoyed that it seems he would prefer I go back to that so it doesn't challenge him at all.

Tl;dr my husband suddenly dislikes my exercise habits and talks about how unnecessary or wrong I'm doing everything. I think it's unhappiness in himself and I want to be respectful to him, but he's not being very respectful to me so I'm not sure how to approach this chat.

ANSWER: My question is why are you pushing this to the side? This should be immediately addressed because he is getting the signal that this is okay. Your exercise habits predate him and are not for him to control. Have the discussion, he needs to stop.

QUESTION: Friend keeps messaging me  20–50 times a week and I don’t know how to handle it

TL;DR - Old friend messages me constantly despite my repeated attempts at boundaries. How do i stop this without being cruel?

\_\_

Hi all,

I (29F) have an old friend who I’m not very close with anymore (39M). We worked together for about a year when I was 18. We don’t hang out, I don’t really think about him day-to-day, and I usually reply maybe once every few weeks. But he sends me constant messages - mostly Facebook reels - literally every day. Sometimes it’s 10 a day, and recently I opened Messenger and saw 54 unread messages from him.

I haven’t replied in about 3 weeks. He keeps messaging anyway, and today he sent things like:  
“I don’t think you like me anymore haha you talk to me like once a month.”

He’s also asked if he could visit me while he’s in the area (I didn’t respond), and he keeps pushing past hints that I’m busy or not very active on Messenger.

For context, he has bipolar disorder and can be very intense and emotional. A few years ago when I tried to set boundaries, he told me he cried in the shower because he thought he was “losing me,” which made me feel horrible. I don’t want to hurt him or be cruel, but the constant messaging makes me uncomfortable and I don’t feel close enough to him to manage his emotional reactions.

I don’t want a big confrontation or to send a harsh message - but I also don’t want to reinforce this by replying and starting the cycle again. I've sent a couple of messages over the past year or so just saying 'Hey man, im not on facebook much" or other things along those lines. He just doesnt take the hint to stop messaging. Its relentless.

What’s the healthiest way to handle this?

Is it OK to just stop engaging at all? Should I send a short boundaries message? Mute him? Block him?

If you’ve dealt with something similar, what worked for you?

ANSWER: So dude has been overly attached to you since you were 18 and he was around 28. Without you encouraging it at any point by hanging out or entertaining himself outside of the workplace. And it's been 10 years and he's still going.

This is actually pretty damn creepy and scary. I agree with the longer comment advising you to get your ducks in order safety wise but I would also download or screenshot as much of your message history as you can in case you need to take the problem to law enforcement. Emphasize the very earliest interactions. The ones where you were 18 and he was nearly 30.

Be safe please!

QUESTION: My HUSBAND Always does STUPID experimental stuffs, how not to get ANGRY?

I am F(27) and my husband is M(28). Married for more than 2 years. My husband is a very clumsy person. He easily gets distracted. He says that he has ADHD, I also think that. But it is getting really stressful for me. He is not that careful with his spending. He tries to be careful, but the things he does ends up costing us more money. Recently, his mac was heating up when he worked on it, he saw from a yt video that suggested a small repair. So, to save money he ordered the kit for himself to fix it on his own. We are immigrants and every penny counts for us. I told him that even if it costs a little more he should go to a professional for these stuffs as he has no prior experience. He said yes i think you are right but ended up doing what he thought initially and damaged a more expensive sensitive part instead of fixing it. Now it might cost us 10-20 times more to repair that. This is just an example he keeps doing things like that and I am always stressed or anxious about him constantly about whatever he does. Even if I show anger because of that he did not listen to me he says that I am nagging and it is not right. If I can't say anything good in these typpa situation I might just stay quiet. His ADHD is increasing my anxiety and stress levels. What can I do to fix his these type of behaviours so that he takes more mature decisions and thinks maturely and logically before doing something. So that I no longer have panick attacks.

TL;DR My husband is always doing immature things and making immature decisions, I am getting hyper anxious day by day, what should I do?

ANSWER: 1. You're not having panic attacks. That is very different from being frequently angry with a spouse and having anxiety over money.

2. You can't "fix" him.

3. Your husband \may\ have ADHD -- has he actually been diagnosed? -- but "disregarding my partner's concerns" is not a symptom of ADHD. That's just a spouse being a jerk.

So the first thing I'd do is encourage your husband to actually get checked out for a formal diagnosis. If he has a problem that prevents him from being functional in certain ways that are very important to you, medication and teamwork to change how you divvy up tasks (like who is responsible for repairing a broken laptop) are things you can get from counselors who deal with people with these problems. I don't think it's helpful for you (or him) to pathologize all your relationship issues as being caused by a mental health disorder your husband may not even have. If he does, then HE has to do the work here, and YOU have modify your expectations and behaviors so that you find a dynamic that works for you.

As for the rest of it, when you say you're constantly stressed or anxious about what he does, that's a really bad mental state to be in. You can't parent a grown man. What are some practical things you can do to protect yourself from the impact of his impulsive decisions? (e.g. take over managing the household money) How about some emotional things you can do? (e.g. don't clean up his messes, leave the area and go someplace quiet away from him, etc.)

Does your husband CARE that you are having all these conflicts? And how did you resolve conflict before you got married? Surely this didn't just spring up out of nowhere.

QUESTION: Moved in with my boyfriend (23M) 3 months ago and I’m (22F) drained. Should I move out while he’s gone?

My boyfriend and I moved in together about three months ago, and ever since then I’ve felt completely overwhelmed. Before living together, things were great. But now I’m doing almost all the housework while working fully onsite, and he works hybrid and still barely handles his small chores unless I remind him multiple times. Whenever I bring up how stressed or frustrated I am, he says I’m “attacking” him or blowing things out of proportion.

Today I rushed out the door late for work and accidentally tipped over my sock drawer, and instead of being understanding, he texted me during lunch pointing it out in a passive aggressive way, even though I silently clean up after his messes every day. It made me realize how imbalanced things have become and how little accountability he takes. We’re going to be apart for a month starting Sunday, and I’m thinking about staying in an Airbnb until he leaves, then going back home when he’s gone and possibly moving out while he’s away so I can think clearly. I still care about him and would give the relationship another chance, but living together has brought out issues that are really draining me. Am I overreacting, or is this a sign we’re incompatible living together?

TL;DR: Since moving in with my boyfriend, I’ve ended up doing almost all the chores while he gets defensive whenever I bring it up. Today was my breaking point, and I’m considering moving out while he’s away for a month. Not sure if it’s dramatic or the right move. What should I do?

ANSWER: Get out now while you still have your fire, because it gets a lot harder to leave once you’ve forgiven him two or three or twenty times. It does not get better, seriously. This is supposed to be the honeymoon period of living together. It’s the best it will ever be, right now.

QUESTION: Bonding with parents feels impossible because I (28M) feel like I have to walk on eggshells.

I (28M) often find myself in this position where bonding with my dad (63M), I might say something conversational and it gets interpreted as me not having a good time.

For example, I come over so we can watch films together over dinner, and let's say we watch a movie and even though I liked the overall film, I might say, 'It was good. It kind of dragged at points but it was a great narrative.'

Somehow that gets translated into him profusely apologizing: "I'm so sorry I made you watch that. I liked it, I just thought you might, but I won't make you watch any more-"

As much as I try telling him that I did like it, he doesn't seem to hear me. It's like one wrong move, and suddenly, it's all over. My mom is pretty similar, but right now, I'm focusing more on my dad.

This has happened across several experiences throughout my life and unfortunately, we're not that close. I want to be closer, but I feel anxious about saying anything around him. Anyone experience anything similar?? How do you get around it??

TL;DR: I want to bond with my dad, but even small comments make him fret and over-apologize. I feel anxious speaking around him and don’t know how to communicate honestly without upsetting him.

ANSWER: How does he react if you just mention what you liked about it?

One of my colleagues wrote a book that was . . . okay, but not that great. But it did have a really strong sense of place, and when I said that I'd read the book, I pointed that out. He then said he was really happy to hear that, because he'd worked really hard on that, and it turned out that I didn't have to say anything else at all.

It sounds like your dad has some insecurities. Have you seen this show up in other ways, with other people in his life?

QUESTION: I (32f) am being made to choose between my ex con (34m) brother in law or the rest of my in laws by my mother in law (51f)

I really need advice here. Please help! Names in the story have been changed for anonymity.

I'm a 32f and have been married to my husband, Lucas (32m), for almost 7 years. We dated long before that, basically since we were both 18. I was a co-worker with his mom Bella(51f) when my husband and I were still dating, and so we've always been pretty close. My mother in law tends to keep my son(7m) with her over the weekends because she loves him and loves spending time with him doing fun things he'll enjoy. I've been accepted into Lucas's extended family with open arms and feel very welcomed by everyone. They may not always understand me and I may not always understand them, but we try and are always there for each other.

As a child, my brother in law, Tom (34m), hung out with the sorts of people that got involved with drugs and gang related activity. Lucas was then made to be the responsible one in the family in Tom's place and basically become a mini adult to help raise/care for his cousins and younger brother while his mom and the aunts worked on their careers. It was a turbulent household with an abusive man married to my mother in law, which had a big effect on the kids. Tom would basically do what and go wherever he wanted.

I've been told that Tom was doing drug deals, tried to pretend to be my husband when he'd gotten arrested one time, (thank God a family member was able to set that straight), broke into his mom's house when he wasn't supposed to be there, got shot in a drug deal gone wrong and has stolen someone's car. And those are just the things that I've been told about. There's most likely much more.

After the drug deal gone wrong, Tom was sent to prison for a few years. He got out, and within just a few months, he stole someone's car which broke his parole and was sent back to jail. So now he's been in jail for at least 5 years. (Sorry, I haven't been keeping track of exact dates.) Now he's out of jail again and has been since sometime in July of this year, I think. And that was when the initial issue started. Not with my brother-in-law but with my mother-in-law.

I believe that Bella truly does love her children, but I also feel like she has a large amount of guilt for how her son's life turned out. I think that she's trying her best to make up for lost time as quickly as possible. However, she's doing it in a way that's making others uncomfortable and is pushing other family members' boundaries.

Around when my brother-in-law got out of jail, my husband's entire extended family had been planning a trip to a water park together for an Aunt's birthday and everyone was looking forward to it for almost a year. However, Bella tried to insist that we invite Tom, too. Some of my husband's family are in law enforcement and have young children. They were not comfortable with that idea, especially with him so freshly out. My mother-in-law then tried to dig her heels in and say that if he couldn't come then she wouldn't come, and then the aunt that was putting on the entire trip for herself and the family almost canceled the whole thing over the drama! Luckily, my mother-in-law saw reason before we left, Tom didn't come and the trip stayed on.

Which brings us to the problem that I'm having now: Bella is trying to plan her own Thanksgiving away from the rest of the extended family because Tom isn't invited. And that would be an okay choice for her to make. However, my husband and I are now being made to choose sides. Either we support my mother-in-law and Tom, or we support the boundaries of the rest of the family. I don't really know what to do. Honestly, I don't like Tom. From what I've heard about him, and how I hear him talk to Bella, Lucas and my son (7m), I just don't like him as a person. Even without the crimes he's committed, he's rude and selfish. If he was not related to my husband, I would never be around him. But my mother-in-law is making this extremely personal. She insists that Lucas, my son, me, my other brother in law Dax(22m), Tom, his daughter (14f) and his daughter's mom Angel (??f) all forfeit going to the annual extended family Thanksgiving.

I don't believe that this is a fair choice, especially for my young son. Usually, at the big extended family Thanksgiving, all of the kids play together all night, watch holiday movies and then write out their Christmas lists to Santa. We all play family games like charades or trivia. All of the adults exchange white elephant slips to know who they're buying for that year. Then all of the adults plan on Black Friday shopping to try and knock out most of the lists. I don't see how making my son sit with a bunch of adults awkwardly all night it's supposed to help anything or show support.

And did I mention that I have my own family's Thanksgiving to attend? Every year it's a struggle to balance two separate Thanksgivings on the same day but we somehow manage. Now I have all of this added stress to the decision making and need to essentially choose to do three Thanksgivings or upset someone by not attending one of theirs.

I tried to appeal to my mother-in-law to ask if maybe we could get together with Tom on a different day, and tried to explain that the family just needs time to see whether or not he's changed and to rebuild trust with him. That he made a series of poor life decisions and that these are the consequences. I'm not saying that he shouldn't have a Thanksgiving with the family members that want to support him right now, I think that that's very good of Bella to want to do. I just think that she is letting her emotions cloud her judgment and that this could be the start of a rift between the family and unnecessary tension. My son cried today when he heard that we wouldn't be going to his cousin's house this year and it broke my heart. I think I'm leaning toward choosing to go to the extended family's Thanksgiving, now, instead.

How will future holidays go? Christmas? Easter? Birthdays? Anniversaries? Etc etc.

Not to mention that my mother-in-law is lashing out and has essentially said that she doesn't care what me and my son do, but that she expects my husband to attend her Thanksgiving because she would hope that all of her sons would want to spend the holidays with her. So now she's trying to keep my husband with her. How is that fair to my son and I!? I don't know what to do! I have so many past traumas, current mental health issues and people pleasing tendancies that this is really putting a strain on me. My husband is very non confrontational and hates that he's being forced into choosing.

Lucas has already tried to discuss this with her but she still insists on doing it this way. When my husband first told me about her plans, I expressed how upset that I was and how unfair it was for our son and he agreed. But he still wants to support his mom, even if he doesn't have a good relationship with his brother and isn't super close with his mom. He doesn't know what to do, and neither do I. I don't know what Lucas will choose to do.

Please, I'm begging for advice or people's perspectives! I really need help!

Tl;Dr:

My mother in law wants us to choose between her awful son or the extended family Thanksgiving tradition this year since he just got out of jail. Help!

ANSWER: I would choose not to spend my thanksgiving with an asshole or the woman trying to force me to do so. Your husband needs to step up, this is his family to deal with.

QUESTION: Married within a year, and now I’m seeing red flags I ignored before — how do I handle this? (27F/33M)

Hi, this is a long read. Bear with me. Im a 27/F. My husband is 33M and we’ve been married for a year. I’m looking for some advice on how to handle this situation. I feel like I have no one to talk to, and I really need to vent while also getting someone’s perspective.

My husband and I got engaged and married all within a year. Everything happened pretty fast, but we both deeply desired marriage. Now that we’re married, some of the subtle red flags I noticed before are starting to repeat themselves.

My husband is very paranoid. He often assumes I’m cheating or doing something shady when I never have and never would. We attend church, and he gets upset when I put effort into my appearance. He assumes I’m dressing up to seek attention — even though I keep to myself at church and rarely engage in conversation unless I have to.

A few weeks ago, he went on a brief trip. While he was away, I booked a hair appointment. He became upset, saying I must be getting my hair done to entertain another man while he was gone, and created a whole argument about it. The truth is, that was the only available appointment time.

When he returned from his trip, he inspected the entire house, looking for signs that I had company while he was gone. In the past, he has often asked to look through my phone — and I’ve allowed it because I have nothing to hide.

If a man at church looks my way, or if he sees me glance at someone, he interrogates me and asks if I know them or if I’m trying to get attention. He frequently asks about my whereabouts, even though he has my location and I’m always transparent about where I am and what I’m doing.

One particular incident stands out — I was on my way to a church meeting (I serve at church), and I left early because I like to be punctual. He called me and told me to come back, accusing me of leaving early to mingle and potentially meet other men.

These are just a few examples of many similar incidents that have occurred. He says he wants to change and asks me to give him time. I believe he’s genuine in that desire, and he truly does have amazing qualities. Every time he realizes he’s wrong, he apologizes. I understand that change takes time, but when these episodes happen, he becomes a different person — angry and loud. And it honestly scares me. He’s not physically abusive but I’ve become so anxious around him.

I don’t know if I should wait it out or leave. He plans to seek therapy, but hasn’t yet. He says he can fix the issue himself, he just has to be self aware. I want to give him a chance, but I also know this behavior could get worse once kids are involved. I’m torn and don’t know what to do.

TL;DR: My husband and I married quickly, and now his paranoia and constant accusations of cheating are becoming overwhelming. He says he’ll get therapy, but I’m torn between waiting it out or leaving.

ANSWER: Please leave if he doesn't treat his insecurities- he's being extremely controlling and  isolating you, the first steps towards more physical abuse.

QUESTION: After 4 years together still no proposal. How long do I continue to wait?

I’ve (39F) been with my BF (37M) for four years and we’ve been living together for over two. Before I gave up my apartment and moved into his house, I asked where he saw our relationship going and his timeline for commitment. He said if after a year of living together everything was going well, we’d get engaged. This matched with what I wanted, so I moved in.

A year passed and no proposal. I bring up the conversation we had before I moved in and he said he’s saving up for the ring. Then his friend asked us if we were going to get engaged, and my BF said yes, soon. So, I was reassured we were still on the same page.

Then we get to two years living together, and still no proposal. The type of rings I like are not expensive, and with his salary I know he would have saved up enough by then. Then his brother got engaged after only two years with his GF. I know all relationships have their own timelines, but the news made me reflect. So, I straight up asked my BF why he hadn’t proposed.

At first his excuse was that planning a wedding was such a hassle. This didn’t ring true, so I said I thought he wasn’t being honest. Then he confided some struggles with his mental health and fears that I would grow resentful of ways he couldn’t contribute to the relationship due to them. I was surprised because those things are not deal breakers for me, I’m not upset by them, and I don’t think I’ve ever expressed resentment.

He said he’d thought about returning to therapy to work on things and asked me to give him some time. I agreed, but he’s not forthcoming if/when his appointments are or what he’s working on – which I understand I have no right to know. He’s allowed to keep his therapy private if that’s what’s best for his therapeutic journey. But, I wish I had some insight to know my waiting will be worthwhile.

I don’t question his struggles, but I’m having a hard time believing he’s not just stalling. He’s expressed some reservations about me, mainly that I’m not social enough, especially with his family. I’m a super introvert, but I’ve really tried with his family. I once expressed a worry that his family mistook my shyness for disinterest, but he assured me they understood and liked me, so I don’t know what the problem is.

My other doubt is that he talks about doing things and often doesn’t follow through. Like, he’s been saying he was going to take me on a weekend trip since the first year together, but he’s never done it. During the same time he’s planned and gone on four trips with friends and family. I don’t doubt that he would enjoy a trip with me, he just doesn’t care enough to actually plan it.

Recently, we went to his friend’s wedding, and another of his friends asked if we’re getting engaged, and my BF again said soon. I just don’t believe it anymore. I don’t doubt his love for me. We do a lot of stuff together and he’s physically affectionate. But I can’t ignore this feeling he doesn’t want to marry me and never will. I don’t think he wants to break up, but he also doesn’t want to commit.

I get upset about this every other day and I’m just so tired. I’m nearing forty and just want to know he wants to be my life partner. I feel four years is plenty of time to know someone. I have been open and transparent about who I am and what I have to offer. I don’t know how much longer I can wait around for him to decide to commit.

Do I stick around and see if he ever proposes, or follow my gut and cut my losses?

TLDR: After four years BF has not proposed even after saying multiple times he was planning to. Explanations are weak and I'm questioning if he'll ever do it.

ANSWER: I think it's time you look for your own apartment and move out. He is just stringing you along. Just consider: there is no actual factual reason he can't propose to you - the only valid explanation is that he just doesn't want to. It's heartbreaking that he stole the four years from you that were vital if you wanted to have children - I really hope you don't, because that would make it so much sadder.

Anyway, he's telling you loud and clear that he is not going to marry you - time to accept that and move on. You will be much happier once you're free from his push/pull mindgames.

QUESTION: Fiancé (31M) threw me (29F) under the bus to our friends

My fiancé and I are thinking about going to this music festival in a few months. We’re planning for it now since tickets go on sale tomorrow. We both really want to go, but money is the issue. Not only are we planning our wedding, but we are going to be renovating soon. As well as I have some debt I keep trying to pay off. I can’t pay it off since things like this keep coming up and we don’t wanna miss out.

Anyways, today in our group chat with our 4 other best friends (who know about my money struggles and us needing to save) we were chatting about renting an RV vs tent camping and I mentioned that I wanted to do whatever was cheapest since we’re a little tight on cash right now. I also mentioned that if that wasn’t an issue, we would do the RV in a heartbeat and I wanted to compare costs. I will add; I’ve never been the friend to complain about costs. In fact, I’ve always been really down and that’s how I’ve found myself in some hot water with debt. I’m only being “stingy” because I haven’t been able to pay it off and we’re planning a wedding and such

My fiancé and I were texting separately about all of this and he even agreed with me- even stating this wasn’t even worth it, he’d rather go on a vacation, he doesn’t mind tent camping and we could bring all our own stuff etc. We ended up saying that we would chat more about it later when he got home so we were on the same page. BTW the cost difference with tent camping vs RV would be 400-500$ total.

Our group chat kept popping off about the RV and I sent a text saying “Fiancé and I are going to chat more about it tonight and get back to you guys”. My fiancé then messaged me separately saying “stop telling them about money problems, you’re making us sound poor”. I apologized and said I wouldn’t mention it again. He then proceeds to text in our group chat saying “oh yeah by the way we’re for sure doing the RV, that makes the most sense” and just completely threw me under the bus.

I got super pissed at him because wtf we literally were just chatting about it and he acted like he would have my back. I totally felt like I was the bad guy/the only one not 100% about the RV. It especially sucked because everyone else is like “what why wouldn’t we do the RV?” And are all gung ho about it. He told me that he didn’t want our girl best friend thinking we didn’t want to do it and he sensed she was upset we were on the fence about the RV so he said that… I literally was like so you’re putting her potential feelings over my feelings? I am the one struggling to pay off my debt and trying to be smart.

I’m so annoyed and frustrated with him. How do I approach this with him?

Tl;dr my fiancé threw me under the bus with our friends

ANSWER: The way he talks to you is problematic. He can convey his thoughts and feelings without cussing at you.

QUESTION: How can you really start to accept that people won't change? (Relationship with ADHD)

The relationship between me (28F) and my boyfriend (31M) is pretty decent overall. Our communication is good for the most part, we can be very honest with each other, we respect each other and act usually very supportive of the other. We've been together for 5 years now.

One thing I cannot get behind though is the fact that he has some traits and qualities I cannot change and which will, very likely, never change. Most of our arguments are about the same topics. Often times it's about his lacking degree of emotional regulation towards inconveniences or stress in general. He frequently uses me as an 'emotional dumpster' when he wants to vent about the world and whatever happened to him that upset him (note: not all of these things are really overblown and unreasonable as my wording might make it seem). Recently this happens a lot more frequently and it's exhausting.

He's already in therapy because of depression and ADHD (already medicated). I know that emotional regulation is especially hard for people with ADHD and this is what makes this so incredibly frustrating. I'm at a point where I don't wanna hear about all these same things anymore that bother him. He's just venting about it at me, not changing anything (e.g. talk to the person at work that actually upset him) or trying to work with his emotions to not always react this hard (which again, might not even be possible). To add some extra salt to the wound: He formed a new friendship with another person at work which is all fun and giggles all the time. So basically, he comes home, tells me how much fun he's had with this person and what cool stuff they've been doing this day, and then starts to vent. It feels like I'm being served all the negativity he's built up over the day, and this person is experiencing all the fluffy joy he has to offer instead (he's a very fun and goofy guy when he's not venting and marinating in his own misery). Yes, it's honestly the first time in perhaps 10+ years I felt some sort of jealousy.

I've voiced my wish for not being used as his private therapist all the time many, maaany times. He always apologizes and wants to better himself. Never does. We also get into other discussions about the same stuff over and over again, too. Also mostly related to his ADHD (cleaning, putting some effort into planning special days like anniversaries). In general, he's apologizing all the time and I believe him but at this point I can almost predict the words that come out of his mouth every time we're having this conversation.

A part of me feels like 'well, it's the ADHD, suck it up. If you like him, YOU have to find a way to deal with all this, not the other way round'. Another part, that has a lot of old childhood trauma mixed into this emotional response, screams at me that I cannot accept my boundaries not being heard. I don't want to go into details of my backstory, let's just summarize that I've had my fair share of therapy to work through this independently. I feel stable and pretty safe in that regard. But these two backgrounds—one person with ADHD, one with former PTSD—feel like a nightmare to mix.

Is anyone out there, perhaps with the same combination in their relationship, who can perhaps offer some advice? How can I not get triggered by making the experience of 'nothing will ever change, just swallow your anger and adjust your needs' over and over? It goes heavily against what I learned back then in therapy. All of this is really sucking the light out of our relationship. The fun times get less and less, all this 'drama' is leaving me so exhausted and depressed. One part of me is slowly giving up, since it all seems so hopeless to me. Please, offer some advice.

TL;DR: ADHD boyfriend (in therapy & medicated) constantly uses me as emotional dumpster + we have the same arguments over and over to no avail. Therefore getting depressed myself since I feel like I just cannot expect any change at all + this heavily triggers some of my former trauma memories of helplessness.

Edit: Adjusted TL;DR

ANSWER: By ending the relationship. I have severe ADHD and it's my job to manage/regulate my emotions and symptoms. I don't get a pass to shit on people who love me.

QUESTION: I (26F) need a reality check before I move cross country with my ex (29F).

Five years ago, I was married to a man while discovering my queer identity. He was supportive simply because he was a horny man and loved to imagine it, and encouraged me to explore. That is when I met Zoe through a queer dating app.

During the pandemic, our connection developed quickly and deeply. We had virtual cooking nights, painted together, planned creative dates, and all from opposite coasts. By the end of the year, we each separated our partners as we each wanted to do for years, and she moved across the country to be with me. For a week, it was magic. Then reality hit.

Despite sharing important values and perspectives, we were wildly different: our personalities, family dynamics, and ways of handling conflict clashed hard. I was going through a divorce and struggling in a conservative town where neither of us felt safe. Fights turned volatile, once even physical as she hit my throat when she was triggered as she thought I called her stupid during an argument. After nine chaotic months, we moved apart but kept talking.

Over the next couple of years, we tried to heal. Therapy helped me and she turned to secretive spiritual communities and meditation programs. That secrecy, along with our fundamental differences, always left me feeling confused, awkward, and divided (granted, I often feel that way as a person anyway).

In recent months, she asked me to be her girlfriend again. Things were calm and steady, though not romantic. No hand holding, no cuddling, separate rooms, but an awkward “dance” through our individual routines near each other each day. We’ve become great friends and roommates, sharing our lives but without intimacy. Still, I hoped our peace meant progress — and I was content as we had a great balance at home, and we each lived as our holistic, sober, celibate selves comfortably around one another.

Then, when prompted as I was in desperate need for clarity, she told me the truth: she doesn’t want a romantic partnership with me. She cares deeply, but she feels fear and sadness for me: for my small support system, my sensitivity as autistic person, my autoimmune conditions, and how we’ve impacted each other over time. It hurt, but I finally had clarity.

Now we are supposed to move to her hometown this spring, as we’ve planned for over a year, to care for her family that needs consistent care. On paper, it makes sense. We coexist well as friends and co-parents to our cats. But part of me knows I’d end up feeling alone and resentful while she’s surrounded by family.

I could instead move back to my home coast to be closer to the few family members I’m close with. It would mean living alone for the first time in my adulthood, which terrifies and excites me in equal measure. It feels like a real beginning. It feels like I finally would be able to be in my own orbit rather than someone else’s.

I think I already know the answer, but I can’t help second-guessing myself:

Would it be foolish or selfish to choose independence and move on my own instead of following her to support her, and care for her family?

—

TL;DR: My partner of five years and I planned to move to her hometown across the country to care for her family in the spring. She let me know that she is not interested in me romantically, but wants to remain as the good friends we are. Do I make the move I promised to make or move for myself for the first time in my adulthood?

ANSWER: > It feels like a real beginning. It feels like I finally would be able to be in my own orbit rather than someone else’s.

This sounds like an opportunity too good to pass up.

QUESTION: My fiance (M29) always eats things I leave for myself (F26)/or takes all of the food snacks

My partner and I have been fighting over food lately (or I've been fighting with him). He is always asking if im gonna finish what's on my plate as I'm eating. Or Ill buy snacks and they're all gone before I can have any. Or last week I had wings for lunch and didn't finish them, he just ate them before I got home from work and didn't feel bad at all.

It's frustrating. I tried to bring it up today and he tells me I must have a problem with food because it's weird that I'm upset about it and I shouldn't be upset about wings from a week ago. But I'm obviously not upset about that specific thing. I feel like for me, its just like he doesn't respect my boundary which is why I'm upset.

This feels like a stupid thing to fight over but I just can't stand that I food I want goes missing because I didn't tell him directly "don't eat my leftovers" or "hey save me some caramel bites because I'm gonna want some".

How do I fix this? I don't want to fight with my partner about food. But now he's in our bedroom and told me to leave him alone. Ugh.

TLDR - Fiance eats food I want to save for later every time or snacks in hoping to eat and told me I have a food problem because I'm upset about it.

ANSWER: It's not a stupid thing to fight over. You were looking forward to your little treats and he took them from you with zero consideration for your feelings. Partners shouldn't do that to one another.

Talk to him and tell him clearly: my leftovers are off limits to you unless I say you can eat it. You can share my snacks but it's rude to eat an entire bag of something I bought for myself and not immediately replace it. If he had a non romantic roommate he wouldn't be eating all their food without asking; it's the same thing here.

QUESTION: Is my (34F) husband’s (35m) terrible spending habits a deal breaker or is this salvageable?

My husband and I have been together 10+ years, married for 6, and recently I gave birth to our 2 month old baby. When I was pregnant I discovered that he accrued credit card debt among other things. His debt and loans amounted to $40k, he also spent $6k on a road bike and a mountain bike, spent unknown thousands on collectable cards (Pokémon, baseball), and had no personal savings. He makes great money ($150k+) so it’s extra shocking that he spent so much money to not have savings and end up with debt. He also hid it all from me because he was trying to fix it on his own without me finding out. In the past he also gambled some unknown amount and has also lost $14k by investing all his savings in one company’s stock. We had many fights about this and he has expressed remorse and that he is turning a new leaf. We cancelled all his credit cards and are gradually paying off the debt. Is this a deal breaker? Or is this relationship salvageable?

Here are some additional pros and cons for context: 
Pros:
- we generally enjoy spending time together 
- he contributes and is involved with the family and household 
- he is a good father

Cons: 
- bad with money 
- no physical intimacy 
- no sexual chemistry

Tldr- my husband is bad with money and hid his debt from me but said he has changed. Is this relationship salvageable or would most people walk?

ANSWER: Apart from the “list” of pro’s and con’s you failed to mention that you clearly have lost respect for him. Add to that the missing intimacy and missing chemistry - your frustration levels are only going to increase while your tolerance levels for putting up with “bad stuff” will only decrease. Once those lines intersect downwards you’ve crossed a threshold. You might already be there given your post. Even if you salvage his spending (and thats a big iff) how can you salvage no chemistry and a lack of intimacy???  This has “doom” written all over it. Ugh.

QUESTION: I (22M) have a very complicated relationship with my (24F) best friend

I've been pretty much best friends with a girl for over 5 years, and there has always been chemistry and tension between us. We tried dating once but she backed out because of her own stated commitment issues and life circumstances.

I'm the closest thing she's ever had to a boyfriend and the only guy to ever even take her on a date which is crazy because shes very traditionally attractive and could have any guy.

We hang out 1-on-1 constantly, travel to motor races together, stay in hotels, and have slept in the same bed platonically many times. She tells me I'm very attractive and a great guy, is very flirty with me, we know everything about each other, her friends and family even say we should date, and when anyone has asked her for reasons why she wouldn't, she said she couldn't think of one.

She even made a marriage pact with me (her idea) and wants to come to my work Christmas party saying we could joke that we aren't "dating" but getting married in 8 years. She once called me while drunk and said I'm the only guy she's ever felt really cared about her and that I might be the only guy she's actually loved. But whenever I talk to or date other girls, she acts like she doesn't care and just says she knows I'll "find someone," which hurts because I want it to be her.

The worst part is that she completely deflects and shuts down any time I try to have a serious talk about us. We're also core members of our friend group so I'm scared of ruining things - but the limbo is draining me. How would you recommend I approach this?

TL;DR there's clearly romantic tension between me and my best friend but she shuts down whenever I bring it up. How do I approach this?

ANSWER: Well, since she doesn't want to talk about it, it's time to stop flirting and acting like her BF. She doesn't get GF treatment if she doesn't want to be your GF.

QUESTION: I (30F) Found my husband's (29M) second phone.

I (30F) found my husband's (29M) second phone yesterday and I am in shambles. We have been together for almost 12 years, married for almost 10. I am 7 moths postpartum and have been struggling with postpartum depression and anxiety since I had my wonderful baby boy in March. I see my therapist weekly and a psychiatrist often for medications. It hasn't been an easy battle and I know its taken a toll on my little family, but I've been trying and was getting better. My husband (let's call him Jax) has been very supportive but his work schedule moved him to the night shift so we barely see each other except for a few hours on the weekends. He tends to keep the same sleep schedule those days so I end up sleeping on the couch while he stays awake in the living room just to be close because I miss him. Well, fast forward to yesterday. I was looking for his car keys to move the car and I was looking in his work bag when I found his old phone. I immediately felt my stomach drop because I thought he got rid of it and it was fully charged so it had been used recently. I went to wake him up and had him unlock it for me. He swore there was nothing on it and he was just trying to download pictures off of it to his laptop. He lied. There was a second reddit and email account on there that had messages, posts, and comments all being sexual and flirting with other women. I messed up and locked the phone when he tried to take it so I dont know the PIN to get back into it to take screenshots and he refuses tk give it to me. When I ran out of the room he deleted the reddit account and the email account. I am sick to my stomach. I dont know where to go from here. I quit my job because he wanted me to be a stay at home mom. I'm a homebody with pretty much no friends. And to make things harder his family lives with us. Where do I go from here?

UPDATE: He came clean and told me he was sexting 10 different people over the span of a month or two. He also admitted to doing this four years ago. All through his primary and secondary reddit account. He said he wants to fix this and will do whatever it takes to do so. I'm at such a loss. I am broken. I told his mother and she is on my side and said it is my choice on what happens next and not his. Thank you for all of your kind words of advice. I have requested to see my therapist twice this week and going forward until I can come up for air. I am still trying to figure out what is best for me and my baby boy. I have been applying to jobs all day as well to establish my independence again.

ANSWER: At this point you don’t need to gather the evidence the damage has been done. Don’t stress getting the “proof” back because he will have permanently deleted by this time.  Now, it’s up to you with how you’d like to proceed, but he has shown you that he’s comfortable being sneaky and deceitful. The only reason you found out is because you found the phone (not like he’s tell you anyway bc he knows it’s weird and wrong to have that device)

The best thing you can do now is take some time away and clear your mind to make an informed and clear decision.

QUESTION: My boyfriend suddenly insisted on using protection and I don’t understand why (26F/39M)

I need mature perspective on something that happened. My boyfriend has always hated condoms. We have never really used them, except our very first time together when he wore one for about two minutes and we both agreed to take it off. Since then, we’ve always had sex without one.

Yesterday, out of nowhere, he insisted on wearing a condom and was very serious about it. When I tried to take it off because we both prefer without, he literally held my hand to stop me. That has never happened before.

When I asked why, he said he didn’t want to get me pregnant because he’s about to leave the city for six months for a short-term contract. That surprised me because he knows my cycle very well and I wasn’t fertile at all. We've also had sex on peak fertility days in the past with no protection and he has always talked about wanting a baby someday. I’ve told him I wanted to give him one, too.

For context, he was married for 15 years and his ex-wife never had a pregnancy scare. So seeing him suddenly become strict about condoms just feels strange and very sudden. And when I asked him three times why, and he redirected the conversation instead of explaining.

On top of that, he asked me to wait for him during these six months. So now my mind is going in circles. I don’t want to accuse him, but I keep wondering:

Is he suddenly unsure about our future and doesn’t know how to say it?  
Did something happen or did he get involved with someone else?  
Could he be worried about something health-related and doesn't want to talk about it?  
Did he change his mind about wanting a child with me?

These are uncomfortable questions and I don’t want to sound like I don’t trust him, but this was such an abrupt shift that I don’t know what to think. I want to approach this like an adult and communicate clearly.

Could this be a red flag? And how do I bring this up in a calm, non-accusatory way while still getting clarity?Or maybe I am not understanding his "vision"?

ANSWER: I agree. I think it's likely std related.  If not that, it could be cheating related, or both.

My.best guesses are:

1) He's been cheating with someone else and having unprotected sex. The AP recently notified him that they have an STD?

2)He's cheating, and his AP notified him that she's pregnant?

3) He currently has active herpes blisters.  He may have known all along, but since there wasn't an outbreak, he never told OP?

4) He's planning on breaking up with OP so he can screw around while he's away and really doesn't want to risk getting her pregnant?

Whatever the reason, I hope Op comes back and lets us know.

QUESTION: [FINAL UPDATE] My (M28) Fiancée (F28) randomly ended our relationship, is this abuse?

I tried to post this a week or so ago, and it didn’t go through because how close the posts were, but I knew there were a few people who wanted updates.

Fingers crossed this time it’s works.

First and foremost, thanks to everyone who messaged me offering advice and resources. It made a huge difference.

I have a lot to update on, but I’ll try to keep it short.

Once I was out, the pattern of abuse became more evident. The emotional rollercoaster she always had me on was one I didn’t really realize I got on, until I finally got off. I went into the apartment with my sister (F36) while my ex (F28) was at work to clear out all my stuff. I was initially going to go with my brother (M34), but in the calls to my mother (between 5-20 a night on weekends) she sometimes physically threatened people, and my sister wanted to be there in case she did get physical, since my brother and I wouldn’t be able to do much if she did. Obviously, neither of us would hit her or anything, so this made the most sense. (The police also didn’t seem to want to accompany us) We cleared the bulk of my stuff out but unfortunately, she did come home early, because… well, that’s been my luck lately.

She yelled a bunch, which we ignored but unfortunately, my sister spoke to her before we left because a bunch of my stuff was missing. I didn’t care about a lot of it at this point, but my sister was upset the PS5 was missing, so she told her she didn’t know where she put it, but she needed to get it because she wasn’t leaving without it. Tensions were obviously high, as my sister is currently living with my mom taking care of her, so she’s been present for the nonstop calls on the weekends. When my sister kept pressing her about it and ignoring everything else she was saying, my ex pick up a picture frame and threw it at me “for bringing her here”. At this point, everything boiled over.

My sister got between us and when she slapped my sister, a fight ensued. Long story short, police arrived, and my sister told them she wanted to file another report, which made my ex surrender the PS5 and admit she had thrown a bunch away.

Because of all this, the landlord was made aware, and I’ve  been taken off the lease.

A few days after, her mother called me. She basically wanted me to reconsider the reports filed because she was worried my ex would have charges that would follow her around and she didn’t think it was fair after I “called off the wedding and abandoned her”. I told her that she needed to have a conversation with my ex about the lies she was telling and her harassing my mother before I hung up.

Thats the long and short of it. Hopefully, I‘m done now and there won’t be any more updates. Thanks for listening to me and helping me through all this.

I don’t know what came from that conversation, but her mother did send mine flowers, so I’m guessing at least some truth came out.

Anyway, I’m hoping to put all this behind me at this point. Now that I’m done with the apartment headache, I am going to grief counselling with my family and working on starting over.

ANSWER: Do not drop the charges. Assuming that you are in the US (was just told that you are in Ontario, and looked and they do similar things with different titles) and she has no previous record, they are probably going to put her on probation and require her to do some type of anger management, community service, and pay you back for what she took from you. They will then give her as set amount of time where if she behaves (maybe a couple of years), they will clear her record. This does not always happen, but in a case like hers would happen almost all of the time.

Glad that her breaking up with you helped you get out of this relationship, and that she has now been held accountable for what she did.

QUESTION: Me(38F) husband (39M) marriage of 18 years. Should he have a girlfriend on the side?

This is pure insanity. We have 3 kids together 3, 4 and 17 yr old. I am constantly busy with the kids all day doing the whole thing. My 4 yr old and 17 yr old are both in school. I stay home with my 3 yr old during the day. My husband works 7-4 every m-f. Some days he gets off at 4 but doesn't make it home until 5 or 6 pm for various reasons. We haven't had sex or any form of sexual release in about 2 months. Our schedule doesn't always line up because I work from 7pm -12am Sunday -thursday. I get 5 hours of sleeping I'm constantly going all day with my 3 yr old. My 17 yr old is a senior she's got all kinds stuff going on. My husband is upset and thinks this is a normal thing to ask if his wife isn't giving it to him for him to seek it other places. He seems to think if he pays for everything he is owed this one small act that shows him I love him. I feel as though this is ridiculous I'm exhausted by the end of the week. He doesn't really help with the kids. He's physically present with us and the kids just not active with us whenever the kids want to play or interact with their father, there's always an excuse as to why he needs to excuse his from the situation after about 5-10 minutes. It's too loud he can't handle the kids all over him, he has to think about paying bills. I feel like I'm just his lil doll for his pleasure that he can use whenever he feels the desire and I'm left all alone and used. I've expressed these emotions and feels to him he laughs it off as to "those are silly". He will show no interest in me until the kids are down for the night and it's "his" time. I emailed a divorce attorney and I'm through with this disrespect. Almost 20 years! maybe I should just take it and just deal with it.

ANSWER: I love how you’re stretched so thin & he’s bored. Can’t even begin to see the actual problem here. Honestly, he sounds pathetic.

QUESTION: I (27F) broke up with my boyfriend (29M) partly because of his relationship with his sister (25F). Help me understand if I was appropriate please

I need some perspective because I’ve been feeling confused and invalidated about this for a long time.

I recently broke up with my boyfriend of almost 2 years, and one major reason was his relationship with his sister (who he lives with) and mom. I’ve always felt something was “off,” but any time I tried to bring it up, he acted like I was crazy, jealous, or just didn’t “understand their closeness.” Now that I’m out of it, I want to check if my concerns were valid or if I was truly overreacting.

Here are the behaviors that made me uncomfortable:

1. His sister acted territorial toward him, especially toward me.

She made comments that felt competitive or protective in a weird way. Examples:
	•	When she showed me a picture of a guy she was talking to, I said, “Oh he’s cute!” and she immediately responded with something implying I needed to “respect” her brother  even though I wasn’t talking about him at all.
	•	Another time when we were talking about men in general, I said some guys “don’t know what they’re doing in bed,” and she instantly said, “Are you talking bad about my brother?” in a defensive tone. (I only said that in response to a comment she made. She is always for some reason talking about sex. I never start talking about that to other people)

She always gave me the feeling that she was ready to defend him from me even when I wasn’t attacking him.

The sister was overly concerned about the brothers’ girlfriends, going as far as going to a witch to see if a girl had good intentions with her brother, she’d verbally fight them, & stuff

In front of my ex she would as weird questions such as “have you had other boyfriend’s in the past? why did you break up?” and make comments trying to make me look bad in front of her family.

2. She constantly called him for attention even when he was with me.

If he came to see me, she would call him:
	•	to show him where she was
	•	to show him who she was with
	•	to gossip
	•	to involve him in her drama
	•	to FaceTime him into hangouts with her friends

It often felt like she needed his attention or validation in a way that wasn’t normal sibling check-ins.

I always felt she would compare herself to me. I am thin and she is not and she would randomly start talking about how she used to be thin like me in the past and would make suggestions on how i can be prettier like “i just bought these fake lashes that would look good on you too” even though I never wear fake lashes. We have very different styles. We also had different taste in music and preferences like dancing etc & my boyfriend would always push for me to be more like his sisters in these areas. Or he would see a sister wearing something and moments later would suggest I do the same. He’d also be like “ do you wear dresses?” my mom likes it when girls wear dresses. & would ask me to be more affectionate with his family like hugging every time i saw them (which I already greeted the parents that way) & wanted me to be more extroverted like them (I lean more introvert). I feel like he wanted me to be just like them.

If I asked him to come to a room with me to help me with something, she’d call him minutes later to pull him back to her.

It started to feel like I was competing for basic emotional space.

3. She and the family made sexual or inappropriate comments about him.

I would find this weird because my family doesn’t really joke about sex and I dont talk about my sexual experiences with my brother.

His sister would:
	•	comment on his butt and slap it 
	•	say stuff like “if he wasn’t my brother, I’d date him”
	•	make sexual jokes around him
	•	talk about sex openly and directly with him

The whole family had this boundary-less dynamic I just couldn’t understand. It didn’t feel like normal teasing or sibling joking  it felt like they didn’t understand where the lines are.

4. He minimized everything, even when it clearly made me uncomfortable.

Any time I brought up my concerns, he’d say things like:
	•	“She didn’t mean it like that.”
	•	“You’re overthinking.”
	•	“You’re being weird.”
	•	“She’s just close to me.”
	•	“That’s just how we talk.”

He never acknowledged how inappropriate some of the interactions were. Instead, he made me feel like I was the one with the problem.

5. I felt constant pressure to be accepted by his family.

He told me repeatedly:
	•	“They don’t know you.”
	•	“You should try harder.”
	•	“My family’s opinion matters.”
	•	“I want you to be close with them.”

His mom and sister were disrespectful and dramatic with other partners in the family too. With most recently making his older brother’s new wife cry in a family reunion. The mom calls me to gossip and talk bad about her but i dont engage. They’ve had problems with nearly every girlfriend his siblings have brought home, and I honestly didn’t want to be the next target. I did try to befriend the sisters in the beginning before I noticed how toxic they were & I was always respectful to everyone. I’d even buy them Christmas and bday gifts.

But he acted like it was my responsibility to win them over not his responsibility to protect me or create boundaries.

6. I didn’t want to marry into a family dynamic that felt intrusive and boundaryless.

When I finally said this out loud that I didn’t want to marry into this dynamic and that I found his relationship with his sister weird he didn’t believe me. He thinks their closeness is normal and that I’m misinterpreting everything. The reason I’m posting is because I feel guilt or something feeling weirded out about their relationship since they’re siblings but it just feels off to me.I dont know if I am wrong or TA for telling him he has a weird relationship with his sister and that I dont want to marry into that.

edit to add more context

ANSWER: Bf to OP: You don't “understand \[our\] closeness.”

Op to Bf: "You're right, I don't. This doesn't work for me. Cheers."

The End.

If something doesn't sit with you, it doesn't. You can break up for any reason. It takes two people to be together and one to leave, and the only reason needed is 'This is not making me happy anymore.'

QUESTION: My boyfriend (25M) finished inside me (22F) without consent for the 4th time and lied about it. Am I going too far by ending the relationship?

We live together, have traveled the world together, and genuinely get along so well. We’re each other’s best friends. But this is now the fourth time my boyfriend has finished inside me without my consent.

The third time it happened, I told him very clearly that it was the last time I was going to tolerate it. He was apologetic and said, “it just felt so good, I couldn’t stop,” but he promised me it wouldn’t happen again.

Last night, it happened again. I asked if he finished on himself and he kept insisting: “I don’t see anything.” “I did, just a little.” “No, I didn’t finish inside you, I finished on myself, you just can’t tell.”

But I could obviously feel that he did, and there was a lot inside me.

I don’t know what to do. I told him the third time was the last time, and months later it still happened again. Half of me feels like I’m overreacting or giving up on our relationship, and the other half feels like this is a major boundary and consent issue that he keeps ignoring.

Yes, I’m on birth control. He keeps saying he’ll wear a condom from now on.

I’m really torn. Is this something I should end the relationship over?

ANSWER: Right!? Like, girl. He’s lied to you and crossed your sexual boundaries three times already… And you stick around to let him do it for the fourth time??? What’s it gonna take? A baby?? The fuck?

OP, leave this man. He has no respect for you and he’s a liar. Plain and simple.

ETA: one more thing. what’s gonna happen one day when you ask him to stop because it hurts? Because you don’t feel well? For any reason at all? He obviously has no self-control. I’m sorry, but I full heartedly believe he would just ignore you and keep going. Which would 100% be rape. And yes, I believe he would be capable of that.

“Oh but baby, it just felt so good. I couldn’t stop myself.”

Pshh… GTFO of here with that bullshit.

QUESTION: My fiancé implied I was hiding something and then gave me an ultimatum when I asked for space. We’re supposed to get married in 8 months. I don’t know what to do? (32F, 30M)

I (32F) just came back from a 2-week work trip. My fiancé (30M) and I are supposed to get married in 8 months. Something happened two nights ago that shook something in me, and I don’t know how to move forward.

I was finishing work and my manager asked if I wanted to grab a drink. I texted my fiancé and told him I was heading out with her, but my phone was still in “work mode,” so I didn’t see his messages come in.

He called me about an hour later. I didn’t want to answer in front of my manager in the middle of a conversation, so I declined the call with the auto-text “I’ll call you back later.” He immediately called again within seconds.

When I answered, he sounded upset and started with, “Why are you cancelling my call? What is this new behavior?” The accusatory tone surprised me, and honestly, embarrassed me, because my manager could hear.

I stepped outside and explained:

1. I wasn’t ignoring him
2. I was literally with my female manager and he knows about her.
3. He already knew I was going for drinks
4. And I’ve declined his calls before when I’m talking to my mom

Instead of calming down, he made a comment about how it seemed like I didn’t want him to see me.

That hit me hard. Because to me, that implied that he thought I was hiding something.

For context: We’ve been together for more than 5 years. I have never given him any reason to distrust me. Both of our locations are shared. If he was worried, he could’ve checked. But instead, it felt like he jumped straight to suspicion.

I told him that comment hurt me. He apologized for his tone, but refused to acknowledge the implication. When I asked him directly what made him think I didn’t want him to see me, he kept saying he “doesn’t know.”

I asked for some space to process because I didn’t want to escalate the fight. And his response was:

“If you need space for “small things” like this, then how will you handle real problems in marriage? If you don’t give me an answer soon, I’ll tell my parents to cancel the wedding arrangements.”

It felt like an ultimatum instead of a conversation. I told him I won’t make any decision while I’m feeling pressured, and that we can talk when we’re both calm.

We tried talking on the phone later, but it ended with me crying and him hanging up on me.

Since then, no calls, no texts and he posted a story drinking alone in a bar.

And I don’t know how to read anything anymore BUT I do know this: the trust issue he projected onto me did not come from anything I did.

And I’m scared that if it surfaced now, it will surface again during marriage, during bigger conflicts, during harder times.

So I’m here asking strangers because I’m too emotionally flooded to trust my own judgment:

Is this something that can be worked through with emotional maturity and communication? Or is this showing me that we are not ready for marriage?

ANSWER: I would meet up with him in public and point blank ask him what has he done when you were gone for the 2 weeks to project so hard on you and demand to see his phone. Normally when someone comes up like that with accusations out of nowhere they are cheating

QUESTION: UPDATE: My (30M) best man (31M) stole my wife (30F) and I think he’s back to take my girlfriend (29F)

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/1od1thu/my\_30m\_best\_man\_31m\_stole\_my\_wife\_30f\_and\_i\_think/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1od1thu/my_30m_best_man_31m_stole_my_wife_30f_and_i_think/)

Didn't expect to get as many replies as I did, so I figured I'd reply to all here rather than individually.

I've read all the comments, and first of all I'd like to thank all those people that gave me genuine good advice. Secondly there seems to be a few things I need to clear up;

I am from the UK, when I refer to 'camp' I literally just mean base. I don't HAVE to stay there for the whole week, but it is a 90 minute - 2 hour drive back home (I know that doesn't seem far to you Americans as you have to drive two hours to get off your streets, but it's long for me). 
 Nobody remained friends with Judas, I did put that in the original post, but a lot of people skimmed over it. Him, Leah, and Andrew all left the group around the time Judas and Leah's relationship was public knowledge.
 When I wanted to spend time with the friend group, Leah would've been there too, so I wasn't completely neglecting her.
 For those asking, Judas kept his teeth because I literally have not seen him even once since I found out.
 Another point a few skipped over, Judas and Andrew are cousins, so they were always going to remain friendly, and take each others sides.
 I didn't immediately demand to see her phone to check the FaceTime because I panicked, I went into fight or flight and clearly chose flight, not really what you want from a man supposed to defend your country but hey. 
 No, I don't know who Kel Knight is.

Anyway, back to it; After leaving and going to my mums, Phoebe had been messaging/trying to call, basically just asking to explain herself, I'd said I'd be back later. After posting on here and reading/replying for a while I managed to get some sleep, I'd been up all night.

First thing I did when I woke up was call Phoebe's brother, explained to him my plan to propose (pureply so he could be the one to break that to her when I chose to leave her). I also asked if he had been in contact with her recently, he said no. The FaceTime can't have been him then.

I get back home, ready with everything I need to say, ready to call Phoebe out on her bullshit, but before I can speak she hands me her phone, tells me I can look through, that she's deleted nothing, and that she'd like to talk and explain rather than shout and argue.

There's nothing in the FaceTime call logs, but in her regular call logs there's a Snapchat video call from Judas. I was kind of relieved that I wasn't just being a paranoid mess. But obviously my heart sank. She said that Snapchat was the only place she could find him because he was in her blocked list, so she'd just unblocked him. Sounds to me like Phoebe was the one that had gone looking to contact Judas.

I read through a bunch of the saved messages on there, to be fair it was mostly just boring chit chat and talking about musicals. Stopped reading when I got to a message from Phoebe to Judas saying 'I miss you'. Clicked on his profile to delete and block him for her, and saw at the bottom of that page when they became friends on there, it was dated just a week before. So at least they haven't been talking again for very long I guess. What also caught my eye, was in the saved pictures, there was a picture of her feet. Phoebe claims that's from a long long time ago, apparently Snapchat still saves all the previously saved pictures when you unblock someone. Does anyone know if that's actually true? I'm not too familiar with it. Either way, I deleted and blocked him for her.

She then explained that she only readded Judas because she was always feeling lonely with me away 4 nights a week, and she'd just needed a friend. I don't know why our current friends weren't good enough for that, but whatever. She was making all the same complaints my ex wife had been making before we separated.

I've told her for this to work she needs to keep Judas out of our lives. I've told her I'll look for work outside of the army and leave. I'm a mechanic there so I assume I can find work in a garage or something easy enough. We spent the week together and it was fine.

I'm now currently back at base, and I'm deciding on if I follow through on that promise to leave and look for work elsewhere, or if I completely jump ship and literally just move elsewhere in the country, probably still look for work as a mechanic somewhere too, start brand new, and not have my career keep costing me relationships.

TLDR; Phoebe had started speaking to Judas again because she was lonely, I'm either going to leave the army and stay with her. Or I'm going to move cities and cut all ties with everyone, and start again, I'm still figuring it out. I think I've lost a lot of trust in her.

Thanks for reading, thanks for the advice. Any further advice is always appreciated.

ANSWER: Speaking to the dude who took up with your wife because she was 'lonely' and has no one else to talk to? This is....very naive.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My (32F) boyfriend (36M) of 8+ years won't marry me

Link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/S8DnCLF7l6

I debated posting an update, because now that everything is resolved I feel kind of silly about posting in the first place, but maybe this can find someone in a similar situation and help.

I should add that I am an over thinker and anxious person, and this is probably why I got here in the first place. After 8+ years of relationship, I started doubting our future only because of the lack of initiative on his part, and it's like all the algorithms decided to feed these feelings with similar stories that didn't end well. So I started over thinking everything, and basically ignored all the signs that we were doing great, like his constant reassurance that he loved me and was happy with me, when he would look me with mesmerized eyes while just going about our daily life. I felt so loved and cared for, but the lack os a proposal had to mean something was wrong, right?

A week before our big trip, while introducing the topic of marriage, trying to start a conversation like I was advised here, he was really dismissive, trying to change subject, and that sent me spiraling down on anxious thoughts. When he realized that hurt me, he immediately back tracked, started apologizing and said that he was only avoiding the subject because he had something planned and wanted it to be a surprise.

When asked on other occasions, months before, he had confirmed his intentions of marrying me one day, but this time was different. It was enough to lift any doubt I had, and I also didn't want to ruin any surprise so I dropped the subject.

Then, as expected, during our trip, in a beautiful place, doing what we always loved doing together these past 8 years, he proposed! It was one of those moments that I felt really seen, like everything was thought out to make me happy, without me having to ask for it. He even managed to record it in the most unsuspicious way, so I'll always have something to remember it.

So this uptade is to say that every relationship is different and every life has a different timeline. There isn't any amount of years that automatically tells you the other person doesn't want to get married. Obviously I'm not saying to ignore any signs, but you have to look inside the relationship rather than compere to others and seek external validation.

Even though most comments on the original post went in a different direction, I probably wouldn't have started that conversation with him when I did, and wouldn't have been so relaxed during our trip when he proposed. So I appreciate you guys for that!

ANSWER: I just read a post earlier about a guy who’d been trying to propose to his girlfriend - he kept offering to pay for her to get her nails done and stuff kept getting in the way. I felt so sorry for him because he was trying to do it exactly how she wanted and she kept accidentally sabotaging it! 🤣

As soon as you said he was dismissive before the trip I knew what he was planning. I’m glad it all worked out for you. 🫶 Congratulations 🥂

QUESTION: I (30F) am planning a drastic breakup with fiance (39M)

Hi all!

This is an abridged version.

I’ve (30F) been with my fiance (39M) for 4.5 years and the last year has been bad. We’ve lived together for around 3 years. We barely talk, he is not interested in me, we haven’t had sex this year, we don’t sleep together, etc. You get the picture. We both work full time, earn similar money, but I do 90% of the house chores. He also has quite bad anger issues that got worse in the past year - lots of yelling, accusations, etc. I stopped engaging some time ago but it makes no difference. When angry, he calls me names, say borderline threatening things, gets in my face and scream at me.

Recently I went to stay with my parents for 2 weeks and they were really worried about my state. I looked tired, depleted, grey and seemed depressed (still do). It was a wake up call being around people who care about me.

I decided to leave him. However I am afraid of his reaction, so together with my parents (my mums first marriage was to a similar man who was very explosive) we decided to move me out while he is away and later explain it to him via phone call or suggest a meeting in a public space.

So now this is supposed to happen this weekend. I am battling a lot of guilt, but I know this is the right thing (to preface your questions, we tried couples therapy, I tried reconnecting etc, several people suggested anger management sessions for him as well). I feel myself losing myself, I barely have time to relax between work, house chores, etc - mostly cleaning after him and being told I’m not doing anything.

The question is - how does one deal with the guilt of leaving, especially in such a cowardly way? Can I leave a letter? text him?

My heart sinks when I imagine him coming to a half empty house. But I do not see any other way.

I have my parents with me and they will stay with me in my new place for as long as needed, my friends are really supportive. I know once I’m out and I have the conversation with him, I’m going to be fine?

Thanks for reading!

ANSWER: I'm sorry you feel guilt about leaving in a "cowardly way," when the reality is you're doing that to ensure your safety. I think you should see a therapist to find out why you don't value yourself, learn why you put up with this for so long, & ensure you never put up with this treatment again.

P.S. he will demand to talk to you for "closure;" that's just because he wants to manipulate you into getting back together with him, because he will miss his maid. Don't fall for that, or any promises to change. He has shown you who he is.

QUESTION: My wife [54f] and I [56m] argue about this, and I would appreciate your insight?

Which direction do you think the TP roll should face? I was raised to have the paper cascade forward, like a waterfall to make it easy to grab. My wife doesn't like to see the ragged end. So, she prefers to load the roll "backwards!" She stayed in some fancy hotel in London that had backward rolls, and that's how she justifies her obviously misguided opinion.

I looked up the US patent license for "rolled toilet tissue." The inventor's drawing of the TP roll shows it facing forward with 2 squares hanging down for easy access.

We don't disagree about much, but this has been a running battle for 26yrs! I would like to settle this and flush our troubles down the drain. Can ya help a brother out?!?

PSA: To the spider ladies, my wife spoke with her coworker at the museum who works with spiders. She said spiders are more likely to be on the floor than behind the waterfall on the tp roll. They're hunting, if they're out. Nothing to eat on the roll...you're safe!

FINAL FINAL: There were a dozen or so recommendations to get a bidet...some of whom thought they deserved mention. While this was a TP question, I did include the divorcemongres. So, 13ppl think tp is generally stupid and prefer a mini butt shower...because that's what smarties do. K? I think that's everyone! Except the lady who uses a "butt knife." I almost Googled it, but it could fuck up my algorithm.

FINAL EDIT: we have a clear preference for the waterfall, P over q, bangs over mullet in regard to the tissue issue! 84% of commenters prefer forward. 3% hold no preference. 10% have cats. 2 people are backwards to rebel against societal norms. 4 people are backwards because spiders live behind the waterfall. A full 3% of commenters skipped the tissue issue and prefer divorce.

My wife decided to switch teams a minute ago. We heard from a woman who was head of marketing for the UKs largest tp company. The company paid for a study to investigate the tissue issue. The scientists proved backward is unclean due to incidental wall contact xferring urine and feces (not you, everyone else). That convinced the wife. Yay!!!

We also heard from the inlaw of a descendant of the inventor of tp! He said the inventor had actually drawn the roll in both directions for the patent. However, everyone in the family is forward. Nope, they don't receive any money in tp royalties...that was disappointing.

Das ende.

EDIT: We don't have little kids or cats. It's possible she does this when she's angry to fugg with me...and I've been oblivious for 26yrs. It seems to happen every time she replaces a roll. I'm not THAT hard to live with. We are not adding more tp holders. We are not getting divorced over her backward ass tp hanging style. We are going to all use all bathrooms.

You cat ladies have a lot of cats. Just a reminder to spay or neuter your pets. Thank you for the cat stories! I enjoy hearing about their silly antics.

Thank you for your kind funny and serious replies. I had no idea so many people have the "tissue issue" (stole that from a reply).

ANSWER: I thought I'd give her one more chance...stupid to expect a different outcome. We've been to a counselor, who puts her rolls on correctly, but wife is adamant. The other morning she asked me to hand her a new roll, and put it on backwards RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME! I immediately left...because of the smell, but c'mon!

QUESTION: My 26m girlfriend 26f came home drunk and now I can't look at her the same way.

Hi everyone.

So me and my Girlfriend have been together just over 2 years now. Generally the relationship is okay, we go through periods of arguing a lot but always seem to come out the other side. I had a rough relationship with my ex (we were together for 7 years) during which she isolated me from most of my friends and would often call or facetime me randomly to make sure I was at home if she wasn't with me. This relationship has led to troubles in my new relationship, primarily if my girlfriend gets angry or really upset I'm not sure how to respond so usually just shut down until she calms down then I can talk about it. This has led to her saying she feels like we don't connect much emotionally even though I make consistent efforts to be there for her as much as possible and be open about my emotions and thoughts. I have pretty severe depression at the moment and struggle a lot with anxiety so this is hard for me but I do my best to be the best I can be for her, however admittedly I'm not always great at it. I do however show my love and affection by way of acts of service. If she wants or needs something I'll get it for her or do it for her no questions asked. This divide has led to a very inconsistent sex life. We have in the past gone more than 4 months without sex, but commonly its maybe once every month or two and even when we do have it she tends to just lay there, opting exclusively for missionary or doggy whereas I have asked on multiple occasions for her to be on top, to receive oral (She gets oral just doesn't give it back) etc. She always says no.

Now to the other night. She went out drinking with one of her girl friends at around 2pm and called me to pick her up around 11pm. I went to get her, took her friend home and then took her to McDonalds. Multiple times in the car she was telling me about all the men who tried to get with her but kept saying she didn't go with any of them because she's loyal to me. We got to McDonalds and she used to work there so recognised 2 of the workers and began talking to them through the drive thru, before asking me to park and she went inside. She was in there for about 20 minutes before coming out and starting an argument with a group of boys outside. I had to go rescue her because she was being quite aggressive and there were maybe 6-7 of the boys there. She got back in the car and again on the way home was telling me about other guys trying it on with her. We got home and she immediately went super affectionate but in a kind of aggressive way, Pushing me and biting my lip and neck very hard. I told her this hurt and to calm down with it which she did for a little while. We ended up having sex and when she drinks she finds it hard to finish so I finished first. I offered to help her with toys which she agreed but ended up falling asleep not even 20 seconds into it so I stopped, put the toy away and went to go to sleep myself. She woke up as soon as I did that and began asking for another round. This was less than 5 minutes after the first round so I was not ready and told her as much. She proceeded to touch herself and tried to put her fingers in my mouth to which I told her not to. This prompted me to get the toy back out and she decided she did not want that and wanted me instead. I still was not ready and told her that but she didn't give up and proceeded to bite me, scratch me and attempt oral on me. She was very rough and it hurt. I said ow and stop multiple times but she didn't, and she ended up climbing on top of me and engaging in the full thing. I was still not ready and told her again she needs to wait and it's not been long enough yet but she didn't listen. She was on top for a little then tried reverse cowgirl which is something I have asked her to do a few times but being as I was uncomfortable and not recharged yet she gave up almost immediately and just got off me really annoyed. I told her its just nature but she didn't respond just went to sleep pretty quickly afterwards.

I was very confused and upset at this situation so didn't sleep much the rest of the night, I actually had a cigarette which I haven't smoked in months but felt I needed it and almost cried but I'm also not quite sure why? She has been acting normally since the event and I'm not sure whether to talk to her about it or not because I'm worried if I tell her I didn't like it she'll cut off sex altogether again and it'll be months until we engage in it or she'll get mad at me and tell me I can't make up my mind or I'm trying to make her feel bad for something. But since that night I can't look at her the same way, I've felt very off emotionally, my depression is definitely getting worse and I didn't really know that I had much worse to go. I'm struggling to understand even my own thoughts on this situation and really don't know how to proceed with it.

ANSWER: Dude she sexually abused you. No amount of booze justifies it and yeah you're going to see her different than you did before.

Her whole obsession with how she's shutting down guys left and right also seems to be saying something crummy about her, but I don't know why it's rubbing me as badly as it does. I get you've got a lot of sunk cost here, but these red flags are bad and you shouldn't ignore them.

QUESTION: My boyfriend (29M) gave me (27F) an ultimatum: him or my dogs and I don’t know how to handle his rigidity anymore.

Hi everyone,
I’m looking for perspective because I feel completely stuck.

My boyfriend (29M) and I (27F) have been together for about 10 months, but we’ve known each other for over two years as close friends and dance partners. Our connection has always been deep. We communicate well, care for each other, and when things are good, it feels like we’re genuinely a team. But there’s one issue that keeps coming back, and it’s now become an ultimatum: my dogs.

He’s made it clear that he can’t live with them. He says he can’t stand the smell, the hair, or the idea of mess...even the possibility of something like scratches or accidents stresses him out. He also says he doesn’t want to “feel guilty” when I’m tired and need help, because he doesn’t want to go against his “principles” and help with them at all.

At first, he said he was open to trying and wanted to see how it would go. We came up with compromises or solutions like: building an outdoor space or sunroom for the dogs, keeping them mostly outside, me taking full responsibility, even having them stay with my parents part of the time. Every time, he agreed for a while, and then later, he would pull back again and say it didn’t bring him peace.

He told me he wants a “simple life,” and the thought of dogs adds stress. But the pattern goes deeper than just the dogs. Whenever something happens that makes him feel restricted or out of control, he becomes uncomfortable and distant. If plans change unexpectedly, or I ask for small favors, he gets frustrated. Even little things like wanting to stop at home before going somewhere, can make him feel “trapped.”

He admits that he feels bad when he sees me tired, because he knows helping would make things easier for me, but he “doesn’t want to do it out of principle.” He says if he does it anyway, he’ll resent it, so in his mind, it’s better to not do it at all. So he also said he knows in both cases he's feel bad. He even said something like if I broke my leg, he wouldn’t walk the dogs, because a “deal is a deal.” But he also knows it would then fall onto him and he doesn’t want that. It’s like he’s allergic to any situation that requires flexibility or emotional labor.

What hurts most is that I can see how hard he’s trying to feel in control of his life, but I wish he could see that life isn’t controllable. I think the dogs are just the biggest trigger for a deeper discomfort, they represent unpredictability, responsibility, and the need to rely on others. And instead of looking at why that scares him, he just tells himself, “I can’t do this, I don't like it.”

When we talk about it, he tells me he’s been thinking about it for weeks and can’t find peace with the idea of living with dogs for years. He says it’s not me, but that he doesn’t see how we can work long-term if our lifestyles are so different. But I’ve tried every compromise I can think of, and he refuses them all.

I love him deeply, but I feel like I’m walking on eggshells around his discomfort. I can’t express too much emotion or he shuts down. I can’t ask for help without him feeling trapped. It’s exhausting, and yet I keep trying because I can see the person he is underneath the fear. Someone who is warm, loving, and gentle when he feels safe.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t imagine giving up my dogs, but I also don’t want to lose him.
Has anyone ever been with someone like this...who’s so rigid that compromise feels impossible? Can people like that change, or am I setting myself up for years of walking on eggshells? I don't need him to do anymore work for them. I would take the responsibility, but I don't feel like I can be with someone who can't accept that and be a bit flexible and help me out as a partner when needed. Also people around have been telling me to live him because if he truly loved me he would've learned to accept it....

TLDR:
My boyfriend (29M) and I (27F) have been together for 10 months, but he gave me an ultimatum: him or my dogs. He says living with dogs makes him feel restricted and takes away his peace. We’ve tried coming up with compromises, but he always changes his mind and refuses to help “out of principle.” This same rigidity shows up in other areas too. He struggles whenever life feels unpredictable or out of his control. I love him, but I’m always the one adjusting, and I don’t know what to do.

Edit for clarification (since this post blew up a bit!):

To clarify the broken leg example: I don’t mean he would literally refuse to help me. He’s a caring person, and he would help, but he’s said he wouldn’t like it because it would go against his “principles” about not wanting responsibility for the dogs. Which then he is afraid he would resent me because of it.

We’ve officially been together for about 10 months, but we were best friends and dance partners for about a year and a half before dating. There’s a lot of history, trust, and care between us which makes this situation harder. We would be seeing each other if we broke up and we'd still dance together.

I would never give up my dogs for him. And he would rather break up than have me get rid of them. I love them deeply and they are my responsibility, but I am willing to compromise and have tried to find every possible middle ground (outside space, part-time at my parents’, etc.). When I say “outside,” I don’t mean literally outdoors 100% (even though they enjoy that) we even discussed building an enclosed veranda or connected room where the dogs could stay, so they’d still be part of the home. And my parents love them as much as I do, so having them stay there occasionally wouldn’t be neglect or “dumping them.” The dogs are family dogs, so my parents are just as involved as me.

I understand how some people might see me as trying to “force solutions,” but I realize now I probably didn’t present the situation clearly enough. I’ve genuinely tried to balance everyone’s needs here.

I do realize his reactions likely come from deeper fears around losing control, being restricted, or feeling trapped. I don’t think he’s a bad person. I think he’s struggling with something bigger internally. I have probably overanalyzed it a lot since I'm an intern psychologist and working towards my master's degree in clinical psychology. I understand how my bf could seem like an asshole, but I have the tendency to look past surface behavior. But I am also aware that I am not a person to give easily, which can be good or bad. My previous relationship lasted 7 years and even when there were signs, I still was stubborn as I saw easy solutions. But I also realize that the other person needs to be willing to change or work on their issues.

And lastly...He loves animals, just not having them himself. He’s actually great with my dogs when we’re together. He plays with them, cuddles them, and they love him too. It’s not that he dislikes them... it’s more about what they represent to him: responsibility, restriction, and less freedom. And the idea of them potentially getting in the way of him doing what he wants when he wants is the reason for his discomfort.

Thank you all for the comments and messages. I can't reply to everyone, but I hope the edit gives some more insight.

ANSWER: > principle

He keeps using that word.  I do not think it means what he thinks it means.  Ironically, I’m not sure it means anything to him at all, except as a convenient catch-all for “thing I don’t like and don’t want to deal with.”

> I also don’t want to lose him

Why?  Seriously, why?  You haven’t been dating a year yet, and you’re already contemplating major sacrifices to placate a guy who you yourself admit is incapable of being satisfied unless the universe is willing to arrange itself exactly according to his expectations.  You won’t even be alone if you dump him now; you’ll still have your dogs for comfort.  So how is this even a question?

QUESTION: I, 48m, realized I probably need to leave my marriage with my 48f wife because I have quite a strong crush on a woman (45f) who I've known for a few years. Am I an idiot? A massive jerk? Monkeybranching?

I've been in a roommate-style marriage for a decade or so, married for over 20 years. Sex once a year or so, no affection, I tried to initiate both sex and normal intimacy for most of these years but about a year ago I was just done, a 10-20% percent rate at reciprocal (non-sexual, primarily) affection means 90-80% of the time I feel rejected and my self esteem is in the fucking gutter. I don't try anymore and to be honest I'm beyond wanting to have sex with her anymore. Why haven't I left? Two kids, our finances and retirement funds are all tied up in the house we live in, and we were both born and raised in the US and now live in a foreign country. An aging relative lives in a small apartment attached to the house. I'm frankly not sure how well my wife would manage without me financially and/or emotionally speaking. I'm not particularly happy in my job but I have these 4 people who's lives would likely be worse if I changed to a more fulfilling but lower paying job, or left my wife.

About 5 years ago I worked closely and on a daily basis with a married woman who I had a lot in common with and found very attractive but that was that. It was basically just the two of us in a small room all day for a few months. As is often the case in this situation you end up taking quite a bit about your personal life and you get to know each other pretty well. I enjoyed the time I spent working with her and that was that. There was no flirting, nothing that I wouldn't have done had she been a guy or a 70 year old woman that I connected with. We still occasionally run into each other for work, and we don't work at the same company anymore but our professional lives are pretty intertwined. We'd meet up every six months or so for lunch or a drink. We talked about our respective relationships and our issues. A year or so ago she separated from her husband.

Recently we met up after work, talked a bit about some projects we were working on. In the course of the conversation she told me that she had such a crush on me when we were working on together and how could I not have noticed, etc. I had no idea. I told her that I felt the same at the time.

Since then I was basically broken. I couldn't stop thinking about her, about what could have been...We both had to travel a bit for work and vacation after this and we weren't writing back forth or anything during that time. I was aware that I was likely blowing this all out of proportion in my head, and was frankly hoping that I was because it would be easier than the alternative. Last week we met for coffee and I basically told her how I felt and how conflicted I was. She basically said she felt the same and that she felt bad for sparking this. I assured her that whatever I decided I didn't want her to feel responsible for it, if I left my marriage and she decided that she wanted nothing to do with me, that's fine.

I tried to act as normal as possible during this time, my wife and I had our usual arguments, but one relatively minuscule thing was the final straw. She wrote a grocery shopping list as she often does, and I added about 10 things to the bottom of it (I cook more than half the time, for both the family and my work lunches). She cut the grocery list in half, and said she'd only get the stuff she wrote down because the other stuff is "me" stuff. I took both grocery lists and bought everything. It struck me that our marriage is really, really bad. My wonderful 16 year old told me she basically wishes we'd split up.

I'm aware of the fact that I could have headed this off much earlier. Talking about my relationship issues with her left me open to this. And the worst thing I did was not communicate more clearly and set my boundaries earlier before my marriage deteriorated to the point that it has. I also know that I'm high on the feeling of someone actually liking me and that my judgement is clouded, and that red flags will likely be ignored and before long this woman may very well be taking shits with the door open or express a desire to collect 27 cats or tell me about her side MLM business...I

Clearly my only option is telling my wife. I have zero desire for a physical affair. The problem is, I don't want to move past this and continue with the marriage. I have absolutely zero idea how she'll react

ANSWER: Leave for you, not for an imagined relationship that may or may not happen. Figure out how to make everything work financially, but it sounds like everyone, including your kids, would be happier for you both to divorce.

QUESTION: My (M33) new girlfriend (F26) and I had sex for the first time and now she’s “changed her mind” about us.

⬇️UPDATE⬇️

_She just texted me and wants to know if we can talk tonight, I’ll post an update tomorrow_

My (M33) new girlfriend (F26) and I had sex for the first time. We were dating for about a month, really getting along great, and sharing a lot of moments together. The timing felt right, for me, and it happened naturally.

Last Saturday she came for dinner. We had a lovely evening, dinner, movie and she stayed the night. Shortly after the movie was done, we were both all over each other on the couch, and had sex for the first time (in the bedroom). It wasn’t a quickie by any means; I was really focused on her and took the time to make sure she really enjoyed it. To me, it was an extremely passionate and mutually enjoyed experience.

Sunday we woke up, had a late breakfast, relaxed in the couch for a while and everything seemed fairly normal. I gave her a ride home in the afternoon but a couple hours later, she sent me a text message that said, “I’m sorry, but I think I’ve changed my mind about us and I need time to think”. I just said, “Okay, I enjoy being with you and I am open to talking about it when you’re ready.”

I decided to give her space, but it’s been three days and I have heard nothing. She hasn’t called or text since Sunday night. I was thinking of trying to call her after work, but afraid it will come across as too pushy. This happened to me once before too, so now I’m taking inventory of all the possible things that could be wrong with me, and I just can’t seem to figure out what it could be.

Without the full context of the relationship I suppose it’s really hard to provide commentary, but everything seemed to be almost perfect and suddenly it’s not.

What is going on here? Is this just a matter of the relationship progressing to fast and her getting scared? Or maybe she felt like she made a bad decision?

I’m curious what women out there are thinking, from the perspective of a woman.

ANSWER: I'm guessing she didn't enjoy it or maybe the sexual chemistry wasn't there.

It could help to ask for feedback but only if you can be receptive. Sorry bro.

QUESTION: My husband (48m) said something to me (43m) in frustration and I can't get over it.

How do I get over what my husband said in frustration earlier this week?

After a particularly frustrating day for him he'd come home from work early. I greeted him as I work from home. When I asked why he'd come home early he mentioned that he hadn't been feeling well. I offhandedly mentioned that it could have something to do with him staying out late for the northern lights earlier in the week, implying lack of sleep.

He lost his mind, saying I was blaming him for being sick, that I didn't care about him, that I was being unsupportive. I let him know that wasn't my intention, I was just suggesting it could be a contributing factor.

He went into his home office and slammed the door. About 5 minutes later he came tearing out yelling that he knows his life is miserable, that he hates it, that he's alone in the world with no one who cares about him. It was such a wild and bizarre escalation. No matter how much I tried to reassure him that wasn't true, it didn't matter.

The next morning he treated like he didn't yell that he hated our life. He's seemingly moved on but I can't.

For context, we've been together 14 years.

Edit:
I know that most don't or won't believe the tone of my question was more out of concern than accusatory. I was essentially asking it to suss out whether it was a cold, general not feeling well, or stomach bug.

Regardless, after space and time, we talked. The issue was due to work stress compounding and an issue with a coworker who has caused problems in the past.

I went to the store and bought stuff to make him homemade pizza and pizza fries for dinner with homemade dipping sauce. We each apologized in our own ways.

ANSWER: OP, I think you’re missing a major point here. Either there’s a lot you haven’t shared with us, or you’re unaware of your partner’s actual emotional state.

His initial reaction and subsequent comments sound like someone who may be experiencing depression. This goes far beyond just having a hard day or a lack of sleep.

QUESTION: I (35 F) am angry about how friends (33 F and 32 M) behaved in my home. Do I say something?

My spouse recently had a birthday, and I decided it would be nice to fly a couple friends and their two children to visit. They couldn't have afforded it, so I thought it would also be fun for them. We've been talking about having our children meet, too. They have a one-year-old and six-year-old. We have an eight-month-old. I was admittedly annoyed as soon as I brought up the topic. The woman, we'll call her Alice, made demands about seat preferences and insisted on a seat for her one-year-old. I always buy a seat for my baby, but I'm not asking other people to pay for it.

Anyway, the time comes, and they're staying in our guest room. They make an enormous mess in our living room and kitchen almost immediately. They leave garbage and their stuff everywhere. Their kids are dumping food all over the place. The older one is a nightmare and is constantly demanding I push in her chair or get her ice when it melts in her glass or find her a snack or read her a book. The parents said nothing. The younger one just sits there and screams. They're both very noisy, and the parents didn't do anything even when we would tell them we're putting our baby for a nap. We eventually told Alice she needs to keep the baby in the guest room while our baby naps.

They expected us to pay for takeout for every meal but made demands about what we could order. No fast food because they eat that all the time. I don't eat much fast food, but I'd have preferred to buy that for them instead of paying $200 to feed them every time they were hungry. I know I should have put my foot down here.

The worst part was that on the day of my husband's birthday, the reason they were here, they said they forgot it was that weekend. They didn't have a gift for him. I usually wouldn't care, but I paid over $1k for them to fly out, hosted them, and paid for everything while they were here. What was supposed to be something fun for my husband turned into a free vacation for them and a nightmare weekend for us.

Finally, when they left, we found that their older kid hid candy wrappers under her bed. There was chocolate smeared all over the sheets of both beds. Paper was everywhere. They moved things around and didn't put them back. We found two dirty pull ups that the 6-year-old literally hid. I was so angry that I texted about the sheets. Alice just said "I'm sorry 🤦‍♀️"

What do I say to them? If anything?

ANSWER: I don't think there's anything to be said — they showed you their true colors. They were inconsiderate and used you. I would not want to be friends with people like that.

What is your goal in saying something? Do you want to mend this relationship, or do you just want to vent?

QUESTION: How do I, 42F deal with my Husband's, 43M compulsion to turn off the breakers in our house instead of turning off lights?

My husband and I have been married 10 years. We've been living in our current apartment for the last three where the breaker box is conveniently located in our bedroom. For the last year my husband has decided that it is easier, and saves money, to just turn off the breakers to the house instead of turning off the lights. Now if we were leaving on a trip and we're going to be gone for a few days I actually have no problem with this because it saves us money however he does this everyday. I leave for work before him and when he leaves for work he turns off the breakers in the house so that when I get home before him I'm walking into a dark house with no wifi. Now that it's getting colder, I'm also walking into a cold dark house with no wifi. This frustrates me to no end. I hate walking into my own home and not being able to turn on a light switch and being able to see. I hate walking into the house and have to turn on the breaker before the wifi or heater will work. 
My husband has OCD, although not officially diagnosed, so I try to be sympathetic that this compulsion stems from that. But my patience is wearing thin. I've brought this up before and he said that it's just easier for him to turn off the breakers than to walk around the house and turn off the lights. I told him to make the kids turn off the lights but he doesn't. On the days when I take the kids to school in the morning I make a big effort to have all the lights off so that he doesn't need to turn off the breakers, he still does.
I don't know what to do to help him to stop doing this. Any advice on how to approach this topic with him? Anyone else with OCD have a similar compulsion? Is this something that I will just have to learn to deal with for the next 40years?

ANSWER: So is your refrigerator just off for 9 hours of the day? That doesn't seem food safe.

Have you tried telling him, "Stop turning off the breaker."  
If you have and he still does it, it's time for some good ol' duct tape to tape over the breaker box. Not enough to seal it in case of actual need of access, but enough to remind him to stop touching it.

QUESTION: GF (31F) has forced me (32M) to take her penalty points. How do I proceed?

Hi! to keep it short my partner of 3 years (& baby) was caught doing 34mph in 20 zone. She already had 6 points & it would have been a potential further 6 points leading to a ban. I explained to her that if her face hadnt been caught on camera & if it wouldn't be potentially 6 points, court appearance etc I would have taken the points for her but also people have gone to prison for such "preventing course of justice".

She came into the room just now & gave me a letter from Merseyside police. She had forged my reply / signature on the initial letter confirming it was me and not her as the car is under my name. It is £100 fine & 3 points I assume as I have a clean license. I don't care about a 3 points but I just don't know how to deal with what she has done & is very messed up. She told me she was angry and upset when we had an argument & did it. Now I am questioning everything about her and have lost all respect for her that she has done this.

ANSWER: If it gets out they will BOTH be in trouble. This happened to an MP and his wife, Chris Huhne and Vicky Pryce, they swapped points, ended up going to prison, lost their jobs and ended their marriage. It's a really big deal and OP needs to get out of this. If they can see her face this will be found out.

QUESTION: I 26M am Buying a house with my gf 27F and she invited her mom and brother to live with us.

For starters, using my burner account.

Me 26M and my GF 27F of 4 years are in the final steps of buying a house, it’s an exciting time and journey but everything changed today.

Her home life has never been easy, her father has always been an agressive man to the whole family, and has hit her mom before. It has been a few years since it had last happened, but a few days ago it happened again.

Her brother just turned 18 and suffers from anxiety, he never leaves the house and quit school all together and her mom works minimum wage.

Well, she told me a few hours ago that she found out what her father did and said that they could come live with us when we move to the new house.

I dont know what to do here. I love her to death and I feel awful that I even feel like this, but this is not something that I want for us, we haven’t even started living together, it was supposed to be the next step for us, and all of the sudden this happens and I might have to share a house with her family as well.

I know that this might sound selfish, but I feel sad that she didn’t even speak with me first about this, it’s our house, these decisions should be made together.

I don’t know, just want some advice on how to take the next steps, feeling a little lost and conflicted right now. Has anyone been in this situation or similar before?

Edit: I see a lot of concerns about the legal aspects of buying a house with a girlfriend, we live in a European country, some things work differently here and this is one of them.

Edit #2:
Some more clarifications, I have talked today with her in person and expressed my concerns.
first, we have lived together in a rental for about one year, my phrasing may have been a little off, English is a second language, but this opportunity came for the house, and we decided to advance on that.
Additionally we are not based in the US, and yes, married couples do have a set of rules different than non married couples, but in my country, when it comes to buying a house, it’s the same as if we were married. In addition to that, we also signed a contract made by our lawyer, that in case we break up, the down payment on the house which was with only my money, is still mine, so I would have that percentage of the house in addition to the 50% that is used as basis.
Her mother is very nice to us, she also calls me son, she has never used any power plays or anything like that with us, she is a lovely lady that always offers me soup when I go to her house. Of course her mom doesn’t want this to happen, none of us do, and if it does, we will set an appropriate time until they have to move out.
It’s an unfortunate thing that has happened, and I’m not cancelling the purchase, nor do I want to end the relationship.
It hurt and it was concerning that she didn’t consult me before saying they could move in, but it was in the heat of the moment, and she was in shock, after talking with her it was made clear that it’s something that will only happen if we both agree to it, if we don’t, then we will try to find other solutions.

Thank you all for the comments, I’ve read most of them even tho I didn’t respond to any.

ANSWER: You definitely aren’t selfish, she cant just ask someone to move into your home without checking with you. Buying a new house is already stressful and may strain your relationship. Adding other people into the equation will make it even worse. I’d talk to her from this angle. If she insists, I’d back out of the sale, which would probably also mean the end of your relationship.

QUESTION: I 18F find my 18M boyfriend’s face during sex a big turn off. How do I go about this?

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year now and we’re in a semi-long-distance relationship. We can only see each other on weekends sometimes, as we’re both seniors in high school and attend different schools. This leads to late-night phone calls and as horny teenagers are these calls sometimes get ✨spicy✨. Which I personally enjoy it over the phone but the one thing about it is his face while we're pleasuring ourselves. It's such a big turn-off for me. He bites his bottom lip and flares his top lip into an almost “m” shape scrunching his face like he's taking the biggest shit of his life. Now my partner is an attractive man, with curly hair pretty blue eyes and a nice body all around it's just during these moments his appearance is a turn off.  We’ve had sex in person but it was always dark or from behind so I’ve never properly seen his face in person. I feel so bad and don’t want a nonchalant partner he’s goofy and fun but I can’t help but just swipe over my camera when he’s pleasuring himself. How do I communicate with him so we can both have a good time?

ANSWER: People seem to think it's a good idea to tell your partner his face is weird during it. I can guarantee that'll make him hurt and extremely insecure about his face during sex in the future. It definitely needs a more gentle take than "ask him why he looks like he's taking a shit" as another commenter put it.

QUESTION: My (37F) best friend (38F) of 15 years went no contact unexpectedly. 5 years later, she wants to talk.

Read the update [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/W2I3S1rHd0)

My best friend of 15 years went no contact with me five years ago. We are supposed to reconnect, but I'm feeling unsure.

She was the most emotionally intelligent, loyal, communicative person I knew. We'd been like sisters and stayed in touch no matter the distance. But when I moved far away to pursue my education and she had babies back to back, she told me that she didn’t have time to maintain a long distance friendship. I told her I understood, that her kids and self care should obviously come first, and that we'd pick up where we left off someday. I never dreamed she'd go NC. Tbh, I'm not sure she knew at that point, either.

I stepped back, invested in other friendships, and gave her space. I'd call every now and again, and text on birthdays and Christmas. She stopped answering the phone and responded to texts every six months or so. I couldn't shake the feeling that this was about more than being busy, especially when I saw distant family and friends mention talking on the phone on her fb. A year and a half in, I sent her a message asking if I’d done anything that hurt or upset her, and that I wanted to make amends if that were the case.

She left me on read.

I took it as a sign to respect her obvious, if unspoken, boundaries. Reaching out without hearing back also hurt like hell; I couldn't do it anymore. I tried move on, to not obsess over the reason. I talked about it with friends and in therapy. I also fell into a deep depression, withdrew from my other relationships, and became increasingly self-isolated. I'd clearly hurt and lost the person closest to me, but didn't know how or why. Five years passed with no contact.

A few months back, I learned her father died unexpectedly and reached out. We spoke for a while and she apologized, saying that she'd never meant to "let it go on this long." I apologized for anything I had done to hurt or upset her. She got quiet and said that we could talk about it later. We spoke a little while longer, but once I got off the phone I became flooded with anger. I let the feelings fade and gave her space, then texted a few weeks later to offer support & condolences, crickets. Gave it another month before messaging and saying that I was up for sorting it out or leaving it be. She said she wanted to chat, but we've been trying to hammer out a time for months now, which is telling...it seems we're both hesitant. Now she wants to talk next week, and I'm not so sure.

Part of me wants to cancel, bc fk this pain (hello, avoidance), a smaller part of me wants to fawn and make it all better (hello, trauma and anxiety), and every cell in my body wants to protect my broken heart. I tend to be really hard on myself, and given the pedestal I placed her on (it’s not just me, she is loved by literally everyone while I am a quirky ND who’s loved, but more of an acquired taste) I've blamed myself, especially in the absence of a reason. But in reality, I feel that this was a fked up way to treat a best friend, and that it isn't all my fault like my brain and lingering trauma would like me to believe. I need advice on how to approach this.

Part of me wants to meet with her, even though my nervous system wants to flee. Part of me wants to heal this rift now in case we never get the chance to. Logically I know that I should hear her out, but I am just so damned hurt and angry. I don't even know whether to express that to her before or after she says her piece. I know I need to make space for both of our feelings and grievances, but how? I missed her so much, but I gave up on her a long time ago. I don't know how to move past this. Tbh, I'm not even sure I want to.

Is talking to or trying to make amends with someone who ghosted me for five years even worth it, if only to find out why?

TL;DR  
Moved away from BFF/almost sister of 15+ years. She said she couldn't do a "long distance friendship" bc of her young children, but still made time for other people. I got the sense that this was about more than just being busy, asked if I'd said or done anything hurtful, & offered to make amends. She left me on read for five years. We are back in touch after a death in her family and she wants to hash things out, but I am unsure.

ANSWER: I would meet, hear her out and then take some time to process. 5 years is a very long time to go without talking. Especially if it was something that bothered her. She didn’t air the problem when it happened and let it fester.
Hear her out but stay reserved till you know why

QUESTION: My (38F) husband (41M) left me over cheating assumptions

I posted back about 3 months ago about how my husband (41m) was convinced I was cheating. He hid recorders and cameras without my knowledge. I wasn’t allowed to shower or shave without being questioned. He inspected my pants when I got off work (I just started working within the last few months when I really hadn’t been allowed to for years because he thought I was cheating then) he has taken me through lie detectors, monitored MY cell phone and spending accounts which I could care less about because I know I’m innocent and still swears I’m cheating. Which fyi I’m not and never have. I couldn’t even imagine cheating on anyone especially someone I loved so dearly at one point, even if that love was gone today. I’ve been in the shoes of being cheated on and it’s HEARTBREAKING. I get it.

Anyways. This is something I’ve dealt with for 6 years so it’s become the norm for me. We have a 5 year old special needs kid together. I have no money to my name because I just started working part time and no way to afford the house I’m in now. My husband has benefit retirement money so he can afford it although he doesn’t work.

My birthday was Monday. Every birthday for 6 years I’ve at least cried once. Over the years I’ve lost so much love that I just don’t have it in me to cry anymore. Anyways my birthday was Monday. Super sweet day. Unlike the others. I should have known then.

The next morning when our child goes to school he presented me a birthday “surprise” saying to choose him or not to choose him. He had a video playing on a little photo display of his “proof” of me cheating. (I can’t post that here but I’d be happy to share that in the messages with anyone that wants to see it.)

The “proof” is a 15s clip out of 5 hours of him recording me and I’m literally sitting on the barstool on my phone playing who knows what game to pass the time and he says that’s proof of me cheating. It’s insane honestly and again I wish I could post it here.

Needless to say I didn’t admit to cheating BECAUSE I DID NOT CHEAT and I’m not admitting to something I sure didn’t do. He’s told me dozens and dozens of times if I tell him the truth we can work past it and get through it. So if I truly was cheating why wouldn’t I just tell him to keep our house and family together. Probably because IM NOT. He has hours and days of footages and recording and all my search and phone history with NO proof yet still accuses me.

Yesterday we were driving around town and a phone ringer went off. Not our phones. He had a second hidden phone that went ringing. He’s the ONLY one that’s been hiding and lying. So after I confronted him about that he dropped the bombshell. He said he got another place. Leaving me and our son without a place to be able to afford.

I am getting “punished” for something I didn’t even do. I know he’s honestly probably the one cheating because stigmas point in that direction AND I’ve been cheated on so many times I know it to be true. And that’s fine. I don’t care truly. What I care about is no warning, no money and no where to go. I don’t have family here. He’s moved me across the country and back running from only God knows. But to up and leave your kid who NEEDS that routine, who’s special needs, without allowing mommy and daddy to talk to him and mommy to figure out a plan for a place is heartless and cold. I truly wish I never met this man. I’m blindsided over false assumptions.

What do I even do from here?

ANSWER: You jump for joy. You celebrate. You are now free off that garbage husband.

Sue him. Take half his shit. And go find a real man who is not insane.

QUESTION: People keep warning me (28F) about my bf (40M). What would be the best action forward?

My bf and I have been officially together for almost a month now. We both really like each other. Everything is going well between us and he treats me really well and is serious about me. We get along perfectly and I personally haven’t seen any red flag coming from him.

I met his family a week ago and they instantly liked me. Turns out we’re distantly related, but he’s lived abroad all his life until recently, so I knew nothing about him and meeting him was by pure chance and unrelated to family connections. He’s the nephew of my uncle (aunt’s husband) and a coworker of another aunt. We’ve shared the news with my family too. But both my aunts keep warning me not to date him saying he’s disreputable and has a history of lying and womanizing, and have begged my mother to do something about this situation because nothing good could come out of it. Meanwhile he thinks he has a good relationship with my aunts and thinks my aunts like him as a person.

My mom has asked around about him as well, but nobody has anything good to say about him. Now my family hate him and want me to break up with him as the general consensus among both people I know and strangers is that he has a bad reputation and doesn’t deserve me. 
I’ve tried to have a conversation with him about this, but he denies everything.

Tldr: I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one hand I don’t want to break up with him seeing how we get along great and we both have strong feelings for each other, on the other I would have to be dumb to ignore all these warnings.

ANSWER: It is unusual for someone to have such a bad reputation for no reason. People can change, but generally if they are lying about it; it usually isn’t a good sign. It is possible your aunts are being over protective; the only advice I can really give you is asking your aunts more about it and possibly reaching out to any women they tell you he has had a bad history with.

QUESTION: I (23F) told my boyfriend (25M) that I won't get a job to make him feel less jealous of my financial situation

English isn't my first language and I'm not good at writing but I seriously need an advice from people not connected to us.

I have been dating my boyfriend for a little bit over a year now. We met through mutual friends and had a pretty usual relationship until now. It wasn't perfect but we never fought much. He works as a manager in a restaurant while I'm still in university.

His life was pretty difficult from the start since he grew up with alcoholic parents and not much support in general. Since day one, he had to work hard for even the most basic things. He couldn't allow himself to get higher education; he had to continously work since he entered adulthood.

I, on the other hand, have a big family that always supports each other. When I started going to university, they continued to financially support me. My parents help with the bills and give me some allowance. Grandparents, aunts and uncles also often send things here and there. I'm on the campus for my lectures most of the time but I also tutor three times a week, getting enough money from it for groceries. I'm good at living below my needs and saving so I don't need that much cash.

All that background is needed for you to understand where our conflict started. Around a month ago, my boyfriend started making little comments about my financial situation. He would say "It's nice to spend someone else's money" or "You wouldn't survive if you had to work for all that money the way I do". I immediately caught onto those comments but I didn't think it would grow into something more. I thought that maybe he's just fussy because he's overworked.

I tried to be understanding, knowing it must be difficult for him to work as much as he does. I proposed that maybe we should move in together to lessen the burden of all the bills on him. I even said that I can help him with some groceries from time to time. He called that insulting and said that he could never agree to either of those ideas.

Unfortunately, it got worse. It feels like almost every day we fight as he calls me lazy, a trust fund baby or says that I don't know what real life feels like. He also started sending me random job listings, telling me to apply even though I don't have any time for those jobs. The biggest fight was yesterday. He came over to my home for dinner and while I was cleaning, started talking about another job listing. By that point, I was at my limit after seeing like a hundredth random job offer. I blew up at him, angrily telling him to stop telling me to get a job. That university is my job and my main focus. I must admit that I said some mean things along the lines "You only want me to get a job because you are jealous of my situation, of my family's support". He stormed out and doesn't really talk to me now. He sends short messages back but he doesn't pick up his phone. I tried apologising but he tells me that he needs time to think everything through.

Was I truly that harsh? How do I make him see my point? Or maybe he has a better point and I should deny my family's support, filling my schedule to the brim with uni and work? Is there even a way for us to reconcile? Please, help, this is my first serious relationship and I don't want to mess it up.

ANSWER: He's seeing you succeed and wants to bring you down to his level. Don't allow it

I also don't think this is the man for you. If he feels bad about you helping with groceries, how will he feel when you have a uni degree and will earn more than him?

QUESTION: I’ve (30F) been lying about my son’s father for 12 years and I want to finally tell the truth to my parents (55F) (60M) and son.

When I was 16, I was in a relationship with a 26-year-old man. I’m 30 years old and now understand how wrong that relationship was. To a large degree, I even knew it was wrong back then. I don’t feel that he groomed me or manipulated me into it. I don’t feel like I was naive or talked into doing anything I didn’t want to do. I still believe I genuinely loved him and a part of my heart still loves him. He refused to have sex with me for a long time, but I pushed and begged, and when things finally happened between us, I felt like I’d gotten what I wanted. I was too young to understand any of it, but I understand that he was the adult and he should never have given in I matter how much I begged. I know he felt guilty about it.

When I was 17, I got pregnant. He asked me to marry him, but I said no. He had severe mental health issues, clinical depression to the point of hospitalization at one point. By the time he asked me to marry him, he was really spiraling and I think just grasping at straws for things he felt would make him happy. If we had the baby and got married he’d be happy. But I knew that wasn’t the case. I was scared of what was happening. He took his own life less than 2 months later.

I’ve never told anyone who my son’s father really is. My family has no clue that this man ever existed. Only my best friend knows. I lied back then and said I met someone at a party and didn’t know who he was. It was a terrible lie, because as crazy as it was for me to have been involved with this adult man, it was even crazier to imagine me going to a party and having a random one night stand with somebody I didn’t know. That’s not something I’ve ever done and I don’t know how anyone who knew me back then would ever believe that lie. I was the studious little straight A student who didn’t do anything wrong. I was desperate and scared so I lied. My parents were already crushed that I was pregnant at 17 and I didn’t think they could handle knowing the truth about who the father was. I thought I’d get in even bigger trouble for doing something so dumb, and I wanted to protect him.

My son is 12 now. He’s smart, kind, and starting to ask questions about his dad. I’ve kept this lie up for so long that I don’t even know how to start unraveling it. I want to show him the pictures I have of his dad and tell him where his eyes and hair color come from. I don’t want him to believe his father is some random stranger out there who doesn’t even know he exists and who he might be able to find through a DNA test.

Telling my parents the truth after all these years might destroy the peace we’ve finally found. They were disappointed for a long time after my pregnancy, and it took years for things to feel normal again. I’m scared I’ll lose that.

At the same time, I can’t stand lying anymore, especially to my son. It makes me sick every time I repeat the lie anytime somebody asks me about his dad. He deserves the truth, even if it’s messy.

I don’t even know where to start. How do I tell my parents? How do I tell my son, in an age-appropriate way, who his father was and how he died? How do I handle the fallout of all this?

I just want to do the right thing, but I’m so scared it’ll blow up everything again.

ANSWER: There is absolutely no way a reddit thread is going to give you good advice here. You need to work with a licensed professional in family therapy. Whatever you end up doing will have consequences. You need to have someone to help you understand the consequences and how to engage with your family members if and when these actions (or non-actions, as the current case is) will lead out.

QUESTION: He (M20) literally won’t let me (F21) break things off after one week of dating. How do you step away from someone like that?

I need to get this off my chest because I honestly don’t know what to do anymore.

About a week ago, I started talking to this guy. He seemed like such a nice person. He was patient, gentle, funny, and genuinely easy to talk to. We texted all day the first day, and that same night, I agreed to a call. It felt natural in the moment, but looking back, that was probably where I made my mistake. After that, it was constant. We started talking every single day and texting from the moment we woke up until we fell asleep, and calling for hours on end. Sometimes six, sometimes eight. Every single day, without pause. It’s like the moment we started talking, I became his entire world.

He calls me out of nowhere now. He gets anxious if I don’t respond right away. If he makes a joke, he’ll ask me ten times if I’m offended. If I sound tired, he assumes something’s wrong. It’s like he’s clinging to me for dear life.

Eventually, he opened up about being cheated on by his ex, and suddenly, his behavior made sense. He’s still deeply hurt, still haunted by that betrayal, and I think he’s trying to find safety and validation in me.

But what’s concerning is how quickly it’s turned into something more. He tells me how much I mean to him, calls me his girlfriend, and posts TikToks about “us,” quoting things I’ve said and romanticizing every little interaction. He acts like we’ve known each other for years when it’s barely been a week. It’s intense, too intense.

So, I tried to talk to him. I told him that we should slow down, that maybe he needs space to heal and find himself again. The moment I said that, he completely fell apart. One minute he was blaming himself, then apologizing, then saying he couldn’t lose me, then accusing me of not caring. It was like watching someone spiral.

It honestly felt like I was asking for a divorce after twenty years of marriage and not trying to take a break after a week of talking. He just wouldn’t accept it. He kept trying to talk about it, to fix it, to make me stay. He said he could “heal while having me by his side,” but I really doubt.

It’s now seven in the morning, and I haven’t slept because we were arguing until three. I’m emotionally drained. I can see that he genuinely believes he’s fallen in love with me, but his attachment has become overwhelming. He’s trying to heal through me instead of healing for himself, and it’s become too heavy for me to carry.

I want to step back and let him heal on his own, but he won’t let me. He keeps holding on tighter every time I try to pull away.
I don’t know what to do.
How do you step away from someone like that?

Edit:

The reason I haven’t just cut him off completely is because I don’t want him to feel like opening up about his trauma pushed me away. He trusted me enough to share deeply personal things about his past, and the last thing I want is for him to associate that vulnerability with abandonment. I don’t want to add to his pain or reinforce the idea that people leave once they see the broken parts of him. That’s why I’m trying to let him down slowly and to step back with kindness rather than disappear abruptly.

ANSWER: “Hey you seem like a great guy, but we aren’t a match and I hope nothing but the best for you going forward!”. And just stop replying.

QUESTION: I(28F) am seriously considering divorcing my husband (32M) because of how he treated my dog and what comes after it

Background on my story: my husband is never mean to my dog, but he's very much not a pet person. I knew about that going into the marriage, I was fine with him not interacting with my dog or helping me with dog duties. I accepted that. His only duty is to open the yard door to let my dog out to pee when I work 10 hour shifts. Even with this simple task, he complains that this is a lot of work for him and makes him stressed out. His reasoning is that having to let the dog out means that he has to constantly keep this at the back of his head and it's one extra thing that he has to do on top of his busy work, which stresses him out. Anyway he still did let him out to pee most of the time, and I kind of just accepted that.

Recently I had to travel out of country because my mom needed surgery. I was gone for a total of 3 weeks, the first week I asked my friend to take care of my dog but they were busy for the last 2 weeks so I asked my husband to take care of him. He did not complain and said ok(which I appreciate). I got back from my trip and found that my 17lbs dog has lost 5lbs under his care. That's 1/3 of his weight. My poor puppy is depressed that I am gone, and god knows whether he's being fed twice a day per my instructions. My dog always loses weight when I'm gone due to stress, but losing a third of your body weight in 13 days? So obviously I was very unhappy about that. I was debating about whether I should have an argument with him because technically he did "do me a favor" by taking care of my dog, but he also did a really poor job. It also feels like this is weaponized incompetence(which isn't, he's still a person of good nature he would never purposely hurt my dog). I just can't get over the fact that he's casually making jokes that oh well he's skinny now at least he's easier to carry. Again I am ok with him not caring about my dog(I know I shouldn't), as long as he doesn't hurt him I was already ok with that. All I wanted to do was to have a conversation with him, telling him that he did not do a very good job taking care of my dog, and that he should know better. He then started complaining about how taking care of a dog is extremely stressful for him, that he has to constantly think about whether the dog ate or peed for the whole day and it's stressing him out. I said that I already gave you the bare minimum instructions, all you have to do is feed twice a day, make sure water bowl isn't empty, and let him out for bathroom every few hours. He said these tasks are incredibly stressful, why can't you understand? It's so much work that it's like a second part time job, I have to constantly think about him all day, did he pee? did I feed him? That's incredibly stressful. Obviously anyone would not agree that these simple tasks are stressful, so I disagreed. He then started YELLING at me, saying that I don't appreciate anything that he does, that I'm not being understanding about how stressful it is for him to take care of my dog for 2 weeks, that he's under SO MUCH stress for the past 2 weeks and I'm still complaining.

The argument ended with him saying that he doesn't want to deal with this and told me to fuck off(yelling).

TLDR: husband thinks taking care of my dog for 2 weeks is super stressful and I am not being appreciative and understanding that this is a stressful task, therefore I should not be complaining that under his care my dog lost a third of his body weight in 2 weeks. He then YELLED at me for not being understanding even though I was the one that is supposed to be mad. (I was calm the whole time when I started the talk).

I still want to try to fix this somehow, but I don't even know how to fight back to his arguments. Can anyone help?

Edit to add: I’m not putting blame completely on him for my dog losing weight, because stress is also a big factor. I’m just pissed that he yelled at me simply because I pointed out that he did a poor job taking care of him. All I wanted was for him to learn that he should be more careful and ask me questions if he’s not sure about dog care. It’s the yelling that makes me consider divorce, not the dog care. So I think this might still be fixable, but I’m not even sure how to go about it? That’s why I’m looking for advice…

Another edit to add: he fed my dog for sure, because the food bag did get less full. I had a full bag before I left and it was definitely used. Now I believe he did sometimes forget to feed him twice a day, but I don’t know how often. Not saying this is acceptable, but for people that think my dog was not fed at all, that’s not the case. But he did neglect my dog, and I just wanted to bring that point across to him that this is not acceptable, you don’t have to like him to feed him twice a day.

ANSWER: I hope you don't plan to have children with someone who's this stressed for having to care for a dog for about 10 minutes total a day.

QUESTION: I (23F) keep having sleepovers with my friend (24M), but nothing ever happens… and I’m so confused.

I (23F) have this friend (24M), let’s call him Matt. We’re both international students. We met during a welcome event for new students in August 2024. We’re from the same country, so we started talking and became friends instantly. 
He’s conventionally attractive, and honestly, I was into him the moment I saw him. But at the time, I was in a relationship, so I never acted on it. I eventually broke up with my boyfriend around the end of the year because long-distance just wasn’t working anymore. Matt has been single since we met, and he is attracted to women, just to clear that up :)
 
Anyway, we’re part of a small friend group (three guys, including him, one other girl, and me). We used to hang out almost every weekend, cook dinner, drink, and chill. So, it’s pretty normal for me or Matt to go to each other’s places. One night (this happened around March 2025) everyone left early, and it was just Matt and me. We kept drinking and talking until like 3 a.m., and since it was too late for him to go home, he crashed at my place. My apartment is super small, with basically just a bed, a tiny couch, a closet, and a desk. So we ended up sharing the bed. It was super awkward, but nothing happened. He left in the morning, and we never talked about it. I was a bit confused because he didn’t even try anything, but at the same time, I felt really safe and respected.

What I didn’t expect was that it wouldn’t be the last time. We’ve had multiple sleepovers since then, either at my place or his, and still nothing happens. Like, literally nothing. We just talk, drink, play card games, and sleep. After a few nights like that, I asked if he’s ever done this kind of thing with another girl, and he said no, which made it even weirder. Of course, I haven’t had these kind of sleepovers with my male friends either, but as I mentioned in the beginning, I am attracted to Matt, and I wouldn’t mind if something did happen with him. However, I’m really shy and never make the first move.

At this point, it feels like we’ve slipped into this weird brother-sister dynamic. He doesn't even step out when I change my clothes or shower, like it’s the most normal thing. So… what’s going on here? Are we just… really close friends? Is he not attracted to me? Or is he just being respectful and waiting for me to do something?

For context, I’d say I have a cute face and an average body. He’s definitely more attractive than me, but I don’t think I’m unattractive either.

Small Update

Hey everyone! This was my first ever Reddit post and my first time doing an update to. So, sorry if I mess something up 😅

I just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone who commented and took the time to give me advice. I honestly didn’t expect so many thoughtful responses. They really helped me see things more clearly.

The general consensus seems to be that I need to stop overthinking and actually talk to him. So that’s what I’m going to do. I’m planning to invite him over for dinner at my place later this week, and I’ll try to be honest about how I feel and see where it goes from there.

I’ll update again once that happens.

ANSWER: Expecting a post from him tomorrow: 
“I keep inviting this girl for sleepovers but we still haven’t done anything I’m confused??”

QUESTION: My (28F) boyfriend (31M) replied to a Redditor's post saying she was seeking cock

Hi everyone, I would really appreciate your thoughts/advice on this. My boyfriend who I've been with for 9 months now was showing me his Reddit comment history and we were laughing over some of the funny comments/jokes he's made when I saw 23 days ago he responded to a female Redditor's post where in the title she was saying she lives in LA and is looking for cock. The post's content itself had since been deleted, but in his comment he wrote about how his medical residency is ending in a year and he plans to move from the city where we live to buy property in LA and if they're both single by then, he'd love to connect.

This was a huge breach of my trust, and I do consider this cheating, but I'm not sure if I'm overreacting because he put the disclaimer of if they're single when they both live in LA. He apologized for it and said it was stupid, but said it's anonymous and he probably posted it when he was horny and he doesn't even remember posting it.

I ended the relationship then and there and kicked him out of my apartment. Was that the right thing to do, or am I blowing it out of proportion given his stupid disclaimer? I feel like I'm losing my mind after seeing his awful comment... Please, someone tell me if this is something that can be salvaged or if I made the right choice, because right now I'm just feeling really heartbroken

ANSWER: Don’t over think this.  The guy was already planning on what he’s going to do after you break up.  You saved yourself a headache.

QUESTION: My (23F) boyfriend (24M) won’t leave me alone after seeing a photo of me kissing another guy.

Hi everyone. I never thought I would be posting on Reddit. I never seen an actual post before and usually just listen to these on TikTok with Minecraft in the background so here I go trying to type this right. So sorry if I don’t.

My (23f) boyfriend (24m) has been at me every single day for a week over a photo he saw while I was out with my friends. I thought everything was fine before this but I guess I was wrong and honestly I have no idea why he’s acting like this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

This all started last weekend when I was out with my friends who I hadn’t seen in a year due to moving very far away. We went to an outdoor concert for cheap in our small town after I moved back just so we could have fun and dress up in costumes so we could hang out and see each other. One thing to note is the friends I was with barely drink (two to three times a year) and they never go out. So of course I was very excited that they wanted to go out with me for once. I would also like to mention I hadn’t been out more than once within the whole year I had been away since I do not like going out without my friends so I do not normally do this either.

A few days after we had went to this concert my boyfriend texted me a photo of “me” saying I look like I was about to kiss someone in the background of one of the professional photos that were taken there. I told him many many times this was not me. This girl had curly hair, she was wearing what I thought was a big black coat, and her face shape did not match mine. I thought he was joking. I was wearing a skin tight black long sleeve dress, wavy hair, and I had a headband with bunny ears on my head. I laughed it off thinking it was a joke and told him it wasn’t me while pointing out everything that was proving it wasn’t me.

The next or couple days later I don’t remember, he texted me again bringing it back up. I again told him it wasn’t me and explained everything that was different between this girl and me. He did not believe me. He kept calling her my twin and saying it wasn’t normal how defensive I got the first time he brought it up (I immediately started telling him why it wasn’t me the first time because I knew where it was going) but I kept explaining how it was not me and I didn’t know what else to tell him. He pretended to believe me but that was not the end of it.

The next time I saw him, he brought it up again but in person, I proceeded to laugh and say “why would I cheat on you in a place where all of your friends are, a photographer taking photos, and in a public space where I know everyone.” I then proceeded to tell him how I am 5 feet tall and the person this girl was “kissing” was shorter than her. There is no one in our small town who is over 19 that would be in the 4 feet. I sort of giggled when I said this because i didn’t think it was that serious.

The issue ended up being brought up a couple more times and I was getting so fed up. Tonight it was brought up again for what felt like the tenth time and I was so mentally drained and exhausted from this conversation I just started telling him to prove that I cheated on him. He wouldn’t stop calling me a cheater saying I was with other men when I didn’t answer fast enough and accusing me of so much. He never acted like this before. He then freaked out at me for telling him to prove it and going on and on and on for hours and hours to the point where I had to stop texting him to keep myself mentally sane.

Eventually I was so desperate I started scouring the Facebook page to find all of the photos of that night to figure out who this girl was to show him once and for all it wasn’t me. I found her. I sent him all of the photos of this girl and put them with the blurry photo he sent me thinking it was finally over. But he responded with “I can’t see her makeup I can only see your black eyes”. I was done at this point. I never ever ever do my makeup. I only wear mascara because I don’t know how to do makeup and make it look good on my skin. I got ready with my friend who went to school for makeup and she helped me and gave me tips so I felt confident enough to try it for once. I did not wear black eyes. The photo was too blurry to see the makeup it was just a blob but apparently he could.

I then proceeded to stop answering him because I was over it and he gave in and apologized telling me he was wrong and what not because I gave up. I thought it was all fine until I was playing video games with my same friend who’s good at makeup and he messaged me a new photo. This new photo was a completely different girl and he said “this is you going into the corner. Good job taking your ears off that’s a good cover.” I had no idea how to respond at this point because it seemed like he just wanted to prove me wrong and was making up stories about how I cheated on him.

Anyways I found the girl who he was talking about (she was wearing a penguin costume) and she looks absolutely nothing like me so I’m not sure why he thinks it’s me. You can see her hood which has a beak and an eye on it which doesn’t look like my costume at all. I did not leave any of my friends side all night and I have no idea what to do in this moment. This has gotten so frustrating that my relationship I never speak about and keep private is now known by my friends and family over this fight. I couldn’t mentally handle it alone and told everyone about it and sent them all the photos and everyone agreed right away it was not me. It wasn’t me. We’ve been together for 8 years and I’m so sick of it and over it and it only took a week.

So if anyone here has some advice about this situation could you tell me what to do now ? I haven’t shown him the photo of the penguin girl because I don’t think I should be the one proving I didn’t cheat and he should be proving I did cheat. I think he should trust my word like I do his but I don’t even know who he is anymore. He’s acting insane.

ANSWER: Girl stop, he’s not a man worth staying with he’s a jealous and controlling waste of space 
He probably knows it’s not you but he loves tying you in knots 
He will use this to ruin any more girls nights out you have so you stop doing stuff to just be with him

QUESTION: UPDATE: Is my (30F) partner (45m) trying to sabotage my job?

You can see my post history for more details about this situation but I'll put the TLDR here in case you dont want to:

My partner (we will call him Bob) and I got into an argument on Monday. Context: on Sunday I was feeling so sick and, was up since 2am with my 2 babies and had nausea and the worst headache. I told my partner I needed to sleep and he took the babies along with his mom (she's been helping). I couldn't really sleep so woke up around 930. Partner was playing video games while his mom had the baby and toddler was wondering around. He played video games for most of the day.

The next day, he told me he was starting his paternity leave. I said that was great and asked him if he could watch the babies for a couple hours while I had meetings for my new job. He agreed and seemed okay with this. I cooked him breakfast and he went out to do some work on his business around 930am.

At 115pm (my meeting started at 2pm) I called him and asked where he was. He said he was surprised that I hadn't called "as I typically would" and I told him I was busy. This comment rubbed me the wrong way because it seemed like he was intentionally taking long to come home and was trying to upset me.

I asked him when he would be home and told him I needed to test my microphone with him. He said "I cant do this every day, if every day is like yesterday and today it will be catastrophic " and I just got angry because i literally asked for 2 hours and felt like he was giving me a hard time about it trying to sabotage my job. He threatened to turn around and not come hime. He yelled at me and hunhome.

He did come home, and I stomped down the stairs grabbed my toddler and told him "I dont need you i can take care of my own children" he said "get out of my house" and I said "I dont care". He came upstairs, upset that I "disrespected him in front of his mom" and threatened to cut the wifi.

Instead of watching tbe children while I did my meetings, he napped and left them with his mom. She couldn't handle them and hurt herself trying to bring them outside.

UPDATE: He has been giving me the silent treatment all week which he knows triggers me. I should have just ignored him too but he knows I had to get a surgery today (Friday). He said he will watch the kids but will not support me or pick me up from my surgery. He also said he will  be taking me off his medical insurance. (He told me in the past he gets joy talking to his ex wife, who is suffering from heart problems because he would be able to help her out but chooses not to and likes to see that she's struggling). Hes also said he wouldn't care if his mother got so upset about something that she died

Fast forward to today, apparently im unable to get an Uber home from the hospital and he is not responding to any calls from me or the hospital. I have nobody else as all my family amd friends are in my home state across country.

So now im stuck in hospital as they try to figure this out. Im so embarrassed and made plans with my sister to come home and leave him once I can, I just dont Know what to do with my babies because we have a custody agreement in place and I won't be able to take them with me until its amended.

ANSWER: Girl you know you’ve been doing more than enough, you shouldnt looking after a 45 year old man child too. Just out of interest how long have you been together?

QUESTION: My 24F girlfriend is leaving me 24M because of finances.

My girlfriend and I met in high school when we were 16. We started going out when we were 17. We were together for almost 3 years, when she left me. This was due to a variety of reasons. We went to separate colleges, we grew apart, and it was also COVID, so we didn't spend that much time together.

Fast forward two years later and we got back together. Things were going really well, and we spoke about issues in our previous relationship, etc. We are now 2 years together again.

She started working last year, and I started working this year. Unfortunately, my parents lost their jobs last year. They were both working at the same company. COVID put a big strain on the company, and my parents had to be let go eventually.

This year when I started working, I started paying the rent of the house my parents live in. They have no money and also nowhere to go. My girlfriend recently asked me how long this will continue. I explained to her that my parents have no qualifications, and they are also 57 years old, so getting a job is not easy. I feel obligated to at least put a roof over my parents' head, as they have provided me with one all these years.

Now it seems she wants to leave me, because she thinks I won't be able to provide her financial freedom or she won't be able to life out her dreams. I do earn more than 2x her salary.

I really want to save our relationship as we were high school sweethearts. I still love her very much after all these years. I feel miserable right now.

Do you have any advice for me?

Edit: Some people in the comments are accusing me of karma farming, or that this is a misogyny post, because my post and comments are hidden on my profile. I've made them public for now. Sometimes I just want a bit of privacy!

Update: Hey everyone. Thanks for all the replies. There are way too many for me to respond to. She decided to break up with me.

ANSWER: I’m not saying either of you is right or wrong, but I am saying “we were high school sweethearts” is not a good reason to hold onto a relationship that isn’t working.

QUESTION: My girlfriend (F24) gave me (M27) an ultimatum. Did I fuck it up?

So, I (27M) was always an extrovert. My girlfriend (24F) is more of an introvert. When we started dating, I slowly stopped talking to a lot of my friends because she wasn’t comfortable with it. I even stopped talking to my female best friend just to make her feel secure.

Over time, I started feeling really lonely. I told my girlfriend that I feel like I don’t have anyone in my life anymore and I stopped talking to everybody because of you and you still end things with me and always leave me alone and that it’s taking a toll on my mental health since I already deal with anxiety and depression. Instead of trying to understand, she said something like, “Because of your nature, I don’t have anyone in my life either, Everyone has left me” in a really insulting way.

After a while, me and my best friend cleared things up and started talking again. I told my girlfriend that we did and gave me an ultimatum!! 
Either her or my best friend. I told her that this kind of behavior is toxic and that I can’t keep cutting people off just to make her happy. She ended things with me right after that.

I begged, pleaded her not to leave and she still did saying you chose her over me.

She has a pattern of ending things whenever we argue, leaving me to deal with everything alone. I still care about her, but this situation really messed me up.

I just want an honest opinion please who’s actually wrong here? Did I do something wrong by talking to my best friend again, or was the ultimatum too much?

ANSWER: The greatest gift she could give you was to leave your life.   Be happy, call your friends, go out, be social, quit longing for the person who made you lonely in your togetherness.

QUESTION: Snooped on my gf phone and I didn’t like what I saw. Not sure how to proceed? m28 f28

I know I shouldn’t have done this, and it’s something I’ve been super mindful of avoiding. I’ve been having dreams that I was going to break up with my partner, and maybe I manifested it.

We’ve been dating for a year now, and it seemed to be going very well. She was super affectionate, saying loving words to my face about the relationship and how lucky she was.

We’ve had a couple of arguments during the relationship, but we’d always say we came out stronger because of them and enjoyed the journey together.

I’ve given her an out before and she said no she wants to stay with me and be committed in this journey. (She once redownloaded a dating profile to show her friend how she attracted me. I found that inconsiderate and was angry about it, hence giving her an out)

Last week, I went through her phone as it was left unlocked, and I read awful things about me that she’d sent to her friend:

“I find him annoying.”
“I don’t enjoy his company.”
“I’m going to break up with him on NYE.”
“He’s a perfect BF, but I can do better.”
“My mom said I can do better”

However, to my face, she’s so affectionate and endearing. It’s ripping me up inside because I know I’ve done wrong, but reading such hurtful comments when I’ve been a great partner in my eyes… I just don’t know how to act accordingly.

We’ve still been physically intimate, and whenever I ask about our relationship, she says she’s super happy with it.

She even says I love you to my face and sends me love emojis and things like ‘you’re an amazing bf and I’m so lucky, I love you ❤️’

TLDR: I went through my girlfriend’s phone and found messages where she said hurtful things about me and planned to break up, even though she acts loving to my face. I know I was wrong to check, but now I’m confused and hurt because she still says she’s happy and affectionate with me.

Edit: completely agree going through the phone is a breach of trust. I’ve been getting therapy for it and can understand how that can be damaging. I did trust her 100% however the temptation to see was there and it’s something I’m working on.

It was the first and last time I’ve ever did it.

ANSWER: I’m so sorry you’re going through this , I do believe that you should just break up with her. She’s basically lying to you and dragging out the relationship

QUESTION: My (38f) Husband (39m) just admitted he hasn't gotten me anything for our 10yr anniversary...

Wait... It gets worse. He didn't get me anything for Mother's Day or my birthday this year either...

Money for us has been tight due to several factors, but I have still made sure he got something when it was a special day for him.

On Mother's day, he said " I just didn't know what to do" and so I told him that morning and went and got it for myself.

For my birthday, he gave me a letter stating he didn't have anything to give me but his love and apologized for not having money. A week before my birthday he drove 4hrs to pick up a $100 item from an auction site for one of his hobbies...

And now our 10yr wedding anniversary is on Friday... I ordered him customized items. Two items arrived over a week ago and one more should have gotten here last week but it's lost in transit. I had to call the postal Service to investigate and he walked in when I was finishing up the call. He asked what the call was about and I told him part of his anniversary gift might not get here on time. He said "oh I forgot that anniversary's mean gifts. I just don't know what to do for those things"

Wtf... We have been together for 17yrs. Married for 10. He used to be so freaking romantic and gave amazing gifts and made me feel loved and important... Made it obvious that he that he put time, effort and thought into his gifts and now... I get nothing...

I feel hurt, forgotten, unimportant... We have been through so much in the last 10yrs and we're still together. It's worth celebrating and recognizing. We have plans to go out to eat and I've been talking about it for over a month so it's not like he forgot. He just didn't put in any effort.

How do I explain how this is making me feel without sounding like a I'm whining?  Like this is serious and it hurts, I don't think it's an over reaction to be upset about it. But I also feel a bit silly about being hurt I didn't get gifts...

TL:DR Hubby didn't get me any gifts for Mother's Day, Birthday or our upcoming anniversary. I'm hurt by his lack of effort. How do I talk to him about it without sounding like a whiny baby?

ANSWER: Hope you looked at him and told him that you aren't surprised since he hasn't prioritized you in years.

QUESTION: Update: my family’s reaction to my [M29] engagement to my fiancée [F27]

Hey everyone - thanks to everyone who read and commented on my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/LYzqFoutr0) about my family’s reaction to my engagement.

It’s now been over three months since that happened. I wish I could say things have improved, but unfortunately, they’ve gotten worse. My fiancée and I have continued building our life together and planning our wedding, but my mom and sister have not reached out in any healthy or supportive way.

After months of silence (other than random texts not addressing the elephant in the room, and even then that was more recent), my sister finally messaged me recently. She wanted to have a conversation with “just her brother” and wouldn’t entertain a conversation to start with my fiancée included. Instead of accountability or a real attempt to make things right, she sent a guilt-filled text accusing me of “treating my family like they don’t matter,” saying I was being controlled by “outside voices,” and closing with, “how you’re treating the only family you have left.”

That last line hit hard - our uncle recently passed away, and it felt like she was weaponizing that loss to hurt me.

The message was manipulative and avoided any responsibility for the way they reacted to my engagement. I realized that responding would only pull me back into the same cycle that’s existed for years: where I’m expected to smooth things over while they refuse to reflect on their behavior. So I didn’t reply.

Even when well-meaning people (including my fiancée’s mom) suggested I might try a one-on-one talk to ease the tension, I realized that doing so right now would mean betraying my self-respect. There’s been no apology, no ownership, and no acknowledgment that the problem began when they turned my engagement announcement into something about them.

At this point, I’m maintaining silence until there’s genuine change. I’m not closing the door forever, but I’m no longer willing to carry the emotional responsibility for people who won’t meet me halfway.

Any thoughts? Advice?

ANSWER: So sorry your sister and mother are pathetic. Live your best life with your new family. Congratulations

QUESTION: My (24F) boyfriend (30M) wants my baby to take his last name, how do i approach this?

My (24F) boyfriend (30M) and I have been together for about three months, and got together when I was about 5 months into my pregnancy (he is not the bio dad). He has honestly been a massive help so far in helping me prepare my house for the baby, and always makes time to take me to any appointments even where I already have help arranged, just in case. We often used to get into spats regarding what will happen once the baby arrives as he wants to move in ASAP and fully step into the role of a father, whereas I just don't feel comfortable letting him contribute to me and my child more than he already has, especially on the financial side as it just is not his responsibility and we are still early days.

Generally though, we are at some level of understanding as to what is going to happen once the baby is born, and I thought we were finally at a place where I could relax a little bit and worry less about him and more about my baby until he asked me if i would give her his last name.

For context, my plans for her last name has always been to use my childhood friend's mother's. It sounds complicated but both my parents walked out on me when I was 16, and she took me under her wing and treated me as one of her own. She has always wanted a grandchild but my friend is gay, and doesn't plan to adopt anytime soon. She doesn't know i plan on giving my child her last name yet, but my friend and my boyfriend have been aware for a while and have actively supported the idea. Which i guess is another reason as to why I'm confused about my boyfriend asking this of me.

When i reiterated my plans to my boyfriend in response, he blew up at me and said that he felt the effort he was putting into this baby was going underappreciated, and that he wasn't sure how comfortable he was sticking around when I won't commit to letting him be the father to the baby, but will let him commit to spending money on us. I honestly had no idea how to react, because whilst I feel bad that he is with me in spite of my pregnancy, I also was not sure why he was bringing up finances when not once have I ever let him spend any money on my child, even as going far enough to pay for fuel costs when driving me to appointments because (as mentioned before) it's not his responsibility to financially support me and the baby. I kind of panicked and told him I didn't know what to say, and he told me I had to think over my plans with this baby if I wanted him to stick around.

I did feel bad about it, so I later told him I would reconsider it, and he's been fine since, but I'm due soon and my heart is set on the last name I had planned, and I'm just worried about telling him that. I just really don't know how to navigate this situation whatsoever and really need some advice haha. And before I get questions, bio dad is not involved as per his own request.

EDIT: i've gotten a few comments asking this, but I am planning to change MY last name to that of my friend's mom (this has been arranged for a while, even before my pregnancy) so please do not worry!!

EDIT 2: thank you for all the comments. i am going to inquire about getting child support from her biological father, and leave my boyfriend as ultimately i need to put my baby first. please be kind.

ANSWER: >My (24F) boyfriend (30M) and I have been together for about three months

It's actually baffling that you're even asking this. You've been together 3 months, and he blew up at you when you told him your plans? Not only should you not give your baby his last name, you should reconsider the whole relationship because he's throwing red flags left and right... I'd go as far as to say it seems like he has a very creepy possessiveness over your child and may have started dating you specifically because you were pregnant.

QUESTION: Found out my (36F) partner (33M) used to have sex with best friends wife while husband watched

Six months ago I found photos and videos that confirmed my partner (33M) had sex with his friends wife. Apparently the couple are into group sex and I assume they asked him to join after his last relationship ended around 3-4 yrs ago. I am not into this kind of stuff and when I found out I honestly was in shock and had a trauma response that involved hyperventilating and shaking. my therapist told me this later. I haven’t been able to talk to him about it for fear of things going badly. I looked at his phone once before and he found out and got very upset. It’s been a while since that happened and I’ve not looked again.  But one night something was bothering me and I only looked at his photos to see if he had saved some of his ex but what I found was unimaginably worse.  Just now I looked again and found recent texts from his friend sending him nudes of his wife and talking about how she wants to do it again and still thinks about him. He doesn’t reciprocate the sentiment but welcomed the photos. I feel so disrespected and I so badly want to come clean and talk to him about this but I’m scared. He is the man I wanted to marry. Is this grounds for breaking up? Can we work through this? Some comments from the women’s side and men’s side or anyone who has dealt with something similar would be helpful.

Update: I ended up talking to him about it because I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I tried to stay calm but asked if he was feeling unsure about us getting married (we’ve openly talked about wanting to already). Initially I tried to just ask him if he had any past with her but he could tell I knew more. After some back and forth he finally admitted it and he wasn’t as upset about me looking at his phone this time. He apologized and said it was something he did one time with his ex gf when things were in a bad place because his friends asked (she was into that stuff). He apologized for the texting and said it was really  bad judgement on his part. He said he wouldn’t want to hook up with them again even if we broke up and wants to be with me and no one else. On one hand, it does feel good to have it out in the open because I hated keeping this secret from him but, Im also extremely hurt. I guess a lot of men won’t understand the phone checking. I don’t have an issue showing my phone or wouldn’t even be mad if he looked at mine behind my back. I’d more just be curious about it and want to reassure him
if something was making him worry. Anyways, thanks to everyone who gave thoughtful responses. I appreciate it because I can’t really share this with my friends or family. As much as it sucks, I’m trying my best to find a way through. At the end of the day, I’m trying to view it as just a  fantasy which was unpleasant to know about but ultimately not an indicator that he doesn’t love me or that he plans on cheating.

ANSWER: Whether it happened before you or not, the real problem is that it’s still active now. A married friend sending nudes of his wife and your partner “welcoming” them crosses a boundary in most relationships. You’re allowed to feel disrespected and you’re allowed to expect exclusivity. You can bring this up calmly and clearly when you feel safe, and his response will tell you everything. Someone who wants a future with you will shut that door immediately and take steps to rebuild trust. If he minimizes it or flips the blame, that’s your answer too. You deserve a partner whose past doesn’t intrude on your present.

QUESTION: I (29M) caught my girlfriend (32F) with something that I don't know if I'll ever be able to move past.  I just really need some advice on what the right thing to do is.  How can I make these terrible feelings go away?

Thought I'd share a quick backstory before getting into it, if you want to get straight to the important part it'll be right underneath the underscore line.

A friend of mine from work, who I've hung out with quite a bit outside of work, told me that he has a friend who's single and looking to find someone to hook up with.

I told him that I'm usually not the type to do a FWB type of thing, and he thought it would be good for me to help get over my recent breakup.  I decided why not just give it a try.

Fast forward to a few weeks of casual hookups, and I started growing feelings for her.  Even though we both told each other that we didn't want to jump into a relationship, especially considering the both of us went through a recent breakup but it just happened.

About a month and a half into the talking phase, I asked her to be my girlfriend. We've been dating for about three months, and I know, that's not a lot of time to really get to know somebody.  But I really believed that when you know you just know.   In about a month into dating I told her I loved her, yea crazy.

I let her meet my family, I met hers, even aunts/uncles and grandparents.  Everything about us seemed perfect, almost too good to be true.  I knew we were moving very fast, and I mentioned that to her, and she told me that it's scary but now she wouldn't want it any other way, and I agreed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This Monday that just passed, the friend who set me up with her randomly called me early in the morning.  I hadn't spoken to him in a while.  He asked how everything has been going.  And I told him that it's been going great.  Before I started talking to her, he explained to me that they had a "small fling" way back in school.  It didn't bother me in the slightest, especially considering that it was many years ago.

Monday night that just passed she was over my house,  I had fallen asleep and she took a funny horrible picture of my face.  Tuesday she came over again to watch the baseball game.  We joked about the picture and I told her I wanted it off her phone.  Innocently I wanted her to even go into her recently deleted messages and fully delete it so it can't be recovered.  I assumed she knew about recently deleted messages because most people do, but she genuinely didn't.

When she went into her recently deleted, right underneath my name, was a random phone number that said 33 messages.  She quickly exited the folder.  Jokingly, I said to her what were those messages from the random number?  I truly didn't think anything of it at first.  In the past if there was ever something I raised an eyebrow to she wouldn't hesitate to show me, and that made me feel confident that she never had anything to hide.

It's when she started getting stressed out with me asking and was reluctant to show me that it began to get me worried.  I said to her babe now I'm worried and you need to just come clean if there's something you're trying to hide.  She started crying, and said to me there's nothing to hide.  I said well then if there's nothing to hide then why are you so scared to show me?  She said because I'm scared if I show you you're going to get mad at me.

I told her straight up that it's basically a lose lose situation and if she keeps it from me, then I'll never know what the truth was, and probably overthink myself to being sick and most likely never be able to trust her again.  She showed me the chat and that's when my heart sank into my stomach.

It was my friend from work, the one who initially hooked me up with her.  and he messaged her Monday morning with his work phone, about an hour after he called me.

I took a copy of it and I'm going to just share the chat word for word, I figured that's quicker and easier.  I'll put "-" for him and "#" for her.  This was in the morning on Monday, about an hour after he called me asking how everything has been with me and her.

When I read this my heart sank right into my stomach.  I felt betrayed by two people in the same night.   My friend who I trusted, wants to bang my girlfriend behind my back.  My girlfriend, hid this from me and tried to delete it, knowing this was someone who I work with and trust as a friend.  She never shut it down, and she never defended my name when he disrespected me the way he did.

Yesterday my phone got flooded with messages from her.  Saying how sorry she is and that she has never cheated from when we started talking to when we started dating up until now.  Telling me that she thought keeping this from me was to protect me.

I told her straight that I think you're only sorry you got caught.  That had I never came across those messages,  she would have never told me. That I would still be friends with a guy who wants to sleep with my girlfriend behind my back.  And she knows I never go through her phone.

Mind you, this guy is married with 2 kids, and I know his wife.

I got her to spill all the beans to me that night.  And she told me the truth is that they were still hooking up well after school.  That the most recent was around 6 years ago.  But that's not the worst part.  In the last few years, which he's been married, he's been contacting her from his work phone wanting to hook up with her.  She told me that she always said no to him (but what am I to believe).  Instead though, she had been sending videos and pictures to him on snapchat during that time, with the most recent being in April/May of this year (I wasn't taking to her at that time)

When she was flooding my messages yesterday, she said that she hates the fact that this irrelevant person is the reason why this is happening between us.

I told her straight, he's not the reason why this is happening, there's no one to blame but yourself.  Had you came to me about this rather than getting caught, this would be different.  Had you shut it down the moment he made it clear what he wants, this would be different.  Had you put a foot down when he disrespected me, this would be different.

I told her even the fact that you lied straight to my face multiple times about your history with him, and I believed you whole heartedly.  You told me "'I've never lied to you about anything, I don't lie." That's scary to me.

After a whole day of flooded messages she called me on the phone and was hyperventilating in tears saying that she doesn't want to lose me.  I told her that we can talk about this in person.

She came by the house yesterday night and we talked for 2 hours in my car.  I didn't hold back, and I laid it into her and made it very clear how upset I am about this situation.  She just sat there in silence and nodded her head.

She kept telling me it was a mistake and it never will happen again.  I said to her this was no mistake, you knew exactly what you were doing.  And you didn't feel guilty when you were doing it.  I said if this was flipped around and I had did this to you with someone you were close with, I'm sure you would feel the same way, and she agreed.

To conclude

By the end of it she told me how bad she wants to start fresh with me, that for the 100th time she's so sorry from the bottom of her heart and wants nothing more than to be with me.  I told her that I love her enough that it's scaring me to walk away from this, but how trust is very hard to build back.  She agreed and told me that this is going to take time and she wants to prove to me that I can fully trust her.

What should have made me feel better, I still went to bed last night feeling so horrible.  I woke up in the middle of the night feeling like my world is collapsing, exactly how I felt the night I found out.  I hate feeling like this, I got people in my life who I love and count on me and and I have no motivation or energy to want to get through the day.

I want to forgive her, I genuinely wanted this.  I just don't know how I can bounce back from this, and if it's even something worth fighting for.

I'm 29 and I'm scared that my time is slowly coming to an end to find someone I can settle down and have kids with.

I don't know why I'm sharing this online, but I just need to talk to someone cause I haven't spoken to anybody about it in fear that they're going to think differently of her, and I don't want to do that to her reputation.  Any bit of guidance is going to go a long way for me today, I just really need to talk about it.  Sorry for the long read.

ANSWER: My brother you have:

- a married “friend” who wants to bang your gf behind your back. 
- a gf who is seemingly okay with violating the sanctity of marriage (if she wasn’t she wouldn’t have responded)

Drop em both and move on. Tell the wife too, she deserves to know what kind of person she married. You’ll be okay but neither of those people are people you need in your life.

QUESTION: Wife (33F) and I (35M) disagree over the idea that our youngest (1Y 4M) has autism. She's obsessing over it and only sees the negatives, won't see any positives to say he doesn't have it. It's causing arguments.

My wife keeps obsessing over the idea that our youngest has Autism. It's day in, day out. "Oh, that's autism", "He's stimming again" and "Don't mind him, he's clearly being autistic again" comments in front of our other child as well as other people.

It's, frankly put, hacking me off.

Socially, I'd say he's doing pretty well. Eye contact, plays with toys, interacts with adults and has a few words down. He plays with his older brother (4) well along with some friends with young children.

Physically, he is walking well, climbing up stairs and has just started sussing coming down properly.

What my wife see's is that he likes to play with balls, spin wheels constantly, likes to walk up and down hills, spins on the spot from time to time.

My thought track is that, while different, our eldest also used to do things repeatedly, would spend hours chucking a ball down the stairs, took a little while to start getting words (car being his first), but she won't see that. She will not see anything past her own negatives. She keeps saying he won't have a life, he'll be a nightmare & difficult. She keeps accusing me of not having her back here, which then escalates to "if you don't have my back, then we don't work as a couple" comments. My response is that on this one subject, we disagree fundamentally and I cannot have her back. It's too early for a proper diagnosis but she keeps watching \\ reading online things like "is my child autistic" etc. etc. which is something every professional will outright tell you not to ever do.

I'm not after "my child is autistic and is wonderful" type comments. How can I get through this with her? While she was concerned a little about our eldest, it was nothing more than a few blips and then moved on. This time around, it's nearly constant and has been for months.

ANSWER: You shouldn’t be arguing about a medical diagnosis without having first sought an expert opinion.

This needs to go to his pediatrician.

QUESTION: I’ve cared about a coworker (47f) for years, but with retirement coming, I (50m) don’t know if I should tell her

About 15 years ago, I (50m) met a woman (47f) at work who completely changed the way I saw people. I remember the first time I saw her, I actually told myself, that’s the woman I could see myself with one day.

Over the years, we’ve become really close. It took time for her to open up, but once she did, we started spending time together outside of work, late talks after closing down restaurants, a few adventures (she even took me flying once), and just a lot of quiet moments that built a deep trust between us.

There have been a few rough patches, times she was upset with me and stopped talking for a while, but somehow we always found our way back to each other. Once, she told me I “wouldn’t want her,” and I backed off for a while, but we still drifted back into being close.

She has a daughter getting married soon, and she asked if I could go with her that day to help keep her calm. I said yes, and I don’t plan to bring up any of my feelings before then, that day should be about her and her daughter, not about me.

I’m planning to retire within the next 6–12 months, and I can’t help but feel like that’ll change things. Once I’m gone, we won’t see each other every day, and I’m afraid the closeness might fade. She talks about wanting to travel the world, while I want to stay near my son and grandkids in the mountains. I’d be fine joining her for a bit, but we’re clearly on different paths.

I’m not sure if what I feel is love or just a deep, long connection built on years of trust and admiration. I don’t know if I should tell her, let it go, or just keep enjoying what we have while it lasts.

Any thoughts?

TL;DR: I’ve had a close connection with a coworker for 15 years. We’ve shared a lot, and she’s asked me to be there for her daughter’s wedding soon. I’m retiring soon and unsure if I should tell her how I feel before that, or just let things be.

ANSWER: You were the one she asked to go to the wedding with her.  You.  Not anyone else.  I think you should tell her how you feel.

QUESTION: I don't know if I (38F) can ever forgive him (45M)

Update 11/19/25 - I just got off the phone with my mom. I asked if my kids and I could move back home to VA this summer. She is completely supportive and said she is dropping a check in the mail for me to use to hire a divorce mediator. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I (38F) met my husband (45M) in 2015. We were both recently divorced and fell desperately in love. He brought with him a daughter (SD18) who was welcoming and sweet. We were married in 2017, and welcomed a daughter in 2018 (7F) and a son in 2021 (4M).

I have always had a relatively high libido, while he has a low libido. He would be intimate with me in order to knock me up, but was very much uninterested besides that. This bothered me, but as long as we continued being intimate every few months, I was willing to let it slide.

I have always done the majority of the housework and all the cooking for our family. My husband always said he was too tired, or that he did enough by earning money, so the responsibility fell on me to cook, clean, manage the house, and raise the children.

I made a lot of excuses for my husbands behavior. I can confidently say that he never got up in the night even once with either child, saying that he was an electrician and needed to be well-rested to do his job safely. He rarely contributed financially to the children's needs like clothes and baby food. He needed his money to pay the mortgage and bills, but somehow also found the money to buy a Harley while I suffered with credit card debt and enrolled in SNAP to afford formula for our daughter.

I began to resent my husband, but was embarrassed and ashamed by the idea of going through a second divorce, this time with a child.

In 2019, I landed a job making significantly more money and the financial strain in our marriage disappeared. This is one reason that, despite my growing resentment, we decided to have another child.

As a result of several factors including division of labor, lack of intimacy, and the strain of two children, my husband and I spent less and less time together after the kids were in bed. He would shut himself in his man cave at night and I'd go to bed alone almost every night.

In October of 2023, I found a size small lingerie bodysuit in our Amazon cart.

When I confronted my husband, he denied it at first, then admitted that he had been speaking with a girl in Only Fans and had been sending her gifts. I was heartbroken. He insisted it was only a fantasy and nothing had actually happened. He agreed to couples counseling. I asked to see their messages and he declined saying it would only hurt worse.

Between this and our first couples therapy appointment, I took it upon myself to steal his phone, log in to his account, and read their messages.

I found out that it had been going on for about 6 months, and in that time he had sent her hundreds of dollars of gifts and tips. I also found out he discovered she coincidentally lived about 15 minutes away from us and he had repeatedly and aggressively tried to meet up with her. What hurt the most though is that he told her he was in love with her and wanted to be with her.

At our first couples therapy appointment I confronted him with this knowledge and told him I want a divorce. He was irate that I had gone through his phone and absolutely caught off guard by my knowledge.

After the appointment he begged me to reconsider. He said he loved me and would fight for me and didn't want to break the family up. He said he would do anything.

I told him that even if I forgave him, he could never be who I needed him to be. I told him I was resentful because he never helps around the house, is never intimate with me, and is always tired because of his job.

After a lot of back and forth, we decided to try to salvage our marriage by making the following changes:

1. We would combine our finances so I would never have to worry about him subscribing to her again. 
2. He would quit his job and we would move somewhere we could survive on one income so that he could share the household and child care burden, and wouldn't be tired all the time
3. We would continue therapy indefinitely.

We have implemented these changes, and it has now been over a year.

This is the state of things: 
He cooks dinner once a week most weeks, I cook the rest of the week. He takes the kids to school in the morning and I pick them up. He does laundry and takes out the trash, I do the rest of the household chores. He stays up until midnight, long after I'm in bed alone, then sleeps from noon until 3pm. We have not had sex in 21 months.

Crest-fallen does not adequately describe my mental health. I feel like a complete fool. I feel alone. I feel trapped.

I don't know if I can forgive him anymore.

It's not that he has particularly done anything recently, I just don't know if I can forgive what he did when he has done nothing to redeem himself.

I have also put myself in a position that leaving him would financially ruin me.

Can I ever forgive my husband?

ANSWER: I can’t lie, I’m pretty shocked that he fucked up and in return you just shot yourself in the foot financially to keep a crappy husband

But okay, that’s done and can’t be undone

So, this is clearly not a loving marriage anymore and it’s time to start getting ready to separate

It’s time for your kid to go back to daycare and your husband to go back to work

Once that’s done, then start the process of separating

QUESTION: I F22 get less attracted to my boyfriend M21 whenever he opens his mouth due to his politics. How do I break up in a mature way?

Tldr at the end.

I need help formulating how to break up in a constructive way. I don't want to do the classically "it's not you, but me" because I think he deserves the truth.

I met my boyfriend M21 about 6 months ago on a dating app and we hit it off immediately. We had the same background and a lot of the same interests.

Now none of my friends liked him from the beginning and that is not a rare thing. Apparently most people dislike him, something he admits himself and he dislikes most people but by then I didn't know the reason for it yet. he isn't the physically attractive person so I thought that was the reason since a few of our mutual acquaintances told me I could do way better but apparently that was only half of the reason.

At first everything was amazing. He was funny, respectful and committed. That was the part I liked the most. He saw me in his future and saw us having children which was an idea I loved. He did guarantee a future for me and treated me well but then slowly things changed.

Gradually he started making offhand jokes and comments about minorities and especially gay people which confused me because he is a part of a minority and at the beginning he told me A LOT about how he had gay friends but never mentioned them again later in the relationship.

He then started talking about the 'libs' and I had to remind him that I was one of them. His answer was usually that I was one of the good ones.

I met him as an exchange student to my country. He said in his country he is conservative but in mine he would be center or even left but the more he says the more it isn't true

Whenever he says something about his political opinions be it his pro death sentence stance or anti trans stance even though he knows I have trans friends I become less attracted to him and honestly by now I get turned off by his presence.

I know he really tries. He showers me with gifts, attention and tbh money but all that is not worth literally fighting with him over human rights.

When he joked about things in general I thought "maybe it is jokes, maybe he is ignorant and I can educate him" but he has only gotten more extreme and when he talked bad about my trans friend a week back I think I lost the last bit of attraction. After the argument I couldn't bring myself to even talk to him for a while, especially since I asked him what he would do if our children were gay or trans and he said he wouldn't support it, only begrudgingly accept it and try to nudge them in a different direction. I am bi. He knows I'm bi.

I could ignore the physical part but whenever he brings up a political opinion again I cringe and honestly I have started feeling used if he made sexual advances already way before (like honestly almost the beginning but I actually thought it was because of the looks or because he literally tried to touch me anywhere and all the time, even pulling me into the woods for it and especially since I thought the main reason were the looks I thought I would get over it in time)

Honestly in this relationship I dreamed more of other people and yearned more for ex crushes than ever before. I never contacted any of them, even ignored their texts but I caught myself thinking about how they respected people and thinking that my boyfriend was a worse person than them and that's something I shouldn't think and he doesn't deserve.

I just can't do this anymore. I've been cold on him, he's been trying to give more but I can't accept him seeing the identities of people I hold death as grounds for a debate or talking down on people with my opinions or with the same sexual orientation as me

However as you can probably notice my thoughts and feelings are all over the place, especially as I have never broken up with someone so I'm asking: could someone help me sort and formulate my thoughts so I can break up with dignity because I think he deserves to know the reasons to do better next time.

Tldr: boyfriend is way more right wing than I originally thought by his betrayal, now I get turned off whenever he opens his mouth and I kinda wish he would never talk. Need help with breaking up.

Edit: guys. Neither of us are American, we're both middle eastern Europeans please stop arguing about American politics or accusing us to be part of certain parties or even telling me that I am what's wrong with America. I have no connection to the country.

ANSWER: No further clarifications. You date to find out if you’re compatible. You found out you aren’t, doesn’t have to be hard feelings with that

QUESTION: How do I (F45) respond to my fiancé (M46) asking if he should leave because he misses who I was?

I've been with my fiancé for 7 and a half years and he just asked if he should leave.

A couple of weeks ago I went to the doctor because my neck was hurting and I found out that I have 4 herniated disc's.

I've either been experiencing extreme pain or am a zombie from the medication I've been taking for the pain. On top of that I work fulltime, have 4 kids, and I'm enrolled in my final class I need to get my AA.

My fiancé is upset because he feels neglected and I haven't been spending time with him, and he even asked me to apologize for making him put up with me through all of this. He asked me where his fiancé went and if he should just leave because I'm not the same and if she's gone, maybe he should leave too.

Is there anyway for me to explain that I'm not being distant on purpose, I just physically can't do anything more than what's necessary right now?

ANSWER: The fact that you know this:

>I found out that I have 4 herniated disc's. I've either been experiencing extreme pain or am a zombie from the medication I've been taking for the pain. On top of that I work fulltime, have 4 kids, and I'm enrolled in my final class I need to get my AA.

and you still feel like you need to ask this:

>Is there anyway for me to explain that I'm not being distant on purpose

is actually genuinely sort of heartbreaking

QUESTION: Found a weird text on my boyfriend’s (32M) phone sent to his friend and I (30F) am now not sure about taking this relationship ahead.

FEW MORE BITS ADDED BELOW

I (30F) is living with my boyfriend (32M) of 7 years and is now planning to get married in the next couple of months. Recently I saw a text on his phone sent to one of his female friends which said something like below:

“So… I think I’m actually in a relationship now. And honestly, since I’m done with the whole “things eventually blow up” cycle, this one might even end up going the marriage route. Everything’s been moving kinda fast.
Still super early, of course but after the absolute madness and just wanting my life to change, I basically went, “screw it, let’s do this.” I was desperate to get out of my own head, and this just felt like a nice, solid option.
I wanted to tell you earlier, but I was still figuring it out myself. And then by the time I got back, everything was chaotic. When I saw you the other day, I realized I was just stalling. Apparently this is harder to talk to you about than I expected. And yeah… I guess there’s still some leftover unresolved stuff on my end. Sorry, I know I said I wouldn’t bring it up again.
But seriously, don’t worry. We’re all clear. You’re way too important to me as a friend, more than anything else. So please don’t be bothered, even if you’re annoyed I’m digging up old stuff again. I just needed to be honest.
All that is behind me now or will be soon. I’m apparently still not a full adult. But I’m trying. This girl is really understanding, and it feels like something calmer and more grown-up, not some dramatic, starry-eyed thing. So yeah… awkward update. Don’t give me some overly polite response. I’m an idiot. I should’ve just told you, and you would’ve handled it in your usual disgustingly cool way. But I didn’t, and now I’m irritated with myself.”
(I have modified the message for obvious reasons).

For context, I know about this friend of his but never met her.  I know the fact that they had a history a couple of years before I met him. But after being in a relationship with him for 7 years and us talking about marriage shit for the last 2 years, this message looks like she has no idea about us.

(Also, our relationship didn’t start anything like what he described in his message. I felt it was something “spark at first sight”. He kissed me for the first time on our 2nd meeting or so and we weren’t even expressed our feelings for each other at that point. (I had a giant crush on him, at that point) it’s been 7 years after that, so definitely this is not early).

I also realised none of his female friends knew about me and now because this is getting official he is trying to make it public very gently. I haven’t still met any of his female friends.
Last year, I came to know that he lied to me one time and went out for a late night movie with another friend (F). When I came to know about it and brought it up to him. He just called her up in front of me and invited her for our “wedding” to prove me there is nothing going on between them. Then why the fuck he would lie.

There had been issues 4 years back where he did break my trust but we have worked on our relationship throughout these years. We also have been in LDR for 3.5 years. I am not someone who controls his life. I have always been someone who wants him to live his own life and meet his friends, then why he has lie to me about meeting his female friends, if nothing is going one? I can’t bring up such stuff without him snapping or him thinking I am blaming him. 
Yes, he has been there with me emotionally and mentally and been my strength for the last 4 years and kept reassuring me. But now why to hide stuff about going out with female friends?

Whenever I bring up about calling his friends (along with his female friends to whom he has lied about us) to our house for dinner or whatever, he just avoids it saying they are not that close which I know is not true. You don’t share your family and childhood pictures with those who are not close to you.

This is literally bothering me and I am not sure how this marriage will work if he keeps lying about such things.

- Wow!!!! I wasn’t expecting these many comments and I am very overwhelmed with everything going in my head. Thank you all.

Just to add few bits here.(Not defending him. Just putting out the actual picture).

Me and him, we both are very private when it comes to sharing personal stuff to people (that includes friends). His male friends (whom I met recently) are surprised to know he was even in a relationship for 7 years.

While we were living in separate countries with different time zones. He was with me on the phone (FaceTime) most of the times throughout the day…so much that it never felt as if we were away. He even changed his schedules according to my time zones so that we can atleast eat and sleep at the same time. We video called every single day before we went for bed and kept the FT ON throughout the time till we wake up in the morning. Also, in the 4 years of LDR, he was the one who kept on asking me to come back to him, get married, start a life, blah…blah…. And that went for 2 years. For 2 whole years, he kept on bringing up about wedding and stuff. Hence, I left my job and moved back to his country. Even after moving back, he took care of everything. I started having health issues and he took care of me and the medical bills. Consoled my family and made sure I am comfortable. Recently, I had a surgery and he is the one taking care of me and is with 247 for the last 1 month.

So yes, this is a HUGE BLOW on my trust. I need answers and will definitely get answers. Guess, time to step up for myself.

ANSWER: You've been dating this guy for SEVEN YEARS and none of his friends know about you?  Am I understanding that correctly?

QUESTION: My wife F26 and me M28 want to have kids but after two miscarriages and a blood test showing she has the gene variant for spina bifida, I am hesitant.

We had a miscarriage in march and then another one a couple months ago. We got bloodwork done and it shows she has a gene variant that can cause spina bifida in the developing fetus. Her brother has spina bifida too. Knowing this we should’ve gotten the bloodwork done before we even started trying but I’m trying not to dwell on the past.

We had a tough conversation the other night. I don’t know if I want to take the risk of having kids if there is a good chance the baby will have spina bifida. We have an appointment with our OBGYN on the 18th and that should give us more info on the medications she can take (folate) that would lower the risk of the baby developing spina bifida.  She is already taking folate but I guess with the gene variant she has it makes it difficult for the body to process folate so she might need a different form of the folate. Let’s say the OBGYN says this lowers the risk to 10-15%. That’s still a number I am uncomfortable with and I’m not sure I would want to take those chances.

I could see this being something that may end in a divorce and I am very stressed out about everything. She wants kids no matter what. I just know with seeing her brother and all the care he needs I am not prepared in the slightest to take on a monumental task like that. I know there is going to be differing opinions on this and there’s not one easy answer, but does anyone have any advice or experience with something like this?

ANSWER: You can likely do ivf and do pgs testing of embryos and not transfer ones that have the harmful gene.

QUESTION: My (18M) girlfriend (18f) told her friends about our sexual experiences and i dont know what to do

Ive been dating this girl for about 1.5 months, shes pretty great and a few nights ago we had oral sex for the first time.

Fast forward to today i was hanging out with her and her friends and they were all acting funny, her friends kept on referencing it but i ignored it. When we were walking home I asked her if she told them and she was avoiding the question until she eventually admitted it and it felt like a stab in the heart. I told her it was really disrespectful of her to do and it made me uncomfortable and she said she didnt know i wouldnt be cool with it even though i told her it should stay between us.

I feel so betrayed because i trusted her so much and now I feel like that trust is broken and I dont know if it can be fixed and im considering breaking up with her?

ANSWER: Did she empathize with you? Apologize? Try to make it right somehow? Offer to tell her friends to forget they heard that and stop referencing it?

If you want to break up, you can. But those things combined may help you feel better.

QUESTION: I (32F) had an abortion and didn’t tell my husband (42M). The guilt is overwhelming. How can I fix this?

I recently had an abortion, but I didn't tell my husband about it. The guilt has started eating away at me, and I feel like I've made a big mistake not being open with him.

I got pregnant almost exactly 12 weeks after our first baby was born. I found out I was pregnant when I was about 6 weeks along. I panicked and immediately decided to terminate the pregnancy without talking to my husband or even really thinking through the decision. I don't regret the abortion itself-as I honestly feel like it was the right decision for me-but I do regret not telling my husband about it.

Motherhood has been a huge shock to my system. It's really hard and I don't think that I could handle having a second baby right now. My husband seems to have adjusted to parenthood much more easily. He's involved and very hands on, but I'm still doing the bulk of the work. He really only takes over in the evenings when we both get home from work. I'm the one doing most of the caring. I even bring her with me to work since my workplace allows new moms to bring their babies for the first 6 months.

I didn't tell him I was pregnant because I was afraid he might want another child and don't understand why it's so important to me not to have one. Now I feel guilty for making this decision without his involvement, without being honest with him regarding the situation at hand and as to how I really felt. I didn't need his permission, but yes, it is something we should have talked about.

I'm terrified that by telling him now, it's going to make things worse. He may be angry that I made this decision without him, but what I'm really fearing here is that he'll be hurt that I kept it from him at all. If the roles were flipped and I found out later my spouse kept something like this from me, I would be devastated. I feel so torn between telling him and just finding a way to silently and privately move on. I just don't know how to move forward from here. How do I tell him?

ANSWER: A lot of the anxiety you’re feeling may be from all the hormones in your body. I had two babies thirteen months apart and while I survived, I barely did and the depression and anxiety haunt me 20 years later. I am concerned for your mental health and not just because of the secret or abortion or newborn. It’s all of it. Please seek therapy. I know it’s too much to handle on your own so you need to talk to a professional. Your husbands reaction will not be supportive (possibly and likely) - and you will not be able to handle that on top of  everything else. A therapist will be able to work with you to manage your emotions and plan how to tell your husband and when. I know that feels impossible on top of everything else but you need help to sort through everything. Peace to you and your baby and your husband.

QUESTION: My flatmate M19, and I F18 knowingly committed flatcest

Okay so for context, I F18 started uni this year and became really close with my flatmates. One of my flatmates M19 and I got really close in a platonic way, and are just able to chat about anything.

We both recently came out of long term relationships, so we’ve been chatting a lot to get over it.

The other night, he came back from a Wednesday social, and as we normally do he came into my room and gave me a debrief of his night. He accidentally fell asleep on my bed, and I couldn’t wake him up, so I just gave him a blanket and lay on the other side of the bed. I woke up in the middle of the night to him really gently wrapping his arm around my stomach, and nestling his head into the back of my neck. When we woke up in the morning he asked why he was there, and seemed really apologetic. I haven’t told him that he was cuddled up to me, and I don’t think he remembered.

Moving on, last night his friends from home came down for a night out. They were all really lovely and it was a good night. When we got home, one of his guy mates fell asleep on my bed, and another on my bedroom floor. The girl fell asleep on his bed. As a result, me and him were both sleeping on the floor in his bedroom.   
Bear in mind it’s 3am at this point, and I’m cold so I start shivering. He puts the blanket that he has over himself partially over me, and holds my hand so that the girl on the bed can’t see. This leads to us both snuggling up to each other, and him leaning over to kiss me. Initially I hesitated, because we both were drunk/tipsy, and I didn’t want to ruin our friendship. However, I did eventually give in, and it was a really good kiss. We spent the rest of the night cuddled up, making out and him grazing his hands over my hips/back. It felt right, I had butterflies and whenever we’d stop kissing my heart was beating so fast I couldn’t breathe.

I had to wake up early - 6.30 - so when my alarm when off, he just cuddled up to me, and kissed my forehead..

I went back to my room to get my stuff and get changed, and when I came out he was sat on the floor outside “waiting for the loo”. I sat next to him, and he asked if I had to go etc etc it was really sweet.

Since this morning, he texted me saying “I shouldn’t have done that, I’m so sorry” and I replied and haven’t heard anything back despite him being active. I go back to uni tomorrow lunch but I really don’t want it to be awkward. We’re living together next year, and I really don’t want this will affect our dynamic. Any advice??

UPDATE
I hate to disappoint all of you. I spoke to him this evening saying that it gave me butterflies and that I enjoyed it, and he said he felt similar. However nothing more will come of it :(
We’re both super non-awkward people so we’re just gonna go on as before, and pretend it didn’t happen.. 
we’ve made many friends with benefits jokes to that’s how it’s gonna be I guess - not complaining icl
We’re going out again Wednesday and this weekend, so likely it might happen again 
I’ll keep you updated xxxx

ANSWER: This is so cute. Just first year uni things! Enjoy it, be kind to each other, and you’ll be OK! UpdateMe

QUESTION: After ten years, we (F36, M36) tried to open the relationship. It was horrible. How do we recover?

I think my boyfriend and me might have fucked up our 10-year-relationship by trying to open it.

Long Post Alert.

He started dating someone else, but nothing except one kiss happened, because he knew I wasn't comfortable with the situation yet. He was dating her, trying to keep her interested, while we were at the same time working on me becoming comfortable with the situation.

He has had two serious relationships before me, the second one lasted three years and was open. He is my first real relationship, and I am way less experienced than he is, both in terms of relationships and sex.

He explained to me that his plan was to sleep with her a couple of times and then slowly let it peter out. He said, based on his past experiences, that the third wheel usually loses interest quickly, because they realize they have the least amount of power in the arrangement. If she had not lost interest, he would have tried to turn the fling into a friendship if possible, or just respectfully break it off. Especially so if he had suspected her developing any romantic feelings. This had been his MO in his earlier open relationship in his 20s.

After about six dates in 2 months, he ended it with her because of how things were going with us. With me. I don't know how to sum up what happened to me, but I just kept feeling worse and worse about the whole thing. I started crying every other day, just while working at my desk or taking the train. I started resenting both of them. I started snapping at him, which is not a normal thing in our relationship at all. Basically, even though we had lots of talks, and in some ways I felt closer to him than ever because of all the communication we were having… I nevertheless felt like he was cheating.

I know this is not fair to him. He was open about everything he was doing. He didn't sleep with her. He stopped dating her when I asked him to, although they met like two more times as friends after that because he did not want to make her feel bad. She is going through a bad divorce and really needed somebody to talk to. He did not want to leave her hanging. Or feeling used.

Why did I even agree to try an open relationship, you may wonder.

Well, for one, we never really decided that we were in an open relationship. There were off-hand remarks by both of us over the years that this might be a possibility for us. That was all. But we never had a serious conversation about it. Then one day he comes home after work and tells me that this woman has messaged him on Instagram and that he wants to meet her. And honestly, looking back I now realize what he was asking. But back then, I didn't know what he was really asking. He said he couldn't tell whether she wanted to be friends or more. So I agreed that he could meet her, because I didn't want to be a controlling partner. After their first meeting, he said that she definitely wanted more than friendship. When he said that, I BURST OUT CRYING. I cried for like an hour, couldn't talk or look at him. He tried to comfort me but I really couldn't tolerate him touching me. That was the beginning. THIS NEXT BIT IS INSANE, but after that, we agreed that he would meet her again, but that I didn't want to know anything about it, because I obviously couldn't handle hearing about it.

Does this sound insane, yes. I know that NOW. Let me pause right here.

How I understand myself now, in hindsight: I am a people-pleaser, I don't like saying no. I have pretty low self-esteem. I thought I could just pretend all this wasn't happening and wait until his little adventure would fizzle out. He had made it clear that he had no interest in a relationship with this person. There was no potential for anything beyond sex with this woman.

I know looking back how stupid, unhealthy and unkind to myself all of this was. But when the person you love most in the world wants something, you want them to have it. And I also wanted to push through my discomfort. And to work on making this work, with him, as a team. But as time went on, I felt alone and betrayed and like they were playing on the same team, and I was all alone. The talks we had helped make me feel better and secure in our relationship again, but always, after a few days, I would feel like absolute shit about the whole thing again.

He did nothing that wasn't allowed. He didn't sleep with her. They messaged, he spent several evenings at her apartment, getting to know her. He was honest with her about being in an open relationship. There was sexual tension, but he didn't act on it. At one point, he was hugging her at the end of a date and she kissed him. I guess she was getting impatient and thought he couldn't take a hint. The next day, he told me about the kiss and we decided that he should stop dating her. Because at that point I WAS A MESS.

The thing is… I agreed to all of this. Or, at least, I didn't disagree. I participated. I didn't draw a boundary, because, honestly, I didn't know it existed. But hoo boy, it exists. And it was crossed. And I just… hurt more and more every day.

The whole thing ended about four months ago. But for the first 2 months after, I was still getting worse. Crying, sleeping terribly, losing my appetite, being irritable… we continued talking, spending time together, being us.

A lot of this mess is my fault. I think my decision-making and behavior are deeply troubling. Did I mention this is my first relationship EVER. I just wanted to try this, to make him happy, to be cool, because monogamy is laaame, right, and maybe I wanted to kiss someone else at some point. I was very naive. I suppress a lot of feelings it seems. I have very low self-worth it seems. I probably depend way too much on my boyfriend and felt like I could not turn him down. I have realized that I feel… dependent on him to an unhealthy degree. That I think I won't find anybody else ever.

All very unhealthy stuff that has come to the surface. Well, I love learning, but dear God, I really didn't want to learn about myself like this.

Ugh, anyway, here we are. They are donzo. We are better. He says he has no problem being monogamous and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me. This fling was just supposed to be fun, it is by no means something essential he needs in his life. We have been together for ten years. He is my best friend. I love him. He is a very honest and trustworthy person. For real.

I participated in creating this whole mess of a situation. I AM NOT GREAT AT FEELINGS AND COMMUNICATION YALL. He is sorry he hurt me. He thinks he did nothing wrong. Sometimes, oftentimes, I believe that too.

And yet… and this is unfair, but, I fucking hate him. Since his first date with that other woman, I wake up almost every morning and want to no longer be with him. I want to break his greedy little heart. I want to hurt him. I want revenge. Because he really loves me and it would hurt like a bitch. But I also want to break up because I just don't want to be with him anymore. Although I also want to be with him forever.

I feel betrayed, although he didn't betray me. I feel deeply disrespected. I feel ugly and unloved. I don't trust him like I used to, even if he was being honest the whole time. I used to trust him completely. I fucking hate him so much now some days. This will get better with time but it will never be like it used to. I am so mad at his selfishness, his vanity, his laziness. At some point during a conversation he complained how exhausting this whole thing was and I thought TOUGH TITTY YOU STARTED THIS YOU WANTED THIS YOU BROUGHT A THIRD PERSON INTO THIS RELATIONSHIP YOU FUCKING SELFISH ASSHOLE.

Yeah, so… before someone comments on it, stupid games, stupid prizes and all that. To reiterate, I am not good at this relationship stuff. There is so much more I could have written as for background info, I know there are gaps, but this is already an epic block of text.

I don't know what to do. For one, I probably need therapy, just in general. Because I was really not looking out for myself. And I don't seem to like myself. Or think I deserve to be treated well.

But, like, what now. There is just some resentment in me from all that has happened that is… huge and heavy. Our relationship used to make me feel safe and proud. Now I feel trapped and humiliated. Oof.

I guess I just need some feedback. I am too close to see anything clearly.

Extended Version - free of charge ;)

First of all, he did not sleep with her, although I know Reddit finds this hard to believe. I am 100% certain of this. He might be downplaying some of their emotional intimacy, but nothing sexual happened. I know this because his father is a piece of shit, who cheated on his mother for years and he found out when he was a teenager. He loves his mom more than anything. One of his main goals in life is that he NEVER wants to be like his father. He could never sleep with another woman and lie about it, he wouldn't be able to live with himself. (Although lately, I think he might be more like his father than either of us can stomach.) This is the foundation of who he is. If he lied about that, I would have been living with an imposter for ten years.

Will get checked out for STDs nevertheless, better safe and all that.

We are engaged, he proposed to me a few months before all of this happened. Great, right? It ‘took him so long’, because I have never been interested in marriage and only warmed up to the idea recently. (I just don't like weddings and never thought it was necessary to put a ring on it.) HE would have gotten married years ago. But he accepted that I did not want it and waited. Ironic? Maybe.

Yes, I will get therapy. FOR ME.

Yes, deep down I know that this relationship is doomed. Right now, I am only working part-time because I’m in graduate school and I am somewhat financially dependent on him. Which I regret IMMENSELY. Also, the idea of moving is daunting. Ugh.

There are many things I resent him for. One thing is his incredible laziness. If you want an open relationship, you need to put serious work in beforehand. And since he was the one more eager on it, I expected him to take the lead on doing that work with me. Especially since he had done this once before. But in one of our later talks, he said he thought I was going to do the research. At some point, while he was already dating said lady, he said, “mmh maybe we should get a book or something.” The entitlement. I think in his previous open relationship, his girlfriend took the initiative and made him do all the emotional work. But that was because she wanted to open them up. During our conversations, I was quickly becoming the person more knowledgeable about how this was supposed to work, because I had taken the time to google for like half an hour.

The other woman… is interesting. At one point, I thought a lot about her. He was pretty honest with her in some regards, but also careful that she only knew what he needed her to know, I think. She definitely knows about me. She is concerned about me. I don't have contact with her but he told me this and I believe him. (She sounds like someone I would want to be friends with, tbh.) She consented that they would only ever be … a fling as he called it. The thing is, the ex she is divorcing is truly horrible and abusive, and my man must have seemed like a saint compared to that guy. I think more than a sexual relationship, she was relying on my man for emotional support. And he wanted to give that to her. And fuck her, of course.

The way he talked about the other people in an open relationship really troubled me as well. It seems pretty… transactional and cold. The thing is, he really needs to be a good guy for his own self-worth. He told me this one story from before we were together: He slept with this girl and she was clearly falling in love so they had a talk and stopped having sex. But afterwards, he would meet her for coffee for YEARS so that she would not realize he had only used her for sex. Even though she bored the shit out of him. He told me this story like it was a decent thing to do, but to me it just seems messy and disingenuous. Of course, fucking people and ghosting them is also shitty. But surely there must be a middle ground? This all gives me the ick.

Maybe people in the non-monogamous community can explain how they navigate that stuff.

It is probably useful to know that my fiance is very charismatic. People are drawn to him, especially if they have problems. He is very good at talking with people and does counseling for a living. This is kind of ironic, because the communication in our relationship has been terrible, as it turns out.

I am way more introverted and have less of a ‘flashy’ personality than him. But I am deeply kind and loyal, also slightly odd and perhaps a little neurodivergent. (Yes, I finally need to go to therapy, I know.)

What else? THANKS FOR READING AND ALL YOUR COMMENTS, even, perhaps especially, the snarky ones. I have never posted anything this honest and personal online. I read every single one of your comments.

I will update.

ANSWER: So he pushed through your tears throughout the whole process. What a prince.

I can see why you hate him. Act on it.

QUESTION: (F/43) My husband (M/42) of ten years is on a work trip with his boss, but it's quickly turning personal. How do I confront him and be heard?

My husband and I have been pretty estranged for the past year. For the past few months, we had made plans for him to move out on November 1st, but he is still here and we are trying to work on making improvements. A few months ago, he had planned a work trip for this week. The night before he left, I found out this work trip is only with his female boss, and they had planned it together. They coordinated flights, and he rented a car for them both. Immediately after leaving the airport, they went thrift shopping together for several hours and didn't attend the first day of the conference. I have let him know how uncomfortable I am with this situation, especially given that I have felt she has had feelings for him for a while. He keeps dismissing me with anger, and telling me "it's all in your head" and that I am making things up. I called today and they were out to lunch together, not at the conference. I later found out that she is not married, like she said she is. I keep getting more upset with the situation and everything continues to get worse. Every honest fear I express to him is turned against me or dismissed. What do you think of his behavior? How can I speak to him in a way to get him to acknowledge the optics of the situation and my feelings? How would you react?

ANSWER: I’m a professional woman in a male dominated field. I’ve been on dozens of work trips with men even single men. I’ve never ditched my work to go shopping with them.

He’s crossed a line and having an affair. Sorry.

QUESTION: I (20F) want to break up with my BF (20M) because of his best friend's girlfriend

So, me (20F) and my bf (20M) have been together for 4 years and 6 months and I''ve been having problems with his best friend's (19M) girlfriend (19F). It all started when this girl, we'll call her Ana, stalked me once when I was at the mall with some friends, took prictures of me, sent them to her bf and implied that I was out cheating on my bf. This got to my bf and we got in a fight because of that, almost breaking up in the process. I got so mad because of that, he fully believed her and freaking thanked her saying he helped him see who I actually was. Anyway, we somehow made up but I was rlly upset that Ana was still in our lives. The next time Ana tried to flirt with my boyfriend while all the four of us were out at the barber shop (our bfs were getting their haircuts) and she tried telling my bf how his hair would look better because she likes it a certain way. and another time while I was out with my mom (48F), Ana took a picture of me again trying to frame me because she thought I was with a boy. I was rlly fed up with her and the fact that I have to keep seeing her and acting like nothing happened, she's really like a plague and I've tried telling my bf that I don"t want to see her anymore but he insists he can do nothing because it's his best friend's gf and he has no say in it. I have come to the conclusion that if he would rather not speak up about it on my behalf, I would rather leave him then be forced to see her again and again and act like nothing happened. I rlly don't know what to do, any tips?

UPDATE: I decided to have a long talk with my bf giving him an ultimatum that if he values my presence he will cut her out of our lives completely, he has agreed to do so and that he will only be in the presence of his best friend and not in Ana's, decided to give him one more chance and see what happens. Wanted to tell y'all some juicy details tho, Ana's relationship with her bf isn't so rosy, so I suppose one of the reasons of her intervening is because she could be really jealous of me and my boyfriend or just straight up wants my man, there is more to it but I won't go into further details. Also wanted to edit this a little bit and say that my boyfriend has not reciprocated Ana's flirting (I should've added this sooner but I remembered to once I saw some of the replies)

ANSWER: This is very odd and it sounds like Ana wants your bf. I would address it head on with all of them in the same room. Why is she so obsessed with your relationship? Shouldn't she be focused on her bf instead of yours?

QUESTION: My boyfriend of 10 years (26 M) has an issue “resource guarding” his phone from me (27 F)

UPDATE

Buckle up, it’s a long one.
So after being in the bathroom for so long making this post and reading some of the comments he knocked on the door. I came out and immediately gave him a choice. An ultimatum. I said “your weird behavior about guarding your phone is not something a normal person would do. People who are hiding something awful on their phone have the same kind of reaction you do. You’re hiding something and you’re lying to me. I’ve never wanted to be this person and I have ALWAYS respected your boundaries and given you grace and patience when you asked for it. And yet the way you react to me just simply offering to change a song on your phone when you already have the app up is pretty telling. So I’m giving you a choice. You either disprove me that you aren’t hiding something awful on there and/or cheating by showing me your phone or you leave and this relationship is over. I cannot be in a relationship with a person who has been knowingly lying to my face for almost a decade.”

He was quiet, shook his head and sighed, pulled his phone out his pocket, opened something up and then shook his head and put his phone back in his pocket as he started to pace our living room back and forth. He repeated this over and over, the shaking his head opening his phone, then putting it back and pacing. He then said “it’s nothing”.  I said “well clearly IT is something. The fact you said ITS nothing and you keep opening up your phone and shaking your head is EXTREMELY TELLING that there is something you’re hiding and are at war with showing me.” He said “it’s nothing. I know you’ve respected my boundaries and privacy I’m sorry for reacting the way I did in the car” I said “it’s not even about just what happened in the car at this point. It’s about this repeated guarding behavior you have over your phone when I have never done anything to make you not trust me to not go through it or touch it even. It isn’t fair. I’m not letting this go. You show me what is on your phone that’s making you react that way and treating me like I’m not someone to be trusted or you leave.”

He said “so you’re giving me an ultimatum?” I said “YES. I sure as heck am. We cannot go on like this anymore. You can’t have a relationship without trust and trust is a two way street. I have bared my soul to you, you know who I am in and out. Things no one else knows. You say you want to marry me and be with me forever, but you can’t extend me the same trust I have given you. You are currently breaking my trust and you of all people know that once that’s gone there is no going back. So either you show me what’s on there or you leave.”

Things escalated. He just kept pacing and I had enough. It was clear to me that he was hiding something and the fact that he immediately just didn’t hand it to me told me everything. At this point I had decided in my head that just the mere act of him putting the phone in my hand would have been enough for me. I wouldn’t look through his phone because just him being willing to let me see his phone would have told me he wasn’t doing something or into something. I kept giving him chances and time to give to me and fess up but it didn’t happen and he kept resisting. I went into our room and starting throwing some of his clothes in a bag.

I came back out in the living room with the bag and  said “you’re going to throw away everything all because you can’t show me that you aren’t up to something bad. Really?? 10 years. Just gone? If you actually cared about me you would see how much this is tearing me apart and you would show me. I have never done anything to make you not trust me or hide something and lie to me the way you do have I?” He said no. I said “what if the roles were reversed and for the first time in 10 years you were asking, begging me- like I am doing now to you- to see my phone because you thought I was cheating or doing something horrible? And I just said it was nothing and reacted the way you are now. Would you think the absolute worse of me? Would you even wanna be with me anymore?” He put his head down and shook his head and said “no I wouldn’t”. I said “so then WHY if you know your answers if the roles were reversed, WHY are you not simply handing me the phone to disprove my accusations??” He didn’t say anything.

I said “you’re choosing to end this relationship then? All because you can’t show me. You’re throwing away our relationship. Our love for each other all because you refuse to prove me wrong. You will never kiss me again, hug me, hold me, touch me, or even talk to me ever again. This is what you’re choosing. You realize that??” I started to sob partially from sadness, partially from anger.

I told him to get out and threw the bag that I had put some of his clothes in into his arms. He looked dumbfounded. I got angry. Like full rage. And told him through my teeth “I don’t know who you are anymore, you’ve lied to me for 10 years. Get out. GET. TF. OUT. I don’t want to see you, talk to you, touch you ever again.” He started to try and weasel his way out of it by trying to calm me down and get closer and I told him while backing away “NO. Do NOT touch me. You’ve chosen whatever it is you have in that phone over me and you have LIED to me for 10 years. We’re done. I’m breaking up with you right now. This is done get tf out or I will call the cops if you don’t go on your own.” He started to again try to get near me to hug me cause at this point my rage turned into a panic attack cause all I saw in front of me was this lying stranger who intentionally hurt/lied to me and broke my trust. He was saying “hey hey hey it’s just me” in a soft voice but I was not having it.

Side note I see a lot of your comments about him possibly having C-PTSD. The irony to all this is that I am the one actually diagnosed with C-PTSD and have been in therapy for it since the beginning of our relationship basically. Because I knew that if I did not seek help that my trauma would leech into our relationship and I could project that on him. So for the sake of our relationship and my own mental well-being I got help and have been in therapy ever since. So it is a slap in the face that he is aware this is a “childhood trauma thing” and yet won’t get help for it when he knows it’s negatively effecting our relationship. He has not been willing to put in the work to better himself and our relationship as I have been actively trying to do since the beginning. Anyway thought Id put that in here regarding the panic attack and the comments I saw about c-ptsd. End of side note.

We wound up in the bedroom cause thats sort of where he ended up walking me back into cause I was trying to get away from him. He kept trying to get near to hug me to ground me and I kept telling him “I will call the cops. I do not want you to touch me, I do not want you here and you can’t talk your way out of it this time.” He just sat at the end of the bed and said “okay, okay let me just sit here and at least make sure you’ll be fine and are calming down from the panic attack”. We sat there for a while and when I was able to be calm enough to talk normally I said “if you had just simply placed the phone in my hand that would have been enough for me. It would have told me you’re not hiding anything.” He turned around wide eyed grabbed his phone off the dresser and said “here take it” I said “no that’s not how this works. You had to have done it on your own. If you had nothing to hide you’d have immediately unlocked it and placed it in my hand and said here see, nothing. But you didn’t. You can’t go back now. We’re done, and that’s not sinking in for you.”

He started to say how it’s not that he doesn’t trust me it’s just that he does have things on there. Things of a fetish nature. Which is so stupid to me that he felt the need to hide so intensely because I’m already aware of this fetish. He said he just has photos he’s save off of some websites like Twitter, discord, deviant art, etc of other girls and he just didn’t want me thinking that he knew those girls and was being sent those directly cause he was cheating. He then opened his phone and handed it to me. Unlocked. I said you’re not going to flip out if I look through messages, phone calls, emails, and your photo gallery? He just shook his head. I went through all of it with him over my shoulder. Nothing. No calls, emails, texts that weren’t to me, his family, his job, or just plain spam. I went through his gallery. Yeah, fetish type stuff. No surprise there. I said “why guard it like you do from me? I’m aware of what you’re into. I’m aware that at one point you’ve questioned your sexuality. I have done nothing but support you in everything, fetish, sexuality questioning and all. Why would you react in such an extreme way to me just wanting to do the most basic things on your phone to help you while you’re driving or having your hands full?”

He said he didn’t know and started to go into about how his family has always been I guess oddly private with one another about majority of things. We started talking more and I brought up the fact that I have told him everything about my life and I had to find out certain details about his family through his brothers high school ex girlfriend back when we were first ever in the talking phase of our relationship. I said “a lot of these things I found out through her and you either never told me at all, your siblings or parents told me, or you didn’t tell me until literally like 5 years down the line of us dating. That’s a problem. That’s not normal. I shouldn’t be told deeply personal things about your upbringing and family dynamics through other people. I should hear them from you. I always just thought you’d tell me these things in your own time, but again you rarely, if ever did.”

The more we started to talk about this the more he realized that yeah, it’s not normal. And yeah he does need therapy. He said he’s going to look into if his job offers some sort of counseling/therapy through his benefits. I’m holding him to that. I told him “this is over if you can’t or won’t get help for this. We can’t go on with only one of us giving trust.” He agreed. I still partially think there’s more he’s hiding honestly. My trust in him right now is broken and I’ve been crying on and off. He sept on the couch last night.

Thank you to everyone who gave me good advice on how to approach something like this and a big thank you to those of you that offered advice that wasn’t just ‘leave him’. I’m going to give him a chance to work on himself. If he actually doesn’t seek help? We’re done officially. I told him he now needs to build back my trust now too. He broke it. I’m exhausted. Unfortunately this pattern of me wanting to break up with him and him finally coming around when I’m at a breaking point is the usual. I hate it. I don’t know why I have to be wanting to end things with him in order for him to come around on whatever the issue is.

Anyways thank you again. Hopefully he will keep his promise of seeking help.

Original post

Hi Reddit, I’m a long time lurker and this is my first ever post. I’m also sorry in advanced for how long this one is, but I need some advice/insight, etc on this issue we’ve had since the beginning of our relationship.

I’ve had enough of my boyfriend’s weird behavior regarding his phone. My Boyfriend (26 M) and I (27 F) have been together for almost 10 years (will be 10 years in February of next year). We are high school sweethearts and met in high school when I was a senior and him a junior. Throughout our entire relationship he has just been downright weirdly defensive/guarding of his phone. I have never once in the almost 10 years together tried to look through it, take it or even touch it without his permission or knowing. I respect his boundaries and know that he is particular about his phone and laptop. Yet he has access to my phone. He knows my password and even has access to hidden things if he so desires. I’m a fully open book.

We’ve had conversations regarding this in the past and he has told me he is this way because his parents and/or siblings used to invade his privacy I guess and go through his stuff without him knowing or asking him. I told him repeatedly during those conversation that I “am not his mother or his siblings and I have never, nor would I ever, do that to you” to which he agreed and said I know you haven’t and I’ll work on it, etc.

Well cut to in the car coming back home from the store this evening, he was trying to put on a specific song that we were talking about while he was driving. I told him “Hey you shouldn’t be handling your phone while driving I can look up/change the song for you since you already have Spotify up”. To which he kind of quickly reacted and said “No never mind, it’s fine.” as he promptly turned off his phone screen and put up his phone.

I blew up on him. I said “why do you still react that way when I have never gone through your phone or even picked up your phone without you knowing or asking? You literally already had Spotify up, you could have just handed it to me and I could have quickly typed in the song and be done with it. Are you cheating? Are you hiding something? That kind of reaction is suspicious and akin to someone who is hiding things or cheating. You have full access to my phone, how is that fair? 10 years. 10 YEARS together pretty much and you STILL don’t trust me and act like you’re hiding things!”

He didn’t say anything until we pulled into our apartment parking lot and he just said “I think you already know why, I’ve already been over this” referencing his trust issues with his parents and siblings. I said “no, this is just straight up weird behavior. No one reacts that way to their significant other offering to simply change a song on their phone quickly without there being something to hide”. We didn’t say anything else to each other as we went inside and this brings us to now. I’m in the bathroom typing this asking Reddit for help or insight.

Is this behavior something to be wary of or be concerned about? Is this truly some childhood trauma based thing or is it deeper than just his childhood trust issues? Could he actually be talking to other girls or cheating? Could he be hiding some weird things on his phone? I mean this is making me question who the heck this person I’ve been with for almost a decade really is. I’m tired of it. I love him so much and we do want to get married, but I don’t want to be with someone who can’t trust me enough to just simply let me change a song on his phone.

I realize this probably sounds ridiculous or like I’m over reacting, but like said this has been an ongoing issue for the entirety of our relationship with ebbs and flows of it getting better only for a tiny bit after bringing it up again. Is this something I should be really worried about? If it is how do I approach talking with him about this? How can we get over this if him ‘working on it’ never actually amounts to anything? Sorry for all the loaded questions, I’m at my wits end.

For more context this man has been caught many, many times in stupid white lies. Which in and of itself is a whole other issue. So this is a person who has a tendency to be on the defense, lie, and hide even the silliest of things.

ANSWER: There's a lot of these "I'm 23 and I've been with my boyfriend for 10 years" kinda posts and I just want to point out that maybe a decision you made when you were a child probably isn't gonna pan out very well into your adulthood.

QUESTION: How do I (30m) move on from my (28f) wife dating by best friend?

She decided she wanted a divorce and she thinks we “aren’t good together”. After trying to convince her otherwise for a month I just figured fuck it I’ll give her what she wants. So now that’s what we’re going through. And a month and a half after we have been separated she’s now dating my best friend of 17 years. I guess I should call him an ex best friend.

Who really needs enemies when you have friends like that? The worst part is I work with this “friend” on a regular basis. Everyday I want to cuss him out but I don’t want to bring drama to work.

My reaction was furious at first, but now I’ve just come to realize that no matter how long you’ve been with someone you truly never really know them. And no matter how long you’ve been friends with somebody they will stab you in the back at the first sign that it benefits them.

Parts of me want to scream at them both and tell them how I feel but I think I’ll fall on deaf ears. I also don’t really know how to start over. I was with my wife for 6 years. Feels like I don’t even know how to talk to people anymore because it’s just been me and her for so long.

ANSWER: Be grateful you don't have kids. You're still young, look for a different job with a payrise (you could move anywhere if there's somewhere you've always wanted to try). I'm sorry man, that's really shitty. If at all possible find a way to remove them from your lives completely.

QUESTION: My husband (31M) switched up on me (31F) after moving in together.

How do you know if this can be worked on or if he’s just shown his true colors and I’ve made a mistake in marriage?

We’ve been living together for just over a year now and just got married a month ago. As soon as we signed the paperwork on our house together, all effort on his end to uphold our relationship was thrown out the window. I had to deal with the bills 100% and it was expected of me to handle all relationship responsibilities. It was on me to inspect if we needed any updates to the house, the cooking, the cleaning, the upkeeping - all me. I was so excited that we would have infinite time to spend with each other while working on the house, but it was the complete opposite. I was overwhelmed and tired out from painting the walls and maintaining the cleanliness to thinking about and buying what we needed for our house. After many long conversations, it finally got a bit better after half a year when it clicked for him that it was helpful to me for him to contribute to our house too.

Fast forward a few more months and we get married only for his efforts to slowly dwindle. I think I am so afraid of conflict after everything that I was okay with solely carrying the weight of our relationship. But after a certain point I guess it’s taking a huge toll on me and I end up snapping. I hate it when I have to nag or repeat myself to ask for help and especially in a relationship when I’m supposed to feel seen and respected. He’s shown lots of micro aggressions throughout our relationship but somehow I’ve ignored them. It’s finally shed light on me who he really is this past week when my open enrollment for health insurance began. I was deciding on keeping my insurance or going on his and splitting it with him and which one would be best should we procreate. After a lot of reading and thinking, I just wanted to gather his opinions and reassure myself if I was making the correct decision by asking him if he could go through his benefits. Much to my surprise, he scoffed and made it seem like it was a huge inconvenience to his day and that “since I’m the one carrying the baby, that he has no responsibility to go over the insurance”. I was taken aback. The argument started there and escalated to him yelling in my face and me looking away. I’m still traumatized by that statement and haven’t spoken to him since then. It’s made me reconsider my whole existence and this marriage. If I have a baby with him, am I going to be a single mom to two children?

Tl;dr my newly wed husband has flipped personalities on me and is taking zero accountability in our relationship while I am carrying the entire load of this relationship and navigating marriage alone.

For context, we’ve been together for 5 years.

Edit: we split the bills but I have to manage all the issues and setting up that it comes with.

Update: wow didn’t expect to get so many comments. I’m reading through every single one and processing.. thank you!!

ANSWER: Honey you're already a single mom, you're literally raising an adult male. You've been taking care of all the responsibilities by yourself and now this man is showing you that he doesn't care. 🤔 Did I miss anything else?

QUESTION: I 27 F just broke things off with my 28 M fiancé, did I make the right move?

We’ve been engaged for almost two years. Last night, after I came home from a trip, we got into a pretty big fight, a discussion that we have had multiple times. In the last year and a half, my fiancé has had 10 jobs. He doesn’t stay at them for more than a month and a half. The longest I’ve seen was 10 weeks. He either walks out on them without finding another job to back it up, or he gets fired for various reasons. I’ve needed a lot of help financially and in the last few months, he has not paid his half of rent or utilities. He sometimes pays for groceries, but you can’t live off of pizza rolls and taquitos. He also doesn’t have a car because he’s said that his doctor told his vision is too bad for it and that he was going to go blind in 8 years. This has been a big issue for me because I work all the time practically, 2-3 jobs, to make ends meet. I’m exhausted and ready to pull my hair out because the bills just pile on and Ive expressed to him that I feel like I’ve been taking on everything by myself. Here’s where I’m at a stand point: he’s had a couple of people in his life pass away in the last year, so the grief has been hard for him. I’ve made sure that I’ve been there for him and to remind him that he’s loved. And I’ve always made sure that he had an ear to listen to and support. It’s to the point where sometimes all he does is sit in a dark room and play video games. He sometimes will go a couple of days without eating. I have begged and pleaded with him to go get help, but he refuses every time and says that he’s fine. I had to go visit some family recently, and when I came back from my trip, all of the food in our house was gone, and when I asked if he had eaten, he said, “Not for two days.” This infuriated me. I’m not exactly sure why it did. But I was pissed. We got into a big fight and one thing led to another, I broke things off. He begged and pleaded to stay together, but I just can’t bring myself to say yes. I don’t want us to hurt each other anymore. I want to be there for my fiancé but I’ve hit my breaking point. I feel like the biggest jerk.

UPDATE:
Thank you so much everyone! I’m sorry to a lot of you who I didn’t get a chance to reply to. Your feedback was very needed, I didn’t expect this much of a response lol. 
To answer some questions, before we got engaged, he held it together, a regular job that he had and was taking better care of himself, something I should’ve specified at the beginning, that is my fault. Hence why I came on here to ask because I was second guessing if this was normal with grief and that there was something that I was overlooking or I wasn’t being sensitive to. I have lost people in the past but it’s been years. I’ve been talking to some mutual friends and I guess he had a habit in the past of…over exaggerating his health problems? Something I didn’t clock in on because I never want to invalidate anyones health problems. I put research into some of the things he was saying and…yikes. He is moving out. His family (who lives in another country) found out about his job stuff (I didn’t know that they didn’t know) and were PISSED. I guess they blew up his phone😅. I’m starting therapy again soon, something I couldn’t afford for a long time.

Thank you again everyone, I really appreciate the response. I’m taking some time to reassess my boundaries.

ANSWER: Good decision, cut your losses, don't fall for the sunk cost fallacy. You are young, get rid of this leech, stay strong, he might be a hard habit to break but you absolutely deserve better.

QUESTION: My (F30) mother in law sent my husband (M33) a message saying she is cutting us off. It’s been a few days and she’s now messaged and asked what we want for Christmas.

We have had a good relationship for years but there has been tension recently because my mother in law has meddled in my marriage. My husband made it clear that he and I stand together and have taken a bit of a step back from her. Due to the fact we haven’t messaged as much, my MIL said she is cutting us all off including the children. She said she’ll always love us but that’s as far as it goes. 
Now a few days later, she’s messaging asking what we want for Christmas.
How would you tackle this? It’s just such a ridiculous situation

ANSWER: I would just ignore her.  Ghost and no response.  She wants to be cut off, let her be.  If and when she is willing to start acting like a human, and not some crazy weirdo, maybe she can apologize and earn back the trust she broke.

QUESTION: Expanding my 30f and bf’s 29M sex life

Myself (30 F) and my boyfriend (29 M) have been discussing branching out in our sex life. He had several really good experiences with threesomes in his previous relationship and has expressed a desire to do that with me if I was comfortable. Right now I am not comfortable with that-  but the idea intrigues me. There’s definitely aspects of it that turn me on. 
I thought of the idea of someone giving my bf a blowjob in front of me. That seems hot and i could test the waters to see if that turns me on more. It would be a way to feel it out without intercourse being involved. 
My question is- it seems difficult to find someone to just want to give my bf a blowjob without any sex involved. We talked about getting a sex worker but we both didn’t love that idea if we didn’t need to. 
Any ideas of how to go about this?

ANSWER: So, say you find a person to just give a blowjob. It’s happening, you’re watching. He starts reacting to the blowjob in ways that you’ve rarely seen or heard him that turned on. He cums hard, and is wow’ed by the experience. How do you feel?

Are you going to be envious that another person was better than you? If it’s a woman, will you start comparing yourself to her? If he brings up wanting to do it again, will you wonder you can’t please him?

If you think you’ll be totally secure, go with the sex worker. It will be more of a business arrangement & the chances of it somehow turning into more won’t be there.

QUESTION: Is it weird that my (22F) fiance (24M) won’t let me come to any work events after 4.5 years together?

We have been together for over 4 years. We own a house together, we own a dog and two cats together, we have been engaged for a few months now and plan to get married in April. Anyways, he’s been in the marines for over 3 years now. He has never once let me go to any military event, no balls, no hang outs with his military friends, nothing. I’ve never met them or talked to any of them. They might as well not even know I exist. The next marine ball is next month, and I asked him if he was going to invite me this year since we’re engaged now. He got very defensive and insisted he wanted to be able to party with his marines for the weekend and I was being intrusive. I was hurt by this, and vented to my best friend (23F), at which point she discussed it with her boyfriend, who’s best friends with my fiance.

During this, her boyfriend admitted to me that my fiance had invited HIM to the ball, but he declined because he “knows what he would be doing there and didn’t want to be involved in that”. He said military balls are comprised of three main things: a cake cutting ceremony, getting drunk, and getting laid. This has really concerned me. At this point I wonder if his marine friends even know I exist. I’ve tried bringing this up to my fiance and his response to my long speech was “it’s not that deep”, which made me storm out of the room in frustration. Why do you think he’s doing this, and am I being overdramatic?

ANSWER: As a FORMER Air Force wife the red flags are flagging 🚩🚩🚩😬. We were married for 12 years and I NEVER went to a ball - and in divorce I had over 30 affidavits from women he’d slept with. Save yourself from this trauma. I’d seriously start making an exit plan, even his best freaking friend talked shit About him.

QUESTION: [Update] My (33M) wife (31F) is having an emotional affair. Is divorce the right choice? Ty

I ended up having the confrontation early last week. It wasn’t exactly when I had planned it but she knew something was up as I had emotionally checked out over the few days leading up to it.

Some background info I learned/not provided in the original post. The texting had gone about a week total. It turns out I had discovered it pretty early on. Although they have texted a lot for the last few years (I’ve seen them in the past and there was nothing like this/genuinely just work related stuff). There was also a lot of remarks about the intimacy between us fizzling out indicating that it may be a sign of the affair being physical. Our intimacy has dried out for the last year or so. We had chalked it up to stress, work, hormones, depression up to this point.

In terms of the confrontation, there was no arguing or fireworks. I laid out a lot of grievances about the betrayal and the incredible disrespect I felt. I also pointed out the rage I felt over the hypocrisy of accusing all men of cheating for years. She swore up and down that nothing physical occurred between them. I get it is naive of me to believe it, but for various reasons I do. When I initially threatened to tell the other guys wife, was when the first wave of defensiveness began. She begged me not to “ruin their family with a new baby and focus on fixing our marriage instead.” I was also told how the OBS will definitely tell all their coworkers and “now both her home life and work life will be ruined.” They are both contractually bound to working together for the next 5 years (residency).

Her reasoning was that I have not made her feel desired/like a woman in a long time. That she “gave into hormones” as he was saying things that “made her feel craved.” Multiple times I did feel like the situation was minimized. Statements such as “nothing physical happened it was JUST sexting” have not sat well with me. I also felt like I was being blamed for this. To clarify, we have talked in the past about trying to be more “romantic” and stuff of that sort. I still feel like that does not mean doing this crap is acceptable. I admitted plenty of my shortcomings during the confrontation but also reaffirmed that what she did was so insanely wrong.

I also reached out to the guy. He was clearly panicked and swore up and down nothing physical happened. He begged me not to tell his wife and ruin his life. He claimed his son is “his entire world” which I rebuffed by saying all he did was complain about him to my wife. Not long after he blocked me on everything and was texting my wife to “not let your husband move out” and “is he going to ruin my life now?”

I wish I could say that I took my pets and stormed off and moved out like I dreamt up in my head. Sadly, all I did was move out of our room and demand time and space. She has been saying she will respect that, but has been persistently approaching me asking to talk about our marriage for the last several days.

My emotions have ranged from complete rage to completely dead inside. I have just been right working or in the bed sleeping for 14 hours a day at this point. I know I’m checked out at this point. I’ve been fighting passive suicidal ideation wishing for a car to crash into me or just to not wake up. I can assure all that I have no active plans of self harm and that is not the point of this post. I feel like my entire life has been turned upside down. I recently established with a therapist for the first time in my life (plenty of childhood trauma for terrible parents) and she has been telling me that I am mourning a life I thought I had. Truthfully I am just over all of this and everything. I have definitely just got into self protection mode now.

A few days ago, she asked me if I would be willing to see a marriage counselor with her. I begrudgingly agreed. During our first session, I admitted I am unsure if I want to save this marriage or not. I was not a very active participant as I was quite checked out (it had only been like 3 days since confrontation). We have more appointments coming up. I have told her that I am unsure I will ever get over this betrayal. I have also told her it is clear we have significant incompatibilities. She has been begging me to try as we have been together for so long so clearly “something works about us.” She has been trying to be affectionate the last couple days and getting me to reciprocate (hold her hand, give a kiss, compliment her, etc).

I have not told the other guys wife yet. I have not decided if I will or won’t. Morally I know the absolute correct decision is to tell her. However, as mad as I am at my wife, I am not trying to just ruin her entire life. I am not out to get revenge on people. I grew up with enough confrontation and am definitely a non-confrontational person now. I have also not ruled out telling her yet but am just thinking on it.

I apologize for how much this post is just a rambling mess. All in all, emotionally I feel dead inside. I have lost all joy in my life and am just doing the motions. I do not know if I will be able to get over this to save the marriage and I do not know if I want to save the marriage. Our lives are just so intertwined that splitting will be such a difficult and miserable process. My closest friend is the only person who knows and they have made it clear that divorce would be their only choice if they were in my shoes. I am lucky to have had their support during this but I do feel guilty for just trauma dumping this situation. I know most replies will be that I should have already started the divorce process and I wish it was that easy. I will value advice and I know quite a few people had asked for updates. I definitely missed a lot of info and will try to reply as I can. Thank you.

Edit: for clarification, yes I have a large chunk of these texts documented and saved. I do not know if I will ever get over this. When I told her that I don’t m know if I’ll ever get past this she told me how she knows that I “hold grudges against people” referencing my poor relationship with my parents these days. I definitely feel like there’s been minimizing of the situation but she frames it as “trying to move forward and learn from the situation”

Edit 2: I thought I had linked the original post but it’s not showing up for me so I have attached it below

Edit 3: I also just learned that he texted her last night to complain about some work situation to her. I was told they were completely done speaking to each other but it turns out the only person getting blocked is him blocking me after I confronted him

Edit 4: the sentiment is pretty clear. How intertwined our lives are makes the prospect of splitting that much more miserable. Our families are very close now, we share the same group of friends, work in the same hospital. I think the cowardice of dealing with all that is definitely affecting my thinking

Edit 5: for the people who keep asking, we live in NYS. Also, for the people who are just messaging me super hateful stuff, I would appreciate not getting that crap. I recognize im not thinking straight right now

Update 2

I have received a lot of messages asking about updates. I will like the original post and the first update below. For background we have been together for 13 years and married for 4. No kids

She does seem to be showing true remorse recently. She has been very open about how badly she messed up and destroyed all our trust.  I can’t say whether this remorse has moved me at all. I still feel checked out.

I’ve just been coming home from work and sleeping the rest of the day. She tries to get me to cuddle or hug her but honestly I just feel so empty at this point it’s just going through the motions. I do actually feel bad about how I’ve been but this has just struck me so deeply at this point.

She has broken off all contact (it seems) with the other guy. She’s blocked him on everything and avoids him at work (according to her). I’ve told her that I am always going to have this bit of distrust in the back of my mind now.

We have been continuing therapy but honestly it still feels like it’s her trying to justify the circumstances that led to the affair. We have clearly identified a lot of huge incompatibilities in our relationship. She wants to fight to change and be stronger and I just don’t even respond still.

I feel like this affair validated so many self-doubts. My entire childhood was spent being screamed at about how everything I did was wrong. And not it feels like I’m being told what I did wrong to lead to being cheated on. Sometimes it seems like she understands the gravity and sometimes she’s trying to minimize it so we can “move forward.”

The last few weeks have been awful. I’ve been struggling between being completely numb and seething with self hatred. I have not felt this lonely in my life since I was a kid. I have been confiding with 2 friends, but at this point I feel like it’s just pushing them away so I won’t be anymore. I’m surrounded by a larger group of fair weather friends who can’t be depended on for anything. My family will never understand divorce as in this stupid immigrant culture you tolerate anything to stay married. I just am crumbling from the inside and don’t even feel like I have the strength to make a decision. I go to sleep every night hoping I don’t wake up as I just want out of this now. Swallowing the pill that essentially half my life is being thrown away is unbearable. I recognize how easy it is to say that divorce is the right choice but it doesn’t make it any easier.

Apologies for the rambling

[Update 3?]

I wanted to give an update about this situation. The last month has had me in a very dark place. I have continued to feel like there’s many many moments of minimizing what happened and many moments of true remorse. I became paralyzed by the stress and shut down.

This week I made the decision to move out. I packed the essentials and booked a hotel. (Her parents paid a huge chunk of that house so I’m not asking her to leave). I’ve begun reflecting on everything and I see that our relationship has been trying to get past some horrible incompatibilities. I finally have my answer that divorce is the right option. We are not happy together. She cheated and I’ll never get over that. She is begging not to but I will be telling her that I am done.

And for the APs wife. I will tell her too.

ANSWER: "Please don't ruin our lives," say the people whose actions are the sole reason why their lives would be ruined.

You have said yourself that you don't know if you'll ever be able to get over this betrayal. Is it still raw? Sure- but if anything, I think that's more of a push for you to at least have a trial separation from her.

I agree that it sounds more like you're mourning the life you thought you had than your actual relationship. At this point, don't keep going through the motions just to make HER happy. She sure as hell didn't care about your feelings when she started this whole mess.

And forget their begging and guilt-tripping. They made their bed, they can lie in it. The OBS also deserves to know. Who says the guy doesn't/didn't have other 'relationships' that would put the health of both her and her baby in danger?

QUESTION: (29M) My gf (25F) hooked up with someone 3 hours after our first date

Hey guys I’m just looking for some advice on how to proceed and approaches you’d take. Title says it all but I found out that she texted some guy she’d been hooking up with 20 minutes after we’d left each other to go meet up/fuck. I confronted her about it and she initially tried lying but the messages were pretty explicit and she eventually admitted/apologized. I know we weren’t “exclusive” but it really feels like I was the second choice and if the hook up would’ve committed to her then she’d choose to be with him. We’ve been together for 4 months now and I really want to move past this but I think with this hanging over the relationship is going to create a lot of issues moving forward. I don’t know if I can trust, especially when their first instinct is to lie and cover up. Does anyone have any similar experiences or advice for me please?

Update for anyone interested: I broke things off, thank you all for weighing in. Definitely agree it’s too early to be dealing with this shit and no trust from the very first day isn’t what I’m going for. Appreciate and love you all.

ANSWER: Tbh you most likely won't be able to come back from this, its one of those sure no one really did "cheat" but feelings do not tend to care about technicality like that.

QUESTION: I’m (29F) no longer excited about marrying my boyfriend (29M) after asking for a year?

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 10 years, and over the past year we’ve had a lot of disagreements about marriage. These last three months I’ve dropped it and haven’t even mentioned it once. The big thing was He told me he wouldn’t get married until his debt (student loans and car) was paid off, which wouldn’t be until we were 35. We’re 29 now. I told him I didn’t want to wait that long and that I wasn’t sure I could keep dating him if our timelines were that different.

Recently, he suddenly said he’s ready to get engaged. It completely shocked me, and I didn’t react very excited. He noticed and said he didn’t understand why I wasn’t happy, and that I put pressure on him and now im not satisfied.

I really love this person, but we disagreed about this for so long that now I don’t even know how to feel. I just thought if I was ever to get married it would be exciting and now I just feel sad? I never thought I would have to beg someone to marry me and I feel rejected because we argued about it for so long. I think I understand him saying that he’s giving me what I want and I’m still not happy so I’m confused on why I’m also not happy.

How would you feel if your partner didn’t want to get married and then suddenly agreed?

ANSWER: I wouldn't marry someone that I had to pressure into marrying me. Hard stop. Also him saying "I'm giving you what you want" is a MASSIVE red flag. He should also want to marry you. It should be mutual.

QUESTION: I’m so tired of my mom (50F)?forcing “equality” between me (22F) and my sister (20F)

I’m honestly exhausted by how my mom insists on this “forced equality” thing between me and my sister. Why can’t I just have my own identity, my own things, without my mom making sure my sister gets the exact same stuff too?

I sell preloved items online including some of my mom’s stuff. I’m the one putting in the effort: listing, packing, paying for shipping, and going to the post office. Yet when I make money, my mom says I have to split it evenly with my sister. Like… why? She doesn’t help at all. At least let it be 70-30 if she’s not contributing. Plus, I give her 100% for her stuff.

It’s the same story with education. I got into a top college, and my sister didn’t. My mom went through insane lengths to get her into the same faculty and field as me, even though my sister wanted to study something else. Now we have different class schedules but share one car, so one of us has to wait around campus for hours every day. It’s absurd.

Even when we were kids, my mom made sure that whenever it was one of our birthdays, both of us got gifts “to be fair.” It’s always been like that.

I know wanting fairness between kids is normal, but this feels excessive. I just wish I had something that was mine for once, something not automatically shared or mirrored. I tried talking to my sister about it but is my mom’s number 1 fan.

ANSWER: Is your mom working out some issues from her own childhood? Maybe she had a sibling who was the "favourite" and she always felt left out?

How does your sister feel about this - is there any chance you guys could work together as a united front to push back on this weirdness?

QUESTION: [Update] Is it fair or me 27F to tell my husband 34M that he can't move with us if he isn't employed

I wasn't honest in my first post. Just like I lm not honest and lie to most people in my life right now. I guess it is the unbelievable amount of shame I carry.

It is true that my husband was fired in January. The real reason is bc he had a workplace injury the previous summer. He completely tore up his knee. Had major surgery. Rehab. The company was extremely helpful in his recovery.

Then his prescriptions ran out. Found out later he started buying pain pills off the streets. Which, ya, isn't oxy-whatever. It's basically just fentanyl these days.

So as a consequence of a ramping up addiction he could no longer hide, I had kicked him out. Then he got fired. He went through periods of in patient and out patient and AA and therapy and suboxone (maybe) and drugs for depression and drugs for anxiety and everything else we could think of, and all the while we were living separate lives because he was a danger to children.

Why am I still so attached? How the fuck was any of us supposed to forsee this happening. You fall deeply in love. You get the ring and the kids. Life is going pretty good, always with its challenges but that is just like life. It is fucking hard.

I'm not even sure what the point of my post was. It didn't really make much sense because yeah he is an able person, why can't he just get a job, come on dude. Or be a stay at home dad. Yall… i would have loved to give him that privilege. If only. But people with substance issues can't really keep a job. Definitely cant be around kids.

A lot of people read my post. Took time out of their day. Most of it was just criticizing us but i mean that is what everyone does to everybody most of the time in real life too. Still, I have been feeling some type of way about it all being based on a lie.

I want a life with him. He does love his kids. This isn't how it was supposed to go.

Then to top it all off, he has, because of his addiction issues, caught slick 5 charges in the last 5 or so months. Been wrecking cars first his then whatever family was stupid enough to allow him to drive them. Legally isn't allowed to drive. After I posted this he got arrested for driving without a license.

I already wasn't sure how in the fucking world I could salvage our relationship. Love was the only thing keeping me from cutting him off completely.

His family and I are going to push for him remaining in jail/then prison and hopefully get him placed in hopefully a more substance recovery based program, but yall know how fucked the US prison systems are. Most likely he will be general population, get even worse mentally, and God forbid it but may eventually be saying final goodbyes. My priority at this point has passed protecting him and moved on to protecting the general public from him.

For now, at least he is safe? If you consider jail/prison safe. Which i sure as shit don't but at least he won't OD. Right?? Repeat to myself, it is out of my hands. Just like this whole experience has been.

Fuck yall i don't even know anymore. My family says they are proud of me for holding it together. I'm sure they are disappointed in a lot of things ive done, not just keeping the door open this long. Ive been so dumb throughout my 20s. I know I can do better in my decision making.

Most of all, I want stability for my children. I've decided that I will be serving him with divorce papers once he gets officially sentenced. It is just a damn shame. I loved the person he was before all this chaos so much yall don't even know. Him holding our two little twins in the hospital? The dad who cried when I gave him a card saying ‘Baby A loves you and will see you soon daddy’ (this was after something like after my 20 month scan i cant specifically remember now)… then I  handed him a second card that said ‘Baby B loves you too and can't wait to meet you as well.’

I cry every time I think about that. I'm crying right now.

How do I accept that I can't have that life with him? I just don't know. I'm just so heartbroken.

In short, yeah, we will be moving into the apartment without him. We will be moving on completely in life without him.

Maybe one day he can join us again and we will have more special and meaningful days. Maybe not. It's out of my hands.

I appreciate yall. Yall can tear me up for all this. That's perfectly fine. I deserve it too I'm not a saint. I've said horrible things to him throughout this time. I have been so angry and resentful from how this past year and a half has played out.

But I'm ready to finally move on.

I'm just gonna leave this here and probably not return to this account. For those of you out there that are dealing with anything like I have, I'm so fucking sorry. It destroys not just the addicts life, but anyone who cares about them. As long as you care about them. And it isn't ever, ever easy to say goodbye to someone you love. Not in normal circumstances, or the extreme. Just know that you are not alone. I tried al anon but wasn't able to establish a community. There are resources and genuinely caring people and support out there if you need that.

Take care yall.

ANSWER: Thats a heavy and heartbreaking story! You are very strong! Also, suffering such an injury must be a heavy hit, we are all just people. I wish you all the best, even in those dark times when light is scarce! Be here for your kids and yourself, don't hesitate to ask for help whoever you can - you don't have to face this alone! Find therapy if you can. And if you still have energy, be here for your husband if you want to - as a person that worked with addict - having family that cares about you is an absolute game changer for such a person. But again, put yourself first.

QUESTION: The Worst Thing My Wife (24F) Could Have Ever Done To Me (26M)

There's a lot to explain but a quick backstory, my wife and I have been together since high school. Her Dad was never in her life but she's had a very supportive Mom. After high school we went to different colleges and while I was away at college, my wife had reconnected with her father. She was excited to find out more about him since he wasn't around while she was growing up, and I was excited for her to be able to get to know him.

Just before I finished school her father took a job several states away and she hasn't been able to see him since. They've kept in touch through email and sporadic phone calls to keep each other updated, but I've never met or spoken to him. After I finished my degree we moved in together and tied the knot. We had a beautiful wedding surrounded by friends and family, but her father wasn't invited because my wife hadn't told her mother that she reconnected with her father. I felt that it was wrong to keep it a secret, but I didn't say anything because that was her truth to tell and it was my place to say anything.

We've been married for 2 years now, and a month ago I couldn't imagine a life without her. Now I'm not sure if I can ever look at my wife again. (end of back story)

A couple months ago my wife announced that her Dad was coming for a visit, and possibly moving to be closer to her. She was ecstatic and her smile has always been the highlight of my day, so we were both happy to hear the news. We talked about the possibility of having him moving in with us short term until he could find a place of his own. And to give her credit in the situation, she seemed as if she was more concerned with how I felt and she wanted to make sure I would be okay with it. I told her that would be fine with me and I absolutely supported her reconnecting with her Dad, but I also said it would be hard to know for sure because I've never met him and don't know much about him. This was all pre-emptive conversation to see how we both felt about the situation and her Dad moving closer to us wasn't a certainty yet, but it felt like we were on the same page.

Well last month her Dad got into town and we took him out to dinner at a local Italian restaurant. Once we got to the restaurant she suddenly became distant and I immediately felt like something was off.  When she saw her dad she immediately ran up and jumped in his arms, except when she did this she wrapped her legs around him mid air and he proceeded to walk inside holding her like a child. This was completely out of character for her, and I had no idea how to even react to my 24 year old wife being carried into a restaurant like a 6 year old child. After that moment I felt like the third wheel for the entire evening. She never introduced me to him, which I thought was odd. When I introduced myself I don't think he ever even looked at me. Every time I tried to join the conversation, it's like I wasn't there. And my wife who doesn't normally drink was suddenly having several glasses of wine.

I was trying best to not overreact because this was her dad that she didn't get to know growing up, and she hasn't been able to see him in a couple of years. But it didn't feel like we were at a family dinner, it felt like I was watching my wife while she was on a date with an older man. They were whispering to each other, holding hands, telling stories and laughing. The entire night felt inappropriate and maybe I was misreading the entire situation, but I just couldn't wait to leave. I figured we would talk about everything when we got home, but while walking to the car my wife yelled out, "Just follow us!"

To my surprise and without conversation she had apparently decided that her dad would be staying at our house after all. When I said we hadn't talked about him staying there, she blew up and yelled that we definitely talked about it and agreed that he should. I was shocked because she has never yelled at me before. I tried to remind her that I also said it would be hard to know for sure if I was comfortable with him staying with us because I've never met him and don't know much about him. To that she responded, "now you've met him, so it's fine!"

We didn't talk the rest of the way home and as soon as we got there it was just a continuation of our night at the restaurant, except somehow worse. They decided to continue drinking and opened another bottle of wine. Her "Father" was now being slightly flirtatious and kind of handsy which was making me nauseous. At this point it felt like an episode of Black Mirror and I had enough, I decided I was leaving and would stay at a hotel. Without saying a word I packed a bag. When I walked through the living room towards the door my wife freaked out asking where I was going and why. That's when everything that I had bottled up from the entire evening came spilling out.

I told her how I felt they had been inappropriate all night, how overwhelmingly uncomfortable I had been, and how for the first time since we met I don't recognize her. She started telling me that I was being ridiculous and that I was overreacting. She said that I needed to "loosen up". While yelling back and forth I told her that I wasn't interested in being around her or her father if that's how they insisted on acting. After several minutes of us yelling back and forth her dad blurted out, "Just tell him!"

Both of us starred at each other and I was stunned by what that could have meant. That's when she began confessing to me that this man was not her real dad... I was shocked, and speechless, and somewhat relieved, and extremely confused. My heart was in my throat and a cold sweat engulfed me.

She continued telling me that while I was away at college, she had met Don (fake name) at a party and they were seeing each other off and on. And while cheating on me she had developed a kink for role play and would pretend that Don was her father when they slept together. She told me that Don did take a job in another state and that she had kept in touch with him, all this time telling me that he was her father. When he told her that he was moving back she had hoped that he would be able to move in with us. Permanently.

Suddenly a lot of things started making sense, things I hadn't questioned. The reason he wasn't at our wedding, the reason she never told her mother, the reason I hadn't met him or talked to him until now. I took the man that slept with my wife to dinner, then paid for it.

I didn't say anything to her. I just walked out, threw up in the yard, and left. I've been staying at a hotel for a month now just trying to process the entire situation. I haven't told my family anything, I haven't talked to coworkers, I just feel like I'm in survival mode. She's tried calling several times and she's left voice messages to come home to "them" and that we can work things out together.

I've always tried to be rational and logical, but I have no idea what to do.

Do I get divorced? Well.. Obviously I have to get divorced. But how do I explain any of this to friends or family? Would it be easier to just change my name and disappear? Do I leave the country? If I do start over how could I ever trust anyone again when I've spent a third of my life getting to know someone, and it turns out I never actually knew them?

ANSWER: This must be fake, but if not, tell her family and your family the truth.  Get a lawyer and file for divorce.  Have all communication go through the lawyer and never talk to her again.  When everything is done, move to be close to just your family and friends and cut her and everything about her out of your life.

QUESTION: My (33F) husband (33M) nit picks and over reacts about everything and I am considering leaving him

My husband goes through phases where he seems to be angry or annoyed at me and nit picks the smallest things. We’ve been together 12 years.

Tonight, it was because I had left dishes in the sink and some used food packages when serving dinner (I was going to clean up after dinner!). I always clean up after dinner, tonight I had our toddler attached to me but still managed to make a really nice meal and simply didn’t have time to clean up/put dishes in the dishwasher before eating. I got upset and said he was being unreasonable but he said I ‘always do this’ and I shouldn’t be leaving a mess. I feel he should have been grateful for the food- he was more angry about ‘having to clean up’ (and made a point of doing so before dinner) than the fact I cooked dinner.

Some previous other examples include being extremely annoyed I took ‘too long’ to breastfeed our newborn, complaining and being miserable on our overseas holiday as he didn’t know it would be different to travel with children, making me feel bad for working on a weekend to make extra money for our family, being annoyed over little things to the point of not talking to me for a few days.

He is the breadwinner however I still work 3 x a week. I would also say I manage most of the household- doing the clothes washing, cleaning, groceries, meal planning, cooking, organising all childcare, all holiday celebrations and gifts for his family. There are many, many things I could nit pick too but I don’t.

After our overseas holiday where he was just awful, I did talk to him and said I was considering wanting to separate as I was not happy with how things were. He agreed he was a little depressed and he would change things. However, tonight I feel things have gone back to his moodiness/unreasonable behaviour. I wasn’t brought up to be treated like this and I’m beginning to think I would be happier being alone. It would be hard as we have a child.

I don’t know if it’s unreasonable to want to leave someone like this?

ANSWER: He complained you took to long to breastfeed ?! Wtf is wrong with the guy. The rest is just as bad. OP, you know this isn’t right and goes way beyond ‘nitpicking’. I’m sure he has good sides too, but literally nothing can make up for being this awful to you.

QUESTION: My (30F) older half sister (36F) has stopped speaking to me after I got married to my husband (32M)

My (30) older half sister (36) has slowly been cutting contact with me since I got married to my husband (32). Please be kind because I really don’t know how to handle this situation.

For background, I have had a really close relationship with my older half sister since I was around 12. I am no contact with my mother (we do not have the same mom) due to her complicity of physical abuse from my stepdad and my older half sister really stepped up to fill a role I needed in my life. She has been there for me for relationship advice, career advice, and always as someone to talk to. We share another half sister (all the same dad, different moms) and had a group chat where we all would talk daily. I got married in May and we haven’t spoken since the first day of my honeymoon. I really miss it and I don’t even understand what went so wrong.

Before you think this may have to do with the person I married - she never said anything negative about him nor did she ever even attempt to dissuade me from getting married. In fact, it was quite the opposite, she would reaffirm that she believed we were truly in love and a great couple. I would have no reason to think she was upset about the union itself.

On my wedding night, no one in either of our families or the wedding coordinator I hired got our gifts and they were later stolen along with an envelope with a large sum of cash. This highly upset me. 3 days after the wedding, when I realized no one got the gifts, I immediately asked my family in a group chat what they knew. I mostly received half hearted responses and this frustrated me even more. I then texted my older sister and expressed my frustration at the lack of urgency because my husband and I hadn’t received much, and what we did was stolen. It felt violating. She immediately responded blaming my husband and I’s friends in the wedding party saying that they had already stolen “an extreme amount of items” so we should ask them and not the family.

This response took me aback, because no one had even alluded to this to either my husband or I. For context, this was a backyard wedding and we got ready in homes my family lives in on the property. None of my siblings live there, only my dad and grandfather in separate houses. My husband and I had both mentioned during the wedding that the amount of caters and vendors going in and out of the home without any supervision was concerning and someone should probably supervise at least. I tried to explain this to her and said I felt my perspective was more likely, given that my husband and I witnessed the vendors having direct access and going into the room where items (not my gifts) were supposedly stolen.

She immediately dismissed this thought and asked if I thought her child (my nephew and ring bearer in the wedding) was a liar. Again, this took me aback because she never even mentioned that he witnessed this and just opened with your friends are thieves so start there. I responded no? You never said he witnessed that until just now so how would I have known? She then said that multiple other children confirmed this and then a few text messages layered said she herself witnessed it. She kept insisting my husband and I “have no real friends” and saying some really mean and hurtful things about their character, who mind you, she met the majority of that weekend. We both went to college out of state and most of the wedding party were college friends who have never

Her thought process just seemed very odd and not like the person I’ve known… I again expressed my frustration with her disparaging remarks about people she barely knew for a few hours, because apparently over 15 people that she’s never had contact with before are all “evil to the core” - and apparently all 15 stole gifts - one being larger than a suitcase itself - to get on flights the next day. The fees they would have had to pay in extra baggage would have been a greater value than just buying the items outright. She insisted that one of my bridesmaids was a cheater saying she slept with the best man (both are married) and kept repeating “ask that skank liar, thief, and whore and I bet she knows exactly where it all went”

These responses honestly astounded me because I have NEVER heard her speak so aggressively towards me in over 17 years of an extremely close relationship. I just kept expressing disbelief asking what she was talking about, and then she told me to “stop blaming family and blame both of your terrible friends.” I said no I just believe it was a vendor, I don’t think anyone in the family stole from me! And she went back into another rant about the above bridesmaid in particular.

At this point, I am visibly upset, crying, shaking because I don’t even understand where this is coming from. This was also as we are attempting to leave on our honeymoon. My husband has now noticed how upset I am and asks what’s wrong. My older half sister then calls me and continues her rant about how it was our friends and we need to confront them and “not blame our brother.”

Our brother (her full sibling, my half sibling) was a drug addict over 10 years ago. He has since gotten clean, married, and had two children. There was a point in his life that he may have done something like that, but I had NEVER up until that point said that he did it nor did I believe that he did. I still don’t think he did, I think. Things got so odd it makes me question everything. I’d like to believe he put that chapter of his life to bed many years ago as he really takes the role of a father and stepfather seriously because he’s never even hinted towards going back that way at all in the last decade.

At this point I start screaming I never said that to her on the phone. I’m pretty sure I started having a panic attack because my husband then took the phone out of my hands and began talking to her on speaker in front of me. She then starts screaming that we both need to stop blaming Alan when neither one of us even said that a single time. My husband was perplexed and asked what are you talking about? She then went straight into telling him how all of his friends are thieves and we are both bad judges of character from the people we assigned to the wedding party. He took this pretty seriously and defended his groomsmen’s character. Because despite saying there were “many witnesses”, when he pressed her he never got an account of what, when, or how things were stolen.

She then said f this, I’m getting my husband who she screamed at and said they’re blaming Alan for stealing. Her husband answers the phone with “why are you all blaming Alan for stealing?” My husband then laughs in disbelief and reiterates again, that neither of us said that nor do we think that. Her husband then states that’s not what she told him, and my husband says I don’t know why she thinks that, but we did not say that. They had a pretty civil discussion and I went on my honeymoon thinking she would reach out afterwards, hopefully to apologize for the misunderstanding. That didn’t happen.

In fact, she has now unfollowed me on all social media platforms, removed any photos of me, untagged herself from my photos, and I’m not sure how but our sister group chat is gone. I don’t know if she blocked my number or what, but it’s as if I was removed from a 3 person chat because one day it disappeared from my pinned messages. I searched and could not find it. I never delete messages so I didn’t do that. She also stopped sharing her location with me.

She has also spread the narrative that I’ve blamed our brother for this as one day our grandmother called me to ask why I thought he stole from my wedding. I have maintained that I never once said that, I believe it was someone working for a vendor as there were many of them with direct access.

From everything I’ve been able to confirm through cell phone photos and videos from that night, accounts from our photographer/videographer husband and wife duo and their 2nd shooters (we have worked with them for years and I doubt they would risk taking their reputation for a large towel warmer) none of what my older sister alleged has been confirmed.

What is weird to me is my dad has outdoor cameras. I’ve repeatedly asked for the footage from that night/next morning and every time he says he’ll get it to me, he doesn’t. I worry it’s not even available now. I’ve asked over 5 times and I’ve kinda given up.

I don’t even really know what to do. I don’t know what happened but now I question if my brother really did steal it. I really don’t want to believe that’s true, it’s just everyone in my family’s reactions felt out of character. I still haven’t spoken to her to this day. Both of her children, my nephews, have had birthdays since then and my birthday wishes sent directly to their phone numbers went unanswered for the first time ever.

I worry she is going no contact with me but I don’t even understand why in the first place. I also don’t feel in my heart like I should reach out to apologize first, because all I did was try to have a wedding day with the person I love and our closest family and friends. I never did the things she accused me of and even if she truly believes our friends are that bad - my husband and I go years without seeing them because of the distance. They don’t have the proximity to affect her directly so it isn’t like she has to be around them past that day.

It’s hard for me to understand her perspective because even if I thought our younger sister had the worst friends, I can’t imagine cutting her off in this way to drive her into those friendships even more. I love her and her family, especially my nephews, and I’m genuinely scared we may never speak again now that it’s going on over 6 months.

ANSWER: The more your sister protests and tries to divert your attention elsewhere, the more guilty she sounds. Your dad refuses to give you video footage so I'm guessing he knows what really happened as well.

QUESTION: My (43M) MIL was confronted after my SIL (45F) found recorded calls where MIL privately vented about her. BIL (45M) says recording was a bug. How can I support MIL?

I’m a 43M visiting my wife’s (43F) family in India. We normally live in Europe. Her brother (45M) and his wife live here with their mother, my MIL, who is a widow and financially dependent on them.

A few days ago, my SIL claimed she discovered five recorded phone calls on a phone she had borrowed from my MIL for several days. These recordings were private conversations between MIL and her daughter (my wife’s sister), where they were venting about SIL over a pair of earrings.

My SIL played all five recordings to my BIL. He confronted MIL, shamed her, and MIL cried. She couldn’t deny anything – her voice was clear. She was completely humiliated and powerless.

When asked how the calls were recorded, BIL said it was a “bug” on the phone and refused to elaborate. I later looked it up and learned accidental call recording is technically possible, but it seems unlikely for five separate calls, all with the same person, to be recorded purely by mistake.

The calls themselves were about SIL asking MIL to give her one of her few nice sets of jewelry. MIL only has two left, while SIL has many. MIL didn’t want to give them up, vented privately to her daughter about it, and eventually gave SIL the earrings anyway. In the calls, MIL and the daughter used the word “khutti,” which I understand is an insult MIL freely uses about other family members as well, even to their faces. It sounded to me like ordinary venting.

MIL lives in her son’s home, with no income or real privacy. She speaks openly about other relatives, but apparently she cannot say a single critical thing about her daughter-in-law without consequences. My wife doesn’t believe the “bug” explanation either, but her brother insisted that this entire matter stay private, including not telling me. She eventually told me anyway, but she is hesitant to push back because she doesn’t want to upset the family.

I know I’m treated with respect here as the son-in-law, and I appreciate their hospitality. But I also know that my opinions don’t carry much weight because I’m an outsider to the culture and not seen as someone who should comment on internal family matters. I genuinely don’t want to insult anyone or misread cultural norms. At the same time, this situation makes me uncomfortable. From my perspective, MIL seems socially, financially, and emotionally cornered. The recording incident felt calculated, and the secrecy around it adds to my confusion.

How can my wife and I support my MIL in this situation without jeopardising her position in the household?

ANSWER: Sounds like your BIL and SIL were recording intentionally. I don’t know for what reason. Feels malicious to also gang up on your MIL.

At the same time, you also don’t know how your MIL behave when around these family - for them to react in such a way. Seems like you don’t have a lot of information and no insight on the dynamics of the family. Which is something I would try prioritise finding out.

I’m not sure how you can support your MIL other than taking her out of your BIL’s place - considering the whole toxic ganging up thing is happening. I would probably set aside some money for your MIL in case anything goes sideway. And also to tell your MIL to not bite the hand that feeds her.

QUESTION: Is it unfair for me (30F) to charge my boyfriend (30M) £800pm rent?

I (30F) have recently bought a two bedroom two bathroom flat in zone two (which is pretty close to zone one) in London. I bought solo as my partner (30M) and I have not been together long enough to commit to this together and I have been saving for this solo for a long time.

We are due to move in soon and we have been having discussions about what is fair and what costs we should be responsible for. He’s mentioned he wouldn’t feel comfortable putting money towards the mortgage as he doesn’t gain any equity and I think that this was a fair call out.

I have been doing research across different sites, including Reddit about what other partners have done and what feels equal. I suggested he covers all bills (less than £650) and my groceries which should come to 750-800 a month. He believes this is too much. And he was expecting to pay less.

My portion a month would be covering 70% of the costs so I don’t see this as unfair. And given the size and location of the flat, I think this is a steal. And allows him to save considering it’s much cheaper for him than our current rental.

I would also like to add that we’ve had a bit of a rough year in our relationship so I don’t know if that is clouding my thinking right now. Which is why I’ve come here to see if I’m being reasonable or unfair.

ANSWER: Based on OP’s previous post about this boyfriend, it sounds to me like he’s entitled and self-centered.

Per that post, he realized he fucked up and has a habit of saying shitty things (after she felt broken hearted in response to his unsolicited criticisms of her boobs).

Look, this man has the right to a glorious home in a fabulous location at negligible cost to himself. He is equally entitled to boobs greater than or equal to a D. Why shouldn’t he speak his mind? He has a right to voice his opinions!

What do you mean, OP would be negatively impacted by these dynamics? What’s that got to do with anything? /s

QUESTION: Update: My(32F) MIL(68F) is acting like a manipulative victim now that I’m pregnant. Previously we were close.

Here is my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/1xLzc51VPi

It has been about 3 weeks since my original post.

Since then, my husband cut my mom a check for MIL’s formerly promised portion of my baby shower.

Her bowing out of paying after insisting upon doing so (without being asked) has been gnawing at my husband, and he finally got the courage to ask his mom why she never let him know. In the gentlest way possible he said we didn’t need the money but she made such a big show of wanting to pay for half after seeing the total cost - if something came up and she couldn’t honor her promise he has 0 issue with that, but why not tell us directly? Well, she lied and said she never said that to my mom. She claims she told my mom she was capping it at a certain dollar amount, but never bowed out.

My husband and I discussed their conversation and thankfully he understood my mom would never lie about something like this, and his mom was lying again. My mom swore on my deceased grandmothers life she never mentioned any sort of cap. It’s worth noting I had to pull the info out of my mom in the first place that MIL wasn’t contributing anymore, she did NOT want to tell us. My husband and I came to the conclusion his mother most likely wanted to get my mom and me nervous, feel like we really needed her contribution, and then she was probably going to try to swoop in last minute and “save the day” with her portion. Based on his convo with MIL, we knew she was already brewing some show up to try to get back in the fold and make the payment. We decided to lie to MIL and tell her one of my other relatives stepped in and paid the remainder, but thank you so much for the generous offer.

Needless to say, she called my husband sobbing saying she knows we paid for it and not a relative. He thinks he lied to her well enough that she now believes it’s a relative, but was losing her shit over this. She called my mom extremely angry, gaslighting her saying “WHY DONT YOU REMEMBER OUR CONVERSATION WHERE I SAID I WAS CAPPING AN AMOUNT” my mom just killed her with kindness and said I’m so sorry for the misunderstanding even though it never ever happened.

MIL mentioned to my husband that her feelings were hurt she was paying for half but I never invited her to see the venue. 1- we saw the venue prior to her offering to pay anything. Am I allowed to do nothing with just my mom? 2- turns out, my mom DID invite her!! So the lies continue.

I know this seems minuscule compared to some monster in laws mentioned  on this sub, but I am so so so upset by all of this. I feel in my bones she has been trying to set me up to victimize herself to my husband, and thank god he’s not falling for it. I do not plan on attending her thanksgiving dinner, and I also will never have a conversation with her that’s not either in front of my husband or in writing via text. I thought her and I were insanely close before, and this is so jarring to me. Ever since I announced my pregnancy, she paints me as an angry woman she tip toes around. She has made everything about herself. She finds fault in everything I do, and feels comfortable mentioning it to my husband.

She has made small comments to him like will DIL let me babysit - she just doesn’t want me around - she is excluding me from her pregnancy. None of these things were true until she did all this and I caught wind of her making those comments! And what on earth does it mean to exclude someone from their pregnancy?! She was apart of the baby shower planning committee, which she sabotaged. Every single ultrasound I’ve had she’s received a photo and an update. How else would I be expected to include her?! I truly hate her now. I will never get over how much she’s slighted me and made this about her. I don’t know how to move going forward, my feelings are probably palpable, and so far I have completely avoided her but will have to face her soon. I hate how rude she’s been to my mother, how manipulative she’s been to my husband, and how she’s tried to make my pregnancy about her and her perceived slights.

Any advice is welcome. Thanks.

ANSWER: Any MIL shennigans needs to go through your husband. Do not answer any call or text. I mean it. My sister is pregnant with her first right now (coming in a month alrrady!!) and i sometimes lie awake at night because i'm afraid of some stressful situations she could have that would put her at risk.

Pregnancy is a natural thing. But that doesn't mean it always goes smoothly. You need to prioritize your health. You are what matters the most right now, because you matter for 2. Stress like this can lead to physical or psychological conditions linked to pregnancy and none of them are good. So stop entertaining that Attention-seeking monster and take a step back. Your husband will handle her.

On another note, it kinda makes me think there's something medically wrong with your MIL. Like maybe she stopped her meds for Bipolar, or she has a brain tumor. My grandma acted this way when she had her tumor. It was ginormous, yet benign, fortunately. But whatever the cause, this is not your problem to deal with

QUESTION: he (m32) does not want to marry, I (f32) don’t want to leave him- how can I come to terms with this?

We have been together 9 years and I love him completely and have no wish to split up. The way I see it if I leave him then sure, I might get married but I wouldn’t be with him so what’s the point? If I stay then I’ll never be married but at-least we will be together. 
Reason I want marriage - being chosen publicly, the security of marriage, knowing that he is sure and certain about me.
I feel ridiculous calling him my boyfriend and I hate the term “partner”. Partner in what? Law? Crime?

He is against it due to the risk of divorce and its financial repercussions.
This hurts as I believe I have proven myself worth the risk, we have been together almost a decade and - of corse had our ups and downs but in general are a good couple and care and respect for each other. we have separate finances (I’ve never asked him for money) and I am more than happy to sign prenups (which are binding in the country we live in)

He suggested talking it all over with a lawyer so he could be certain he would be safe (and advised that this wasn’t him saying yes to anything)
At that point I said, no thanks. Felt like I was twisting his arm. The bride wore a cattle prod.

Has anyone been in the same situation? How did you learn to live with this? I do NOT want to split up with him, he is a wonderful man and I adore him. 
It’s just painful to see so many couples around me happily, eagerly and (seemingly) effortlessly choosing one another and taking that risk yet my partner (ugh) can’t seem to see my worth or the point in a legal union

ANSWER: Repeat this to yourself every hour until it clicks:
« he is willing to lose me, but I am not willing to lose him »

Say that over and over. How does it feel in that perspective?

QUESTION: Is my (30F) partner (45m) trying to sabotage my job?

I recently had a baby and returned from maternity leave. I have 2u2 and got a new job working part time remotely for really good money ($90/hour, 25 hours per week 12-5pm) basically my dream job.

We took our kids out of daycare because we both work remotely and could flex our schedules around caring for them while spending time with them and saving money.

Partner just started Paternity leave today and it was the first time I asked him to watch the kids, just for a few hours so I could focus on meetings. He seemed OK with this in the morning.

He left to do some work for his business around 9:30 am. He knew my meeting started at 2pm.

At 1:15 i called him to see if he was on his way back and he questioned why I hadn't called him yet (I was busy with a million things). This made me think he stayed out all morning to make me upset (because he'd expected me to call asking where he was).

He then went on a rant about how he 'cant do this every day' because he has things to do and watching them would impact this.

Admittedly I got upset because I do 90% of the child care (his mom is helping for now but is leaving soon). I told him I just needed 2 hours and that's not a lot to ask. He got angry and threatened to turn around and not come home to watch them. I told him that sounds like he wants to sabotage my job and he hung up on me after screaming at me.

He did end up coming home and I was angry so I gave him an attitude and told him if its so hard for him I'll just take my children and do my meeting I don't need him.

He then threatened to kick me out of the house snd turn off the wifi for disrespecting him.

He then went to sleep and had his mother watch the kids anyway while I did my calls. Even though he apparently had so much important work to do which is what started the whole argument in the first place.

He always says my job contributes nothing to the household and I should just be watching the kids not working. I may be paranoid but I offer to pay bills toward the house and he refuses. I think he just doesnt want me to have my own money with how critical he is of me working.

Am I asking too much?
Does it sound like he wants to sabotage my job?
Am I being ungrateful by giving him an attitude even though he doesn't make me pay bills except my own.

I just felt so much anger and resentment because I don't go off and nap whenever I want like he does. He NEVER wants to give me time to do my work like I do for him

I clean and cook take care of 2 babies and I end up being the one constantly criticized.

On top of that he was talking about how he wants another kid but literally cant handle caring for the ones we have on his own.

ANSWER: Yes he's absolutely trying to sabotage you. I see a lot of red flags and abuse tactics here. You need to plan your exit strat ASAP.

QUESTION: My boyfriend (35M) and I (35F) have been together for 5 years. My parents finally accepted him after initially disapproving, but now he’s putting conditions on them and I feel he’s trying to assert control. How can I decide whether to move forward or end things?

I (35F) have been with my boyfriend (35M) for 5 years. When we first started dating, my parents were upset that I chose love outside of an arranged marriage. Because of that, they didn’t speak to him for a long time.

Eventually, my parents softened and decided to accept our relationship. They’ve even encouraged us to get married. About a year ago, they gave us their blessing, but my boyfriend refused to go ahead at that time. He said he wasn’t comfortable because my parents hadn’t spoken directly to him yet.

I told him I understood and that if this situation didn’t align with what he wanted for his life, we could go our separate ways. Instead of having a calm conversation, he yelled at me several times but never actually ended things. Since then, every conversation about marriage turns into a major argument.

The most recent fight was terrible. He involved his mother, and I felt completely ganged up on. His mother (who is separated from his father) plans to live with us after marriage. Being shouted at by both of them made me feel unsafe and emotionally overwhelmed.

Recently, he has also started adding conditions that my parents must follow before he agrees to marriage. It feels less like he wants to build a partnership and more like he’s trying to assert control or dominance. I still love him, but I feel drained, confused, and unsure whether this relationship can ever be healthy.

What I need advice on:
How do I figure out whether this is something we can work through, or if these are major red flags that mean I should leave? How can I tell the difference between someone setting healthy boundaries versus trying to control a situation?

Edit : There seems to be a misunderstanding. I have been in a relationship with for 5 years but my parents have only known about this for a year. My father did speak to him when he came home ( my mother did not). My entire family extended family has been very nice to him and have invited him to all family events. But he isn’t satisfied with all of this . He wants to be very communicative and accepting, specifically my parents. I’ve explained to him it takes time to build a loving relationship and his actions matter too. He hasn’t made an effort to be nice to them either.

ANSWER: Do not marry someone who yells at you. Do not marry someone who is okay with his mother yelling at you.

QUESTION: I (F24) became obsessed with my ex (M25) and completely lost control. I’m so ashamed of myself. What can I do now?

I need to get this off my chest because the shame is eating me alive. I’m not asking to be shamed. I already know what I did was wrong. I hate myself for how I acted, and I’m not looking for excuses or sympathy. I just want to know if anyone else has ever gone through something like this, because right now I feel like the only person on the planet who’s ever completely lost control like this. I feel so sick about what I’ve done. It’s been 3 months since we broke up. 6 weeks since he told me it was final. 1 month since he blocked me on everything. 1 week since he unblocked my phone number, 3 days since I was blocked again after a messaging/calling psycho moment.

We both live really close and are from a small and tight knit town in Ontario Canada (everyone knows everyone) and have many mutual friends. We go to the same gym multiple times a week and share a lot of similar hobbies (snow boarding, mountain biking, orienteering). We also both frequent the same coffee shop and go to the same university, in the same department, so it’s almost impossible that we won’t see each other.

Background of our Relationship: we dated for 8 months, broke up. NC for 4 months. Got back together, was a healthy relationship for 3 months. Nearly moved in together and bought a dog. Last 2 months together there was a bit of arguing (never any yelling or disrespect). Then we were off and on for about 4 weeks. He would message to ask me to talk things out. I said no. Then I came around and we spoke and agreed to work through things. We just couldn’t. There was resentment and trust was broken. At the end we had a 3 hour phone call where I told him that I still loved him, he told me “I love parts of you, but not necessarily you” and was super airy about trying to reconnect later on after some time apart. At this time I was actively researching and seeking help to work towards becoming more secure. I became obsessed with ‘fixing’ myself. It was nothing that I genuinely believed could not be repaired through communication and listening.

Over the last few months, I became obsessed with my ex in a way I never thought I was capable of. It wasn’t just missing him or hoping we would fix things. It felt like something in my brain snapped. I called him constantly, sometimes literally dozens of times in a night. One night I called him around 40 times. I remember watching myself do it, knowing it was wrong, knowing I was crossing every boundary, but I couldn’t stop. It felt like my body was in a panic spiral and the only thing that would stop the pain was hearing from him. It almost felt out of body and I hate admitting that. I genuinely feel sick about it.

When he pulled away, I kept texting him long emotional messages, apologising, begging, explaining myself, trying to get him to just talk to me. I was humiliating myself over and over, and he barely responded. And the little responses he did give kept me hooked, just enough to make me think there was hope, just enough to keep me stuck in the limbo he created. He would say things like he “needed time” or that he “wasn’t sure” or that we “might talk later”, “I don’t know if I can move on”, “I don’t know what to do”, “what if i can’t find someone like you” and every tiny crumb felt like a lifeline I was clinging to. Looking back now, I can see how much I let myself fall into that cycle. We had broken up before and got back together. So I understand why I found it hard to comprehend the finality of the breakup. I’m also really struggling with the whole sharing mutual friends part. He also let me keep the dog, and I feel a weird disconnection from him. I love my dog to absolute death, but he is a constant reminder of my ex from the moment I wake up to going to bed.

It got to the point where I even reached out to his best friend on Snapchat because I was so anxious and panicked that I convinced myself I needed to “check on him.” That is something I’m deeply ashamed of. She had nothing to do with any of this and I dragged her into the mess I created. I still cringe thinking about it.

The lowest moment was when I completely lost it and drove to his house. I showed up crying and basically having a full emotional meltdown on his doorstep. And instead of telling me to leave, he agreed to talk, for hours and hours. We ended up walking to a cafe and had coffee. We spoke a lot about things we should have done to have a better relationship and what went wrong. He told me at the cafe that he wasn’t sure how he felt about me and that maybe we’d talk again. He was busy with work and just got a promotion and had to start travelling more frequently to the main office. And because I was so desperate and dysregulated, I took those words as hope. It pulled me right back in, even harder than before.

Then, a few days ago, he told me it was final. That he didn’t want anything. That he is seeing someone new. He had been talking to this girl the whole time this was going on, even when we went for coffee as mentioned before. Fully aware I was obsessed with him and trying everything and anything to fix things. And I just broke. I spiralled harder than ever. More messages. More calls. More panic. He told me to fuck off and that he wanted to never see my face again at one point, and honestly, I don’t blame him. Not because I think I’m some horrible monster, but because I crossed so many boundaries and acted in ways that were overwhelming and invasive and not okay. This is when I stopped contacting him. I knew it was over. Final. Done. It’s like a switch went off in my head and I finally could rationalise that it was over. I haven’t contacted him since, haven’t looked at his social media, haven’t driven past his house. Nothing

I’m seeing a psychologist. I suffer from really severe obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety, and in the past I’ve been told I present with borderline personality traits (4-5 years ago, was pretty mentally unstable at 19-21 due to a traumatic event). But have only ever had stable and healthy relationships with both romantic partners, friends and family, so I don’t think it’s BPD. I also have a pretty good sense of identity and self. I’ve just absolutely lost it this time around and I can’t quite understand why. I’m trying to understand why my brain reacted the way it did, why rejection triggered this kind of obsessive, uncontrollable fear response in me. I’m working on it, and I genuinely want to get better. But none of that erases the fact that I hurt someone I loved with my behaviour. It doesn’t change how ashamed I feel. It doesn’t change how much I hate the person I became during all of this.

I’m not here to blame or to justify my actions. I’m not here to ask if I was right or wrong. I already know. I just need to know if I’m alone in this. If anyone else has ever completely lost themselves after a breakup and done things that feel horrifying in hindsight. I feel like a crazy, psycho stalker ex. I harassed him and I feel abusive. I have lost all my self worth and am trying so hard to work towards moving on and forgiving myself but the shame and guilt is eating me alive. right now I feel like I’m the only one who has ever spiralled to this level, and I feel disgusting, and I’m trying so hard to understand how I reached this point so I never become that person again.

After all of this I am beginning to realise that I don’t actually love him that much. It’s almost like limerence and becoming obsessed with the idea of something that is unattainable. I don’t like the way he would treat me and spoke about how I needed to be “fixed” and change so many things about myself while we were together. I’ve idealised the relationship we had and the person he is in so many ways.

I am done. Done with the texting, calling. Done with harassing and obsessing. I’m setting strict boundaries for myself going forwards. I refuse to date again until I fully understand my actions, triggers and ways to better cope with emotional regulation in future. I will NEVER be that person again.

Please be as kind or cruel as needed. I know my mental health has been a major contributor and it is no excuse. But please remember that at the end of the day I am a human with feelings.

UPDATE: It’s day 4 since I last contacted him. I have not called, text, looked at his social media, or driven by his house since. I’m seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist and have made myself a promise that this will never happen again. I am taking this as a lesson. I am taking full accountability for my behaviour and seeking help to understand why and how I can prevent this from happening again. I feel deep regret, guilt and shame, but am trying to be kind to myself. I am also happy that he has found someone, even if it hurts a lot. But he deserves to be happy and I always hope he is.

ANSWER: Definitely not alone! I did very similar things when I was 21 and my boyfriend of 4 years ghosted me. This was 12 years ago now and I do still cringe sometimes. The brain has stress and withdrawal responses once the feel good chemicals have gone. Therapy is very helpful and try to work on forgiving yourself!

QUESTION: My (27f) boyfriend (30m) wants to buy a house together after only 8 months of dating. How do I make it more clear to him that it’s not happening?

I have only been with my boyfriend for 8 months and known him for less than a year. He keeps telling all friends and family that we are looking at houses. Obvious problem #1 is we have been together a short amount of time. He moves fast. He told me he loved me day 2 into dating. Problem #2 is he has $1,000 total in his bank account. First of all I am not buying him a house. I can afford a decent house on my own and I will be moving out of my current house within the next 6 months due to neighborhood drama.  He sees this as an opportunity to buy a home together. When talking about buying my next house I am purposely using phrases like “I can afford this amount”. I have told him his finances scare me to afford a house and contribute to any costs. He told me it’s “normal” to have only $1,000 at a time in his bank account and that’s how most people live. For clarity he has a decent job and works in the trades. In previous years he has filed taxes for a $90,000 income. Obviously it fluctuates depending on amount of over time each year. But every time I ask him where his money is his response is he has bills….. another inconstancy is his only bills are general utilities and a car payment that is almost done. He doesn’t have a mortgage (inherited his house), student loans, or any dependents. He also has passive income from being a landlord of other homes he has inherited. His dad is big time pushing us to move in together and my boyfriend agrees that we should. I am not ready to move in with him for a variety of reasons (time, money, cleanliness, habits) but he’s not picking up the hints I am dropping. I feel like he’s making this decision for both of us without even asking if I want to. I don’t want to hurt his feelings and I don’t know how to approach bc any time I bring it up he has absolutely zero verbal response to my concerns.

ANSWER: "We've only been together for 8 months. There is no way I am purchasing a home together. This is too soon and not financially feasible."

End of.

QUESTION: only getting my(22M) girlfriend (21M)a pit ticket to her favorite artist.

Hey Reddit, so I bought my girlfriend a ticket to her favorite artist (Renee Rapp), and I've told people this, and they naturally ask, “Aren’t you going with her?" I say that I only bought her ticket, and I'll be driving her to and from the concert and staying in the area to make sure she's okay. People have interpreted this as me not wanting to go with her to her favorite artist. The floor seats were definitely out of my budget, but I got them for her to have a great time and the best experience possible. And I definitely could have bought a cheaper nosebleed seat to at least be in the same building as her, but I personally don't see the point in that. My girlfriend is happy and excited about it, and that’s what I truly care about.

Is there something I'm not seeing?

ANSWER: “Is there something I’m not seeing” 
Yes and no. You’re seeing their reactions and unseeing your gf excitement. Just look at her excitement and happiness to go and cut out the noise outside your relationship.

QUESTION: My girlfriend (23F) blocked me (22M) and went on a trip with her friend group, which includes her ex-boyfriend and it happens to be his birthday.

Hey everyone, this is my first post on Reddit, so please bear with me.

I (22M) started dating my girlfriend (23F) about three months ago. Shortly after we started dating, I had to move to another city for work, so we’ve been in a long-distance relationship (LDR) since then.

Before dating me, she was in a four-year relationship with her ex. She told me she ended things with him because she was attracted to me she even said she never found her ex physically attractive. However, she’s admitted that she still hasn’t fully moved on from him and that it’ll take time. I told her I’d give her space and try to be understanding, but lately, I’ve started questioning if I’m doing the right thing or just overreacting.

She’s a very social person and has a big friend group, while I have a small circle of close friends I completely trust. The issue is that her close friend group includes her ex. She still hangs out with them, and honestly, it makes me uncomfortable. I’ve told her multiple times that she can hang out with other friends, but why keep including her ex? She always says it just “happens by chance” that her friends call him when she calls them.

In the last two months, they’ve gone to four movies, one overnight beach outing, and several dinners together. What hurts most is that there’s this one place I’d always wanted to visit with her, and she didn’t want to go when I asked but now she’s going there with her friend group (which includes her ex).

Yesterday we fought because today is her ex’s birthday, and she’s going on a trip to that same place. I’ve told her several times that I’m not comfortable with this, especially since even her ex was insisting she come because it’s his “birthday” and everyone would “miss her.” Despite everything, she agreed to go.

Last night I told her that if she goes, we’re done. She apologized and said she’d “plead with me later” but couldn’t cancel because this would be “the last time” she’d get to spend a day like this with all her friends.

Fast forward to this morning she blocked me. She’s not answering my calls or messages. I’ve called her over 50 times, but she’s left me on delivered on WhatsApp and hasn’t responded at all.

I know she is going to come back and apologize to me about everything and this happened multiple times but this time this does not feel the same.

So now I’m just sitting here, completely lost.  
What am I supposed to do in this situation?  
Is it normal or okay for something like this to happen in a relationship?

tl;dr my gf went on a trip with her frnd group which has her ex and they are going to the place where i wanted to take her on her birthday date because we are doing LDR now, i had told her several times in the last month that i am not ok with that but still she planned that and today morning she blocked me and went on the trip what can i do now?

ANSWER: You already said what you were going to do in this situation.

Don't make threats you aren't prepared to carry out.

QUESTION: My sister (29F) didn’t invite me (27M) to her wedding. Thoughts?

Recently my sister got married on a destination wedding. She texted me 6 months ago saying the wedding would just be her and her wife and that she would hold a family/friends event next year. I congratulated her and said sounds good.

I found out that both her and her wife’s direct family ended up coming to the destination. Not present for the ceremony, but they were there the rest of the time. My other sister and parents, the wives sister and parents, and the part that really gets me… my mom’s boyfriend (7 guests total).I would have felt fine with this whole situation, but hearing he was welcomed to come and I wasn’t… stings.

My sister and I have had periods of months without talking but we are always happy to see each other. No real conflicts. I brought this concern up to my mom and sister, and they played it off saying it wasn’t a big deal and they would be there for witnessing/legality purposes.

I’m imagining a few reasons for this situation

1) my mom really wanted bf to come 
2) my sister secretly despises me 
3) it’s just how things worked out and it’s no big deal. You just happened to be the only direct family member not there.

ANSWER: You won’t know without talking directly to your sister. It’s wild to me that other family members did know and kept it a secret from you. You need to talk to your sister and understand what is going on so you can try to repair your relationship (assuming you want to have a relationship going forward with your sister)

QUESTION: BF calls his ex "my wife" when he argues with me. (40M and 40F)

Me 40F, BF 40M.

My BF is separated from his wife and is going through a drawn out divorce.  Many times during arguments he can get very nasty.  Swearing, yelling, insulting, etc.

Today, we were having an argument, and out of no where he goes "Hold on, my wife is calling me.  I have to talk to my wife.  My wife is coming today to get some of her stuff, I'll call you later."

Also during the same argument he started talking about my ex husband, and said, " I can see why he couldn't stand you and cheated on you.  Don't blame the guy at all!!!"

I have never said anything along those lines to him, EVER.  I don't bring our exes into arguments, ever.  I stick to the topic of the argument.  He generally goes into these types of insults when he has nothing substantive to argue about. I've spoken to him about this many many times, but for some reason, he wont stop.

I understand his ex is still legally his wife.  It's just that he never refers to her as that unless he and I are arguing, and only refers to her as that to me, not anyone else.  If he's talking to others, he will call her by her name, or say his son's mother, etc.

I feel like when he does this, its almost to put in me in my place.  To make a point to say, "she's my wife, and you're not.  She has status in my life, and you don't.  She means something to me and you don't mean shit."

He and I have discussed getting married once his divorce is finally over, but honestly, when he makes comments like this, I don't even want to.  I want to reiterate, I do not call him names, I do not bring other people into our arguments. He would regularly compare me to her during arguments, that has become more rare, but it has been replaced by this "my wife" talk.

I am left wondering why he does this and if I am interpreting this correctly.  I need to know if this is a behaviour that will change or if this is a warning sign of worse to come.

Why does he do this?

Update: I've read your comments and you are all just validating everything I feel inside.  He doesn't like me, this is abusive and it's not stopping. He's called me 7x since the argument this afternoon.  I haven't been answering.  I need way more time to process this and figure out how I feel and what I want to say.

Update 2: thank you everyone for your advice. I have decided to move forward with my life. The biggest takeaways I have gotten from this are that

1) he doesn’t like me.

2) abusers rarely change.

I have already ended the relationship in my head, and I will probably send him a quick text whenever he next reaches out just letting him know that I’m done. I will not speak to him on the phone.

I will be seeing him over the weekend as our kid play hockey together, so any advice to avoid him over the hockey season would be greatly appreciated.

ANSWER: In your second sentence “many times during arguments he can get very nasty”. Why would you ever disrespect yourself and allow someone to do that to you more than once?

Move on and cut out the drama.

QUESTION: My bf (48M) is mad at me because I (33F) because I didn’t want to have sex. Can the relationship survive?

I didn’t want to have sex in a specific position because my foot is broken and I’m in a lot of pain.

I told him I was in pain and I needed a minute to get back in the mood because he was putting me in positions that made my foot hurt even worse.

He said “sheesh it’s just your foot” then stormed out because “he didn’t like my tone”.  In all honesty my tone was normal, I simply said I’m in pain and this position isn’t comfortable for me. He asked me to give him a BJ but that position an the nagging pain was causing me to not to be in the mood for sex. I told him I needed a break and he got so angry and just left. Didn’t even say anything.

Please convince me this is wrong and I need to leave. I’m struggling.

Edit: thank you all for your support! I just texted him this:

“I  can't fully articulate how deeply hurt I am... it's a searing kind of pain. I truly loved you unconditionally, until I felt used and abused. I keep trying to justify what happened and give you the benefit of the doubt...but you made me feel me like shit for not wanting to have painful sex with you this morning, and the fact that you would even want to be intimate with me knowing I'm in pain makes me sick.
I'm no longer interested in having any kind of relationship with you, in any capacity. I truly hope you never make another woman feel the way you made me feel. No one owes you their body especially if they're in pain
I don't block people, but if you need to, go for it.”

I know this is probably harsh, but honestly this wasn’t the first time he’s made me feel uncomfortable/obligated to have sex. I feel like I made the right decision, but the ending definitely sucks. :(

Edit2: he responded and said “apologies, take care”. Then he blocked me on all platforms. How does someone behave this way to someone they “love” and sleep at night?

ANSWER: Definitely a reason this 48 yo MAN was single.

OP, dump him. You are not only there for his sexual pleasure while he ignores your physical and emotional well being. Please know you deserve better.

QUESTION: My (26F) boyfriend (26M) got physical during an argument. He says I made him this way, and I don’t know what to do.

We’ve been together for three years. In the first year, I was recovering from self-harm and suicidal thoughts. He supported me through a really dark time, and I’ll always be grateful for that.

Since last year I promised myself I wouldn’t ever go down that road again mostly thinking of my parents. But lately our relationship has been really rocky. We argue a lot almost every weekend now, and every time things get heated, he blames me for “not listening” when he asks me to stop.

Yesterday it blew up. He was gaming when I walked past, and he yelled that I made him lose a point. Later I tried showing him a hoodie ad I thought he’d like, but he brushed me off. I felt hurt and went to the bedroom.

Later he called me just to ask if I’d go babysit his sister’s kids and I snapped a bit, asking why he only talks to me for stuff like that. He told me to stay quiet while he played, then started yelling again when he lost another game.

When I began packing to leave, telling if he wants 0 of my presence : I’d rather go now itself and he started calling me names, saying I’m “illiterate like my dad” and never listen when he asks me to stop talking. I said, out of frustration, “I wish I was dead and think all of this was for a game,” and that’s when he grabbed me by my hair and neck yelling at me for saying that. He told me he hates when I say things like that because it “reminds him” of when I used to self-harm. And everything I’m doing is for attention.

He said I’ve made him this way that trying to handle me turned him into someone he doesn’t recognize. I left and went to his sister’s place. I feel awful and guilty, like I caused it. But I also know being grabbed like that isn’t okay. I still love him and want to fix things, but I’m scared and confused.

TL;DR: Boyfriend (26M) of three years got physical with me during an argument, says I “made him this way” because of my emotional past. I love him but don’t know how to handle this or if it’s fixable.

My question(s):
	•	How do I know if this relationship can be repaired or if I need to walk away for good?
	•	How do I handle the guilt I feel when I still love him but know this isn’t right?

Edit: I know most of y’all are at right asking me to leave, but what about the compassion, love and care I have for him, how can I accept that this is the end of the road with him. I thought he’d be the one, every single relationship of mine goes through shit exactly the third year, last one I was sexually assaulted in public, and this one physically abused. I don’t know if it’s my actions that leads these things to happen to me. I’m hella confused.

ANSWER: And don't tell him you are leaving until you are away and somewhere safe. Make sure you take your important documents with you and anything sentimental. Once you have left tell your landlord you are in an abusive relationship and have left for your own safety and see if they will let you break your lease early. Seek help from domestic abuse charities/ support lines

QUESTION: [UPDATE]: I (23F) Asked My Friend (24M) About Our Sleepovers… and Things Moved Forward?

Hi everyone! I wanted to give an update because your advice honestly pushed me to do something I would’ve kept avoiding.

Here is the link to the original post 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/iw2WEXDuVe

On Saturday evening I texted Matt saying I needed to talk about something. Originally I wanted to do it in person… but I chickened out. So I just went for it and asked him how he felt when we slept together. He was confused at first (understandably lol), so I clarified and told him I enjoyed those moments because I’m actually attracted to him. Then I asked again how he felt.

He told me that the first time we slept together, I had recently broken up with my ex and he didn’t want to take advantage of that moment. And the other times, he was just trying to be respectful. He literally said, “I am loyal to you always.”

After that, we decided to talk properly in person the next day. We already had plans to go to a friend’s place on Sunday, so we met there. It was super awkward for me to see him after confessing my feelings, but he was completely normal. After the hangout, he drove me home, and that’s when the real conversation happened.

I told him that I was into him from the moment I saw him and that my feelings grew stronger as we got closer. He said he likes me too :) and admitted there was always tension between us, even when we hangout with the group. He explained that he never asked me out because of my ex at first, and later because he thought I had something going on with other guys.

Anyway, we agreed the past is past. I asked how he wants to move forward and if he’s ready for something more. He said yes, and that he wants to get to know me in a different way.

So… I kissed him. Finally 😅. And the rest is history :)

Thank you to everyone who encouraged me to communicate. I would’ve stayed stuck in confusion without your advice. Y’all gave me the push I needed. ❤️

ANSWER: Please watch out for red flags… you casually mentioned before that he goes through your IG and WhatsApp messages to see who you’re talking to, and that was before you were even dating. Glad you’re happy but that seems incredibly controlling.

QUESTION: Husband (36M) constantly mansplains and interrupts me (37F), but gets upset with me when I point it out

My husband (36M) and I (37F) have been married for three years. Over those three years, I have noticed an increase in “mansplaining” and related behaviors that really bother me. He regularly interrupts and talks over me, he corrects nearly everything I say (even when I’m right or the issue doesn’t have a right/wrong answer), and scrolls his phone when I’m trying to talk to him. All of these things make me feel like he doesn’t respect me.

I’ve tried on several occasions to discuss these concerns in a calm, nonreactive way, but no matter how I approach it he gets offended. I really don’t think he realizes he does these things, but if I point them out he feels like I’m lumping him into “the patriarchy” when in reality he’s one of the “good guys.”

I think that my suggestion that he does these misogynistic behaviors is incongruous with his self-image and therefore feels like an attack. But the result is that the issue just gets abandoned. How do I express my needs in a way that he will respond to?

ANSWER: Those things make you feel like he doesn't respect you because he doesn't. You're correct. He's not interested in changing the behavior and when you challenge him on it, he only becomes irritated and dismissive. It's been happening for three years. If you don't want to leave, then it's time to insist on counseling.

QUESTION: My bf (33M) was uninvited to my sister's (34F) wedding. Can my relationship heal from this?

Part 2 Update:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/1ovdqcl/part\_2\_my\_bf\_33m\_was\_uninvited\_to\_my\_sisters\_34f/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ovdqcl/part_2_my_bf_33m_was_uninvited_to_my_sisters_34f/)

\\\Edit\\\

I started this thread with the intention of forgiving my (29F) bf (33M) after basically cheating (texting and messaging women and bots on other platforms - some explicit). Only this isn’t his second chance, it’s technically the third. As ridiculous as the third event is, it’s still cheating, whether it was a bot or not.

The other issue I addressed was that my sister (34F) will not forgive or acknowledge him now, which I totally understand, but it would be obvious in front of my family, putting her character at risk, because my parents don’t know what’s going on. They will wonder why she’s being so rude, and that will hurt me even more. So I was wondering how to remedy the situation, or if it was pointless, and the relationship is doomed. She also revoked his invitation to her wedding. I am on her side. He has made me feel bad about this, but I agree with her. I don’t even want him at my sister’s wedding.

Y’all did not hold back - and honestly, I needed to hear it.

I want to thank everyone who took the time to give me solid advice. For many of you, it probably came from experience, and you know (on some level) what I am going through. For others, you have common sense, or are blessed with a strong will, or maybe just know better, but your advice and feedback still mean a lot. I’m sorry I couldn’t respond to everyone, but I tried to read every response.

Since I already put myself out there, I’ll go ahead and address a lot of common threads -

1. My sister is an angel for putting up with me. That’s putting it nicely. She is right not to want him at the wedding, and she’s an excellent judge of character. I should take her advice, and all of yours, and run.
2. I was in therapy, a lot of it. I thought I had moved on from all of this nonsense, so it was really hard to see it for what it is. I’m a bit out of practice. But he literally gaslit me so many times. I used to be an expert in this! My therapy started at 14 through 16, then again at 17 to 19. And again at 23 to 24.
3. I definitely need some alone time. I did have back-to-back relationships, with one break lasting up to at least 6-8 months, but my bf was relentlessly pursuing me at the time. I let his harassment slide for so long. And then I dated him. I saw him for what he was and chose to see what I thought he could be. He is not that person.
4. Manipulation is crazy, especially when the fog clears, which it has with everything you all had to say. My eyes are opening. It hurts so much to let the image of him go, but I need to realize it’s not really him. It’s fake. Doesn’t exist. 
5. I have safe places I can go. I have a support system and people who will be there for me. 
6. I promise this wasn’t for attention or clickbait. I was really lost before coming to Reddit. It was my first actual post. But I’ve hit a new low, and I think my subconscious was screaming for someone to wake me up. What better way than this?

Y’all didn’t disappoint. I want to leave my bf now.

I need to make a plan - many of you recommended I should follow through with packing my stuff and leaving while he’s at work.

So, that’s what I’ll do. I need a few days to reorganize but… I need to do this. And for anyone who read this and is going through something similar, I hope this thread helped you as much as it helped me.

I have free will, this is my life, I don’t need him, I will be okay, better even, without him.

The wedding will be epic, especially because he’s not going to be there.

I need a real man. Wherever he is, I hope I find him. I don’t want to settle for anything less than what I deserve.

I’ll keep you posted

Thank you, all.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

My sister "Eve" (34F) got engaged last year, and I (29F) am her maid of honor. We weren't always close, but we are really close now. She's my big sister and has always been really protective of me. I've had really bad experiences with men, but I've also been lucky to know what a good man is and looks like.

My bf (33M) "Kevin" of 3 years really fucked up. I broke down and told Eve what happened (before I talked to Kevin, probably a mistake), because I was just devastated. Since then, after confronting Kevin, I chose to stay. Even though I had my car packed. It felt like he used all the "feel bad for me" manipulative tricks, but it worked, and I'm still here. I really do love him and care for him.

But now Eve is refusing to acknowledge or talk to him. She also revoked his invite to her wedding.

Ultimately, Eve doesn't want him in the wedding photos, and she doesn't trust him anymore. I totally understand. I'm not sure if I even want him at the wedding anymore. We're still working on us, but if things don't work out, I don't want him to be in those photos. She thinks he'll be a stain in the photos, and I'm not sure if she's wrong.

I want to express that I am NOT mad at my sister. I'm more on her side than his. He made a huge mistake and now he's suffering the consequences. But I'm right in the middle of it. He is devastated; he loves my family and now feels like everything is falling apart. So do I.

If you thought it was messy now... Thanksgiving and Christmas are coming up. Eve is getting married just a few days after Christmas. How am I supposed to have my bf around the family (literally just my parents, Eve and her fiance, and myself and Kevin), for Thanksgiving and or Christmas dinner?? Eve doesn't want to talk to him at all. It will be so obvious. She's sworn to secrecy; she won't tell anyone, especially not my parents. But if she acts like that, they'll know something is up. And all they'll talk about is the wedding that my bf knows he's not invited to, but can't tell anyone he's not invited to. I'm the maid of honor, so I have to be involved. It's just a mess.

When he isn't at the wedding, I'll have to lie and say he has covid and that's why he's not there. And afterwards? I don't know.

Should Kevin talk to Eve? Should he try to remedy it? Is this relationship over?

I can't imagine being with someone my sister doesn't trust... she'll probably never think any guy is good enough for me - but this just feels like too much. My parents, dad especially, love Kevin.

Backstory/ Drama:

I found out he had been messaging his exes and other women in April of this year. Really nasty stuff. One was even a "closure" message to someone he fell in love with years ago. Which, honestly, I wasn't as bothered by that as I was with the other stuff I saw. Also, for some reason, he was messaging bots on IG who were posing as sexy latinas... lol. We have lived together for over a year, so I slowly started organizing and gathering my things. I was preparing to leave. It took me weeks to confront him, because it felt so hard. I knew my life, our relationship, would change. I was scared to lose that comfort I found in him.

I chose to forgive him. We had a big talk, I said he needed to step up, yada yada.

Months later, nothing changed. He was still up to his antics of not being a very good BF. Just unsupportive, unhelpful, lazy... September comes around. We're watching TV, he's on X, and I see him go to his messages, and quickly exited out. I knew something was up. I decided to check his socials while he was at work to see if he was talking to anyone again. Lo and behold, I found new messages with a BOT on X. "She" was sending him almost-nudes and whatnot, he was responding, calling "her" baby, etc... (I say "her" because it was probably a middle-aged man trying to scam people).

I went numb, and I couldn't even cry at first. He wasn't supposed to be that guy. We were good friends for years before we started dating. He warned me against those guys, told me to stay away. That any dude who still talks to his exes or other women is just keeping his options open and is disgusting. He isn't supposed to be that guy. And now, my whole reality has shifted, and I don't know what's real or not.

This thought is what caused me to break down in front of my sister, causing me to tell her what happened. I didn't tell her about what happened in April. I only told her about the bot he was messaging on X.

I've been cheated on, and I was even groomed by a man when I was 14, not really knowing any better. Or thinking I did. It lasted years, and he abused me a lot emotionally. I've had a hard time with relationships ever since. I'm really good at dissociating, too, so that's kind of what I've been doing. And totally avoiding confrontation with Kevin.

We finally talked about everything the other day, and he's completely devastated again. I tried talking to my sister about whether she felt any differently about the situation, and she said no. She doesn't want to talk to him or acknowledge him, and he's still not invited to the wedding. He's upset and doesn't think it's fair. But he also gets it. He thinks she'd change her mind if I fought harder for him and advocated for him and our relationship.

Wtf am I supposed to advocate for right now? That's basically what I told him, in nicer words.

I've been in back-to-back relationships my entire early teens to late 20s. I've learned a lot and I've loved a lot. Kevin was supposed to be the nice guy. I chose the nice guy over money, over looks, over everything. I chose a guy that I thought would be a good partner and a good father one day.

As stupid as it sounds, he was literally messaging a bot, and that's what did us in? It's hard to believe something so stupid, so ridiculous, so embarrassing for him would destroy our relationship. It moreso brings up images of the messages I saw in April, and it's triggering af.

As I'm typing all this out, I feel like I know the answers to my questions. But I struggle letting him go "so easily". I know I'm not responsible for his actions, but when he cried and told me he was nothing without me, he couldn't do it without me, I believed him, because I feel the same way. But it felt really unfair. I had my car packed, and I waited for him to get home from work. When he did, I told him I was leaving. We talked for like 2 days. And I ended up staying. More for him than me. But now, a month later, I'm just sad and confused. I love him and don't want to see him so hurt. But he caused this.

I can't imagine anyone else can relate to a situation like this? Maybe it's not so uncommon. Should my bf try and talk to my sister? Or is this relationship just doomed now?

If this ends up getting a lot of attention and debate, I'll post the messages I found on his phone to settle it.

Thanks in advance -

"K"

ANSWER: Your sister is right, and you need to grow a straighter spine. He’s messaging other women and disrespecting you, then manipulating you to stay. What’s so great about him? It doesn’t sound like much.

QUESTION: My (25 F) boyfriend (26 M) wants to be a billionaire and I’m realizing our values might be completely different

I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for a couple of years. He’s been working on building a startup for almost 2 years now no income yet and he’s now in debt but refusing to get a job. He’s incredibly driven and patient. He’s also supportive of me and encourages me to pursue my own dreams so I feel extremely conflicted.

One of his big life goals is to become a billionaire. He genuinely believes that since billionaires exist, there’s no reason he can’t be one too. To me, that mindset feels… wrong. I understand that part of this comes from wanting financial security and never wanting to struggle again like his family did as I child but to me, that mindset feels really off I don’t think anyone should be a billionaire when there’s so much inequality in the world. I value peace, balance, creativity, giving back, and financial stability, not excess wealth or constant hustle.

He works nonstop, even on weekends or late at night. I don’t understand why he can’t find a part time job to make some steady income but he refuses and says he needs to go “full throttle” on the startup and that it has “billion dollar potential”. I find myself feeling disconnected and honestly disagree with how he is approaching this. It feels pretentious and out of touch with reality. He’s point blank told me that he desires to be a billionaire and that my opinion about it is what stunts individual growth.

His recent decision have made me rethink our longterm compatibility. Can a relationship work when one person wants a simple, meaningful life and the other is chasing billionaire-level success? Or is this just fundamentally not going to align long-term? I’m open minded to different POVs and realize that my own middle class upbringing in a conservative family when if comes careers could be shaping this too. Thanks!

ANSWER: It’s your call honestly. I think this needs a bit more context. Is the problem the billionaire part or that he works and works and works and has only his debt growing? Also how come there is zero income if he’s running it 2 years? Does he have at least some, but is paying debt with it?

Either way look at the past years with him, can you stay with him for the same amount of time with nothing changing?

Also, is he mentally okay? Might be also a depression problem.

QUESTION: My (27 F) husband (32 M) is deployed and I just found something about him that I can’t stop thinking about

I’m a 27 F and my husband is 32 M married together 6 years  I want to say up front that I completely support the LGBTQ+ community, and I don’t mean to sound judgmental or offensive. I’m just really confused and trying to make sense of my feelings.

About a year before we got married, I noticed through his Reddit history that he had been watching adult content featuring transgender women. I know looking through his phone wasn’t right, but I did it anyway. I didn’t see any messages or personal interactions, just that he was viewing certain communities.

When I brought it up, he was embarrassed and didn’t want to talk about it. I asked if it was something he was specifically into or just what he liked watching, and he said he didn’t really know. I wasn’t trying to shame him, I just wanted honesty and to understand.

Fast forward three years. He had logged into his Instagram on my iPad and forgot to log out. Recently I went on the app and saw that he was still signed in. I looked around, and even though his likes and comments were normal, most of his recently watched videos and link history were of transgender women. It looked like a consistent pattern over the last month.

From what I can tell, he’s not messaging anyone or paying for anything, but it seems like this has been ongoing for several years.

I’m not upset about the type of people he’s watching. What hurts is that I feel blindsided. It feels like there’s a whole side of him I don’t know, and I can’t talk to him about it because he’s deployed for a year. I don’t want to accuse or shame him, but I also don’t know how to process this alone.

It makes me question what this means for our intimacy, our honesty, and our future. I keep wondering if I’m overreacting or if this would make anyone else feel uneasy too. What would you do in my situation?

ANSWER: It makes sense that you’re feeling the way you do, totally valid. I don’t know how folks communicate with each other when deployed, but I also don’t think this is a relationship ender. I’ve dated men whose sexuality was fluid. Maybe that’s just the type of porn he likes maybe there’s something more. If you love him and wanna make it work, I’m sure you can make it work. First step would be having an open, honest conversation with no judgment

QUESTION: My mum (53f) read my (23f) diary while I was out, discovered deeply private things and Is now acting inappropriately

I’m 23, autistic, and I’ve had mental health struggles in the past but my last serious incident was over 5 years ago. I do need support in some areas because of autism, but that doesn’t mean I’m incapable, unsafe, or unable to make adult decisions.

For some background my mum has always crossed boundaries under the excuse of “keeping me safe” for example. -

•She has looked through my diary before, even when there was no crisis or reason.

•When I lived with her, she would constantly walk into my room without knocking including when I was naked and just say “sorry” and keep talking.

•I’d sometimes leave for a week and come back to my room being trashed and covered in dog pee/poop.

Everyone in my family uses Life360 and I eventually started turning my location off or not taking my phone with me because the moment I walked out the door someone would text “Where are you? Are you safe?” even if I was just going to the shop or meeting friends! One time at 20 years old I walked to the corner shop at 9pm and got a call saying I shouldn’t be out that late because it was dangerous.. it’s literally a 3-minute walk! I’ve basically been suffocated with “safety checks” to the point I’ve formed habits that aren’t great like hiding where I’m going just to get privacy.

Two days ago I slept over at a guy’s house, I turned my location off because I didn’t want my family blowing up my phone. In the morning I texted my mum saying I was fine and she asked if I wanted to go grab coffee and I said maybe. My location is still off at this point.

Instead of waiting, she went to my house, let herself in, and read through my diary to “find clues” as to where I might be.

My diary has extremely personal, embarrassing things in it stuff I always thought I’d take to the grave, private thoughts, fantasies, and momentary ideas and I only found out she did it because my sister called me to tell me :D

I confronted my mum and the conversation blew up, she told me I’m “going to be a single mother” because I don’t want to go on birth control. So much for bodily autonomy or whatever.

A day later as we are trying to talk things out and she proposes an idea of a fetish clothing and sex toy business that we can both do online… she had read my sexual fantasies, preferences, stuff I probably don’t even remember writing and that I don’t identify with anymore shit that I NEVER wanted to get out.

I feel exposed, like I have no privacy even in my own thoughts anymore and the worst part is I know what she’s like and I can’t trust her to keep her mouth shut and I’m deeply embarrassed. I want to curl up in a ball and disappear.

I’ve tried explaining the boundaries I want and how this is effecting me but the only response I get is she is mama bear and keeping me safe, that there’s bad people out there and she’d rather me be upset with her than be in danger.

I feel sick knowing what she knows about me and I don’t know how to move forward anymore.

Tldr - my mum read my diary where I wrote sexual fantasies, preferences and instead of respecting my boundaries she is now is proposing a sex toy business to start together.

ANSWER: If Mom has a key, you are taking it back right now.

If she won't give it back, you are changing the locks, also right now.

This is completely inappropriate and borderline incestuous. I'm autistic and have mental health problems but I'm also an adult with a job and if my mom looked through my things and then suggested we act on my sexual fantasies I'd exile her to Siberia and never speak to her again. She doesn't need a key if she's going to be acting like this.

QUESTION: My 39M husband wants me 39F to give him more attention (of all kinds). How can I get him to understand where I am coming from?

Hi all, thanks for reading. I have been in a relationship with my husband since we were 19 years old. In the last five or so years he has complained that I haven’t been giving him enough attention, and I mean of all kinds. Examples:

He complained we weren’t spending enough time together, I suggested a movie night. We used to love watching movies together. He complained that most evenings he needs to play games online with friends. I asked him how then can we spend time together. He said “You could just sit on the couch and watch me play,” in this wistful voice.

When I try to engage him at dinner he will talk about three subjects: work, firearms, and how the food tastes. If I deviate, he gets frustrated.

Lastly, he wants more time together in the bedroom. I asked him to come to bed before midnight. I don’t want to do anything after I shower because I generally shower and go to bed. I need my sleep for work as well (we are both employed full time). He comes to bed 12-2 am. I encourage him to come to be earlier and he won’t in favor of playing games. If he does come to bed earlier, I have to be the one to initiate.

When I try to talk this through with him, I am generally the bad guy. My libido isn’t what it used to be and with juggling the majority of the house work, working the same hours, and having my own things to accomplish, I don’t know how to make him see that maybe we could both stand to make more time.

If I bring that up, he gets defensive and I can’t seem to get through to him that it’s not because I don’t want to, it’s because he’s not willing to meet me halfway. How can I get him to understand where I am coming from?

TLDR: my husband wants all kinds of attention and I can’t seem to figure out how to give it to him without bending over backwards more than I already am.

ANSWER: It seems like he wants an NPC rather than a wife. An NPC would just quietly wait while he does his stuff (important Main Character stuff) then be immediately and happily available to him when he wants to interact. This NPC wouldn't have her own interests or agenda but would exist solely for his convenience

QUESTION: I (23M) broke up with my (22F) girlfriend, 2 years after she publicly humiliated me

About four months ago I made a post on here about what happened between me and my girlfriend. I was struggling to get over something she had done early in our relationship that left a lasting impact on how I see myself.
For anyone who did not see it, she took me to an event with her netball friends to watch England play live. The night started well. I went with her and her dad, and after he left, I ended up being the only man there. As the drinks kept flowing, the conversation shifted to everyone talking about their partners’ performance in bed. I was already uncomfortable and assumed my girlfriend would stay out of it.
Instead, she covered my eyes and tried to cover my ears and then told around fifteen people that I had a small penis and that I was not good in bed. Hearing that from the person who was supposed to care about me completely destroyed me. I walked away, but I still stayed in the relationship.
I stayed for two years. Two years of constantly questioning whether I was enough, two years of believing that the reason she did not have  higher sex drive was because of my size, and two years of emotional damage that I tried to pretend was not happening.
After our first breakup, we got back together, I came to Reddit for advice. Over 200 people told me to leave when I mentioned that she asked if she felt “looser” when I told her I had a feeling she had been with someone else. I deleted that post out of fear she would find it, and I still went back. I stayed another three months.
Finally, last week, I ended the relationship. I had enough self-respect to cut her out of my life.
The problem is that even though I left, I do not feel whole again. I still feel inadequate and still feel the echo of the things she said about my body and my worth. It genuinely feels like she took a part of me with her.
How do I move forward from this? How do I start feeling confident enough to date again when the humiliation and insecurity still follow me around?

ANSWER: My dad once told me after a breakup that "for a while it will be the first thing on your mind. Someday, it may be the second thing, then the third, and eventually you may not think of it at all. That will be a good day."

QUESTION: My (F30) partner’s (M30)  inability to do anything on their own is driving me to a nervous breakdown.

My partner and I have known each other for twenty years. We were good friends for most of our lives, then five years ago something sparked between us. I work as a manager at one of the Big Four, while he’s been teaching English at a high school for about a year and a half. Our relationship has never really been balanced. I’ve always earned more than he has, and he only decided to go back to school a few years ago. This year, we decided to move in together after five years in a mostly long-distance relationship.  
I wish I never had.  
Not only is there absolutely no intimacy between us (he says he’s too tired and selfishly, I can’t help but wonder how it’s possible that he’s the one who’s tired after working 3–4 hours a day at school, while I work nine and somehow shouldn’t be, but that’s another story). He has no savings but since he was called to work in my same town, he moved in with me. It took me a while to get used to his habits and routines, but eventually, I just passively accepted them.  
And yet, I can’t understand how it’s possible that a man his age constantly needs to ask me how to do everything. The problem is that he’s always lived with his parents, they never pushed him to be independent or taught him how to do things on his own. He expects me to cook for him during my lunch breaks when I occasionally work from home, and every single time he has to cook for himself or do any housework, he asks me how to do it. At first, I made up for it by doing the things he didn’t know how to do, but I ended up exhausted every evening. So now, maybe out of frustration or spite, I’ve started doing only what I need for myself.  
I don’t know what to do. He just asked me again how to use the dryer. I’m exasperated, and this whole situation (on top of the total lack of intimacy in our relationship) is making me question everything. I want a partner, not an incapable roommate.

I’ve tried talking to him, but nothing changes. What can I say to him before deciding what to do? And most importantly, what sh I do?

ANSWER: In a peaceful moment where he's not actively bothering you about a task, ask him how he, as a teacher, would deal with a difficult student who appears to be intentionally not remembering a lesson that he's been taught over and over and over. What would he recommend doing? And then do that back to him whenever he acts incapable.

QUESTION: My (19f) boyfriend (20M) is a flat earther

So…. I (19F) just found out that my boyfriend (20M), who I’ve been with since middle school, is a hardcore flat earther. Like, not “the government lies” level I’m talking full “we live under a dome” type of flat earther.

We’ve always been super close, have talked about marriage, future plans, everything. Then out of nowhere, he just drops this bomb on me along with a bunch of other conspiracy theories he apparently believes in.

For context, I’m a Christian and a biology major planning to go pre-med, so you can probably see how this doesn’t exactly fit into the life I imagined for us. I honestly have no idea when he started believing this stuff, but he sounds 100% convinced about all of it.

I love him so much, but this is seriously stressing me out. Like how am I supposed to spend the rest of my life or even raise kids with someone who genuinely believes we’re living on a flat rock covered by a dome??? Is there anyway I can convince him otherwise because when I tried to bring up actual facts he just started sending me gibberish videos about the illuminati.

ANSWER: Don't get caught up in a relationship version of the sunken cost fallacy. Just because you've been together for a long time doesn't mean you have to be together any longer. Especially someone you met that young. The person you were in middle school will be a different person now, and a different person in ten years. Don't expect beliefs to change, just be honest with yourself as to whether you can continue the relationship and be happy.

QUESTION: My husband (35M), says I (35F), don't feel good anymore. What can I do?

Alright y'all I need help. Anonymous for what will be obvious reasons. Post may be a little NSFW.

My husband 35M confided in me 35F today that I don't "feel good" during sex anymore. Over the past couple years we have been struggling with him keeping at "attention" once we start penetrative intercourse, and he blamed it on being tired, etc for awhile. But over time I have noticed a pattern. He has no issues keeping it up for oral and other things, but the second it comes to direct sex he loses motivation.

So I confronted him and he admitted that he thinks I'm loose. I'm so mortified and embarrassed and insulted and so many other feelings. He also said he isn't as attracted to me as he used to be. He has admittedly struggled with porn addiction in the past. We got together when we were both 26, so of course I don't look like I used to. I've gained weight, so has he. I don't look like the women in porn.

What can I do to improve things? Can kegels really make that big of a difference? I want to take this seriously and invest in myself so my husband is attracted to me. I'm going to have to find out how to get over the hurt of it all, and the embarrassment, but I also want to address the issue.

TL;DR: After nearly 10 years together husband says he thinks I'm loose and less attractive. What can I do to be "tighter"? Are kegels really that effective or can I do more?

ANSWER: Yep. Death gripping his dick to fucked up porn, now can’t get it up for normal sex.  
  
Porn brain is destroying so many men

QUESTION: I (29F) want to break up with my boyfriend (26M), but he has no one else and the holidays are coming up. How can I end things as gently as possible?

\[Updated\] My boyfriend and I have been together for two years. We argue sometimes, but overall things have been fine, and there’s never been cheating or any huge issues like that.

But lately I’ve been feeling emotionally drained. He’s become more controlling and gets upset when I do things on my own. Part of the problem is that he doesn’t really have anyone else. He’s cut off from his family, and since moving to my city, he hasn’t built his own social circle. I have hobbies, friends, and things I enjoy, but he doesn’t really support that, and it’s becoming exhausting. We had a big fight recently over a Nintendo I bought for myself, and after a lot of thinking, I realized it was time to end things.

I still care about him and don’t want to hurt him. He has no one else to lean on, and I’m worried that breaking up will completely crush him. Money is another issue. We share expenses, and splitting up would make things more difficult for him financially. The worst part is that we were planning to visit my family this year for either Thanksgiving or Christmas, and with the holidays coming up, it just feels like the deadline is hanging over me.

I want to handle this as kindly as possible, but I have no idea how to start that conversation. I know sooner is probably better than later, but I just don’t know how to bring it up. I don’t want to make him feel blamed or like it’s all his fault. I guess what I really need is advice on how to talk about this in a way that minimizes the hurt, if that’s even possible.

TLDR: How do I break up with my boyfriend who depends on me a lot without completely crushing him?

UPDATES:

We talked and broke up. He didn’t take it well, but I think deep down he already knew it was coming since he seemed less surprised than I expected. Long story short, I’m moving out to stay with my family for a while, leaving the rest of the lease to him so he has space to decide whether to stay in the city or move somewhere else.

Thanks to everyone who shared advice. I don’t know what the future looks like or if he’ll be okay, but I’m trying to distance myself from it, which I believe is the best thing for both of us

ANSWER: Well with all relationships, you have to be honest no matter how brutal the truth is. Just be kind and gentle during the conversation, and use "I feel" rather than "you do this, you do that" sentences.

Do you want to wait till after New Years or would rather be done with it and enjoy a nice end of the year without this controlling behaviour?

I do think he isn't all innocent and needs to be told that he's controlling and rather dependent on you at the same time so he sees his flaws and tries to rectify them; it's good to try to be a better person when relationships end.

QUESTION: How can I (F/25) save my parents (M/52, F/53) anniversary after a terrible year/month/week?

The past year and especially the last several months have been brutal on them. My mom lost her own father around the holiday season last year, and it affects her immensely. A few months ago, my dad had to have emergency surgery while vacationing overseas, and just recovered from catching Covid in early October. Their older dog had a significant health scare within the past month, my uncle was hospitalized (but released as of yesterday!) this past week.

Today, their younger dog is having emergency surgery for an obstruction. While letting him know about the dog, my asthmatic little brother told them he's got the flu while away at college, so they're taking him to urgent care.

In the middle of all this, my dad mentioned having to cancel a dinner reservation for their wedding anniversary tomorrow and it just crushed me. They deserve and need a break, or some space to breathe. What can I do in the next \~12-18 hours for their anniversary to still feel celebrated, and to really show them they're appreciated? Or lessen the amount of shit on their plates?

ANSWER: Clean up around the house (if needed).

I like the idea of cooking a meal for them (or even ordering food for them, setting the table nicely to make it a little special?).

A small happy anniversary cake could be nice (or if they have a specific desert they like you could get or make that!)

If your mom likes flowers you can get a nice bouquet at a grocery store (she probably has a vase at home so you can just buy the flowers)

QUESTION: My partner (m43) it’s a wonderful person to be with, but in my opinion, he has some unreasonable expectations of me (f45) when it comes to domestic duties. Am I ok to not want to cook at this moment in time?

I don’t want to risk cooking for my partner at the moment because I have been diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands, and I am trying to rest it while I want to go physiotherapy and get better so that I can return to work. At the weekend, my boyfriend wanted me to make soup for him, but I didn’t want to excuse in my hands so I bought it from local restaurant and heated it up for him. He was grateful for it, but then he said that he felt if I love him, I would’ve carried one onion and one potato back home and made him some soup myself. He said he’s concerned that I don’t seem to want to cook for him and he thinks it’s a reflection that I don’t love him. The truth is exactly the opposite. I do love him very much, but I just don’t want to risk hurting my hands because when it does hurt, it’s extremely painful. Now he is giving me the silent treatment. …your opinions would be appreciated.

ANSWER: >e was grateful for it, but then he said that he felt if I love him, I would’ve carried one onion and one potato back home and made him some soup myself.

Fuck this

>He said he’s concerned that I don’t seem to want to cook for him and he thinks it’s a reflection that I don’t love him

Fuck this shit too

>Now he is giving me the silent treatment.

And fuck this child level immature bullshit

Maybe he needs to go live with his mommy....

QUESTION: My (32f) partner (34m) historically quits and threatens to quit his jobs, is this financial abuse?

My partner hasn’t held a steady job in 5 years. We’ve been together almost 9 years. He will get jobs here and there but won’t last too long and constantly says he’s going to quit when he is stressed out or if we are having an argument. He finally got a good job recently, about 2 months ago, and he’s been doing well. Well this morning we had a small disagreement and he said he was done and he was going to quit his job. He said he didn’t care anymore about anything. I said you know I would never threaten to leave my job because of an argument and he said well that’s because you’re not having to deal with you, I am. And I’m stressed out because of you. So I want to quit.

Is this financial abuse? We don’t have kids so luckily that part doesn’t worry me, I can take care of myself and him too so I’m not worried in the sense that I won’t be able to afford bills… but I do feel like he is VERY capable of just quitting and going back to having no job for as long as he wants until he finds another temporary job again. I hate that he feels no shame in telling me he’s going to quit again, considering I have never once quit. I actually just celebrated 15 years at my job.

ANSWER: Girl why are you still with him? 5 years of this crap?! This man doesn't like you. He told you that he doesn't want to deal with you. Make his dreams come true but leaving him. You deserve better than a man child that refuses to hold a job and blames you for his shortcomings. And in short yes it's abusive.

QUESTION: Is my bf (23M) stepping out of line or am I (21F) overreacting?

I (21F) have a boyfriend (23M), we’ve been together for 3 years. I just moved out of my parents house and into my own apartment (we both are in college so he still lives with his parents, nothing wrong there) the thing is, I invited him to stay over a couple days so he can study, because his house is a mess, but it’s been over 3 weeks and he won’t go back to his home, I offered MULTIPLE times every week to take him back to his place and he won’t go. At first I understood because he needs to study, and here he feels more at peace (his house is small and he has 4 other brothers) but damm boy it’s too much time. I will say he does the dishes (after leaving them dirty for the whole day which bugs me) and takes out the trash (usually). But I clean up the house (I’ve just realized he’s a very dirty person), cook (HE EATS A LOT), pay for the food, the rent, etc, I do laundry and everything else. And he has the nerve of saying that I’m doing things wrong, like he genuinely thinks he does so much more in my apartment than me, and for example, the other day I was going to make some burgers, nice and easy right? well not, he wanted pasta with sauce, SO I HAD TO FUCKING GO AND COOK IT, when i’m almost done, he comes to check and he said “no, I don’t want it like that, my mom makes it with chicken” THEN FUCKING GO TO YOUR MOM’S HOUSE (I defrosted chicken and added it) idk I have trouble sharing things and space, but an other example is I bought this really expensive jam that I love, it usually lasts me a month, he ate it all in ONE DAY, I didn’t even get a taste. And right now i’m freaking out because he uses my whiteboard markers, all right, I don’t mind lending them, but they are new and I need them for college, CAN YOU GUYS BELIEVE THEY ARE ALL FUCKING EMPTY NOW? he used them all up, and the worst thing is that he has his own but uses mine
so I don’t know if Im freaking out just because or if he is really crossing a line

ANSWER: You've got yourself a freeloading barnacle.  Why in the world would you make his food.  He's an adult.  He can cook whatever he wants for himself.  Stop being his mother and send him home to his.

QUESTION: PART 2: My bf (33M) was uninvited to my sister's (34F) wedding. Can my relationship heal from this?

\\\UPDATE\\\

Hi everyone.

For those who have been with me since I initially posted - thank you for your advice and strength 🫶🏻

For any newcomers, welcome. Fair warning, you might find my story to be a bit… idk, I want to be kind to myself. But it’s hard not to think it’s a bit pathetic. Especially since the fog has cleared. If you or someone you know is battling an emotionally abusive partner, please have them read the thread from my original post.

Or know that if you post to Reddit, your delusions will be blown away by (mostly) kind strangers.

Original post below:

Update

(Sorry, it’s a long one, and I word vomit. I also have ADD. And maybe a slight ‘tism. My oldest brother (35M) is severely autistic (less than 10 people in the world have what he has. He can’t walk, can’t talk, can’t do anything, and we have no way of communicating with him or vice versa.) Eve also thinks she was touched with a little bit of it. We joke about how our brother got the worst of it, then my sister got a little, and I have the least lol. That might sound rude or fucked up, but if you have a sibling with autism, you can probably relate to dark family humor. This is a topic for another thread lol, and I’m word vomiting, again. Sorry.)

Ok, here’s my update.

Shortened version: I’m going home on Thursday. Alone. I will probably need someone to come back with me and help get my stuff. And help me not fold again. I want to be strong and do it on my own, but I know having someone there to hold me accountable will help a lot.

Long version:

We had a long talk. And I studied the threads all week, so I came prepared. He’s still guilting me about the wedding. I told him I didn’t want him to be there. He said if that’s the case, I should just go home. I said okay I will. Then he proceeded to excuse his actions, again and again.

“I promise I won’t do it again. I will be better for you”

“I knew it was a bot. I was just messing around trying to see what it would do. It meant nothing.”

“What do you even want? Is anything I do good enough for you?”

“I’m embarrassed and disappointed in myself”

“I don’t want to exist. I have no one anyway”

“If she \[Eve\] doesn’t want me to be a part of the family or go to the wedding then fine. She never liked me and was probably hoping for an opportunity to get rid of me”

“Does the last 3 years mean anything to you? You know I love you. There’s no way you don’t know that. It’s because Eve knows and doesn’t want me at the wedding. That’s why you’re feeling like this”

It’s that manipulative back-and-forth tone, hateful then remorseful, trying to gauge if he’ll get comfort and reassurance from me depending on how he phrases it.

I held my ground. I kept imagining if this was my sister Eve. Or my other sister (34F) (adopted) “Jace”. Or my best friend, “GG” (30F).

(Jace and GG knew what had happened since April. Jace was the sister who thought he was ugly AF, but got to know him, and could understand why I was with him. GG always hated him. Both encouraged me to leave. But both were hesitantly supportive when I said I decided to give him another chance.)

And I thought about so many of you who shared your stories with me. I thought of my future. I thought about my 14-year-old self.

I told him he was coming off as really manipulative. That kinda switched something inside him. He said he just wants to fight for me. I told him fighting for me and respecting my boundaries are different things. You had 6 months to fight for me, and you did nothing but message a bot.

“BuT 6 MoNThS iS NoThInG!! ThiS hAs BeeN tHe hArDeSt tiMe iN My LiFe!”

I am going home on Thursday. Alone. I don’t think I’ll be able to pack all my stuff in the car like the last time I tried leaving. His schedule is different this week, so he’ll be home on Thursday.

He knows my weaknesses. He will likely say or do something that triggers me to stay with him. Either threatening his own life, safety, calling me soulless, or accusing me of never loving him, or my favorite, he accuses me of wanting to sleep with other guys.

I have no way of knowing if those tactics will still work now, but I don’t want to chance it. I’m not sure what he’d do if he saw me packing all my stuff again. So I’m just packing essentials. He knows I’m going home for “a few days” and that if he didn’t respect my boundaries this time around, it would speak volumes to me.

He accepted and told me I should go home.

I will probably have to involve someone in my family to help me get my stuff. I haven’t entirely gotten there in my plan yet. Maybe Eve, maybe my Dad. Maybe both. A powerhouse of 2 people with the strongest backbones I know. I know Eve would be absolutely pumped to help me with that.

The other issue is, my bike, a portable but very heavy piano, skis, and a bunch of other crap are at his mom’s house too.

Yes, he was 30 when we first dated & lived at home with his mom. Yes, big ick, I know. There were too many icks that I ignored.

The reason why I haven't just left, or told him I'm done, is because I have no idea how he'll react. My piano means so much to me. I'm also an amateur nature photographer, and he has all of my photos on a hard drive at his mom's house. I don't want him to destroy my stuff. Or threaten me with it.

So yeah, I gotta get my stuff from his apt, and his mom’s house. My sister Jace’s husband suggested I hire movers to get my stuff from his mom’s house. I don’t want to see or talk to his family.

My next update probably won’t come around until next week. I will keep y’all posted.

(ps - I’m only ever on here to look at random stuff… I’m not really sure what the cadence is for updating everyone who responded… I really want everyone who put in the time to read and respond to get an update. There’s an “Edit” to my previous post that is technically more of an update, and I figured I would just create a Part 2)

Thanks, everyone.

All my love and gratitude,

🫶🏻 K

Edit: Sorry!! I took out details about his family that were probably irrelevant and petty, but the point is, I don't want to confront them after I leave him. IYKYK

ANSWER: Try to get your stuff back, but also try to be ok with letting it go. He'll use it as a lever to try to force you back into his orbit.

QUESTION: I (20F) hate having sex with my (21M) boyfriend and it’s ruining my relationship

I don’t know what is wrong with me. My boyfriend (21M) and I (20F) have been together for 3.5 years and we have always had incredible sex. But for the past year I have grown to absolutely hate it. I think I may know why, but I really need advice. 
Last year there was an incident where he was involved with another girl, it completely shattered me and our relationship, but I decided to forgive him. Ever since then, sex is painful, unenjoyable, and I am just doing it so that he feels physically satisfied. 
I always tense up and close my eyes, just waiting for it to be over and it makes me feel awful. I don’t want to make my boyfriend feel like he is violating me, but I also just never feel the way I’m “supposed to feel”
Is my relationship doomed? Is there no hope after a betrayal? 
I also want to mention I have been converting to Catholicism for the past year, so there is a great deal of religious conviction that plays into it. It I had it my way we would just re-wait u til marriage, but I know he has physical needs and I don’t want to deny him. 
I could use some advice or if someone could just analyze the situation to the best of their ability I would greatly appreciate it

Edit: I wasn’t expecting so many people to reply to this so I thought I should maybe go more in depth.
Yes, it is obvious that I don’t want to be having sex while we are engaging, but I verbally give consent as I just feel awful to deny him. I have recently communicated these feelings with my boyfriend, and he is respectful, but I know that I am depriving him of one of the key components in a relationship. Yes, he has hurt me in the past but since being held accountable he has changed his ways completely. He is kind, loving, protective, and patient. This is why I am feeling conflicted. I want to be able to repair our relationship but I feel like it is me who is preventing that from happening

Also I understand that not everyone is religious and I respect that. I didn’t put that in to ask for peoples thoughts on my religion, just to give a little more details to the situation :)

ANSWER: The tension and lack of interest may be your body’s way of telling you that you are not over the betrayal.

Listen to what your body is telling you. Please stop letting him do this; you don’t want it, and his needs are not a good enough reason to put yourself through this. If you ever want a healthy sex drive and sex life, you will listen to your body and only have sex when you are fully comfortable and genuinely want to.

QUESTION: My wife (34F) is pregnant and realized she doesnt want a kid. I (34M) dont know what to do. Please help.

Hi everyone, I'm on mobile, so apologies for any typos in advance. Also, this is going to be a long post since I want to give you as much detail as I can.

We decided to have a child last February and visited an obstetrician. The first one we visited scared us shitless, saying my wife didn't have any eggs, asked why we didn't try earlier, and recommended IVF (I do not live in the US or Europe, so it's normal for doctors to scare people for more money).

I try to support her as best as I can. I found another doctor with good recommendations. This one told us that everything was looking fine, to go and have sex, and to come again if she was pregnant or didn't conceive in a year.

This was around March, so we have been trying since then. It was hard, with negative tests at the end of each month. My wife quickly began to question why she wasn't conceiving due to the trauma of the first doctor. I always tried to support her and told her it was normal, that it could take up to a year or more.

In August, I lost my favorite aunt. I asked her many times to let me be with my family for the first week (as is our custom) and asked for her support. But she was aggressive towards me since we weren't having sex. She even told me, crying, that she wanted a child.

Three weeks ago, we learned that she is pregnant. Now she is seven weeks pregnant. It was great at first, but a week later, she started telling me that she is afraid to change her life. According to her, we have a very good life, and she doesn't want to change it. Now she is telling me that she doesn't want this child at all. She tells me she doesn't feel anything at all.

I mean, I am lost. I never spoke negatively with her. I told her to please remember why we wanted this child in the first place. I told her that we would make great parents. I told her that I would help her with everything. I told her that giving up would make me feel sad and heartbroken. I don't know what else I could say.

I really want this child, and if we abort this pregnancy, I don't think our marriage will last. This feels like the ultimate betrayal to me. We wanted this together for months; we were both sad when her period came. I mean, she even didn't support me during my mourning period. But when we succeeded, she decided she doesn't want it. I mean, why? I don't want to force her to give birth to a child she doesn't want, so I keep these ideas to myself.

Could you please give some guidance about what I should do? Especially women who may have experienced something similar?

ANSWER: Is therapy something thats available in your country? I think theres a strong possibility that she's reeling from the hormones and the stressful journey you two had to go through to get to this point.

QUESTION: My (M/44) wife (F39) has hated every job she’s ever had and it’s starting to affect our marriage. How do I support her without burning out?

My wife and I have been together for 13 years. In that time she has had seven jobs. The pattern is always the same. She starts a new job, feels good about it for a short time, then the complaints begin. She says her managers don’t treat her well, she sees any feedback as “getting in trouble,” and she feels unhappy almost every day.

I have worked at two of the same places she did. The jobs had normal ups and downs, but nothing close to what she describes. I know work isn’t perfect for anyone, but her level of stress and frustration seems far beyond what most people deal with.

She is always looking for a new job, and each time she starts somewhere new she believes it will be different. It never lasts more than a few months before things go back to the same place.

I want to support her, but I’m starting to feel worn down. I listen, I try to give advice, and I try to help her see things in a balanced way. Nothing seems to help. I’m worried that if this cycle continues, it will take a toll on both of us.

I don’t know how to talk to her about this without sounding dismissive or unsupportive. I also don’t know how to set boundaries so I can support her without carrying all of her stress.

ANSWER: Some people hate being managed. These people usually start their own companies or become consultants, and find out the grass isn’t always greener when you have customers directly giving you feedback or no one lined up to buy your product. But some people thrive.

QUESTION: Accidentally send nude to another person, how to comfort husband (M21, F25)

I'm sorry for the long post this whole situation is complicated. My husband recently cheated on me and we're attempting to work it out. Another couple who we're friends with just broke up due to the girlfriend cheating. (Unrelated to my relationship)

I was on the phone with my husband when he asked for a picture. I was stupid and didn't double check the contact I clicked. I was messaging the mutual friend and sending him pictures for a 3D printed project he was making for me. I accidentally sent him the nude. He immediately messaged me, telling me I sent him something wrong. I told my husband something happened, hung up and called the friend crying asking him to please not look at it, to please delete it because it was not meant for him. He told me he didn't look and deleted it. I apologized again and hung up. I called my husband back and told him what happened. I told him it was a complete accident and apologized to him. He said it was fine and we moved on from it. Afterwards I called the female friend (the other man's ex) and explained the situation. I told her I wanted to be clear on what happened, that it was an accident and that I'd never betray her like that. I told her I valued her friendship and didn't want to hold it from anyone. She thanked me and we ended the call.

Well today after my husband left for work he got a call from the female friend. They talked and from what I was told it was suggested that I did it on purpose. My husband is now (rightfully) upset and telling me that I really got even with him. Everyone is mad at me and I get it, it was a big fuck up. How can I make this right for everyone? I've tried apologizing, showing them it was an accident, offering to cut contract, but nothing is being heard. They decided I did it on purpose so I'm a cheat now. I feel so embarrassed and guilty. I just want to fix my mistake.

Edit to clarify: the ex is also my friend. I told her because I felt guilty and didn't want anything to be hidden or twisted.

ANSWER: So, the two cheaters have gotten together and decided that now you’re a cheater?  They’re both trying to make you like them simply to make themselves feel better.  You’ve apologized for the mistake.  You’ve owned it and you owe those two nothing more.

QUESTION: How to be okay with the fact that I can’t fulfill my boyfriend’s fetish? 22F 25M

If your partner had a fetish that involved something you could never be/do, and ONLY watched this type of porn (he doesn’t watch any other kind) to fulfill that fetish, how would you handle that? It makes me feel as though I’m not enough, because I can never fulfill his kink, or like surely he’d want to explore it in person one day, with someone who can.

He tells me he would try it if given the chance (and we weren’t together), but that it’s not a big deal that I can’t give him that. But I don’t think that made me feel any better.

Does anybody have any experience with this? I always feel like even though we have a good sex life, he always fantasizes about these other things. It’s really impacting my self esteem.

Edit: I didn’t want to go into details but since everyone is telling me I should I guess I will. When I first learned about it, he said it was just anal he was into. Which I know is pretty standard for men. But, I was sexually assaulted when I was younger like this, so the thought of engaging in that kind of act just to please him makes me feel very uncomfortable. And I know people might say “it’s better when you practice” or “when you’re with someone you trust” but I just do not want that at all.

Then, I learned that it’s not just anal hes into but specifically trans women/femboy kinda porn. And again I have looked this kinda stuff up before and people said maybe he secretly wants to be pegged. I’ve asked him about that and he said no!

So there you go, it’s both something I can’t be for him and won’t give him simultaneously. Hopefully this clarifies the situation a bit.

ANSWER: Browsing the responses, was a lot of garbage so here's my two cents.

So your partner is aroused by anal and you aren't into it. Okay, let's pretend your partner was into sushi but someone made you eat rotten sushi in the past and you don't like it. Where's the problem? Conflicting needs, right? What to do? Talk about it, set boundaries, find a compromise.

If you are okay with him eating sushi (virtually and alone), great! But if hearing about it makes you feel left out or insufficient then you need to have boundaries about discussing it (he shouldn't keep bringing it up). If knowing he likes sushi at all is upsetting to you, you need to ask yourself why. Is he eating sushi all the time? Is he often choosing to eat sushi instead of spend time with you? Is he pressuring you to eat sushi even though you've communicated you don't want to? Is he lying to you about eating sushi?

If he is not lying, hiding, pressuring you, or addicted to this porn then you have to handle these emotions with self-soothing and regulation. All relationships are going to have conflict and compromise. You have to set your boundaries and your partner has to set theirs and respect yours.

To set your boundaries you need to check in with yourself. Tbh, "how to be okay with" sounds like trying to force something. I'd advise that you instead try to just identify what feelings this situation brings up. From your post it sounds like you feel insecure, frustrated, pressured, and guilty. None of your response are wrong or inappropriate. You are totally valid in your feelings, but handling those feelings sucks.

From your partners point of view, it sounds like they are somewhat bicurious. Cool. A lot of guys are. But most men are so steeped in homophobic shame they never tell anyone, although femboy memes have become the new way to jokingly let it out. In other words, your partner feels safe enough to tell you. So seriously, good job for being a person he can feel safe with! You sound like a really caring and compassionate person and I want you to know you are amazing for that. I'm sorry relationships are tricky :{

Also I am SO sorry to hear you were abused. I (man) was also sexually abused as a child and as an adult have to navigate the way it messed up my sexuality. It's never fun and there is nothing good about it, but the work we do to grow and love ourselves makes us kinder people.

Godspeed struggler.

PS for those who say he is going to cheat. Eat shit, bisexual or bi-curious people =/= cheater. Selfish jerks = cheaters. So unless he has given her reason to believe he is trying to cheat or lies or seems genuinely addicted/compulsive or has other shitty manipulative behaviors that someone who would cheat has then no. Being attracted to femboys doesn't mean you'll cheat. I've been in a monogamous heterosexual partnership for 10 years, about 6 years in I finally accepted I'm bisexual even though I'd been hiding bisexual porn use for our whole relationship. You see I was abused as a kid and deeply ashamed/rejecting of my bisexuality. I certainly was addicted to bisexual porn. Yet I NEVER cheated. I never will cheat. It's not like because I never banged a guy I'm gonna cheat. I never got to bang a goth girl either, that doesn't mean I'll throw away a relationship so I can blow my load. If you think people who have fetishes cheat, what I hear is "I'm terrified I'm not good enough because peoples sexuality is larger than me". To which I need you to know, you are worth WAY more than what you provide sexually. Even if that's what the internet is pushing.

EDIT: Wow, all the upvotes and nice comments. Y'all made me cry. And I'm an emotional-repressed-from-childhood-man so like wtf. Am I healing? Is therapy working? hahaha

QUESTION: My wife 24f just told me 24m that she has been faking her orgasms for 5+ years

I have no idea where to start. My wife and I, at the time we met were 17 and 18 and were in high school together. Spending every sore moment together in and out of school just as friends at first, we grew quite fond of each others presence. One day I asked her if she would like to start a relationship, she said yes and so would begin the best relationship I’ve ever had.

2 years down the road we get married and we now have a little one. I absolutely love the girl I fell in love with and the woman she is now, but she’s been hiding something from me. She’s been lying to me for years.

I guess she’s had her mind on this for some time because just today while she was at work, she texts me that “we need a compromise about sex”. Well that set off the heart alarm very quickly. She doesn’t bring things up like this, like this. Never over text.

Anyway we get through the conversation over text and I feel very hurt. I mean she’s been my girl forever it feels like, and she told me she’s been lying to me for the better half of it. Faking almost all orgasms for the past 4 years. She’s on her way home now and I’d just like some advice on how to open up a deeper conversation about this. I want to tell her exactly how this makes me feel but I also don’t want to punish her for being honest by yelling and making her feel bad.

I know I just need to calm down but I don’t know how to handle being lied to like this. The most intimate part of my life with my most favorite person has mostly been a lie. How do I go about letting her know how she made me feel while also getting to the bottom of a healthy sexual relationship that we both are satisfied with, WITHOUT “punishing” her for being honest?

2 HOURS LATER EDIT: We had a great conversation about the topic. And for all of those that maybe struggling in the literacy department, no I did not yell at her, and no I was not angry towards her. That’s what I was trying to avoid by venting on this wonderful platform.

Thank you to everyone so much for the commentary, it really is a blessing to have strangers care enough to leave us with some advice on moving forward in a relationship.

ANSWER: “getting to the bottom of a healthy sexual relationship that we both are satisfied with” > letting her know exactly and in great detail how this makes you feel

Lock in. Treat it as both of you against a problem, not you against her.

QUESTION: I (27M) was shown a screen recording of my girlfriend's (33F) Tinder profile.

I (27M) was sent a screen recording of my girlfriend's (33F) Tinder profile.

Background info I suppose? My girlfriend and I have been dating for over two years and we've been living together for a year and a half. I work in the ER and on the ambulance so I work long 12 hour shifts, days and sometimes nights.

I clocked out of my shift at the hospital earlier today and was walking out with a couple of my nurse friends asked me to wait for them so we could walk out together. I didn't think much of it as the three of us are super close due to trauma bond and working together for about two years now. As we got outside and into the parking lot my friend, who we will call Anna, said "Hey, I need to show you something and I'm sorry that I am the one showing you." Anna pulls up her phone and says "Alyssa was swiping on Tinder and came across this profile..." She turns her phone and shows me a screen recording that Alyssa took of her Tinder and the profile. Sure as shit, it my girlfriend. The only thing is that ALL the photos are old. Like I am positive that these are old photos because they're all photos I came across on her Facebook after we became friends at a previous job we both worked at.

Obviously regardless of the age of the photos, seeing my girlfriend's Tinder profile popping up on my friends phone was quite a shock. They both apologized profusely again, told me they loved me and that I could call them tonight to talk if need be since we're all off tomorrow. I told Anna to send me the video, gave them a hug and left.

On the way home I was talking to Gemini about Tinder profiles and how long they stay active after the app is uninstalled, or whatever the case. From what I can find online, it seems odd that her profile would be active after over two years. I'm home now, my girlfriend noticed something was up with me but I told her we would talk about it later, after her class and after her son (10M) has gone to bed.

I just want to know how I should approach this?

Thanks in advance.

TLDR; My coworker showed me a video of my girlfriend's Tinder profile, but the photos are old. We've been together for 2 years and I feel like it's unlikely that her profile would still be active after that long.

ANSWER: Yo if someone’s tinder account is showing up, they’ve been active in recent months. If they’re inactive it doesn’t show the profile after a certain amount of time. If you’ve been dating for two years then uhhhh I have bad news for you unless it’s someone using her photos and name

QUESTION: My 22F boyfriend 23M have recently been struggling due to his family finding out I don't politically align with them. Despite never really getting to know me

Hello, I am looking for advice, sorry if it gets long. My boyfriend (BF) and I have been dating for a while and our relationship itself is great. He is kind, supportive and we are able to resolve problems well. My issues isn't necessarily with him but his family. When we first started dating, we had an honest talk about values. I told him I wasn't a fan or supported Trump/MAGA, but I don't automatically dislike republicans. I believe you can be republican without being apart of that group. He told me that he wasn't very political, which was valid at the time as he wasn't fully a citizen and couldn't vote. He was very receptive of views and understanding. We were able to connect on values like loyalty, goals, relationships and security, so we went for it.

Early on I found red flags (not sure what else to call them) with his family. These are all within the first month to two months of dating. I will list them below:

His dad admitted to Facebook stalking me, right after our first date.
 His dad and mother admitted to driving by my apartment to "scope the scene". I really don't know why but it was before we even meet.
 They added my apartment to their family Life360
 They (parents and his brothers) constantly call/text him, which isn't inherently bad, but can feel intrusive. It has also affected our plans before.
 They expect a lot of time out of my boyfriend and aren't really considerate of it. After he is done working 7-5pm he goes to their family work shop and helps them many days.
 They are very traditional about gender roles and dress codes for women.

Now to talk about our relationships with our families. Spending time with his family has been rough. They make racist "jokes" (I am Native American, my BF and his mom are Hispanic), homophobic comments and generally dismiss me in conversation. His father also likes to make sexual jokes and on one occasion made a sexual joke about the Land O Lakes women, who is Native American, in front of BFs mom. I am an advocate, so I do public speaking, and every job I've had it was important to have good communication skills. I have no issues talking to people, but with his family it feels like I'm stonewalled. On the other hand, my family treats my BF like their own son and grandson. They take an interest in his life and follow up on what he has going on. This honestly makes me a little envious.

So to get to what made me make this post. Recently things shifted. His mom followed me on TikTok and saw some reposts I made (memes/political clips, not exactly polite ones) about immigration, racism, abortion, etc. If you are not familiar with TikTok reposts, basically when you repost you are sharing someone else’s video to your own followers, making it appear in their feed. They sat my BF down to question my “morals” and whether our relationship could last. The ironic part? My BF had already seen those posts, we discussed them calmly, and we’re fine. They also told him we need to use the "Bible" and our faith in our relationship. His family has never even tried to ask me directly about my values, my background, or who I am. They don’t know basic things like my major, my goals, or even that I want to go to law school.

The part that’s wearing me down: I don’t fully trust my BF now. He reassures me and says “that’s just how they are,” but I can’t shake the thought. What if deep down he agrees with them? What if he feels the same way but just isn’t saying it? He tells me it takes them "time" to get comfortable, but they haven't even tried. I feel like I have been doing my part by trying to get to know them. I love him, but I feel disrespected and alienated by his family, and the lack of trust is creeping into my relationship. Now they've agreed to have a "sit down conversation" about the TikTok moral debate.

My question is: How do I handle this? Do I take this as a red flag for the future? If we have the sit down what to even say? I have some ideas but its just so complex to even have one approach in my head. Has anyone else gone through this? Or has anyone else dated someone who's family was polar opposite like this? And how did that turn out?

ANSWER: So here’s the deal… whether he agrees with them or not, he should be defending you. If his family is being rude or making you uncomfortable, he should stick up for you. As far as the “that’s how they are” thing goes, that will only get worse. I’ve been there, done that. The insults escalated and all I got back was, “You know that’s just how she is.” That being said, tell him his family makes you uncomfortable, and explain why. You can’t change them, but you can avoid them. If he’s not okay with that, then you might want to reconsider the relationship. Also, I’m not sure if you plan on having children at all in the future. Say this were to play out and you got married and started a family. Are these people who you would want to share your child with? It would be their grandchild. Do you want your child exposed to that type of conversation and environment? It is seriously something to consider.

QUESTION: My (39M) wife (38F) cheated on me five years ago and I just found out about it. Not sure of the path forward.

Throwaway for obvious reasons.  So this is a long story so apologies for the rambling.  My wife and I have been married for seven years however we’ve been together for 18 years altogether.  We started dating in college and we were together for a while before we got married about seven years ago.  She’s always been a big drinker and that’s been a point of contention for us.   My dad is also an alcoholic so I think I just chose the wrong partner possibly as I’m attracted to the chaos.

There were several red flags early on that I chose to ignore because she was very attractive and, smart and had a good career.  Majority of our fights always stemmed around drinking and getting way too drunk and putting herself in precarious situations.

Five years ago, we were drinking at our house as we typically did with friends and she was incredibly drunk.  It’s about 1 AM and I decided to go to bed and herself, one of my guy friends and another one of our girlfriends were still there.   I went to bed because I was exhausted and I tried to get her to come to bed and she refused.  She was adamant that she was not going to bed so I didn’t force the issue.

The next day, she was acting very weird and I was walking past the bathroom and she was in there with her friend talking and I overheard her say “I’m absolutely freaking out. I don’t know what to do.”  So she came out of the bathroom and I called her on it.  She made a big story up about how our guy friend told her the night prior that he had feelings for her and she wasn’t sure how to handle it.   And that’s what was freaking her out.   I confronted him about it and he gave me a different story and said that she slid next to him on the couch, but that was all that happened.

We got into a major argument about it, but I didn’t have any proof that anything happened despite their stories not lining up.  Fast forward to last week.  I was talking to another buddy on FaceTime and he mentioned this guy’s name.   My wife’s face turned white and she looked incredibly uncomfortable.   So I called her on it and said why do you look so weird and she said “I thought I saw someone outside of our front door.”   It’s a very dumb response and clearly made her look like she was lying.   So I’ve been sitting on this for about a week and then a few days back I talked to my buddy and asked him if he would talk to our other friend to see if anything happened several years ago.   Keep in mind the guy who was at our house that I think my wife fooled around with was married at the time but now he’s divorced so he has no reason to lie.   I’ve caught my wife in several lies over the years though nothing of this magnitude.

So my buddy asked this guy if anything ever happened and he paused and finally admitted that they made out that night in my living room (when I was asleep 20 feet away.). I’m not an idiot and highly doubt that was all that happened given everyone was incredibly drunk.   He assumed that I knew about it and we just worked through it because it had been so many years.

I haven’t confronted my wife about it yet, but I’m leaning towards a divorce given we have other issues and this just crushes me, knowing she lied to my face when I asked her about it and has been lying for five years.  The kicker is I just moved across country to be closer to her family and we have a three-year-old son that I am absolutely terrified of having joint custody because I won’t get to see him as much and he’s the love of my life.  We also just moved into a rental home with a 1 year lease so it would be tough financially for either of us to move right now, and I can’t bear the thought of kicking her out because she would definitely take my son with her.

Also, I haven’t confronted her yet because I’ve read on here and other subreddits that you should speak to an attorney first.  It’s been very challenging to not bring it up and her family is coming later this week so I will have to continue to hide it for a couple more days.

I’ve already started researching attorneys though and going to try to get a free consult later this week.  What would you do in my shoes?  Any advice from people that have gone through something similar would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

ANSWER: The marriage is toast, I'm sorry. If you stay for the child, you'll be miserable with her.

Talk to the lawyer and figure out your options there. Only solid advice there is. I'm sorry, OP.

QUESTION: concerning behavior, intercourse while i’m asleep from my boyfriend 22F 24M

is this concerning behavior? so for the past month i’ve been awoken during the night to my boyfriend having intercourse with me. it varies from him fingering me to actually forcing himself inside of me. if i randomly wake up to it before it gets to the point that he’s inside i roll over onto my stomach (then he’ll start messing with my butthole …), moan disapprovingly, or the last time- i pushed him away. hard. One time he did it we spoke about it the next day and he admitted that it wasn’t okay at all but that he thought I was awake, but I know i showed no signs of this and the fact that it has happened multiple times? he also tried to say he thought it was okay because i was wet but i’m pretty sure that was just my body betraying me because he was fingering me in my sleep. is this something normal or is it a big deal and i’m just downplaying it?

ANSWER: yes, this is typically called rape. if it feels bad to you it's never okay. if you aren't consenting it's never okay. if he admits he knows it's bad ITS REALLY NOT OKAY, because most of the time guys will try to defend themselves first. get rid of this guy immediately, for real.

QUESTION: My (30F) husband (35F) won’t apologize to my parents. Should he at all?

(Edit: husband is male)

Hey everyone. My husband and I had this huge fight on my birthday and he humilliated me, called me names, was totally out of control and asked for divorce (for context, we have been struggling because I accepted a temporary job on a different city 4 hours drive from where we live and I had to move).

Now my parents get to the scene. After our fight I grabbed my stuff and went to my parents. My mom and dad were horrified and my husband has thrown similar tantrums(but no that awful) before.

Few weeks later my husband and I patch the wound, but my parents are still very upset and demanding an apology from my husband for the way he treated me. My husband doesn’t want to apologize (and I agree with him), but now we won’t have christmas together. Any tips on how to solve this?

ANSWER: I am once again begging women to have some self-respect and to not waste their one precious life on men who hate them.

QUESTION: My husband (33m) hates me (33f) so much and I don’t know why I’m still even hanging on to this….

There’s way too much details to this so let me just share a recent thing that been happening. Why I’m even sharing this, idk… I just feel horrible inside and alone…. Since we had kids this relationship has been holding on by threads. My threads. He cut all his already it would seem….

To preface this story a little I do ALL the house work, wake up early with the kids every single morning since they arrived and do any overnight things they may need, we split bills 50/50. If any cooking is done it’s done by me… like literally he won’t even turn off a light like a normal person. I have this one light I leave on overnight and always forget to turn off, rather than just shutting it off he unscrews the lightbulb because it’s going to “teach me a lesson”

So to the main event that’s happening right now, it’s my son’s 5th birthday. I planned the whole party and made all the arrangements and invitations. This was an outdoor party with a bounce house. I obviously did any upkeep of the house that I could, but I also work long days Thursday and Fridays. We have two kids 2 and 4 and they make a mess when they play like any other kid…. He has Thursday off and comes home at 6 on Fridays keep in mind…

Saturday comes. Party day. It’s at 1pm… I’m up at 630am per usual with the kids. I get their day started and am running around doing last minute party stuff. He sleeps in til at least 930/10. I had asked him to come to Walmart with us for an hour, I begged and he would not…. He wanted me to help him with morning wood first, with the kids right on my heels that was impossible and we were running out of time…. So I just leave. Keep getting the party set up. He gets up and gets right on Xbox playing rocket league for hourssss….

His sister shows up a little early as she always does and starts picking up what she could on the inside of the house. I made the asshole comment of “well it’s suppose to be outdoors so we don’t really need to clean up too much in here”. Looking back now that comment was snarky but I was fully annoyed that he was sitting there playing video games til about 1130 not helping…. According to him that comment set him off and he was pissed. Pissed that the kitchen was “left a mess and that I always do everything last minute”

When I tell you I had no clue this comment I made, made him mad. I didn’t even know he heard it…. But this is where he says he got mad. Earlier that day nana (grandma) dropped off a brand new power wheels toy to surprise my son with later on. I figured AFTER the party. But we had no real plans. We didn’t discuss it. We continue through the party. Half way through with 15 other kids there he pulls out the power wheels toy… I asked him “please please don’t do this now” “please wait” “please wait for your mom to come back” he looked at me with a death stare and through the remote to the power wheels and broke it….at the party with guests there…

Goes inside super pissed at me, my son just finds the power wheel toy sitting there, so we didn’t get the big “wow factor” out of it… nana missed it entirely.

So my son rides all around the yard and of course all the other kids want turns, kids are crying, someone got their toes ran over…. It’s a mess honestly.

I go find him because the garage is locked and he is the only one with a key, ask him to please put it away and he angrily shouts in front of guests “why are you telling me?!” His friend had to remind him he has the only key…. They got out and put it away. Party ends like a few hours later.

730 at night now, the party is over, nana came back to help with clean up and getting kiddos to bed. He just left with his friends and said nothing to me. He ignored my calls for an hour and half. Apparently he was at the bar….

Now it’s been over a week and he will barely look at me still… won’t hug me, touch me, sleep our bed…. We go through a cycle like this seemingly every three to four months where he flips out but eventually comes back around sort of… I don’t really need advice I just feel like I’m loosing my mind…. Maybe I am the problem… maybe I cause this anger in him before the day even starts… I don’t know what I wanted from telling this story except to not feel so alone all the time…

ANSWER: Honey, choose you and the kids. He's abusive and he will teach your kids, especially your son, to abuse women. It's time to go. You can do it. His anger will only continue to get worse as the years go by. He will become even more violent. He will cheat or already has. He's evil. Please be smart and thorough in leaving, but absolutely leave. He's a monster.

QUESTION: Update: All signs point to my(F27) husband (M27) having cheated on me. Friends agree. He says he didn’t.

Hi everyone! This is an update to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kt3l4k/all_signs_point_to_myf27_husband_m27_having). You can see the comments there, but as the post itself is deleted, [here is a link to the screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/m3x2zNN). To everyone saying stuff like "I knew she wouldn't leave him" or pushing me for an update: I told y'all I'd take my time lol.

Long story short, my husband and I are officially over. I won't go into too many details, but there were things I needed to do before getting to this point, and they have now been done. Thank you everyone for the advice given!

Posts require a question, so here's mine: would you stay with someone who cheated on you?

ANSWER: Adult child of a serial cheater here, yep. Would kill more than just trust, I would lose all respect.

QUESTION: My wife (41F) told me her fantasy is to watch me (44M) have sex with another woman.

My wife and I have been married 8 years, together for 12. We are exclusive, no open relationships, swinging or cheating. Last night we were drinking and talking about our fantasies. I told her mine, and then she hits me with her fantasy, me having sex with another woman while she watches. She swears it is not a trap. Prior to marriage we had a few threesomes, always MFF. The only rule then was I could not have penetrative sex with the other girl. I asked if this was some kind of exchange, like does she want me to do the same? She says no, which is great bc I have no interest in watching her with another man. The conversation went on and I believe she is serious about it. We discussed where would we even find a willing participant. In the moment, I thought this is hot, let’s do it. But now that I’ve slept on it, I’m thinking it’s probably a bad idea. Any advice on how to handle this?

ANSWER: Yeah man. I agree with other comment. Don’t do it. Let her know you’ve thought on it and while you want to fulfill her fantasy, fidelity to your marriage and vows is paramount to your values. At least that’s what I’d say. Too many moving parts leads to too many moving hearts.

QUESTION: My 19F boyfriend M19 took too many pills and now his life is falling apart, how do i support him without selling myself short?

Hi everyone, my boyfriend and I have been together for two years and I really like our relationship and he is very loving. We both use party drugs occasionally (about 1-3 times a month). However, about half a year ago he discovered Benzos. He doesn’t do them daily, sometimes to sleep. But 3 times now he has completely overdone it, he is a heavy (strong and tall) man but obv he can’t handle taking 10-13 pills in a go (i don’t know the dosage).

The last time before yesterday was in August when i was on vacation. Between midnight and 6am i was on the phone with different people trying to get him home somehow, i was worried sick and it was a horrible experience. Also in my experience people on Benzos aren’t nice. He drove to where i was the next day to apologize.

Yesterday we had set up a date at 10:30am at a park. We were both really excited the day before. Then in the morning he has taken a lot again, i could barely tslk to him. He let me wait for about 40 minutes and then kept giving me other informations until after two hours of looking for him i found him asleep in his car where he lives. I managed to bring him home (he weights double my weight) and he was constantly very very rude and mean. He made fun of me crying and was angry the entire time. He couldn’t walk straight and barely actually talk. He also got aggressive but not towards me. I got him in his bed and sat there for 4 hours watching him to make sure he will wake up. Suddenly his dad stands in the room (his parents aren’t together and he lives with his mom who isn’t in town rn but he was worried about him).

Everything blew up and his parents aren’t the best or loving so it wasn’t good. His mom called me later to tell me how she wants to kick him out and has no empathy for him at all (she has been an alcoholic his entire life).

I haven’t talked to him yet. How do I approach him? I want to be supportive with the situation with his parents but I am very hurt myself.

+ he obv didn’t show up to work that day so he might loose his job

EDIT: to clear up some confusion: I’m not from the US or UK so sorry for any grammar errors (also explains confusions about me studying law at 19 or being a bartender in a club) & about my drug use I get yours concerns and will keep them in mind, right now I’m pretty okay with where I am

UPDATE: I’m overwhelmed by the amount of attention this got, thank you for everyone taking the time to give me genuine advice. 
We have talked, he apologized a lot and decided to get any help he could get, his talk with his parents hasn’t happened yet so we will see how it goes (his mom changes her opinion by the hour, one day she’s smoking weed wirh us at 17 in the kitchen, the next she was threatening to call the police on us for smelling like weed when we got home). He apologized a lot, for the whole situation, for retraumatizing (is that a word in English???) me after my sister tried to end it with the same shit last spring and especially he was very ashamed that he got so aggressive (not towards me but in front of me what also made me scared). He could barely remember anything from yesterday. He said he doesn’t wanna be like that and promised to make a plan he will present me by Friday what he will do to change, including finding therapy and somehow convincing his parents to support him. I’m gonna give him this chance. Many of you will probably be glad to hear that i told my dad about the situation. My boyfriend agreed to this so that i don’t have to deal with it alone. I love my dad and he is very kind person who hasn’t always had  it easy either. He will support me and him no matter what i decide to do.

And to everyone who has been sending me sexual messages what the hell is wrong with you.

ANSWER: That’s a lot of benzos to be taking in one go. You say he doesn’t do it daily, but I’d bet my last ££ he’s taking more than you think, if he’s even considering taking ten at once.

You’re so young and it isn’t your responsibility to help someone with their drug addictions. I’d truly recommend you both try and find some support in getting off these “party drugs” and support for your bpd etc.

QUESTION: My boyfriend ‘M/24’ asked for a threesome with my ‘F/22’ bestfriend ‘F/21’. How do I deal with that?

So… I’m still trying to wrap my head around this whole situation, because it feels messy in a way I didn’t expect. I’ll explain everything slowly so it makes sense.

My boyfriend, my bestfriend, and I hang out together a lot. Not in a weird way, more like we just have the same humor, the same energy, and it’s easy to be a trio. We go for drinks, chill at home, watch shows together. Nothing ever felt off.

About a week ago, though, my best friend and I were talking about stupid things we did when we were younger. One thing led to another, and that old memory came up, how we hooked up once when we were figuring ourselves out. Nothing romantic, nothing deep, just two curious teenagers trying something and then moving on like it never happened.

I mentioned it to my boyfriend because the topic somehow came up when we were joking about “weird teen stories.” It wasn’t a big confession or anything and more like “lol btw, we hooked up once years ago and it was dumb.” He didn’t act weird about it at the time. He laughed, asked if it was awkward, and we just moved on.

Or so I thought.

Fast-forward to yesterday. We were lying in bed, just talking. Out of nowhere, he brought it up again. He said something like, that since my bestfriend and I already hooked up with each other before, we would probably be comfortable with each other to have a threesome with him because he thinks that it could be really hot.

I kind of froze.

At first, I didn’t even know what to say because on paper it sounds like a simple question. But in reality, my brain immediately went into panic mode.

My bestfriend is omeone who knows everything about me. Someone who’s in my life long-term. Someone I trust. And the idea of my boyfriend wanting to sleep with her, even with me there, hit me in a way I didn’t expect.

I started overthinking everything.

I know people ask for threesomes without bad intentions.

But it still bothered me deeply that the specific person he wants is the one girl who is closest to me, the one girl who’s always around us.

And the worst part is: now I don’t know how to act around either of them. I don’t like the idea of them being together.

I don’t know if I’m overreacting, if it’s a red flag, or if it’s just an awkward situation I have to talk through carefully. I don’t want to accuse him of anything, but I also don’t want to pretend it didn’t mess with my feelings.

Edit:

My boyfriend and I talked and I posted an update.

ANSWER: Threesomes are a bell that can't be unrung, the same as asking to open a relationship. For a lot of partners, once it's said it changes the dynamics and how you view the other. I think there's additional damage in knowing he selected someone, even if his mind went to what you'd find comfortable.

Threesomes almost always destroy relationships and have to be an enthusiastic yes because I can promise you it won't be as hot as he's thinking. So you have a couple of options here: you can talk to him about this and find out if he just wants a threesome or if he wants one with her in particular. The latter? I don't think you can come back. The former? He was admitting a fantasy. If there's no other red flags and you think you can move past it, let him know you'd never want one and not to bring it up again. If he brings it up again? Break up with him. Don't get pressured into an act by a partner.

QUESTION: My wife (26f) cheated on me (25m) and i dont know what to do?

My wife (26f) recently admitted she cheated on me (25m) with her ex. So my wife and i have been together for over 5 years now and we have an almost 3 year old. We have always had really good communication and kept nothing to ourselves. Recently she went to a concert and her ex was in town and asked if i would mind if she took him as i was staying home looking after our daughter. I didnt mind as he was an ex from around 10 years ago and i thought i could trust her. I also helped pay for her hotel as she wanted to have a night out and she deserves it. A few days after the concert she admitted to him confessing his love and they made out for 3+ minutes and he took her shirt off, he than said she will regret this so they stopped but she admitted that she probably would of went all the way. Some backstory also this isnt the first time she has been unfaithful as a few years ago she told me someone close to her offered her money for nudes and as we were not in the best financial situation she sent them. I forgave her as we just had our daughter but it took me awhile to get over it. I just dont know what to do. I have moved to my mums for the time being but she is upset with me how fast i uped and left but it was purely in panic. I do love her with all my being and she is the best thing to ever happen to me i just cant seem to get the image of her making out half naked in a hotel room with another man. Just seeking advice on what others think about my situation. I might add also that recently our relationship hasnt been all sparks and rainbows as we both work full time and once we get home we just focus on our daughter so we rarely get date nights or alot of us time.

ANSWER: "they made out for 3+ minutes and he took her shirt off, he than said she will regret this so they stopped " - if you actually believe this, i have some magic beans to sell you.

QUESTION: I (23F) slept with my bestfriend (23M) of years and I am so confused now..

So I’m a 23F and my good friend and I since the 6th grade 23M recently slept together. There has never been any past “history” between us at all. He did confess to having a crush on my our freshman year I had a little crush on him in like the 6th grade as well but that’s strictly it and we never confessed it till years later (last year) he knows my family has known all of my previous partners and vice versa. Anywhooo we’ve been hanging out a lot more recently I come over we have a couple beers watch football or movies sometimes have dinner and a drink and we call it a night. About 3 weeks ago is when it first happened, I gave him oral for like 10 minutes before stopping and realizing omg I’m gonna regret this tmr. We spoke about it 2 days later he said we were both drunk and that it was completely okay. We both did not feel forced at all I wanna make that clear and he made it clear as well. He also stated im the #1 person he confides in and that he doesn’t wanna lose our friendship I agreed. We were both very apologetic to each other. 
We didn’t hangout for a few days and didn’t talk as we consistently do for about a week before everything went back to normal. 
I honestly will say and be truthful he is so attractive, in the past I always thought of him as like an aww he’s adorable but as we’ve gotten older especially the last year I’m like woah he’s a good looking guy but I wouldn’t DARE try anything…… till I did. Last week we hung out, had dinner at his place then watched movies as we were drinking. He went on and on about my hands being so soft (for reference I was  handing him my vape) I end up giving him a back massage then he does me and boom my shirt is off lol… I honestly will say I was really really turned on. I kissed him and we went all the way. He was so GENTLE in a caring nd loving way. I texted him the next morning saying “idk if you wanna talk about it or not but I probably shouldn’t have kissed u I apologize hope we’re okay?” He replied back saying “it’s all good no worries we’re okay” we’ve been speaking completely normal ever since too. 3 days ago he told me he bought me these plushies from this show I put him on with (the night we had sex) and I was like what the hell?…. He’s a gentleman and has paid for my food In the past but random gifts??? NEVER. Idk if I’m reading too much into it, I’m so delusional too which does not help. 
He’s also the typa guy who no longer believes in love and isn’t the kindest person to himself so I almost see him as someone who just needs someone. That’s the main reason we’ve gotten even closer the last 2/3 years He basically is all alone rarely speaks to parents, only child, literally a handful of friends. Anyways some reason I feel so much adrenaline yet guilt at the same time. I’m so scared I’m falling for him like there’s no way. I feel like he wouldn’t like me back… idk guys I’m venting at this point. I’d love to hear a guys perspective on this if you were him like how would u feel about me? Is this casual like what is this…. oh and I refuse to bring it up anytime soon to him 😭😭. I wanna wait a little while just to see how things are in person. We’re hanging out Sunday for the first time since it happened. He’s giving me the plushies he got me and I’m planning on a spooky basket for him cause why not. I feel bad coming empty handed knowing he got me plushies of my favorite characters. Plus I’ll be eating half the stuff in the basket, anywho I’m done yapping guys I’m sorry I’m spiraling.

UPDATE 10/29. 
We carved pumpkins Sunday, baked brownies, watched a show and had a few beers. Nothing happened but we both had a great time. He thanked me for the spooky basket. Anyways… I asked him today to talk, I asked what it meant to him if it was casual or meant more. He replied saying “it means nothing more”. So yeah.. happily ever after I guess.

ANSWER: I'm much older than you but from my perspective I can't really see the down side to having your best friend that you are also attracted to as your partner for life.

I get what you both express about being afraid to lose what you have. To me that's not a good argument. The chances are that if you don't end up together one or both of you will end up with a long term partner that won't accept a best friend with a romantic and sexual history. The best chance you have of staying friends in the future is to be that partner yourself.

QUESTION: I (27M) started climbing with this girl (24F) from my gym but can't tell if I should keep offering to pay or if she thinks I'm being weird?

I (27M) started climbing with this girl (24F) from my gym about 3 months ago and I'm honestly confused about the whole payment situation when we do outdoor routes.

It started with us just spotting each other on boulder problems but now we've done a couple outdoor trips together. First time I suggested this route about 2 hours away and offered to drive since I have a truck that fits all the gear better. I paid for gas and let her borrow some of my equipment since she mentioned she's still building up her collection and trying to save money for her own rack.

When we stopped for food after I just automatically paid, didn't really think about it. Second trip she drove and suggested breakfast afterward, but when the check came I felt weird letting her pay so I grabbed it again.

Thing is, I definitely like her as more than just a climbing buddy but I can't tell if she's into me or if me paying for everything is making her uncomfortable. She always offers to split stuff but I keep saying no because honestly I have money aside and she's mentioned budgeting for gear, and I was raised to pay when I suggest plans.

But now I'm second guessing everything. Is she being polite when she offers to split? Does she think I'm some controlling guy who won't let women pay? Or worse, does she think I expect something because I'm covering costs?

At the gym our conversations are pretty normal, we talk about routes and random stuff, but I can't get a read on whether she sees these outdoor trips as dates or just climbing sessions.

ANSWER: If you end up telling her how you feel and she doesn’t feel the same, will you in any way regret paying or feel like she took advantage in some way? If you would, you should stop paying. And not saying feeling one way is right or wrong. Let her split it with you next time.

QUESTION: My (25F) husband (29M) wants to get rid of our cat. I love her so much. What can I do?

My husband and I moved into a new apartment at the beginning of the year. There are many stray cats and we fed them. We soon noticed that one of the cats was pregnant and agreed when the time came, we would take care of her and her kittens. She gave birth in April to 4 healthy kittens. We asked friends if they wanted to adopt any and gave away one after three months. A month ago, we found a hungry, motherless kitten about 3 weeks old near our apartment. My husband became attached to her so we're back to 5 cats which is a lot of work and money, but we both agreed that it was manageable.

During the six months we've had her, the mama cat has grown on me so much. She doesn't like to be picked up or cuddled but loves pets and rubbing her head on my legs while I work at my desk. My husband doesn't interact much with Mama Cat because he's usually at work or would rather play with the kittens. When he does interact with her, he picks her up and makes her do little dances which she does not like. My husband is now saying that she is "unfriendly" because she avoids him and because she hissed+accidentally scratched him a few times (twice) when he tried picking her up. He wants to get rid of her since we're moving to a new house. To be clear, this is not because 5 cats is too much, but because he does not want a cat that "doesn't like him." I have tried asking him to feed her so can she associate him with food and will then be less likely to avoid him, but he wont hear it.

I love this cat so much. She is so sweet and has so much personality in her own way. I have read that cats experience emotional trauma if abandoned and I cannot bear to think that she would experience that or go hungry because I couldn't convince my partner to keep her. Is there anything I can say to be more persuasive? Is it not cruel to abandon an animal like that? Is there any chance she will be OK if she stays here?

TL;DR My husband wants to get rid of our cat because she's not friendly enough. I don't know what to do.

ANSWER: "My husband treats an adult cat like a toy, the cat is understandably annoyed by this behavior, and now he wants to get rid of her because he's annoyed that, under his roof, there's a living being that doesn't fully submit to his whims".

Here, I fixed it for you.

QUESTION: 18M 22F her ex sent her a large teddy bear twice my size and 100+ roses and idk what to do about it. any help?

so im 18 and shes 22. we have been in a relationship for 2 months (im not counting 1 month of talking stage) so we talked about our relationship and she said we r 50% official and I can call her my girlfriend in front of my friends and for 100% she needs time. so she has her ex followed on insta. they broke up 2 years ago. today her ex sent her teddy bear which is twice my size and 100+ roses. A LOT OF roses. at first I got embarrassed that I could not buy her those stuff and her ex did (I do buy flowers but not that expensive) at first I told her what shes gonna do with them, like throw them away. and she said no shes keeping them both. I told her "r u gonna put those flowers next to the flowers I gifted you?" and she said "yeah but far away" so yeah im a little bit heartbroken about it. then I said "why did he gift you those stuff when he knows u have a guy" and she said "we talked about it" like she meant we r not 100% official. am I wasting my time here? we had our first kiss too 2 days ago at a party.

edit: she also mentioned that "his just wasting his own money"

also this is my first relationship

also she told me im the only boy she went out on a date in 2 years. some of you mentioned that she bought those flowers and teddy bear but I actually don't know. he spent so much money that its someones one month salary in my country and its just too suspicious. im 1000% sure they have 0 contact and she even said she broke up with him. she also said its not 100% official yet because when she made things official that fast before they did not go well. I really love this girl, and the option to just leave her and stuff just wont work with me

update: she kept flowers and teddy bear when i visited her house

ANSWER: Dude I'd rather be single than this. 
Be with someone who WANT you. None of that situationship/uncommitted stuff, what a way to degrade a human being. I was treated like that until finally I found someone who actually liked me and life is so so much better. I wish I had just left people who treated me like that.

QUESTION: My (33F) husband (33M) was less than supportive through pregnancy, labor & postpartum. Can we overcome this?

I’m 6 months PP and have had a tough time with my husband. A little backstory - we’ve been married for 7 years, together for 10. He’s always wanted children - if I was up to him we’d have at least 3 by now. He didn’t have a great example of support growing up. His dad is an asshole to put it lightly. In our relationship he’s always been supportive of me, but I’m also very independent and low maintenance so he’s used to me taking care of things for myself. My family and friends adore him, etc.

During my pregnancy he wasn’t overly supportive. When I wasn’t feeling good things around the house piled up until I felt better. I got exactly 0 back rubs despite asking and expressing how uncomfortable I was in the last few weeks. He lacked sympathy, honestly. During labor he sat in his chair watching shows on his iPad alone. When I got my epidural he sat in the same chair, did not move. The only “support” if you even can call it that, was telling me to breathe from across the room in said chair. I ended up pushing for hours and needing a c section. He was supportive during that part (from what I can remember - a lot of it is blurry for me) In recovery he didn’t help me out of bed, he just called for a nurse. I see these videos online of women whose husbands helped them shower and change bandaging - I did that all alone. If I asked he would’ve helped but I didn’t want to have to ask. I have to imagine if the roles were reversed I would’ve helped without asking.

Fast forward to coming home, he was overwhelmed (understandably) On day 2 at home he broke down in tears bc he was overwhelmed. At that point I felt like I had to carry a heavier load. We slept downstairs for the first two weeks bc stairs were hard for me and the bed sits high up. In those weeks the baby didn’t want to be put down so we did “shifts” of holding her. I was a freak about safe sleep and during his shifts he’d sleep with her in his arms. My shifts I stayed awake. He slept until 10am every morning. By the time he’d wake up I’d have been through half a day with our daughter. We finally move upstairs where our daughter slept in her bassinet. I did every overnight feeding - I was NOT breastfeeding so it’s not like he couldn’t help. Every morning he’d wake up complaining about being tired while I was lucky if I had 3 hours of sleep broken up. I expressed to him with tears in my eyes multiple times that I felt like I was breaking, I needed help. He would listen and almost think it’s cute how deep of a sleeper he is he just “didn’t hear her” - funny bc he hears his phone ding though…He even had the audacity to be completely serious and complain about his allergies while I had staples in my abdomen.

To say I’m flabbergasted and disappointed by his behavior is an understatement. He is great with our daughter and I knew he’d always be a wonderful father but he really dropped the ball as a partner. I feel robbed of my first pregnancy, birth and PP experience. I love him but I truly don’t know if this is something I can get past. I always wanted more children but I can’t fathom doing this again with such little support and I know it would be harder since our daughter will need to be tended to next time as well. He has apologized but I’m not sure if he’s sorry or if he’s now realizing how big of an impact this is having on our marriage.

He has an issue with our lack of intimacy since pregnancy / birth but I am just so hurt I can’t even bring myself to imagine being intimate with this man right now.

I guess I’m just looking for anyone with similar experiences. I know therapy would be a good move.

ANSWER: Is he a great father though? A great father would have done an overnight feed, made sure safe sleep was happening, and made sure the mornings went smooth for you and baby.

QUESTION: My (34M) wife (37F) had an affair for six years, and explains it with cultural differences

tl;dr: My (34M) chinese wife (37F) of 8 years (15 years as a couple together) had an affair for 6 years, and claims that she started the affair due to my laziness that can be explained due to cultural differences (I am German). But is it really though?

I just found out my wife, that I am together with for 15 years and married for 8 had an affair already for 6 years. Just two years ago we bought a house together and got a daughter together. Her behavior towards me worsened over the years and she became quite hostile. We worked really hard together and were quite successful on so many ways. I got an extremly well paid job at a big corporation in a management position, and she made her small, but very profitable business. However, there has been times where I didnt want to travel because of work. It was around 2 years after our marriage where I decided that that year I didnt want to travel. Already then, she met someone and since then they traveled all the time togehter and became a couple. Because I felt bad for my wife that I couldnt travel with her that year, I supported her to travel as much as she want (I thought with friends). But she traveled so much that it became such a huge burden for me. She traveled 6 to 10 times per year and was away every second or third weekend. This made me extremly burned out and also sad for the relationship. She said I was too lazy for her, but my lack of energy was because of the extreme amount of work we just managed to handle. Since we got our daughter, I did everything necessary to make her life as easy as possible, because I know that its hard for moms at the beginning of having a child.

She argued that she is always so angry at me and could never accept that I couldnt finish things as fast as she wanted it to be finished. Like if I push a task in the future because I was tired, she couldnt accept. Or like we have to have documents done for some passport application or something like that, and I was working until the night before, and then I said "I want to prepare the documents tomorrow because I dont have energy anymore today." She is so angry about it that she said she needed another man who is more like she want her boyfriend/husband to be. But her affair is much younger and they agreed that they dont want to be together and only be together for as long as the man finds a younger woman that her parents can accept in order to make a family.

Now she said this is all due to cultural differences, and she claimed everyone around her (her friends and business partners) agree and support her in her decision to cheat on me. All of them are chinese too. Even her mother, who often came from China to Germany to help us with our daughter always complained about me, that I am lazy and I should do more, even though at the time of her visit to us, my wife escaped with her secret boyfriend always and I had to stay home with her mom to take care of our child. I just dont understand how I am lazy here?

Why do they all think I am lazy and all accept this situation like now? I refuse to believe that this is a cultural difference as of now, because I work from 07:00 to 23:00 everyday, and sometimes even so much that I have like only 3-4 hours of sleep for several months.

Please help me understand this situation. What happened here? I am so confused and would really appriciate a chinese perspective here.

OF COURSE I don't forgive her. I write this because some people here think I accept this somehow. I will of course move forward and start a new life as much as possible. Right now I am just a broken man though.

ANSWER: Cultural? I’m pretty certain cheating is frowned upon more in China than Germany. Your wife’s a skank.

QUESTION: Do not know what to charge my(33f) Bf(34m) in rent

I’ve been dating my Bf for about 2 years now, but we have never truly lived together in this time. Though over the last 6 months or so he might stay at his own place 1-3 days through out the week. I enjoy him being at my place and have asked him countless times if he would like to move in. 
Recently things have come up that make it an even better idea for him to move in and he’s actually considering it but wants a set ‘rent’ and wants me to tell him what that would be. I have no idea what would be fair honestly, so thought I’d ask for some advice. 
I’m content paying my own bills as I have been doing so. I’ve consistently made more during our relationship 70k vs 50k (give or take) and have less bills over all (one of the reasons I’ve always offered for him to stay). House bills consist mostly of utilities 3-500 a month, mortgage 600 a month, 1-200 extra for random extras, And a once a year big Reno about 5k-7k which I save up for all year. (Only adding the Reno as it’s why the mortgage is so low so I like to think of it as mortgage payments too). But it will also give a good idea of what the house expenses look like. 
What Is everyone’s thoughts on what I should charge ? Nothing isn’t an option I’ve tried.

TDLR; I don’t know what to charge my bf who insist on paying rent.

ANSWER: Do you have combined finances? Is he going to be doing any of the renovation work? If not, you’re in more of a landlord/tenant situation. Charge him half the market rent, split the utilities, and you pay for the renovations, taxes, and insurance on your own. And make sure he signs a lease, to protect both of you.

QUESTION: Guy I haven’t talked to in 6 years asked if my (27M) girlfriend (25f) was underage

I (27M) posted a 1 year anniversary story with my girlfriend (25F). We both look young for our age (we’re Asian). A guy from college (who’s white) who I haven’t spoken to in about 6 years replied to my story and this was the exchange:

Him: How old is she...?

Me: Why do you ask?

Him: People wonder if she’s 18

Me: She’s 25. Asians tend to look young. It’s a weird thing to ask someone after 6 years. I see you haven’t changed a bit.

Him: Ah I’m happy she’s old enough
Him: I see you have changed

I haven’t replied since. Was his question valid? I’d say we both look young for our age, me maybe 24-25 and her 21-23. I’m not sure, it kind of insulted me and I’m not sure what to think of it.

ANSWER: I thought he meant like op was a dick now. Like it was in retaliation to the “you haven’t changed” line

QUESTION: I (26F) got married around 3 months ago (27M) and things are already going down

I and my husband are both teachers. Being a teacher, I don't only work at school but also at home as I have to prepare materials, exams and evaluate them etc. When I come home, I have to cook (he hates vegetables and I cook meat everyday, the kind of meals u'd have at a restaurant) and wash the dishes, and on the weekends I do the cleaning. He sometimes helps with the dishes, but most of the household chore is on me. I could be okay with it because cooking is actually my hobby but when it becomes a responsible with all the other responsibilities I have got, it becomes tiring.

When we got to our house, we decided sleeping in different beds could be a better choice as his sleep is very light. We also have different work schedules so we go to sleep and wake up at different times. From my husband, I see nothing romantic, no compliments, no gifts, no cuddles. The only time he cuddles me is when he wants to have sex, which causes me to have no desire at all...

Since he's better at economy and finances, I send some of my income to him for him to make savings. I am okay with it. But sometimes it becomes very controlling like when he wants to control what I got the credit card debit (which is not at all high) from and what I bought... or when he complains about how we spend money on groceries and meat but how could I possibly cook without them?

To be honest, I don't feel like someone's wife, I don't even feel like a woman, I feel like a robot who always has something to do. When I have time off, I spend it going out with my girl friends or playing video games as that's the only thing that feels a little better. But I cannot ignore how we already have nothing joyful left tho it's been only a few months since we got married. I don't know what to do, and I don't know if I am making things up in my head and creating problems. I also feel guilty about not being that into having sex anymore, but I just know that I don't at all feel fine so it seems understandable to me. Could you guys maybe show me a way as someone objective?

ANSWER: We need a bit more information on the context of the relationship, how long you have been together, was it always like this, why are oyu taking on so many of the responsibilities, do you live in a Western country, etc.

QUESTION: My (28f) best friend of 10+ years (33f) cut me off completely. How do I process this?

I’m struggling to process something that’s completely blindsided me.

My best friend (33fF) and I (28F) have been inseparable for over 10 years. She was my maid of honor less than a year ago. Everything seemed normal. She was amazing that weekend, and just a month ago she and her husband stayed with my husband and me for a visit. She talked about upcoming trips, their dogs, and house projects.

Two weeks later, she started acting off. I offered to fly out, then gave her space. Out of nowhere, her family called saying she’d filed for divorce and asked if I knew anything. Her husband and family were totally blindsided and worried she was having some kind of mental-health crisis.

That night, she texted me: “If anyone reaches out, no response... I’ll call you to explain.” I had already talked to her family by then. When she called later, she said their visit to me and my husband “was their last shot.” I was stunned. None of this had ever come up. I told her I loved her and just wanted her to be happy. I understand divorce is very personal but we share everything together that it seemed odd to not mention anything about it to me in any capacity.

After that, I sent one short “love you” text. She deleted me from Find My Friends and social media, changed her number, and cut off mutual friends and some family too.

Then this week, I got a formal email from her titled Harassment Warning. It said she doesn’t owe anyone an explanation, that this is a pivotal step toward her happiness, and that any further contact will be treated as harassment. It ended with “Please do not reply.” I'm not sure who, if anyone, else got this.

Her husband is in a dark place. He said she’s still talking to a few acquaintances. She is talking a lot  to a much older “life coach” type friend who’s telling her things like “you’re young, live your life, be selfish.” Her family thinks she's involved in a cult.

I’m  confused. It’s surreal to go from daily best friends to total silence.

What are healthy ways to process this? Do I expect to not hear from her again? It feels like a movie.

TL;DR: My best friend of 10 years suddenly filed for divorce, cut off everyone, and sent a “no contact” email calling further messages harassment. I’m shocked and have no idea how to process it or if she’s okay.

ANSWER: Her behavior does suggest she's got involved with something shady. Cult, drugs, affair, sounds like only she knows. Until you know more about what's going on it's hard to know if you can help her. Be patient and wait for more information. At the end of the day, she may not want any help and you may have to come to terms with that.

QUESTION: Ex (24m) got my name (27f) tattooed on his ribs after he cheated on me and left me for someone else, why?

My ex, who cheated on me and left me for someone else, got my name tattooed on his ribs, in huge letters, probably two inches tall each. We were together for a year before he cheated on me with a co-worker and completely abandoned me and started dating her.

Two months later, he came back saying I was his soulmate, that he loved me, and that he had changed his whole life, and then he went and got the tattoo.

I still can’t wrap my head around it. Why would someone do something so extreme after betraying and discarding you? How can a person claim to love you while doing all of that?

ADDING TO THIS:

\-He is a very charsmatic, good-looking person who can charm anyone. He fooled all my friends and family and everyone adored him. He wasn't an asshole, he was very nice and kind so this was genuinly a complete shock.. until I started discovering all the LIES.

\- HE ENDED IT WITH HER. She flipped on him when someone sent her a screenshot of him at my house. He called her and apologized and then they ended. I found this out MONTHS later after I went through his phone. I had no clue he was with someone else... I thought he just left me..

ANSWER: Enjoy the fact that every time he sees that tattoo he will be reminded of how stupid he was to treat you badly and lose you.

QUESTION: How do I politely tell my bf I'm touched out? 34f and 38m

IDK if this belongs here or in a parenting group. My (34f) boyfriend (38m) of about a year is very physically affectionate. I have a young child who is going through a sleep regression, BF and I don't live together, he only stays over on weekends.
BF likes to grope my waist, ass, breasts, thighs, basically anything he can get his hands on. Every time he spends the night he's biting his lip and growling at me when I change and wanting to hug me while I'm trying to clean or cook dinner. He always calls me sexy or gorgeous or hot or whatever but y'all, I'm exhausted. I bring it up and he goes "I can't help it, it's a guy thing". He'll stop me from grabbing stuff at the grocery store to get a hug and wants full on make outs every time we kiss, even if the kid is screaming because LO is overtired.

ANSWER: "I don't like that, please stop doing it"

And if that's not enough, it's not because you're not saying it right. It's because he refuses to hear you.

QUESTION: My GF (22F) dream is to be a stay-at-home wife and say I'm not doing the bare minimum. I (28M) on the other hand would like both of us to work.

My girlfriend and I has been dating for 2 years now. Recently we talked about what we want in the future, and she told me she wants to stay at home wife/mom. I told her that I don't want to do that because:

1. dynamic of power will be weird - i will have the say on what we do with the money
2. I want equal partnership and we both working will make more money to afford a bigger house and nice cars, and other things.
3. If i work by myself, we probably penny pitch and live pay check by pay check. I feel like that will make me resent her in the future because I'm financially savvy - i like to save and invest for retirement and not a big spender like that.

After i told her this, she brings up how her friend that she knows is doing that - stay at home mom. They have a house and will be going on vacations for 1-2 weeks a year. She say it is not impossible and she dont need alot in life - it could be a small house. But that's not what I want. I want both of us to work and be able to get a nice decent big house - like a 4-5 bedroom house with a 2 door garage and a basement and upstairs in a good neighborhood with luxury nice cars, and also be able to afford a nice vacation. You don't know what's really going on in another person relatioship and their life too. They could be in debt or very cheap on their vacation, or even just loaded with money. But for me I can't do that. I told her if I make doctor money or win the lottery then yes that will be on the table, but also the dyanmic of the relationship will shift too.

I think this is the breaking point in our relationship and I don't see how we can save it since we both want different things.

Is my thinking wrong or there's a way to fix this?

We have other issues like she say i don't celebrate monthsiversary and get her flowers every month - apparently in her culture they celebrate their relationship every month. I dont take her on dates a lot. She would give me examples of her friends in a relationship and getting gifts from their partners and going on dates. She wants to plan trips and dates and doesn't really want to do any of that. I don't do stuff she wants from a bf or the bare minimum.

But I do our laundry, make her food when she's over, and other stuff when she asks. I buy her gifts now and then, and try to surprise her, but not every month. I like to stay home and we usually see each other every day. I like to stay home with her and just watch a movie or something. I don't like how she compares us/me to others either. I tell her to just say what she wants from me, but she never does. She says that you should know as a bf, i should need to you how to be a bf. She says she gives me hints and i should we the clues.

At this point, I dont know what the bare minimum is anymore. Am I not doing enough? She is a lovely girl, sweet, and very caring to family and friends. Someone that is loyal and check all my boxes as a girlfriend.

EDIT: I want to clarify, OF COURSE she has a said in money. When I say the power dynamic is different, I'm saying here and there she can buy what she wants. But if it's like a big spending thing and i dont want to do it then I'll have the last say since I'm the one bringing home the money. Like if she wants to help a family member out from somewhere, then okay it depends how much and where we are. I will have to know EVERYTHING before we lend out money and how much will always be in question.

EDIT: She does work right now and a hard worker. She also supports her mom - very mature.

ANSWER: If you don't want that for yourself break up. She's 22 and still growing (up I hope). You have a right to want those things for you so you are simply incompatible.

QUESTION: My (32M) Wife (35F) spends all her time on her hobby while I'm home with our toddler, how much time is reasonable for her 'hobby'?

Wife's hobby has become almost all consuming. She rides/shows horses.

We've talked about the time she spends at the barn in the past and she changed her work schedule around to get off sooner so she could go straight from work and then be home somewhere around 5-5:30.

Time goes by and now she starts helping more at the barn and is getting home later than 8pm twice per week and then on Sunday staying at the barn from 9a-4pm.   
  
I had a talk with her that this is unsustainable for me and we have to make some changes. She had a show coming up in several weeks, so we 'agreed' to maintain this schedule until after the show. The new terms is 1 evening she will be home for dinner, the other will be the same (8pm), but on Sunday will be home by noon. The first week of the new schedule goes by fine and I'm feeling like we've compromised and that this might be sustainable. But the first evening of the second week she's asking me to stay late again.. already trying to push from what was agreed upon, then on Sunday she says she's going over later because she wants to sleep in because we were out late Saturday, so she's at the barn from 10:30a-3:30p.

And now I just can't get over the resentment, it's like her family is her lowest priority. 1 and 2 being both of her horses. 3 being the barn owners, (when we talk about schedules she always talks about how the barn owners need the help that they have taken too much on, I always tell her that is not our problem), 4 our toddler, 5 horse equipment, 6 me.

How do I make it clear this isn't working? What is fair as far as time for her hobby goes?

ANSWER: I'm a cyclist and this is an extremely common topic in our subs. Cycling can be a time-consuming sport, and there's a lot of "my partner spends 20 hours per week on the bike while I'm at home with the littles help!"

You two need to have a serious discussion about division of labor and division of rest/hobbies. You should have equal time to do your own thing, but it seems like she just does what she wants.

QUESTION: My gf (F23) told me (M23) she gets turned on knowing other dudes like her ?

We’ve been together for 4 years now. She told me the other day that she got turned on by knowing that some dudes at her work seem to be attracted to her a lot. And told me this after she came, I couldn’t even keep going. It was such a strange feeling.

I know that over these 4 years some girls wanted to hook up, but even the slightest idea of doing it didn’t go through my mind. Even less I got turned on by that.

Im not an insecure dude, but that hit me. 
How do you even understand this? Like how do even approach this, from where, and how do I get this out of my head.

ANSWER: She said this while you were having sex?

My best guess is that she was trying to bring you into a kink or something but that's absolutely terrible timing.

I don't think it's all that unusual but I think most people keep that to themselves and I definitely don't think that they mention it in that situation unless they know that the other person is into it.

QUESTION: My (23F) boyfriend (25M) would rather jerk off to fully clothed women than sleep with me

My boyfriend has confessed to me he has jerked off to fully dressed streamers on instagram, Sabrina carpenter (one of my favorite singers and he knows that) and Jennifer Lawrence. I’m pretty sure he has also jerked off to girls he has went to school with’s pfp on Facebook. My issue is with the fact he often declines to have sex with me and we hardly sleep together. When I spoke to him about it he said it’s because he’s embarrassed about his penis size HOWEVER he has changed his answer as to why 1,000 times. I’m too goofy, he was worried that we’d get interrupted, he was too tired and he wanted to do it himself, he didn’t want to put in effort are some of the examples of other things he’s blamed it on. He also had made me throw all my toys away when we first got together because it made him uncomfortable so now I’m just sexually frustrated and feel worthless to him. It has taken a pretty big toll on my self esteem and no matter how much I try to forget it makes me very upset every few days I just wish I could forget about it. Any words of encouragement or hopes that it’ll get better? I just really wish it didn’t bother me like it does, I feel so stupid.

Small update disclaimer: I don’t know if it makes any difference but he was a virgin when I met him (2 years ago) so maybe possibly that might explain the behavior??? Idk maybe I’m just trying to justify it :(

UPDATE he said it’s because he sees 
                    me as a mom now instead of a whore               and can’t disrespect me like he wants to during sex.

ANSWER: Never hope it would get better. Basically bring out whats bothering you and communicate to your partner. Don't wait and take action.

QUESTION: I (43M) suspect my girlffriend (F45) is in just for the money

Hello all,

I have been dated this girl for the past year. She was divorced twice previously but has no kids. She has a office support job and lives with her sister. She make about the median amount in our city. She's overall a sweet girl, but when it comes finances her ideas and mines diverge quite a bit.

I make significantly more than her and she has been very "aware" of this from the beginning. I pay for most our dates. She shows appreciation for it but at the same time expects me to. She does make contributions but they are always far smaller, the ratio is about 80/20. She often suggests places she would like to go, things she would to get, or activities she would like to do as hints for me to get them for her. On our second date she straight up asked me how much I was making. From early on also she has been talking about marriage. Given our age and that kids are practically not an option at this time, I don't care for marriage. Wanting to find out what her true intentions were I asked her if she would be ok with us not getting married. She said such relationship would go nowhere and wouldn't stay with him if we were to never. Then I suggested we do get a prenup, which she flat out refused. No matter what would led to the marriage failure she knows it would mean a big fat check for her and ruin for me. Given that she's already divorced twice before hitting 50 and she isn't a celebrity, I believe acting with caution isn't unreasonable.

She doesn't really reciprocate. The other day since I was sick with a cold she stopped by my house to drop me a container of vitamin C supplements from her home about to expire ....

I'm often left feeling she sees me like a walking ATM, which isn't a life goal of mine. To give a little background she is a of East Asian extraction.

Is this doomed?

ANSWER: I think what’s telling is the way you describe her. You already know this isn’t the relationship for you

QUESTION: I (32F) love my partner (31M) but I don’t desire to have children. How will this end?

We’ve been seeing each other for a year now. Each time the topic of children comes up, I always make it very known that I don’t want children and have no desire to be a mother. He thinks I’m not serious. He thinks I can be persuaded. He thinks I’m open to it. Most of the times I try to explain my decision, saying “I don’t want to be a mother because I know how selfish I am and I will never be a good mother.” He would respond something like “You’ll definitely be a good mother. I can tell.”

I will no doubt sit down and have a serious conversation with him about this very soon.

The only chance I can be persuaded to have kids is if my partner steps up and takes most of the responsibilities. He said he’s happy to do his part and more but let’s be honest here, that’s unrealistic.

I’m going to get downvoted to oblivion for saying this but I am selfish. I refuse to sacrifice my career, my freedom and my life for a child. I know I’ll ultimately end up doing it and resenting them.

I’m painfully aware a child needs both their parents and it would be incredibly unfair to bring someone into the world and not love them.

I’m writing this but I already know what I have to do. However, I would like to know, if there’s anyone here that was persuaded to have kids by your partner and ended up being very miserable? Is breaking up the only option here? I would hate to be the reason he never got to be a father because he loves me too much to part ways.

ANSWER: Why are you still dating someone who's trying to change your mind on one of the most important things that you could do to impact your life?

The two of you are incompatible, full stop.

QUESTION: I (27M) think my girlfriend (23F) cheated on me..did she ?

So I came home from work one night and my girlfriend was at her friends house. I offered multiple times to pick her up when I was close to being home. She denied and said she was already getting a uber. Which is red flag #1, I call her when she’s In the uber and I hear a man’s voice in the background. One that I recognize, I immediately say I’m at her house and want to see the uber driver drop you off…she hangs up and then FaceTimes me on the side of the street saying she wants me to pick her up when she was 8 mins from her house….every time I bring it up she makes me feel like I’m crazy or I’m just tripping. This happened about a month and a half ago and I keep bringing it up to her and everytime I do she says “you need to stop bringing this up or this isn’t going to work”so I stopped but I ALWAYS think about it and end up bringing it up….. I love this girl so much…part of me dosent want to believe it but my heart is telling me something isn’t right

ANSWER: I don’t know if she cheated on you, but if you don’t trust her anymore, just break up. It sounds like this relationship is done.

QUESTION: My (30F) husband (32M) can't set boundaries with anyone and it's affecting our marriage

My husband and I have been together for 6 years, since we first got together I noticed we had very different aproaches to things that, at least to me, are simple to solve. Things like comunicating with his family before they come visit so we could prepare instead of a surprise weeking stay arriving at our door at 5 am of a Friday, asking for our furniture to not be rearranged, or our closet reorganized unnecessarily and without our consent.

Personally I’m not one to put up with this kind of stuff, and that’s the reason I don’t have any contactwith my father or his side of the family, but knowing how important it’s to him I did my best to make them feel welcome once every 3 months, while still asking him gently to set some rules. But after years of putting up with them, their behaviour and snarky remarks about my body, how we’re raising our kids and unwanted two cents about our marriage I did something about it.

We were expecting our second daughter, had just lost her twin and it was a very high risk pregnancy, after the usual hell imposed by his mom + evil remarks that she “had a feeling this time we had twins on the way” one week after my surgery to remove the other baby, I told him I didn’t want her around until our baby was born and had taken her 2nd round of vaccines at 2 months old. He talked to her about it and with his brother.

This resulted in his family bringing out all the guns to manipulate us. First trying to make me feel like I was being a b- and after it didn’t work, trying to turn him against me. Surprisingly he stood his ground but after a while I found out his brother is trying to convince him to separate and move states with our oldest daughter.

I confronted him, he swears he loves me and would never do something like that, but told me that he fear that by setting boundaries with them they won’t love him anymore. I get where he’s coming from, but it’s gotten to the point where we make decisions about our lives, career related, about our kids education, or our marriage (!) and I am only informed out agreement is not on anymore after I ask him and he says: “I didn’t think I needed to tell you, I’ve talked to my brother and changed my mind”

I just can’t stand this anymore! He also refuses to set healthy boundaries with our daughter, and won’t let me do it without trying to guilt trip me. I wanna help him set himself free of this codependency with his family but he even refuses therapy. I don’t wanna leave him unless it’s the only option left, but I’ll admit the thought has crossed my mind a lot lately.

How can I save my marriage?

ANSWER: I'm not a mental health professional, but it sounds like Your husband has some serious abandonment issues. Without background I can only guess(though it seems obvious)where they come from and it's causing him to be a doormat.

If it were me I'd have a serious conversation about possibly getting into therapy, but it's going to take time and there's no guarantee that even that'll help

The question you now have to ask yourself is do you want to raise your children with a man that will likely continue to put his family above you and your kids?

QUESTION: I (33M) just recently found out my gf (27f) previously had sex with her (40m) “best friend” and she lied about it

For this story I will be John, she will be Jane and he will be Jack.

I work with Jane. Back in March she threw a party that I showed up to. We flirted a lot and kissed but we work together so I didn’t want to overdo it and pursue too hard.

I could tell she had a crush on me and my feelings were growing for her.

Two weeks later at the end of March we hang out again and this time we have sex and so begins our relationship.

Then in June we go to a concert with a large group of friends. I’m introduced to Jack as a normal friend of the group.

Jane tells me Jack is a new but good friend. I accept this and we hangout with him a lot through September. Many hangouts with his new gf, group events, and sometimes just me Jane and Jack. A trio.

One night I had a gut feeling something was up so I went through her phone (bad I know but keep reading).

I found texts on her phone that Jane and Jack had sex the week in between her party in March and when I got together with her two week later.

Jane instructed all of her friends to go along with the lie. I found texts proving it.

I called out Jane and she said “it’s not that big of a deal” “it was in the past it doesn’t matter” Things like that.

I asked her why was it so important to keep Jack around? She said he’s a cool guy and everyone in the group likes him. She denied having feelings for him and called their short tryst casual.

I also found texts that she was planning on introducing Jack to her Dad when he visits for thanksgiving.

I feel embarrassed hurt and lied to. She denies having feelings for Jack but I just don’t think that’s possible.

She said she lied because she knew I’d be upset. But she did it anyway and protected another man and didn’t care about my feelings.

The question is: is she still lying saying she doesn’t have feelings for this guy? You would lie about someone, keep them around for months, and introduce them to your Dad and not have feelings for them? It doesn’t add up to me. Thanks.

ANSWER: I wouldn’t trust her enough to continue the relationship at this point. That is a significant lie, and pulling everyone else into it seems mentally ill.

QUESTION: My fiancé, 38M cheated on me with my cousin 39M and I found out through Grindr. My whole world has fallen apart.

I don’t even know where to start. I’m 31 (F) and I’ve just had my entire life flipped upside down in the space of 48 hours. I’ve been with my fiancé (38 M) for almost three years. We live together, have been planning our wedding, raising my son, and trying to build a life after everything we’ve already been through: court cases, his drinking, financial struggles, you name it. I thought we’d already survived the worst. Turns out I had no idea what “worst” even meant.

He came home the other night absolutely drunk. We had about $300 left in the account, and when he walked through the door, there was $29 left. He passed out on the couch, and his phone was open. On Grindr. If you don’t know what that is, it’s a hookup app for gay and bi men.

My stomach dropped. Before I met him, I knew he’d experimented. He had a thing for butt play and had slept with trans people in the past. I never judged him for it. I thought it was something from his past, not something ongoing. I’m open-minded. I don’t “yuck someone’s yum.” But this was different. This wasn’t old curiosity. It was active, recent, and constant.

I opened the messages, and what I saw made me physically sick. He had dozens of chats with men and trans people, explicit photos, constant sexting. But one chat stood out. The location, the profile picture, the name. It was my cousin (39M).

I froze. I couldn’t breathe. My cousin is transgender, and I’ve known for years he’s on Grindr. We aren’t close. I haven’t spoken to my extended family in over a decade because of old trauma and family drama. But still, he’s my cousin. And my fiancé had met up with him at my auntie’s house. They slept together, unprotected, and my fiancé actually bragged in the chat about it, writing things like, “Thanks for letting me breed you, can’t wait to do it again.”

I felt my entire body go numb. He slept with my cousin. On my nan’s birthday. Then came home to me like nothing happened. And did it TWICE.

I confronted him that night, or tried to. He was passed out drunk, literally lying in bed covered in his own feces because he’d shit himself. His phone and wallet were hidden outside in his ute, so when I couldn’t find them, I rang his phone, snuck out, and found it in the car. That’s how I saw everything. Every message. Every photo. I deleted every single picture of me off his phone, even the intimate ones, because I didn’t trust him not to use them out of spite later.

I also confronted my cousin. He tried to act innocent, saying “I didn’t know his name, I didn’t know he was your fiancé.” Bullshit. He absolutely knew. He even told my fiancé that ‘You (me) probably told everyone at Christmas,” like I’d been gossiping about my fiancé being bisexual at a family event, except I haven’t attended a family Christmas in years. Not in 2024, not in 2023. My cousin only could’ve known about him because my sister still talks to him. So now it feels like they’ve all been talking about me behind my back, and somehow I’m the one being blamed.

To make it worse, when I confronted my fiancé sober, he became aggressive. He pushed me, raised his fists at me and at my son, and punched a hole in the wall. We already have an AVO in place, but I felt unsafe in my own house. I spent that night awake, terrified, while he slept in my bed like nothing happened.

Now I’m sitting here, trying to hold it together for my son, realising I can’t afford to stay in Sydney on my income alone. I’d have to drop out of uni, give up my nursing degree, and move hours away just to survive. I don’t have family support. I don’t have savings. I’m looking at two-bedroom rentals in cheaper towns, trying to figure out how to rebuild from nothing.

People at work were kind. They hugged me, cried with me. One woman said something that stuck with me:
“You’re expecting rational decisions from an irrational person. He’s an alcoholic, a sex addict, and he’ll destroy anyone around him if it means escaping accountability.”

And she’s right.

It’s one thing to be cheated on. It’s another to find out your fiancé slept with a man, your cousin, and they both knew.

I’m heartbroken, but mostly I’m angry. Angry that I stayed, that I supported him, that I paid bills and raised his kids while he was out living a double life. Angry that he could do something this vile and still walk around the house like nothing happened.

I’m done. There’s no wedding. There’s no coming back. Just me and my son now, starting over again.

How do you just move on from something like this? Who has betrayed me more my cousin or fiancé?

ETA: He is an alcoholic and was charged with DV against me earlier in the year hence the AVO. The matter before the courts relates to driving….i know, red flag after red flag..I honestly try and see the good in people and look past their negative traits but this was one of those times when I should’ve run away at the start.

ANSWER: I’m so sorry.

You’re Aussie? Lodge for Centrelink TODAY. They will backdate an approved claim. 
There are also resources for emergency payments to help you leave.

Speak to your uni. There is a lot more support for single parents in study and escaping DV then there used to be.

Rental market in Sydney is absurd. Have you checked the outer suburbs? Can you continue your study partially online? Many TAFEs have nursing courses which may help

QUESTION: My partner of 3 years (M33) says that he would only merry me (F34) if I agree to have a swinger relationship.

My boyfriend recently told me that he would never want to marry me unless I agreed to have threesomes or group sex in the future. He said he’d rather break up than live a strictly monogamous life, because he can’t imagine being with only one person forever.

According to him, this is just “the reality of men” that if someone is attractive, they’ll naturally have many opportunities with other women and will eventually cheat if they’re in a monogamous relationship. He believes that allowing threesomes or open experiences is a way to prevent cheating.

As a side note, he often tells me that I’m his most healthy and mature relationship, that I give him stability, peace, and a sense of belonging and family. I have a successful career, I take care of our home, I cook, and I genuinely try to be a supportive and loving partner. In my head, I consider myself a really good girlfriend.

But lately, he’s been saying that he misses the intensity, the “crazy sex experiences” and wild lifestyle he had before me. He says that kind of excitement is more important to him. Once a man experiences a lifestyle like this, he can't go back to boring monogamy.

It honestly shatters me, because it makes me feel like no matter how much I grow, give, or love, it will never be enough simply because I’m not enough for him as he said. And personally me I never had these kind of experiences, even the though makes me uncomfortable. But who knows, maybe if I try it I would enjoy it? What would you do in my position? Would you settle?

ANSWER: What a weird hill to die on. He's saying that because he's a man he will cheat unless there's a swinger relationship and places the responsability on that happening on you. I'd not settle I would leave and find a better life partner.

QUESTION: My (31F) Nan passed away and he (29M) went out with the boys.

I(31F) messaged my partner (29M) that my grandma had just passed away around 4:30pm while I was at work.

He was nice and comforting. He finishes work around 4:30-5pm. I assumed he’d be heading home to see me, we have lived together for the last 5 years and been together for 6 years.

I got home at bit before 6pm, fed the pets. Messaged him to ask if he was heading home.

Didn’t get a response so took the dog for a 15 min walk.

When I came home, his car was there but no sign of him.

I called him - three rings, voicemail. Called again, one ring, voicemail. I thought maybe he’s at the shops and can’t talk. Then thought, nah, I’ll call again. He answers this time.

“Oh, I didn’t know where you were and we wanted to go out to dinner. I didn’t know if you wanted some food. I’m out with the boys for dinner.”

Didn’t text me, didn’t call. He surely would have seen the dog was missing and could have figured I’d be back soon.

I did text him to say I’m upset and not happy with him going out with friends.

He did text back: I thought you might be on phone to Mum or family, or working late again. When we got there I saw you weren’t home and I was going to ask you to come get food to get your mind off things.

He got home at 9pm. I was pretty upset and yelled at him. He’s blaming me for not being here and making a fight out of nothing. Apparently I should have come out if I was that upset.

I told him I wanted a hug. At home.

“ Do you want one now”

I feel shocked and upset. I assumed he would be home to see me after work, but I didn’t ask him to be.

He hasn’t experienced the loss of a family member himself but if the roles were reversed, I would have been home to see him.

How do I discuss this with him, without him getting defensive?

edit - my Nan was 97 and had a fantastic life. I was told in June she was starting to decline and to come visit. I had a lengthy conversation with my partner because I couldn’t afford the flights but I wanted to see her.

I only have one photo of her. My partner accidentally lost all my photos, I lost all my family photos of growing up with her. /edit

TL;DR I (31F) told my partner (29M) my Nan passed away and he went out to dinner with the boys.

ANSWER: Who goes out to dinner with friends right after finding out that someone close to their partner has passed away? That’s honestly insensitive and really immature on his part.

QUESTION: How do I (23f) tell my co-worker (24m) that he has really bad BO without making him feel like it's a microaggression?

I (23f) have a new co-worker (John-24m) who is Indian. We work in the same office block and for the first 3 weeks, he was shadowing me. He has some major personal hygiene issues- his breath is bad, his BO is horrific and I started breathing through my mouth when he's around. I've even heard other co-workers mention it. John doesn't seem to notice.

A few days ago, we where talking and he had some homemade Indian food. he asks if I'm ok with him eating it, I say of course. He then tells me that the reason he had to switch jobs was due to 'anti-Indian racism' from old co-workers; mainly, saying he smells bad which I know is a harmful thing said about many Indian people.

But John does, genuinely, actually smell bad. It has nothing to do with the fact he's Indian and my assessment of his BO is not affected by his ethnicity, but it's becoming a real issue in the workplace. I don't know how to bring it up to him. I feel like a huge asshole because I'm kind of starting to wonder if the 'racism' at his old workplace was actually just his co-workers mentioning his poor hygiene. But I don't know.

I don't know whether to mention it to him in person, or to HR. I don't want him taking it the wrong way. Besides the BO, he's a lovely guy and I don't want him to feel attacked here, too.

ANSWER: Take it to HR. Let the institution handle this. If you tackle it as an individual, you won’t have the same protections or weight to it.

QUESTION: My 26f husband 40m insults the homeless/poor knowing that used to be me? He says I’m overthinking it completely

We have been together 3 years now. We come from 2 different worlds but for the most part we’re a good match, and we fun together.

He says the comments don’t “apply to me” but.. I think they do.

First off just to explain how poor I was growing up. My mom was terminally ill pretty much my entire life, after she passed my dad stopped talking to me/my brother.

At 16 I moved into my car, after years of on and off homelessness and crappy jobs I started working as a waitress at a pretty nice restaurant and was able to rent a crappy room. This to me was absolute luxury, having my own room lol.

I met him at like midnight walking home from work. He saw me and was concerned about me, wanted to help me. So I gave in and let him drive me home. I ended up agreeing to go out with him but I was in a lot of debt, and obviously struggling.

He was not judgemental at all, he helped me get out of it. I moved into his home, we obviously ended up engaged. He is truly an amazing guy but I don’t understand how he differentiates me from others in the same scenario.

We have a good life now, I’m a housewife which for someone like me after years of chaos is extremely peaceful and amazing, he works in law. We’re planing on having a baby soon..
So this isn’t something I want to leave him over, it’s more that I’m looking for help on how to better communicate with him.

He knows Everything and he knows I was homeless, but he’ll say things about homeless people being “dirty” or needing to “get off their ass and work” right in front of me.

But he literally was the one that pulled me out of that, I could have very well (and probably would have) ended up back in that situation.

I asked him what is different about me, and the homeless man he was talking about and he laughed and said “it wasn’t even comparable” so no real explanation.

We were laying in bed the other night and talking about the cost of living in our area and he made a joke he liked it and hoped it continued to go up because he doesn’t want the people who can’t afford it in his neighborhood.. and I was just like… okay but that is me.

And he says it’s not, because it’s not anymore but he’s basically saying in my mind that if I were single & still in a bad situation I’m right there with the people he’s insulting.

There was also another time, we were shopping on rodeo drive and some guy was asking me for money for coffee, I was trying to find my wallet and he pulled me away. He did actually give this guy money but he was pissed I was talking to him, said if he wants money he can get a job and also said it’s dangerous for me to talk to them.
But as someone who lived it i know most of these people are good people. I understand using caution but genuinely most are good.

He literally let me in his car the first night we met, he thought i was homeless and wasn’t scared of me

He says I’m thinking way too much, and it has nothing to do with me. But i just can’t help but think… what did you truly think of me when we met?

ANSWER: It only “doesnt apply to you” because he’s attracted to you and likes you. But if that went away, it would 100% apply to you.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My boyfriend ‘M/24’ asked for a threesome with my ‘F/22’ bestfriend ‘F/21’. How do I deal with that?

I know that is already a quick update since I just posted today but after reading all of the comments all day I immediately talked with my boyfriend after he got home from work.

The first post is here btw:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/s/GgB519dA97

And some people texted me and asked how long we’ve been dating which is a little over two years + we are living together.

So after overthinking all night and all day today, I asked my boyfriend if we can go over it again and I feel a lot better.

We immediately sat down and had a long conversation. We talked about everything. I told him that I felt uncomfortable and couldn’t get it out of my head. I told him that I was worried on why he is focused on my best friend being the other girl and that it got me worried, especially, because he never mentioned the idea of a threesome before.

He then told me what he thinks:

He said he isn’t interested in a threesome because it’s my best friend. He’s not secretly into her, not crushing on her, nothing like that. He explained that what really happened is that he got excited when I mentioned that she and I had hooked up once when we were younger. He said that for him that means that my best friend and I are already comfortable with each other in that way and that it might be an option for more experimenting. He said it’s less awkward than involving a stranger and less of an hassle, he said my best friend is chill and open minded when it comes to sex (she is single btw, bc some people asked about that, and she is quite casual and talks openly about sex a lot). He said for him, my best friend meant safe and no drama, but he understands why I was worried. He really reassured me that there is nothing to worry about.

He said the whole fantasy came from the idea of me being with another girl I trust, not from wanting her specifically. He says to him it sounds hot and got him thinking. However, he doesn’t care if he is actually sleeping with my best friend as the turn on for him is seeing me with her.

He would like to have that experience of watching me with her but only if I am comfortable with that.

Because I got so worried, he wants me to make sure that that’s something I wouldn’t regret and if I think it has potential of ruining things, that we shouldn’t do it.

So he pretty much told me he doesn’t need a “full threesome” at all. He said if I don’t like the idea of it, he is fine with not touching my friend at all and just being a bystander.

What he imagines is:

him just watching us kiss or make out. He said that he would like to see some more sexual stuff but only if i am okay with it. Also he doesn’t even need my best friend to take off her clothes (if i am not okay with that or scared of him seeing her like yhat). So mostly him watching her do things to me, and then him and I having sex afterward.

He said he doesn’t need anything more, only if i want that with them two. And less would be fine too, or nothing at all. He doesn’t want to pressure me but he would definitely like us to try it (if i am fine with it).

I told him I need time to think before making any decision, and he said he fully respects that.

Honestly, after hearing him explain everything, I feel way calmer. It doesn’t feel like he’s into her anymore. It feels more like he got excited about the idea of seeing me with another girl, especially one I’m already safe and comfortable with. I’m starting to think I might have overreacted at first, but I’m giving myself time to think it through before deciding if we’ll try this “experiment.”

Also I would have to ask my best friend if that would be something she would want to do too (I think she would since she was open for the idea of a threesome if I decide if I want that in our previous conversation), if I decide that I want to try that, but first i am just going to take my time to think about it because I don’t want to ruin everything. So I don’t think there is gonna be another update from me anytime soon since I will take my time and sit on his idea first.

ANSWER: Never bring other people into the bedroom unless  everyone is 100% on board. You also need to be aware this could permanently damage or end both your relationship and your friendship. Think carefully.

QUESTION: I 24F got a piercing, now my partner 29M whines how little I value his opinion.

My (24f) partner (29m) and me have been together for close to five years now.

I am a very outgoing person in how I present myself. Tattoos, colourful clothes, statement piece jewellery etc. He on the contrary is rather conservative, but never has been anything but supportive.

The artistic way I engage with myself and others was, according to him, one of the main reasons why he felt drawn to me.

Over the years we had small arguments here and there about dresscodes and whatnot but that was easily resolved.

Now. i have been thinking about getting a Labret piercing (lip piercing) for close to half a year now. I talked to him about it.

He hated the idea. We sat down and I told him that I was planning on getting one and he told me he didn’t want me to “mutilate” my face.

Well. Today I got my piercing, after hearing him out, and telling him that I still wanted one.
 
Before I left for the piercer he told me “your journey m’am”

Now I cane back and we had this long conversation where he revealed he felt I don’t value his opinion.

He brought up how he was the main provider (true) and how therefore he would feel more appreciated if I took his opinions into consideration.

I usually do. But from the start we have established that he doesn’t get to tell me what to do with my body, samesies goes for me.

Legitimately I am so angry at him for it. Because yes I heard his opinion, I just didn’t let it change my decision.

Am I the selfish asshole here who should have not gotten a piercing because he disliked it? Why would he expect me to forego my own bodily autonomy for his opinion?

For what it’s worth, I think the labret looks fantastic on me.

UPDATE

Firstly a few things I saw getting asked in the comments:

Yes I have other piercings, Bellybutton and Nipples, the latter of which he ADORES

And Yes when bringing up the Labret with him, I asked him if he would find that piercing unattractive on me. He said “No”. He did bring up that he wouldn’t want to kiss my piercing whenever we kissed however, which influenced my choice to get a normal Labret rather than a vertical one.

No he does not attempt to tell me what to do in terms of who to meet, where to go, when I should be home, who my friends are etc. I am safe and don’t feel he is controlling, though the way I phrased things above did make it seem that way.

Yes, the way our financial situation is currently was pre-negotiated. I moved to his homecountry because I had an easier time doing so than vice-versa, but also meant my career was put a bit on hold.

Yes I brought up to him how him dangling “Well I’m the provider” over my head was a dick move and he apologised for it. Said it was a moment of insecurity on his end.

Now to get to the actual update on our talk.

I think the consensus we reached is that the piercing in itself is not the issue.

He felt excluded from this whole shabang.  He does not find me unattractive with the piercing now. Fuck, this dude met me when I had a buzzcut! Which I myself can look back at and say not my best hairstyle lmao.

We discussed how it made him insecure in the relationship that I excluded him in this, and concluded that if I decide to get more piercings, he wants to tag along to “hold my hand” when being poked with needles. I find that a bit unnecessary but hey if it makes him secure fine.

In general I think over the years he’s realised that I am still a very independent person. I never thought that was a bad thing. I would never want to burden my partner by asking for help when I damn well know I can deal with shit on my own.

He brought up that this mindset, while he understands it… well essentially wants to help me. He very grudgingly admitted that he only feels loved when he can be of use.

I don’t quite know how to explain to him that I’d love him even if he was a worm, but if he needs to provide acts of service to feel loved, alright.  I can work with that.

If anything I am a bit shocked it took five fucking years for him to admit to me that while he adores me for how independent and confident I am, he does feel insecure in knowing that I don’t “need” him.

Like gurl in my humble opinion a partnership is not meant to be dependant on the other.  I love him for being my gentle giant who I can talk to about anything, who gies the best advice and makes me see things from other perspectives. And yes sure he overly worries about my safety, but I am reckless. Not in a self-destructive way, but in the sense that if I think climbing a tree is fun I will doit even if I scrape up my hands.

Essentially the update is that I found out he feels incredibly insecure, both in how much I love him and if I would not leave him for someone else.

You folks have been lovely with advice thus far, do you have advice for that as well?

ANSWER: Of course it’s ultimately your decision.  But at a certain point, you need to look at the consistent, ongoing (and apparently escalating) pattern of him not being happy with your fashion and body modification choices, and ask yourself if this relationship is really a good fit for either of you.

QUESTION: [Please help] I feel like my husband [40M] is prioritizing his new female coworker [30F] over me [36F] and we are discussing divorce over this.

I am currently discussing divorce with my husband of 8 years, in a relationship for 12 years.

For context, one of the worst fights we had happened shortly after we got married, 7 years ago, when a part of his family was being racist toward me. After many months of suffering he did talk to the family member and agreed that they were not willing to put any effort to make me feel respected, and that he is ok keeping distance from them. I feel like similar dynamic is happening again but with a random coworker of opposite gender, which makes it far worse. I have been extremely hurt and could not think straight for many months, and now I just feel numb. I am seeking for some objective point of views to help me process the situation, if anyone can bear with me.

\long txt warning\

My husband had this new coworker joining his team at the end of last year. He was onboarding her, and I did not think much of it, but noticed that he started mentioning her very frequently.

Early this spring, he started acting very cold and distant towards me. I tried to be understanding, as I knew that he was going through a tough time at work, but after a few weeks I told him that his actions hurt me, he is being cruel to me for some reason I do not understand and that I would like to take some time away from him. He apologized profoundly and told me that he was feeling resentful toward me about our past fights. He promised that he’ll pay attention and that he won’t take me for granted. He kept his words to the extent he could.

A few months later, he asked if it is ok to take the same flight with this new coworker for a business trip (just two of them), and I still did not think much about it. I just noticed that he has never done that with other male coworkers of his for many years when he was on business trips with them.

The day before the trip, he said that he will ride with her to the airport as she offered to pick him up on the way, although the company pays for everything including the ride to the airport. I thought that is crossing my boundaries and asked him not to. He insisted that he wants to take the same car with her and we had an argument for many hours, and eventually he reluctantly said he will reject her offer.

He continued telling me that he really wants her, her fiancé, him and me to be good friends. I asked him what is he going to do if they are mean to me (I have heard a few stories of her being somewhat nationalistic, which he agreed as well, and I was concerned that they may be against me as I am an immigrant). He said that then he’ll have to hang out three of them without me, which made me feel really confused and worried that his first option is to drop me not those people. He later said that he was not putting much thought into this “three of us” comment when he said it, but I started to feel like he is prioritizing the relationship with this coworker over me.

A few weeks later, the four of us had a dinner together and it was actually pleasant, I thought she may not have good boundaries towards married couple but does not have bad intentions and that I was open to be friends with them. My husband was happy to hear that and we planned another gathering a few months later for a brunch.

However, I still felt somewhat uncomfortable as she kept inviting herself to our weekend plans and my husband really wanted to accept them all. This went on for many weeks in a row. I could not quite understand why he feels obligated to accept these requests, when the two of us have already made plans, and normally he does not like changing plans to the extent that he becomes passive aggressive towards me when I suggest to change something.

One day, I visited his office per his invitation as his company was holding a family event. We were planning on going to a concert that evening. This coworker was there too, and she said that she also decided to go to the same concert, and that she’ll buy her ticket onsite. She then invited herself again, that we should all go together to have dinner and hang out before the concert. My husband beamed up visibly and I was unhappy, as we had a different plan to run errands before going to the concert but he seemed to have forgotten about it completely. I told her that we cannot directly head there because we have to stop by somewhere else, while trying to be nice, and I could see that she was pissed at me for saying it. I thought this is a sign that she prioritizes her friendship over our marriage, which was not an ok behavior for me.

As we headed out to run the errands, we had a big argument. He claimed that he did not forget the errands and that he thought I told her about it and she was just suggesting to meet us for dinner after we were done. I had hard time taking this excuse as it really did not make any sense, he was there the whole time I was talking to her, and to be honest I was already quite upset. I told him that he can go to the concert with her while I just go home, and he was very upset at the way I said it- he said that if I said it nicely he would have believed that and took it. We ended up going to the concert without having any dinner. We also started couple’s counseling per my husband’s request, as this seems to have become a source of continuous fights for us.

In the mean time she was texting him, sometimes over the weekend, with personal stuff, which also made me feel uncomfortable. She also bought him an expensive and rare gift for his birthday which I felt is out of line for someone who’s known him for less than a year, especially given that my husband is her senior at work and this can create a conflict of interest. With these continuing, per my request my husband reluctantly created a group chat to coordinate the planned brunch, and I still tried to talk to her nicely even though she appeared annoyed at me for not being up for all her self-inviting. She did not engage with most of my messages, only actively replying to my husband. Then on the morning of brunch day, she explicitly only referred my husband and told him that she’s sorry but they cannot make it to the brunch, which I felt excluded as I was in the same chat but she went out of her way to call only my husband’s name in the message. I told my husband I felt disrespected, which he disagreed and that he wants to continue deepening his relationship with this person.

A few weeks after, he started saying that he wants to have weekly workout followed by brunch with his coworkers every weekend, which included one or two other coworkers and her. I said that does make me feel uncomfortable, but he really wanted it and that he has nothing to hide because I am always invited. I was already quite unhappy with this coworker and spending more time pretending to be ok with this person was a waste of my time, so I did not want to sign myself up for weekly socializing. He insisted that he wants to go and after another few weeks of argument we decided we can join the brunch part together. The brunch was alright but they stopped doing it after I joined.

In the mean time we continued couple’s counseling, and my husband said that he feels resentful toward me for blocking him from having a social life and that I am getting into his way whenever someone is ever trying to get close to him. He is traumatized by me and afraid that he will never have a close friend. I felt like this is a generalization and that he specifically wants to be with this female coworker is the issue I have. For example, I encouraged him to hang out with his male coworkers but he made excuses and never made it happen.

Furthermore, he continued saying that even if it is not this coworker, if there is a female person who approaches him in the future, even if I feel they do not respect the boundaries and our marriage, as long as he does not see it that way he would like to regularly hangout with them without me, since it does not necessarily mean that he is having a close friendship with that female person.

Then two weeks ago, he was sad for the whole weekend, then told me that he had a conversation with this coworker that I (his wife) am not comfortable with her and that he cannot hang out with her privately. I did not request it and it was out of nowhere so I was confused but I thanked him for taking my concerns seriously. He omitted mentioning to me that while I am not ok with her, he is ok with her and that he would like to remain friends with her, which I later found out. Then last Friday, this coworker and her fiancé offered my husband a ride home from work, which he took, but did not mention to me until the next day which made me feel really hurt.

There are three things I found problematic. 1) the ride home offer after knowing that I am not comfortable with her is another clear sign that she puts her friendship over my relationship with my husband. 2) he intentionally omitted the part of him directly telling her that he would like to remain friends with her. 3) I feel like I cannot trust him when it comes to anything with this coworker. Plus, it is really exhausting to continue fighting over someone who makes me feel uncomfortable and to feel like my own husband is the one who is protecting the person, not me.

Now I feel like this is becoming an irreconcilable differences in values between him and me. I need to be comfortable with his female friends if he were to be close with them outside of work, but he thinks I am too sensitive and overreacting and that it is my issue to resolve and he does not need to change his actions, otherwise he will resent me. I don’t want to stay with someone who will resent me for the rest of my life, but it is scary to leave a relationship I had for a good 1/3 of my life. I also considered him not only a husband but also my best friend, so it hurts even more.

Am I being unreasonable, paranoid, and sabotaging his social life and that I need to fix it?

ANSWER: Yeahhhhh your husband is not in a relationship with you, he's in a relationship with THEM. The coworker and her "fiancee" are the only two people he cares about out of the three of you. He's checked out of your marriage. Might be time for you to do so as well.

QUESTION: I feel like I'm (36M) forcing my wife (35F) to get rid of her cat and I don't like it.

Looking for opinions on a situation I have, I (36M) feel like I'm forcing my wife (35F) to get rid of her cat of 7 years. I am not much of a pet person, but I'm okay with them cause it makes my wife happy. The issue is, we have a cat who will not stop spraying in the house and it has become a cleanliness issue now. I feel embarrassed to have people over because I feel like I can still smell cat spray. This happens at least once a week and has been going on for over a year now. We've been married for just over a year and I feel like it started since she's moved in with me, which was almost 2 years ago now.

We have tried multiple things, the cat has already been fixed, but now know that's not a guarantee to fix spraying. We've tried multiple liter boxes, those cat pheromone scent things, we feed him well, fresh water...The only thing I'm finding is that it's stressed that will cause this, but I don't know what is so stressful for him. I'm never mean to it, I try to be as friendly as possible but nothing is changing.

My wife is pregnant, we're redoing some of the house, fresh carpet and refinishing a basement bathroom, along with getting a nursery ready, and we recently just came home from a vacation, we had a friend and a family member check in on the cat, feed him, and clean litter box while we were gone. When we came back home we were hit with a stench of cat spray in the house. I kinda lost it cause I no longer feel comfortable in my own home, told her that this has to change. The cat sprays if we rearrange a room, let alone fresh carpeting, and remodeling, I feel like all that is going to just get destroyed by this cat.

Now the issue is my wife is putting the cat up for adoption, obviously at this point I would love nothing more than to see this cat go bye bye, but she's sad and more than anything I don't want to see her sad. I feel like it's not just "I don't like your cat" but more of a problem and nuisance, however I am stuck between a rock and a hard place because I don't want my wife to resent me over this. She says she's doing it cause it's the right thing to do, but I don't believe her, I feel like I've forced her hand on this. I just wish she came to this conclusion before I had to say anything about it. I don't know what to do...

Sorry for the long story, please help on what I should do, am I out of line on this? Is there anything else I can do for this situation?

EDIT: we did take the cat to the vet, vet ran a couple tests, found cat is healthy and stated it seems like it's stressed induced. Vet said to confine the cat to a single room again and slowly reintroduce it to the rest of the house, we tried that over the course of a month or so, didn't change anything :/

UPDATE: THANK YOU ALL FOR THE FEEDBACK, we will continue to work with the cat for awhile. I should have expressed that these renovations haven't happened yet, but my concern was that if it's bad now, it certainly won't be any better when that begins. Also, after talking to my wife, she said the vet did prescribe Prozac, but she said it was too much of a fight with the cat for the cat to take it....so there's that lol

ANSWER: Medication for cats like prozac is a great option to treat spraying! Pls consider it before going to adoption. Chances are a cat who sprays due to stress will have an incredibly hard time getting adopted.

QUESTION: My (26F) fiancé(26M) are having a disagreement on equal contribution after marriage. How do we come up with a solution?

Hi everyone,

My fiancé and I are getting married in September 2026 and we have been discussing a lot about how married life would look for us.

We align on a lot of things except the whole ‘50-50’ life style. I personally don’t believe in 50-50 in a relationship because one will always do more than the other. Whereas, he does. I don’t think it will ever be as equal as 50-50.

Currently, we live together and bills are split evenly. I pay for my half of the rent, council tax and wifi. He pays for his half of the rent, electric and water. We also split food shops down the middle. Bills wise I pay more, but to make up the difference he pays for one week food shop by himself. I have a longer commute to work so that means I also have to pay for more petrol (which is not cheap). At the end of the month, I’m left with nothing and he is fine. He doesn’t drive so we live close to his work so he can get to and from work easier.

With household task, we’ve split that as well. He does the dishes, laundry, takes the bins out and cooks twice a week. I hoover, general tidying, clean the bathroom and cook 5 times a week. We’re really happy with how we split the housework, but it’s the financial side that we don’t seem to agree on.

The disagreement started because we were talking about how we will split everything including housework and childcare. He said housework would probably stay the same and with financial the same. But we will take into account how much each person makes and work it out from there. The issue started when we discussed what happens during maternity/ paternity leave. His work offers 4 weeks to the father and my work place offers 12-18 months.  for the mother. We were talking about how I wanted to take as much time as possible to stay home and bond with our child. He seems okay with this but the question of how will all other things work out. He said everything will stay the same. I don’t agree with this because it doesn’t really work with his 50-50 Mindset because I will be doing more of the childcare stuff. We talked about how we will do 50-50 of that and he doesn’t have an answer.

I asked if he’s will to do night feed and changes and he said he doesn’t know because he will need sleep for work. So far, the way it sounds is he seems to think I will do 90% of the childcare stuff and he will do his 10% during the weekend when he can have the whole day with them. He is saying he will do more when the child is older but that just means the first 2-3 years of the kids life will fall on me to manage. I don’t think this is fair. I have to do all my current housework, plus take care of the baby and on top of that, because I would be getting paid maternity pay, he is saying I can still pay my half of the bills.

I don’t like this arrangement at all. It makes it seem like he’s getting everything he wants and sometime off as well. Where I would be working 24/7 in the house and also contributing financially. It also doesn’t align with his 50-50 lifestyle.

We had a very big argument last year over finances and since then I’ll admit I’ve had my guard up when it comes to this.

I’m trying to explain to him my point of view on this but he just doesn’t seem to get it.

How can I explain to him that the way he’s looking at it is not equal at all? Is there a solution to this?

Edit:

For those who read my previous post and have questions as to why I am still with him. He made a promise and told me he understood where I was coming from and apologised and said it won’t happen again. I told him the next time we have this discussion I was done. He said he understood and now we’re here. I think in the back of my mind, I thought we would be having this discussion again but just hoped it wouldn’t happen.

I am also pushing for a prenup if the wedding takes place and I am asking for premarital counselling which he is refusing to go to because he thinks the counsellor will side with me.

Edit:

Hi again. Thank you all for the support and giving me your advice. Everything you said, I’ve thought about time and time again. I think I just needed the validation that this is red flag behaviour and not just a bump in the road.

I’ve struggled to bring things up in this relationship because everytime I have he has said I’m attacking him ( this is me trying to be delicate with my wording as well). But after seeing all of this, it good to know that I’m not being dramatic and everything I’ve thought are valid thoughts.

I am sitting him down to have this conversation with him today. I’ve also spoken to my sister and she has said I can stay with her whilst I figure out what to do. So I might have the conversation today and just stay away for a little while.

Wish me luck.

ANSWER: This insistence on 50/50 makes me think he's the kind of person who does what he perceives as his half, and then tells you "figure it out" if you struggle with your part.

QUESTION: I (F21) was sent a sex tape that my bf (M21) and his ex made

throwaway account for obvious reasons. going to get straight to the point, but if you guys want more context, i will be happy to provide.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half now. I’ve always had a little retroactive jealousy and it didn’t help that my bf constantly would talk about his ex at the beginning of our relationship, that obviously created internal issues with myself such as; feeling as if i have “competition”, insecurities and just constant comparing. i never said anything tho (i know, that’s where i messed up). he is very honest and if i want to know something, he has no problem telling me. past or present it doesn’t matter. he’s always been reassuring, just all around very good to me and i couldn’t be more grateful.

now bring us to a few days ago, when my friend sent me a sex tape of my bf and his ex. obviously upon viewing it, my heart stopped and anxiety just started flowing through my body. of course no one wants to see that but i think how ive been handling it since then is not ok and thats why im coming here for help.

i told my boyfriend and he was very mad that “my friend” would even send me a video like that. he apologized that i even had to see the video and he said he was embarrassed. now here’s my issue, im not mad at him because he didn’t do anything wrong, he didn’t cheat on me. this is clearly something from his past and i should be able to accept that it was from before and not now. i should be able to accept that he’s had a past, because everyone has. but i think what’s really getting to me is the fact that i had to see his past right in front of my eyes. i’m traumatized and even tho none of this is his fault i still feel a certain way about it. i don’t know exactly what it is or why im feeling this way. but as soon as i saw it, it’s like a flip in me switched. i no longer wanted to be affectionate with him, i don’t want to be touched sexually by him. and i definitely don’t want to continue making tapes of our own anymore. i can’t even look him in the eyes without thinking about it. i guess im just repulsed by it all now and disgusted?

please someone help me because it’s taking over. every moment i get to myself, i just cry because i feel like i have no one to go to about this that would understand. every little thing that happens during my day just reminds me of it and i can’t get it out of my head. it’s just constantly playing over and over and over. i’m just so mad at myself that im letting something like this affect me so much. i hate this so much. please if anybody has any advice whatsoever, i would appreciate it.

TLDR: got sent a sex tape between my bf and his ex, looking for advice on how to get over it.

ANSWER: Your boyfriend has every right to go to the police that that has been distributed. Your friend isn't your friend they are an arsehole

QUESTION: My GF ‘36F’ is freaking out over me selling one of my ‘32M’ cars?

I’ve been together with my girlfriend for four years and we’ve had a lot of issues throughout the time but nothing compared to this past year. I lost a lot of money in my business in January through a closed account and a partner stealing a lot of money (almost all my money) and my gf does not work. Since January it’s been really tough. We had to move out of our home and have been moving every month to new places while building up finances. It put a lot of stress on our relationship but tbh it actually showed me what I really wanted, valued, and how my gf actually was as a partner through a wave of hard times.

I’ve had two cars since the beginning of the year and they are both worth $40k+ each. I brought up selling one of them earlier this year and she freaked out which I didn’t expect. She said it was her car too and that she found it to be a last resort and basically gave an ultimatum and threat to if I sold the car. I ended up missing an amazing investment opportunity then due to not selling the car and have the capital free and I’m gutted every week I did not do it as I would have had huge returns in the months following. It would have changed everything, literally.

Fast forward we are in November now and with holidays around the corner along with another investment opportunity, I’m planning to sell one or both of the cars as our financial situation is not better but I need free capital to work and use to build on. It would help greatly.

I brought it up again and currently have three offers on both of the cars and the same issue is coming up. We’re barely able to pay bills and I’m in a constant state of stress every week because of it. I just feel stuck and have free capital available. I brought this up to her and she freaked out. She actually went and messaged two of the interested buyers and sent them semi aggressive notes saying not to buy the cars. She’s saying now that the only stability she has had throughout the years is the car and that’s her excuse now which is insane. She either said I have to break up with her and sell the cars or keep them and figure out a way to make money and to “manifest” it and stop complaining.

I just feel like I’m done with her and this mentality. It’s insane and doesn’t make any sense to me. We’ve been together so long and we’ve had many issues but due to the amount of stress that could have been avoided months ago, and the same situation arising now, I just feel done with her and just see this as a red flag in the future. I won’t go into details but would love some advice on where to go here as I’m feeling stuck.

I appreciate you all! Thank you!

Tl;dr

ANSWER: Massive red flag on her end. She does not work, and is now preventing you from liquidating your assets.

Take her on her offer. Break up. Sell one of the cars. Climb back up financially.

QUESTION: [27M] My wife [28F] cheated two years ago, and I still can’t stop looking for the cracks

She cheated about two years ago. She drove to another state to meet up with a guy. They didn’t have sex, but they did other things.

She was also in a really unstable place mentally. Her meds were all over the place and I understand that. I’ve been there myself, I’ve made mistakes too.

My question is: after they draw that line in the sand, when do you stop looking for it? In every interaction, there’s this trace of contempt, barely there, like 0.001%. But I can feel it. She irritates me more than she used to, and I hate that.

I think I still love her. That’s what’s kept us together. (That and a friend who convinced her that dumping me for the guy would be a bad idea.) She says she loves me too, and I… mostly believe her.

I’m not interested in anyone else. I’m not looking for an out. But I feel like I’m being mentally tortured by all the reminders. We’ve done marriage therapy before… maybe we should try again? But I’m not sure it’ll change anything.

How do you stop searching for the damage once it’s been done?

ANSWER: I’m sorry but there’s absolutely no chance that your wife drove to another state to do other things but not have sex. She definitely had sex with him.

QUESTION: I f/18 just gave my boyfriend m/19 an ultimatum. How do I hold myself to it?

So me and my boyfriend have been together for about a year now, we’re very close with each other’s families. He’s an amazing guy and I really do love him and that’s what’s making this so difficult.

In our relationship sometimes, he gets angry and will say things like “fuck you” and just be super rude. It’s like when he’s mad he forgets I’m his girlfriend and treats me like a stranger and it honestly has started to scare me. (I know he would never hit me, but I always get scared when people raise their voice). There was one time I tried to comfort him by grabbing his arm, and he ripped me off of him. After that happened, he went to his car and was crying. He says he doesn’t know why he’s like that and he hates it and he wants to change.

So, the 2nd most recent argument we had I told him after that I want him to work on the anger because I feel as if I can’t talk to him about issues. I offered podcasts, books, therapy, but he claims he doesn’t have time for it so he can’t. And I just told him to find something that works.

The most recent argument however was our worst one yet. I drove up to his campus and went to his dorm to surprise him and set up decorations, two of his friends were with me. We had original plans to meet at a coffee shop but it was a 5 minute walk to his dorm so I assumed it would be okay. As soon as he texted me that he was out, I told him to come to his dorm. Then he started to blow up on me over text. “Why are you like this” “fuck you” “okay I’m just going to your car”. I was super upset at this point and both of his friends saw this, and were in utter shock (one of them saw his texts)

Once he made it to the dorm and realized his friends were there and everything was decorated, he didn’t say thank you, he talked to his friends about his day then gave me a side hug.

So, I asked his friends to leave for a minute and we had one of the worst arguments we’ve ever had. It pretty much ended with me saying “if you snap at me like this again I don’t think I can be with you”.

It felt terrible, my entire trip up there felt ruined. I don’t want to break up with him. But it’s coming to a point where he’s texting me this stuff while I’m with my friends. And I’ve started to get migraines from the amount of stress I’m under. I’m just scared that when the time comes, I won’t have the strength to end it.

So, how do I keep the strength to end it? I know that when it happens again he’s going to do it and then apologize and say he doesn’t want to lose me and everything. I’m scared I’m not going to be able to break up with him.

ANSWER: Bite the bullet and do it, or just decide that you'll content yourself with a shitty relationship.

We can't give you strength beyond telling you that this shit isn't tolerable or acceptable. If that isn't enough, then turn to your friends and family for encouragement.

Wanting better for yourself means making the choices that get you better things.

QUESTION: My (F27) boyfriend (M35) is controlling and insecure, but is begging I wait while he gets therapy - I don’t know if I should ?

For context, I work from home, rarely go out, and I don’t chat with anyone online, I’m a ‘what you see is what you get’ type of lady. I’ve never cheated, emotionally or physically.

However, my boyfriend has been cheated on in past relationships. And since he hasn’t done the work to heal, he is very insecure. When he perceives something as a threat, he feels the need to control the situation, so he becomes harsh, moody and stonewalls me (silent treatment).

The most recent problem - there is a guy in our friendship group who once had a crush on me many years ago. He has since moved on and has a girlfriend. The other day this guy confirmed in our group chat that he will be attending a gig with us - so I responded with a Party Hat emoji. Two hours later I am picked up by my partner as we were heading for a weekend getaway. He was totally silent the whole journey, apart from when he did a sarcastic laugh and asked if I am a retard, because I responded with a Party Hat emoji to that guy.

He is constantly picking apart my behaviour and twisting it into whatever narrative his brain has created.

“You asked a guy in the smoking area for a lighter ? EW - why did you feel the need to ask a MAN?! He will see that as an invitation! I honestly thought better of you - I put you on a high pedestal, but now I know I was wrong”

A few months ago me, my partner and his friend went into town. I didn’t want his friend to feel like a third-wheel so I made sure to ask a few questions and make him feel comfortable. The next day I had the silent treatment for apparently giving his friend ‘too much’ attention.

I got stonewalled recently for playing a ball game in the pool during a STEN party (combined Hen / Stag) because I described we were excited and were grabbing each other to try and get the ball.

I feel like he is constantly watching how I talk, what I say, how I act, with whom and when. I no longer get excited for going out because it’s now a ritual I’ll be stonewalled about something the next day.

He also likes to tell me how gross my history is, even though my history is pretty normal for my age.

He has shouted at me a few times in front of my friends if I don’t adhere to his expectations, which has been embarrassing.

These are a just a few examples - but the accusations are constant.

My family and friends don’t like him and said I should leave him.

This weekend I told him I think we should end the relationship because I am emotionally burnt out, I just can’t cope with the constant accusations and insults. I totally understand that people need reassurance sometimes, and I’m happy to do that, but the way he communicates is upsetting.

He is now apologising for his behaviour, recognises his error, and says he will get therapy. He is asking me to please wait while he focuses on healing. But I just don’t think I have it in me.

Has anyone here ever stook it out with a controlling partner who actually ended up improving ? My position is that I should leave.

ANSWER: Don’t wait. There’s no promise he “gets better” and on top of that, he could be better for a week and then revert. You don’t have to wait for anyone, it’s not your responsibility

QUESTION: My (F48) Husband (42M) and I Have Totally Different Lives Now

My husband travels a lot for work. Like, two to three weeks of the month he is out of state. I am a stay at home mom
with a severely autistic son (Level 3, significant outside support need. Think Arnie Grape and Rain Man as opposed
to Abed and Sheldon).

It is causing a lot of friction in my marriage. When he's home, he is completely involved and we share almost all the
responsibilities. I have no complaints when my husband is actually here. It's when he's gone and when he comes
home I'm struggling with.

Caring for our son alone for week stretches at a time, for half the month, is incredibly stressful. I feel isolated,
exhausted, and emotionally battered. We don't have a ton of money, and I decided I'd rather not have to worry about
housekeeping than hire qualified child care to ease things, so someone cleans the house once a week, and that's
our expendable income spent. It seemed wrong to hire a nanny so I can clean the house uninterrupted; morally I feel
it's better to be available to my son and hire out the house cleaning.

I'm also in school part time online working toward my Master's so I can get a career down the road.

My husband's job is very fulfilling to him. He loves what he does (camera operator for pro sports), and his employers
pay the costs for him to see and do a lot of really interesting things - visit the Grand Canyon, ride four wheelers on
the beach, eat at nice restaurants, stay in nice hotels. I'll get texts like ‘Keanu Reeves is in our production truck right
now!’. Stuff like that.

I don't do anything really. I'm so strapped to my son. My friends are all parents to special needs kids so none of us
have time for a social life. I have limited places I can take my son because of his behaviors. So I'm almost always
just at home.

Here's the main problem: when my husband comes home, happy and full of experiences, he wants to spend time
with me watching movies or playing video games, hanging out. I appreciate that he's happy to see me and missed
me, but all I want to do is hand my son over and sleep, or have the luxury of going to the bathroom with the door
closed, or have a good cry (can't cry in front of my son, he utterly flips out). In short, I want my sense of self back.
And I can tell it disappoints my husband that I am basically zero fun, with zero energy, and just wanting to isolate and
recharge.

It's been almost five years since this started and, frankly, I'm a ghost of who I used to be. I understand that he needs
to make money for us to survive. I understand the situation is what it is. He didn't choose to travel for work, the travel
gigs just pay the most and gig work is precarious and he needs to take every job he can or crewers will think he's
unreliable and take him off their hire lists. And I am very aware how fortunate he is to do a job he loves, with
coworkers he enjoys being around.
But I'm so unhappy. And when he's gone I go into survival mode, making sure I can take good care of my son, get
my schoolwork done and keep my grades up, and handle all my responsibilities. When my husband comes home I
can't get out of that mode instantly or easily. So he comes home to a very sad, very tired wife who was cleaning poop
off the walls while he was eating surf-n-turf at Ruth's Chris. And while I know he wishes things were easier for me, he
has no real idea what my life is like. The longest he's ever cared for our son alone was one week two years ago
when I went on a cruise with my adult daughter. We'd saved for a long time so I could do that. But that's it. Out of
eight years of having our son.

I don't know what to do. I feel like we live almost opposite lives and there's this huge chasm between us. He'll call me
to tell me he's going hiking in the mountains, and I'll call him to tell him our son bit his own hand so hard at school
they had to massage his jaws to get him to let go.
Is there any hope of us connecting as a couple again? I don't know how to do it.

Info Edit - My son has medical orders for every service under the sun. Unfortunately, there's a severe shortage of professionals here. He's only getting a third of his hours with a BHT (para, wraparound) because he has to share with another kid. No home and community hours either, no one to fill them.

Y'all's advice is sound and awesome. I'll be having a talk with my husband, and I'll be going to a hotel next week on my own to unwind.

ANSWER: You sound like you’re burning out.

I think you need to tell your husband, but also can you look into respite care for a bit? You very much sound like you need a break. A week off. Probably with your husband to reconnect as well

QUESTION: I (31F) want to divorce my husband (33m) due to my ongoing infertility

My husband and I met in college, we’ve been together over ten years now, married three years, own a house etc. Over the last three years we’ve been going through infertility, entirely female factor (endometriosis).

We did IVF and I actually got pregnant this round but it looks like I’m miscarrying. I’m devastated and feel even worse as he looked so happy when he saw that positive test, just for it to look like it’s going to get ripped away so soon. He is the best guy I ever met, I feel like I took the best man I ever met and then destroyed his life. He should be a dad, he would be a great one!

Every time I bring this up he says it’s okay, he doesn’t blame me, we can adopt etc. He’s so young, he could easily go have a family with someone else.  I myself fantasize about having an affair or something not because I don’t love my husband (I do) but the thought of a relationship where I don’t have to spend every minute feeling sad and like shit about myself is so appealing. The guilt is destroying me all the time, part of me wants to divorce him so he can be free and I don’t have to feel so responsible for ruining his life anymore. Advice for a situation like this?

TLDR: I want to divorce my husband so he can be free of me and my ongoing infertility.

ANSWER: Please reach out for mental health support. You're going through some extremely tough stuff and it's understandable that your thoughts and feelings are a mess right now.

Please believe me when I tell you that you NEED someone who csn guide you through this from the outside. It will be the greatest gift you ever give yourself AND your marriage.

QUESTION: I (23F) think my husband (26M) is having memory problems and I am concerned for him

hi all, my husband and I just got married 2 weeks ago and are having an amazing marriage so far. we are both pretty hard headed people, but work through any and all problems we have very well, and are both fairly emotionally mature, so arguments and scuffles always get resolved within a day, if not within an hour or so. however, there has been one main issue that i’ve had that has been brought up many times, but can’t really be “fixed” by normal means.

his memory is very poor, and i don’t mean that he forgets birthdays or anniversary’s, he would never do that. I mean more like he will say something one day and the not remember saying it the next day. or he will claim to have said something that he didn’t. on som occasions, he will swear up and down that we had a conversation about something that either never happened or sis not happen the way he is claiming. in more extreme scenarios like the one i just experienced, he will say something, and then immediately forget or claim he didn’t say it the same breath during a conversation.

for example of what just happened, we were having a chill conversation about a friend of ours and he said “i think some of it is maybe for shock value or attention” to which i said “really? you think it’s shock value”. he gave me a weird look and said “i never said anything about shock value”. This was followed by several seconds of silence as I tried to process what just happened or wait for some sort of response, but he stood by the fact that he never said that and was convinced I was making it up.

now i don’t want this to come off like I am always right or I have the best memory, I really don’t, i make mistakes and forget things or remember things wrong all the time, but at this point with him it is becoming genuinely concerning that there could be an underlying problem

for reference; he doesn’t drink, he used to smoke weed but doesn’t anymore bc of work (this has happened for several years regardless of weed use), and he doesn’t not use any other drugs. he does have severe depression and a history of mental illness, but nothing relating directly to memory capacity. we are both very open and talkative about our mental health and he does not typically mention anything like brain fog or anything that would clue me in to this issue.

this problem has been the root and cause of several arguments and scuffles, both due to him not remembering things, putting words in my mouth, and also due to his frustration when I call him out on it. I genuinely do not believe that it is in any way manipulative or on purpose, I truly think he is not aware of when it happens and really believes in his memory. any ideas on how to help him/ better facilitate conversations around this topic?? thanks in advance.

ANSWER: Probably needs to see a doctor. My coworker used to do that before they found out he’s got rheumatoid arthritis. Once he got on the right medication, these things stopped happening as often.

QUESTION: How do I politely tell my partner (M30) that the way he eats makes me (F33) want to drop dead?

My partner (M30) and I (F33) have been together for about a year now. One of the things he thinks is really important is open communication. His last partner never told him when she was upset about something and just broke it off with him out of no where, so he really wants to open dialogues when there is some sort of issue.

The problem is that I'm the only one who ever opens these dialogues. I feel like I'm always asking him to stop doing things or to do things a certain way. I'm worried that I'm becoming overbearing in this sense, which I really don't want to be. I don't want to always be asking him to change his behaviors when he might be letting things I do that bother him slide under the rug.

This brings us to the way he eats. God he never chews with his mouth closed and he's always smacking his lips. I can't stand it. I'm autistic and have a bit of Misophonia, and can not stand hearing people chew. Its not just irritating I have a visceral reaction to it. It becomes the only thing I can think about when I hear it and it makes my skin crawl. However, I'm aware this is a bit dramatic, and it feels like such a petty gripe to ask him to be more mindful when he eats. Not to mention I don't want to bring it up while he's doing it because i get so strung out I don't want to come off like an irritated bitch.

This came to a head last night when we were having a party with some friends. He was sitting next to me snacking for hours, and I could hear every bite he took. Suddenly I could hear EVERYONE eating and I got so overwhelmed and strung out that I had to just stand up and leave the room, which freaked everyone out a bit because the thought I was sick.

I really want to avoid this happening again but I really don't know how to or if I should bring this up.

ANSWER: Is he Asian? This is really common in Asia. I hate it too and I’m exactly the same as you. I’ve dated guys who do this. In fact I could have written this 😂 I’ll stay for the comments

But yeah, you have my support. My sister is also autistic, I’m not but I’m very sensitive to anything eating related and gag very easily when I think something is gross 😂😂😂😂😂 Your EXACT situation has happened to me too, except in my case I genuinely could actually throw up from it.

I really support you so much, I feel like you are my kindred spirit. Never thought I’d see someone post about this on Reddit.

QUESTION: I (19m) got a haircut from my friend (19f) while being in a relationship with my gf (19f).

I’m wondering how badly I crossed the line here as my girlfriend became very upset upon me telling her that I got a cut from my female friend. I tried to stress to her that it is simply because it was a free haircut (I’m broke and don’t wanna go to the salon), along with the fact that my friend is actually a good barber as she cuts her own hair. I know what this can look like but I genuinely just needed a haircut and it was free. I also have previously asked my gf to cut my hair to which she has said she doesn’t know how to, which I interpreted as a no. Have I cheated? Is this something people consider as cheating?

ANSWER: there is no world where this is cheating. How is this different from going to a female barber? If you went to a female barber regularly and became friends do you then have to change barbers or else it's cheating? This is ridiculous.

QUESTION: I (33M) found messages on my wife’s (32F) phone?

Won’t let me upload pics so here’s the conversation:

Him : Hi!
Don’t do a damn quote for Hunter this afternoon
Call me before you do anything

Her: I'm glad you hit me up. He wanted me to revise something for orient. Wanted it done by 2 and I was literally about to do it. Call me if you need to fill me in on what I should do. He's trying to light a fire under my ass about it.
Just read your response to Hunter, not gonna lie, I'm into it. Lol. Nothing puts a smile on my face like someone telling him to slow his damn roll.

Him: (sends video of his roasted pumpkin seeds)

Her: Damn I’m impressed

Him: With the way I roast pumpkin seeds?

Her: And the way you handle Hunter.
Your talents are multifaceted it seems.

Him: So are yours! Don't sell yourself short

Her: I'll admit, I roast a mean batch of pumpkin seeds. 😎

Him: Do you?! Maybe we will have to roast pumpkin seeds together someday

Her: I wouldn't hate that. Am I holding off on this Orient quote?

Him: Yes. Hunter won't respond or call me back, so, yes (❤️)

Her: Love this for me lol

Him: You deserve it (❤️)

Her: Hunter just pinged me to ask
"how it's coming". 😑

Him : That should tell you everything you need to know about that guy. 
Hunter whined and they want you to update to Ts and Cs
still today....l am sorry
I tried to stand up for you

Her: It's fine. I'm still stuck doing quotes for Richard anyway and the T&Cs will take me like 4 seconds.

His: Thank you. I am sorry again

Her: But I can't PDF edit the Ship To like he wanted me to because I don't have my adhe nrn
Fighting with software central to get my
download since the update still 🙄 "urgent" requests like today.

Him: Ugh I am sorry. Get off the computer and go have a great weekend.

Her: I still have to finish the Trinity Hills quote that l had to put on hold to do Hunters Revision. Lol. It's fine though. It's only 3:45 here. I'll be done in time to go party with the kids. (❤️)

Him: What’s your costume?

Her: Pam Beesly (😆)

Him: I love it! Is your husband Jim Halpert?

Her: Lol. No. He never dresses up.
Honestly I wanted to be 3 hole punch version of Jim myself, but i feel like only the cool people would get it.

Him: I would have (❤️)
Or Facebook

Her: Like I said.. cool people.
Dude. Hunters getting himself in a tizzy over this. I'm about to lose my cool. us stuck

Him: What a dick. Can I text you?

Her: Even if I had gotten this done at noon, Marco is still out and unavailable to review it. This is the unfortunate nature of quote creation sometimes. He really doesn't get how this works. Ugh.
I'm done bitching about him. It's late there. YOU should get off the computer and go enjoy your Halloween. Lol

Check you FB. Happy Halloween 😉

she friend requested him and that’s where the conversation ended for now. The hearts I put in a heart reactions from the other person. I just want to hear other opinions. I obviously have my own but I’m trying to gather myself and figure out how to handle this. This is a guy she met a couple months ago on a work trip to Seattle. She has never mentioned him to me before but I obviously know of him

UPDATE

I confronted her about it and she confessed to it. Says that she has a problem with needing to seek validation. Also claims it wasn’t going to go anywhere and she already felt guilty before I said anything..

ANSWER: Friendly and possibly slightly flirty work talk.

What were you looking for?

Her colleague is encouraging her to enjoy the weekend with her family, knows she has a husband and kids. I saw nothing untoward.

QUESTION: He [41M] asked me [37F] to marry him and he hates my reaction

I really need some outside perspective because my head and heart are a mess right now.

We’ve been on vacation for a few weeks, and today he planned a very romantic dinner. In the middle of it, he surprised me with a ring. Instead of saying an immediate yes, the only thing that came out of my mouth was: “Baby, are you sure? We’ve been having problems.”

He got extremely upset. He took the ring back, said I embarrassed him, and told me it was over. He said my reaction wasn’t “good enough” and then started listing ways I break his heart. He also made a jab about how I’d probably write about this because I’ve been writing stories and working on a book, clearly meant to hurt.

For context: we’ve been together 7 years and living together most of that time. I’ve always wanted to marry him, even though he’s always said he “doesn’t believe” in marriage. Our early years were rocky, with multiple breakups. Since June I’ve been in therapy because I realized I’m a pushover and struggle in our fights, which can be messy and awful (alcohol involved). I’ve been trying to reflect on our relationship and even asked him to try therapy with me, but he’s refused.

He has been trying to improve, and I do appreciate that. But I also wanted us to talk about our issues before giving an immediate yes to marriage. Ever since I started therapy, we’ve been fighting weekly about me being “less loving” and him feeling like I’ve changed.

Now I’m heartbroken. I feel horrible for hurting him, but at the same time… if we can’t even talk about something as big as marriage without everything blowing up, are we actually ready for it? Are we even right for each other anymore?

I don’t know if this is salvageable. It feels like the way things unfolded has broken something between us.

What would you do in my situation? How do I even start processing this or deciding what’s next?

TL;DR: My boyfriend of 7 years proposed during a romantic dinner. I hesitated because of ongoing relationship issues, and he got very upset, took the ring back, said I embarrassed him, and started saying hurtful things. Our relationship has had rocky patterns, including messy alcohol-related fights, and I’ve been in therapy trying to work on myself. Now I’m devastated and unsure whether this relationship is healthy or if marriage is even the right path. Looking for advice.

ANSWER: In my honest opinion, he just provided immediate evidence for the source of your hesitancy in that very moment with his reaction. Seems like a case of a bruised ego and a failed attempt at putting a bandaid on your problems. If you cannot communicate about your relationship in a healthy way, or at least make a joint effort to bridge those gaps in communication, what else do you have? his refusal for therapy, and prior disbelief in marriage speaks volumes here though, it sounds like he thought the proposal would shut you up tbh.

QUESTION: My boyfriend (26M) wants to surprise me (23F) with a vacation but I found the booking details and its way beyond our means and I don't know what to do?

My bf and I have been together for about 8 months and things are mostly really good. He's super thoughtful and always trying to do nice things for me which I love about him.  
Last week he was acting all mysterious saying he had a surprise planned for my birthday next month. I wasn't trying to snoop or anything but when I was using his laptop I saw email confirmations for this resort in Cancun. Like a really fancy place with those overwater bungalows that cost an arm and a leg.  
Here's the thing... my bf works retail and I know he has some money aside from a win on Stɑke to move out of his parents place eventually. We've talked about our finances before and he mentioned wanting to keep that money saved for when he gets his own apartment. This trip would probably cost him close to $4000 with flights and everything.  
I'm torn because its so sweet that he wants to do something special for me but I don't want him to blow through all his money just for a vacation. I also feel weird that I know about it now when its supposed to be a surprise. Part of me wants to just let him surprise me and act shocked but another part of me thinks I should say something so he doesn't make a huge financial mistake.  
I really don't want to hurt his feelings or make him think I don't appreciate the gesture because I totally do. But I'd honestly be just as happy with something more low key that doesn't stress his budget.

ANSWER: “I wasn’t trying to snoop but I just happened to be on his laptop and I just happened to open his email inbox and I just happened to open his email confirmations and then I just happened to read through them”

I always find these sorts of explanations so funny.

QUESTION: How can I (23F) explain to my boyfriend (28M) of 5 years that I don’t want to take from my personal savings to help him with his bills like he wants me to?

Hi all! this is my first time posting to reddit but basically as the title says, my boyfriend wants me to take from my personal savings to help him with his bills but I honestly don’t want to and I feel really guilty about it.

I’m going to try to not make this crazy long but there’s a lot to unpack so please feel free to ask questions if anything is too vague or doesn’t make sense. My thoughts are currently all over the place so sorry if there’s any mistakes.

For a bit of background, we live in an apartment which he owns but the monthly fees are really high. The apartment is under his name as he had it before we got together, I have never had my own place and legally still live with my parents. I currently don’t have a job as I quit a little over a month ago due to personal reasons, and will be going back to school so I am not looking for employment as my parents have funds for my education. My bf has a full time job and has been there for almost 10 years now, however the owner recently changed which he’s pretty unhappy about as the new owner isn’t a good guy. Up until this point my bf was fairly happy with his job as he use to be able to nap most of the days and didn’t really do a lot of work, but with the owner change he hasn’t been able to nap or relax at all. I understand it’s stressful but he now wants to quit and unfortunately told that to the new owner even though everyone told him he shouldn’t. Now the new owner is looking to replace him so my bf is panicking that he won’t have any income and wants me to take from my personal savings to cover his expenses.

I love my boyfriend alot and want to spend my life with him but I’m really uncomfortable taking from my savings as I don’t think I should have to, however he thinks I should since in the end it’ll be “our” money anyways and it’s better than him losing the apartment. The thing that really irritates me is he’s super into crypto and has a bunch of money put into it but he refuses to take anything out. When I was working I would regularly send him money to help out with bills and other expenses, but now that I don’t have a steady income I can’t send him as much as I use to and am running low on funds. Luckily as I still partially live with my parents I don’t have many expenses (no bills at least) so I’ve been able to afford helping him. I’m just really stuck with what to do because I want to help him more but I don’t have the means to, and I’m starting to get pretty upset that he keeps pushing me to either get a job or take from my savings. He also could ask his family for money which I know is embarrassing but I feel like he’s putting this all on me without exhausting other options. My parents also are really against me giving him money, especially from my savings, and they refuse to help him as they’ve already had to dig him out of multiple holes previously. I love this man a lot but it’s starting to get hard not to be upset with him, I know he’s struggling a lot but I’m already stressed enough with going back to school after completely changing my career path, and I’m just so worried that this will break us. I’m not always the best girlfriend, I’m not great at cleaning up after he cooks and I’m not good at talking about my feelings but I just hate how upset he gets at me while I still support him constantly even though pretty much all he does besides go to work is sleep or complain or talk about crypto. Sorry I’m starting to ramble but any advice would truly be a blessing I’m just so stuck right now and I don’t want to lose him or myself to this.

TLDR: My boyfriend wants me to take from my personal savings to help with his bills without exhausting his other options and I’m worried if I don’t our relationship will be over

UPDATE / EDIT:
I’ve never updated a post so hopefully this is right!
Just wanted to update and add some additional information as a lot of people seem to misunderstand that I do nothing for my boyfriend. I do pay for things and up until recently I had a job that I ended up having to leave due to my mental health and toxic environment. I do clean up after my boyfriend cooks, I also pay for groceries and pay for anything else we need or want, I just have never paid rent as he owns the apartment and never wanted me to pay / wouldn’t let me pay rent. I am also the one with a license and drive us everywhere as he refuses to get his license. Up until recently I haven’t been able to pay for as much as I no longer have an income and have made the decision to go back to school so I will not be able to work while studying. Anyways! I ended up speaking to him today and told him I wasn’t comfortable taking from my savings and asked if he could ask his own family or take from his investments. He still won’t ask his family which I understand however regarding his investments he said he’ll take from them in the new year if they still don’t go up but currently he still wants to hold on to them as they’re currently down and he doesn’t want to take them at a loss. If he does end up losing his job (which we should know next week) then I’ll just cover him for a couple months until he can hopefully go on employment insurance (we’re in Canada). I’m still not very comfortable taking from my savings but he explained that it’s really his only option and it’ll be better for the both of us in the long run, so I’m praying everything works out (mainly praying he doesn’t lose his job so I won’t have to take from my savings at all). I appreciate all of the feedback, even though some of it was definitely not helpful, and I am aware I’m a bit immature, I mean I’m 23 and have never lived by myself or have had to fend for myself so I’m still learning a lot as I go. I know a lot of you won’t be happy about the update and I’m not really but he’s always been there for me and I’m not ready to give up jus yet, we’ve had to go through a lot and if I need to financially support him at his lowest then that’s what I have to do. Maybe it’s the wrong choice and could be due to my immaturity but I know he would help me if our roles were reversed (even if that sounds hard to believe). Thanks again everyone for your opinion, both to those who supported me and were against me, gave me a lot to think about :)

ANSWER: Move back in with your parents and focus on your education.

This guy is stressed that he can’t nap his way through his job and wants your money.

You don’t want to clean after he cooks or pay rent.

Your parents have helped financially “multiple” times.

It’s okay that you’re not ready to be independent, but stop playing house and pretending like you are.

QUESTION: A few weeks ago myself [22M] and gf[21F] went out with a few friends and she spent the night ignoring me and touching/dancing with another guy and then asked him for his Instagram.

Went out to the club as a group and my gf spent the night pretty much ignoring me, holding on this guy's arm and dancing with him.

On the way home we all stopped to get food and she asked for his Instagram. All of these events took place right in front of me. I've told her years ago I'm not cool with her touching other guys like that. I just found the whole experience to be pretty humiliating.

I didn't say anything about it until a few days after it happened and she just said she's sorry. I brought it up a bit after that and she told me to fuck off and said I'm dragging it. The final time I brought it up she only said she was drunk and didn't think about what she was doing. That time I said I don't think I can continue like this. She basically asked me to take some time to think about it but since has been acting like everything is fine when now it hurts to sleep in the same bed as her. I've barely been sleeping at the moment because it's been on my mind so often.

I know reddit likes to always jump to the conclusion of splitting up but I just wanna give a bit more context as to why that's so hard for me. Firstly we've been together for 6 years. Secondly we live together and still have 10 months left on our lease, my family lives far away and I've been playing in a band here that I really enjoy and I don't wanna leave them.

I feel like she's tried to make me think I'm thinking about it too much.  I don't wanna leave everyone else behind and move home. As I said I've tried to say we can just be friends but she won't have it. I'm afraid to bring it up again.

Is there any chance to fix this? Or are we just incompatible?

Thanks guys

ANSWER: I mean I love when my partner treats me like shit and then blows me off when I try to talk about it.

QUESTION: My (34M) girlfriend’s (34F) coworker keeps pushing for one on one time. I’m unsure how to feel about how she’s responding. Advice?

Girlfriend and I have been together 2+ years. New coworker has been messaging her a lot outside of work. It quickly shifted into asking her to spend time with him one-on-one (movies, dinner). She She semi-ignores those.

Then it moved to several messages focused on me. Asking if I lived there, my schedule and what I do. She ignores those. I know this bc she openly showed me.  We briefly talked about the portions I was not comfortable with and moved on, no argument.

What she doesn’t know is I found the conversation doubling the following week, her initiating half. She didn’t encourage anything romantic, but much less work related (good morning, photo of her Halloween costume and now responding to his invites as ‘ll let you know’).

I’m not looking to control who she talks to, but I feel uneasy about how he believes he can probe for availability for eternity?

My question:
How would you handle a situation where a partner continues talking with someone who repeatedly asks for 1 on 1? How do you balance trust with wanting to feel respected?

ANSWER: Ok, I’ve been married 20 years and neither of us would entertain this with a person of the opposite sex. She should have shut down anything personal politely,and not responded to these requests. She’s encouraging him and you know it and it will turn into an emotional affair. The fact that she’s letting this happen is not a good sign for your relationship.

QUESTION: I(20M) found out my wife(20F) cheated with a close friend for 8 months. I don’t even feel anything anymore. What’s my next move?

We’re both 20. We’ve known each other for 10 years, friends first, then dating, and married for the last 2. I really believed our history meant something solid. But for the last 8 months, she’s been having an affair with a guy I once considered a close friend. Someone who acted like he respected our relationship while sneaking around with her.

There wasn’t some dramatic discovery, a different friend pulled me aside and told me the truth. And when everything clicked into place, it was like my mind just… shut down. All the suspicion and confusion I had before turned into this weird emptiness.

We don’t live together anymore. But now that the dust has settled, there’s no screaming, no crying… just nothing. The days we spent together during those months don’t even feel real anymore. It’s like I was still trying to build a future while she quietly walked out of it.

I know divorce is probably the next step, but even that feels like it’s happening to someone else. I don’t know what to say to her, I don’t know what to say to him, and I honestly don’t know what to feel. The numbness is almost scarier than anger would be.

TL;DR: Both 20. Married 2 years, together for 10. She cheated for 8 months with a close friend. We’re no longer living together. I feel numb and don’t know how to move forward.

Update:

Three days after I found out about the affair, I filed for divorce. Since then, I’ve stayed completely no-contact with her. She’s tried reaching out a few times, but I haven’t responded. There’s really nothing left to say.

Things got a little messy a bit after that. I was out with some friends when her new guy (the one she cheated with) pulled up on me. She was in the car with him. He tried to start a fight, then switched up and said, “we good bro, I don’t want drama.” That same night, she texted me to apologize for how that went down and said she didn’t want it to happen. I didn’t reply to her either.

A few days later, I ran into a few mutual friends from that group. They didn’t even know what had really gone down, so when they heard my side, they all took my side and have been helping me gather evidence for the divorce. Apparently, her new guy has been telling her that I was trying to take everything from her in the divorce, which wasn’t true, but now that I know she’s been trying to do that to me, everyone’s telling me maybe I should just take what’s mine and walk away.

Recently, I found out some more news about them. Apparently, he just bought a house, and there’s a chance she’s living with him now and helping take care of his kid. I can’t confirm it 100%, but that’s what I’ve been told by people who know them.

It’s strange. I’ve accepted that it’s over, and I’ve been staying focused on my own peace, but part of me still worries. I grew up around this guy, and I know how he can be. He’s always had a short fuse and tends to get aggressive when he’s in the wrong or doesn’t get his way. I’m not saying that to start drama, I just genuinely hope she’s safe.

I’m not planning on contacting her or involving myself in any of it. I’m keeping my distance, letting my lawyer handle everything, and focusing on moving forward. It’s been a lot, but honestly, staying calm and silent has helped me more than anything. I’m taking it one day at a time and just trying to rebuild.

TL;DR: Filed for divorce three days after finding out she cheated with a close friend. Been no-contact ever since. Her new guy tried starting a fight, she apologized, and now they might be living together. I’m staying focused on myself and moving on, just hoping she stays safe.

ANSWER: I know this feels like a cliche, but you need to be talking to someone about it.  A therapist ideally.  A religious leader or a trusted older confidant are also possibilities.  But you need to talk to someone to help pull yourself out of the numbness.

Once you do, you'll realize that her behavior was all about who she is and nothing about you.  You'll realize you're young with a whole life ahead of you to love and build a future with someone who deserves you.  And you'll also come to understand that, as awful as this experience is, overcoming it will help you grow in ways you don't yet see.

QUESTION: I (38M) feel resentful about the creeping expectation that I should support my mother (F55) and her partner (F55) as they get older.

My mother had me at 16. We grew up very poor because a) she was/is an alcoholic and wouldn't have been able to hold down a job and b) she's very lazy, and didn't want a job anyway. We lived in a council home, on welfare. Both of them chose to not work a day in their lives and live on welfare to this day. Recently, she's made vague comments about how my sister has been sending her money "and she doesn't even want it back because she knows we're getting older" - which they are, and the sort of lifestyle they've lived means they are more like 65 than 55. The comments come across to me as her basically saying "and why don't you help us?" I've been working every day of my life since I left school at 16. She had me paying rent with her from my very first paycheck, before I moved out at 17. They've never helped me, financially or otherwise really, since then. We get on OK. The idea that, because they're getting older, and they need more money than they currently get from the government, that somehow it's on me to support them seems unfair.

ANSWER: Children are not a retirement plan.

Your mother can expect as much as she likes but you owe her nothing, it might be an idea to start limiting contact with her.

QUESTION: (25F) My boyfriend (30M) dismissed my sickness twice. I am deeply hurt and is struggling with the idea of breaking up with him.

Hey everyone, using a throwaway for privacy. I'm (25F) an Asian immigrant, and my boyfriend "BF" (30M) is a local Caucasian. We've been together for 5 years, and I'm really struggling with a recurring issue that has me questioning our entire relationship.

I need some outside perspective because I don't know what to do.

Incident 1: About a month ago

I woke up in the middle of the night with sudden, excruciating lower abdominal pain. I'm not exaggerating when I say it was worse than my appendicitis pain. I was literally screaming and crying. I had read about Corpus luteum ruptures and was terrified.

I begged BF to take me to the ER (I was too sick to drive my own car.). He refused. Not just once, but every time I asked. His reasoning was that the ER "wouldn't do anything" and I'd "just be in pain in a different location." He said I should just wait it out and would feel better soon.

I cried in agony for over 3 hours. Eventually, he started saying, "Fine, I could take you," but then would immediately follow it with, "but you need to know it's a waste of time and they won't help you." It felt like he was trying to talk me out of my own pain. The pain finally calmed down after about 5 hours total, and I passed out from exhaustion. I was fine the next day, so I tried to just forget it ever happened.

Incident 2: One week ago

I got hit with a bad case of food poisoning (vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache). I couldn't keep even water down. I had a midterm the next day and was worried that I wouldn't make it. I asked to go to the ER again.

BF refused again. Same script: "You'll waste 6 hours there for no reason."

This time, I called an Uber and went by myself. At the ER, they gave me some hydration thing and told me to go home and wait for the doctor to call. The whole thing took less than 10 mins. So I Ubered home and took it easy for the rest of the day.

Now?

I told my mom about both incidents. She is a very traditional Asian and believes in seeking medical help. She is now deeply displeased with him and thinks I should break up. She said, "If something is wrong, it's always better to be at the hospital."

I'm stuck because I can't get over this. This isn't a one-off; it's a pattern that has happened a few times throughout our relationship whenever I'm sick or hurt. His default is to dismiss my need for medical care.

For context, he is not a recluse; he goes out with his friends to bars/pubs at least once a week, so it's not like he's avoiding going out altogether.

I feel a massive breach of trust. When I was at my most vulnerable and in genuine distress, he wasn't my partner; he was an obstacle. My mom's disapproval is adding pressure, but my own hurt is the real issue.

I'm at a lost here and don't know what to do.

TL;DR: My boyfriend has refused to take me to the ER during two medical incidents (excruciating pain and severe food poisoning), arguing it's a waste of time. I went alone for the second one. My mom wants me to break up with him, and I'm struggling with the broken trust.

ANSWER: This is a terrible boyfriend. But you should know that going to urgent care is another option over the emergency room and you won’t have to wait 6 hours and it’s much more affordable.

QUESTION: i (22F) caught my ex (22M) sending another man my nudes.

yesterday, i (22F) caught my boyfriend (22M) sexting another man while also sending him my explicit photos/videos. the two of them were “trading” content of their girlfriends while telling each other how bad they wanted to fuck one another as well as each other’s girlfriends….. i’m sharing this story because i’ve simply never heard of such a concept before and am hoping somebody could shed some light as to what the fuck just happened to me.

part of me is heartbroken, of course, but another part of me just feels so violated and disgusted. normally i’m a crier when it comes to breakups but after this one i just feel so fucking angry and betrayed. what if my pictures get leaked somewhere? what if this wasn’t the only guy he’s sent my pictures to? i just don’t know what to do and could really use some insight/perhaps some words of encouragement.

thanks in advance.

ANSWER: Find out if where you live, there are laws against the distribution of intimate photos without consent. If there are, you can report him to the police, and in some cases they can help you trace and delete the photos (but if they will do that, heavily depends on what part of the world you live)

QUESTION: I (F29) kind of want to break up with boyfriend (M29).  I’m emotionally drained. I like peace, he doesn’t.

So, my boyfriend and I have been together for 11 months. He’s not from the US and has only been here for 6 years. Everything was going good.

Then, it started. Two months in and he started talking about us getting married and having kids. He was previously married and when they divorced, he said that he was mad at women for years until he met me. He said I was the second woman he’s ever been sexually involved with. Of course, his wife was the first.

He said he’s never really been anywhere. He stays inside all the time. He said he and his ex wife rarely went anywhere. He always talks about how he has no friends.

He said he’s NEVER celebrated any holidays which is fine. I was the first person he celebrated Valentine’s Day with. However, he didn’t do anything for my birthday, but asked me what I was doing for his birthday which is weird. He mentioned he’s never had anyone do anything for him for it.

He always on social media and follows a lot of women and when I mentioned it, he said it’s because they followed him first.

The worse thing is that he gets mad at me for every little thing.

He said that his ex-wife used to go through his phone and always accuse him of cheating. Every time someone calls me, he thinks it’s another man. When he calls me, he tells me it’s too silent in the background and that I must be telling someone to be quiet.

He hates when I express my feelings. He often tells me to shut up or be quiet. Then when I am quiet he says that I’m acting weird.

I try to take him different places and thought we were having fun, but he recently revealed that he’s never liked anywhere we’ve went. But, he never gives any input on what to do or where to go and he blames it on not being from here.

When we watch movies, he makes me choose. He snaps me up when I ask him to choose the movie and when I choose he complains, but tells me to keep the movie on. It doesn’t make sense.

One time I wasn’t feeling well when he called and he laughed at me after I told him, I asked what was funny and he was like, “You’re always sick. What am I supposed to do? Cry?” And I was like, “I’m gonna lay down” and before I could say anything else he hung up in my face. I’m not always sick, btw. I have migraines sometimes.

He’s very disrespectful and rude, yet accuses me to be that. I try to my best to be kind, considerate and I like to keep the peace. I often let things slide, so I don’t understand what’s rude about that.

He’s cussed me out multiple times for no reason. The first time was because I made a joke about him going to his favorite store. He got mad because he thought I meant that he was going there to see one of the cashiers who happens to be his type.

He usually pays for everything, he gets mad when I offer to pay for things. We went to a restaurant, when it was time to leave I was about to pay and he pulled out the money to pay then when we got back to his place, he shouted at me and said I never want to pay for anything and that blew my mind.

He gets mad when I tell him I already ate before I came over. He gets mad when I tell him “thank you” for things. He snatches trash from me when I try to throw it away. It’s all weird.

I’m not sure why I’m so tolerant with him.

Things will be going smooth for weeks then he’ll start an argument about something so random. He said he and his ex-wife argued all the time. Maybe that’s what he’s used to.

Now, he is very affectionate and compliments me often, he does buy me things that he thinks I’ll like and I appreciate that because in my last relationship the guy wasn’t like that.

When I buy him things, he pays me back even though I tell him he doesn’t have to. He said his ex-wife used to pay for things for him and then throw it in his face so I guess he thinks I’ll do him the same way. I’m not like that. I do things from my heart.

He goes along with most things I say and he never puts in any input, but it can get annoying at times considering that he starts complaining about my choices.

I’ve taught him a lot of things. I’ve taught him about simple things like using dish detergent, using bleach, or show him simple foods like chips, he said he’s only ate plain chips until he met me. I got him to try different restaurants and stores. I wonder where did he ever go with his ex-wife. He didn’t seem to know about much or about many places before we met. I taught him how we do certain things here in the US (reminder: he’s already been here for SIX years.) He’s very intelligent, though. Knows a lot about history. He’s stuck on how they do things back where he’s from.

He said I’m not doing him any favors which I’m not trying to and him saying that is hurtful, because I’ve done nothing but simply try to enjoy life with him and help him when he needs it.

During one of our arguments he told me that he didn’t love me anymore and honestly I haven’t let it go. He said he only said it because he was angry at the moment.

He took a picture of me and I told him to delete it because I didn’t like it and he got super upset and told me to delete every picture I ever had of us.

He ultimately wants to go back to his home country, wants us to get married and have children. He said that he was only staying here for me. He wanted to leave after his divorce, but someone convinced him to stay.

He said the fact that I stay with him despite the arguments is because I love him.

Sometimes I don’t hear from him for days and he’ll reveal to me that he was mad at me, but doesn’t have a reason why when I ask.

I can’t talk to him because he will just say I’m talking too much.

I love him, but I’m emotionally exhausted. I don’t want to end things, but I don’t feel like the relationship is going anywhere. I’m not sure why I’m holding on.

ANSWER: You already know the answer you are just finding it hard to accept. He’s controlling and emotionally abusive. The good moments don’t cancel out the disrespect and constant criticism. You can’t fix someone who refuses to see they’re the problem. If you are this drained , it’s time to walk away for your own peace

QUESTION: Me (37f) seeing my partner (40m) falling out of love with me. Why is the pain almost unbearable?

I’m a 37 year old woman who has been with my partner 40 for 3 years.
We dated as teenagers, lost our virginity to each other at 16/18 and I moved away for uni a year later. We lost touch, and didn’t see each other for 17 years apart from a brief glimpse of each other at a mutuals friends wedding.
6 years ago he messaged me asking me out on a date but I declined, as my father was terminally ill. Fast forward 3 years, and he messaged me asking for a date which I agreed to. 
From day one, we clicked like we did when we were teenagers, spend all our time together, went on several holidays and fell madly in love.
He told me early on that he loves me and that he will never let me slip through his fingers again. He told me that I was on his mind for all those years we were apart etc. he would ring text me every day and make plans. Always wanted to be with me.
Now the change.
For the past few months, we no longer go on dates. He no longer makes foward plans with me, he no longer invites me to weddings with him, we do nothing together as a couple anymore. My anxiety regarding this has been through the roof, and I may have went overboard with ringing and texting etc as our connection and closeness was being lost due to his decline in communication.
I always feel like a last priority and that his fiends/darts/football come first and that I’m “slotted in”. This was not the case the first 2.6 years.
I became upset and quite angry about this as I had mentioned it several times.
I told him (truthfully) that I get chatted up a lot, and that sometimes I feel I would be better talking to a man that is willing to give me the attention and affection I’m craving. 
When I pushed him on the subject, he says that he doesn’t know if he wants to commit, and when I said ok. He said he’s afraid of loosing me as I’m a good woman. 
I have cried so much watching the man who adored me, but me so low on his pecking order that I might as well be an aquintence he met at a bus stop. 
He came over briefly last night and told me that he still loves me etc.
I love this man, and I don’t want to start over again at my age. However, I deserve to be priority in my partners life and to feel reassured and respected.
I’m planning on going no contact for the next couple of weeks to give each other space and for him to figure out what it is he wants.
Any advise is much needed 
Thanks

UPDATE 
Well well.
He rang me this morning and decided to come “clean”. He has told me that he has been “hiding” an addiction and he couldn’t keep up the lie any longer.
He has told me that for the past year, he has been taking cocaine on a weekly basis. 
He told me that he thought he could have the best of both worlds, but that trying to hide it became too much. He has told me that he has been sneaking around taking cocaine behind my back. His brother who he works with has messaged me several times in the past couple of months, looking for him as he didn’t show for work, this was usually on a Friday after playing darts on a Thursday night (which is whey he would take cocaine). It’s all finally clicking into place. 
He was loosing weight, which he was putting down to IBS but it was a drug addiction. 
The constant “colds”, the “watching football on a Saturday” (when it was to shield me from a coke comedown).
He said that for the first year and a half of us, he didn’t take it but he has been hiding it now for the past 18 months and the lie was getting too big to mask. 
He has told me that he’s sorry, that he does love me and to give him a chance to sort himself out. 
He said the days he was pulling away from me, he was coming out of binges.
The not inviting me to weddings/events etc is so that he could “binge” without me knowing. 
I think in the back of my mind, I knew there was something “bigger” going on, because the change in how he was to me was rapid. No rowing prior, full of affection, plans etc.

I am BEYOND angry, and I am in complete shock

ANSWER: I say this out of love and as someone who recently went through similar. Let him go 😮‍💨. Men won't break up with us but will allow us to linger feeling unfulfilled. He doesn't want to lose you but he's not trying to keep you either. Relationships take effort. Work is required and that's on both sides. I carried too many relationships and left feeling the same, drained! Don't be like me. The man who will love you the way you desire to be loved is out there and he will find you. 🫂

QUESTION: My boyfriend (38M) and I (28F) have lived together for two years, but now his “coach” says our relationship is unhealthy. I’m heartbroken and don’t know what to do

Hi everyone! I really need some perspective on what’s happening in my relationship, because I’m emotionally exhausted and not sure what to think anymore. (English is not my first language so I took advantage of AI to help me edit this post .. I hope everything’s clear).

I (28F) had a tough few years. I lost my mom, went through a painful divorce, and even admitted myself to a psych ward in September 2022. When I came out, in October 2022, I met M (then 35M). I was 25. We met casually while going out, and we connected right away. He told me upfront that he didn’t want kids from previous relationships, and I respected that. I wasn’t looking to pressure anyone, I was just trying to rebuild my life. For context, I have 2 kids who are now almost 9M and 6.5F.

I’ve been in therapy since before we met. At first it was weekly, now it’s monthly. I’ve grown a lot and truly feel I’ve matured and healed from so much.

In March 2023, M asked me and my kids to move in with him. I was surprised, because of what he said about not wanting kids, but our relationship felt strong and loving. He supported me emotionally and financially: he never charged me rent, and we agreed that I’d take care of the house and groceries, cook, clean, and keep everything organized. It worked well.

He was also amazing with my kids. I never asked or expected him to take on that role, but he bonded with them naturally. They see him as a second father, and it made me so happy to see that connection,especially because I’ve always made sure never to put that pressure on him.

Things started to change about eight months ago, when he began seeing someone he calls a “mental coach.” I was actually the one who encouraged him to go to therapy, because he has deep unresolved issues with his parents and childhood trauma. But I don’t think this person is a licensed therapist.. it’s more like a self-help coach.. and ever since he started going, he’s been repeating ideas that sound straight out of their sessions.

According to this coach, our living situation is “unhealthy.” She’s told M that having me and my kids in his home is preventing him from feeling free, and that I’m somehow “putting a strain” on him. And without even meeting me, this coach has apparently said I have “unresolved parts” of myself to work on, that I “play the victim,” and other things that really hurt to hear.. especially because my own therapist completely disagrees with those assessments.

I’m usually the first one to doubt myself. I always question if maybe I’m the one who’s wrong. But this time I genuinely feel like I’ve done everything I could..
I’ve been there for M through his emotional struggles, his fits of rage, his ups and downs. I’ve supported him and stayed patient.

And now, it’s like I’m living in limbo. One day he says I should look for my own place, that it’s best if we live separately. I tell him okay, I’ll start searching. Then he takes it back, says he loves me, doesn’t want me to go, wants to make things work. It’s this constant back and forth, and it’s wearing me down.

I love him, and I’m grateful for everything we’ve shared, but I can’t live with this stress anymore.. I’m constantly anxious that he’ll come home and tell me I should move out again. I don’t think I deserve this instability, but at the same time, moving would mean uprooting my kids again, and I just don’t want that chaos for them.

IPart of me wants to leave just to prove a point and take back some peace of mind, but another part of me still hopes he’ll realize how unfair this is and stop letting this coach influence him so much.
M keeps saying it would be a temporary solution, bc he loves me and we would still be together in a separate house. 
But I know that I would feel rejected, and it’s not how I personally view relationships..

Has anyone been through something like this?

EDIT

Thank you for the many answers and opinions! 
I’m gonna paste a comment I made and add a bit more infos

To address some of your questions : I admitted myself in the psych ward bc I was in a full blown burnout.. i was there for 2weeks. They later diagnosed me with autism! Since the diagnosis I’ve been doing really great. My kids love M. I talk to them about their feeling, their wellbeing, etc. I’m really open to their opinion about what they like/dislike, even about my parenting style. He rarely is with my kids when I’m not around, but the kids always ask him if they can stay with him at his shop, or if he can bring them to school. He improved his behaviour immensely, he used to have fits of rage when discussing with me (he was really jealous) but as I said, he worked on it bc he realised it was a very bad behaviour on his part.
He wants things to work out, he wants to be with me and he’s been very open about all his problems / thoughts. I find his brutal honesty refreshing, even if it’s sometimes hard to hear the cold truth. At least I know what kind of person he is, and he’s always matched his words with facts.

ANSWER: You need to protect your kids first. If he is being wishy washy on your living situation, you need to secure separate accommodations for you and your kids. Something he can’t just decide “actually I want you to move out now”. He is almost 40 listening to some (most likely) unlicensed “life coach” who is creating issues in your relationship by planting ideas in his head that you, someone this life coach has never met, are bringing him down in life. I would also do some digging on who this life coach is and what her credentials are. If my partner was destroying our relationship over advice given by some rando with a Google.com degree, I’d contemplate if I want to continue the relationship.

QUESTION: I ‘29M’ Got a message from my ‘26F’ girlfriends coworker

I 29M received a text from my girlfriend’s 26F coworker tonight about some things my girlfriend has been saying which is making quite a few people at work uncomfortable. “She’s made comments about multiple customers being very attractive, one of them making “sex eyes” at her and she said she wasn’t mad about it… and she told me that she had went to that new bar downtown with some girls and danced with a guy all night that she also found very attractive. It didn’t feel right keeping all this to myself and would want to know if I was in your position..”
I’m pretty taken aback as it has to be pretty aggressive to make your coworkers this uncomfortable as the coworker and I don’t talk. 
This is at a coffee shop. This is pretty new behavior and hasn’t happened to this extent before.

We’ve been together for three years now, live together, discussing future. To be honest things have gotten pretty rough recently. The last three months have been hard, I’ve been pretty career focused and perhaps wasn’t giving as much attention to the relationship as I should. She brought this up to me and seemed to have one foot out. Things have gotten better, I’ve stepped up to all of the areas she said she needed, but it’s felt like a losing battle. Things have been better but it still feels pretty empty. I’ve had quite the gut feeling that something else has been going on for the past few months. I’ve never been able to confirm but this just kinda reinforces that feeling. This just kinda feels like a final blow where if this is what other people are seeing, what else is going on. I haven’t discussed this with her, I don’t want to bring in the message and cause drama in their workplace and mostly just want to keep the coworker anonymous. I feel like this relationship is a feeling of comfort for her at this point.

What are your alls thoughts? I do love her but damn am I not into wasting my time with someone with one foot out and behaving like this.

Update #1: to give everyone a bit more insight. This was her female coworker that messaged me, she’s recently engaged, we’ve never communicated outside of casual talk when I’m getting a coffee or at their work Christmas party. I’m friends with her fiancé and we went to the same school so there’s no ill intentions. This particular bar was a country swing bar that had just opened, it opened on a night that I was out of the country for work and it wasn’t a secret that she went. I’d have full expectation that she would go and dance casually, that’s not a boundary. What is a boundary is telling your coworker unprompted that you danced with this guy all night that you found attractive. We’ve been in what I thought was a better spot, working on the things that she needed from the relationship and this just comes like a gut punch. I don’t have the expectation we would go back to normal overnight, but I do have the expectation there would be effort and a bare respect while we are working on it or what’s the point.

It’s a bummer, but this is coming after a long list of things that I was willing to accept in our relationship from hobby differences to moral differences. But now that this has happened it’s kinda blowing all of that out of the water. I’m willing to grow and work on a relationship with someone. I’m not willing to be in a one sided relationship because I have things to work on and this is the result.

Update #2: I broke things off tonight. The more I festered on this the clearer everything became. I don’t believe she physically cheated on me, I truly don’t believe she has that in her capacity (yes I understand how ignorant that can sound). But the more I considered the things I was sacrificing in our relationship, not feeling understood, not having a partner that could be accountable for how her behavior and attitude affect others, ignorant hypocrisy and a lot of other things that I’ve been able to optimistically put aside for the last three years that after trust disappearing are no longer acceptable.

She was pretty much in shock. She wasn’t really able to accept I was serious about ending the relationship. I never once accused her of doing anything but I did tell her someone in her circle told me the above and that confirms a long standing gut feeling I’ve had. She became pretty defensive that she never did anything. I believe that to a point. The conversation started to get pretty emotional and I made an exit. She asked if there was any chance to work on this and if my mind was 100% set. I said right now there is no way we can work on this and I can’t be 100% set because I care about her a lot, but the fact that I have a lack of trust in our relationship and I see a lot of these other things very clear now overcomes the uncertain parts. I had to leave pretty quick after that.

Not easy. Tomorrow won’t be any easier.

ANSWER: You're right to cover for the co-worker. They seem to have tried to do you a favor.

If all you had to go on was the co-worker's comments, I'd suggest you not act hastily. But, as you say, the comments just reinforce what you already suspected. Sounds like your gf is in a situationship with you, and it's time for you to take a hike.

"Losing battle"? Cut your losses.

QUESTION: My (25F) boyfriend (28M) says I “need to be more fluid” for Halloween

Posting for some clarity because I’m struggling with this. My (25F) boyfriend (28M) and I are hosting a Halloween party this year. It’s our first time hosting a themed party like this, but I’ve always loved the idea of having one. I’ve watched countless DIY guides and videos about food, drinks, games, etc. I made a spider web out of paper streamers that covers our entire living room and took nearly 10 hours total to hang from the ceiling with lights to make a dance floor. And so much more. Point is, I’ve spent anywhere from 20-30 hours so far into this thing setting up, crafting, and buying supplies by myself.

Today my boyfriend asked if the guys could play a trading card game at the party. I immediately said I would be deeply offended if I set up a dance floor, beer pong, and decorations just for them to play a card game that we could play any other time. This is not a short card game - it can take a few hours depending on their decks and amount of players. On top of that, the music is going to be blasting so it’s not like they could hear each other anyway and it would take up the beer pong table. I offered that the guys could come earlier to play or wait until most people have left the party.

When I essentially shot it down completely, he said I “need to be more fluid” and I put my foot down and said if they did that I would likely get an Uber to a club and not come back until after. That I would feel very hurt and unappreciated. He backtracked, but things still feel a bit tense. On my end, feeling like that shouldn’t have even been on the table to begin with. But it seems small so I might be overreacting. How would you approach this situation?

TLDR; My (25F) boyfriend (28M) wants to play a trading card game with the guys at the Halloween party. Is it an overreaction to say I would feel hurt and unappreciated?

ANSWER: > I made a spider web out of paper streamers that covers our entire living room and took nearly 10 hours total to hang from the ceiling

A long LONG time ago (1980s) I did this for a Halloween Party. I ended up having to repaint because someone sprayed beer from a keg in the wrong direction and the dye from the streamers left stains all over the ceiling.

My point is just to keep the keg FAR from the streamers.

QUESTION: My (30F) husband (30M) suddenly feels unsuccessful in his career. This has happened after I got a higher paying job and he says it's not related.

Hi all, I hope to get some advice from you guys on how to deal with a very sticky situation. Both me (30F) and my husband (34M) work in the same field but different "branches" of the same trade. He is 4 years my senior and has more work experience than me. He always supported me in my career to do better and helped me with interviews, dealing with stress etc since our field is very male dominated. He has always made more money than me and held a more senior title than me. I have to say maybe I have been lucky but in the summer I got an offer to join a startup with a Senior title and a 70% pay increase and an amazing health insurance. This of course was incredibly good for us since we have financial goals and all of that. He was so proud of me and I really felt it. But now the sticky part is that I make roughly 40K more than him and I have the same title as him although he is 4 years my senior. Since this has happened he entered quite a depressive spiral, feeling like he has nothing to show for himself after 4 years at the same company with minimal professional growth. I tried to help him since he started being so unhappy with the job and redid his cv and cover letter and applied to over 50 jobs for him, but we never heard anything back other than vague rejections or ghosting. I have to say that for me it was easier to stand out because my ex company made me do a ton of public speaking and writing. His company is all internal so of course he's not allowed to publish things through them. And this made him feel even worse and he basically has non-stop being extremely unhappy with himself and his life and I fear I have made it worse with the job application stuff. I truly feel like he is so smart and can do better if he wants to and maybe I was naive and didn't do the right thing. This pains me immensely because I want the best for him but now I feel like I don't know how else to proceed. At the same time he is telling me it has nothing to do with me getting this better job and it feels like I can't even go there to say it because he gets extremely upset. How would you approach this situation and can it really be unrelated to me getting a better job? I don't even know if I should feel angry... I feel like he always had the highest income and I was always so proud of him.

ANSWER: To validate. I had this situation happen to me a couple years ago. My wife has always made more than me but not by much. It was always kind of a funny, friendly competition. I’d get a raise and make $500/y more than her and then a month later she’d beat me by a few. But then a couple years ago, she landed a big corporate job that she never even imagined she could get. 
After the initial shock and happiness, I definitely went through a few months of feeling like “dang, I suck at careering” and “why haven’t I been as successful as I should have been?” Additionally, I’m in the tech field so a lot of my colleagues and friends at other companies but in similar positions were killing it. It definitely makes you question what you’re not doing right.

For me, after my pity party, I decided that I needed to 1. Ask for a raise and 2. Try to figure out how to make myself invaluable at the company and get better at my job. I’m still not making anywhere near as much as my wife but I’ve had to learn that my career looks different than hers which looks different than my friends which looks different than anyone else’s. It doesn’t matter because my kids can eat and play and my wife loves what she does. 
That’s basically the conclusion I came to but it did take time.

QUESTION: (F21) My boyfriend (M22) has a hygiene issue and it’s giving me the ick.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year, we’re long distance so we’ve only met physically twice. During those visits we’ve spent at least 3-4 days together and each of those times I’ve noticed he has an issue with his hygiene. He’s very messy, doesn’t worry about how he dresses or even taking care of his body, the couple times we’ve showered together he said that he can’t ’scrub his body’ because it damages his skin which is really weird to me and he literally wouldn’t pay attention to how he showers that he’d leave the bathroom with soap all over his body.

I understand that we are all different and I was willing to let it go until I smelled him stinking like sweat the past couple times we were together, he doesn’t have a signature scent or anything that makes him smell good. He just gets out of the bed, without brushing his teeth or showering and goes about his day looking unkempt. Each time we have sex I smell him and his private area, it’s so nasty and what makes it more annoying is that the scent will stick with me for daysss, my private area and my pee will smell like it too and for this reason I found an excuse telling him I don’t want to have sex for a couple months. His mum once called him aside once and mentioned his bad smell to him, he didn’t think I heard the conversation but I did. He honestly isn’t the easiest person to speak to, he’s way too emotional for me and I can’t deal with whatever will come after if I try speaking to him about it. I love him so much but he’s GIVING ME THE ICK!!

So my question here specifically is: how do I go about this situation? Because at this point, I’m worried about my own health too. He’s too careless

ANSWER: If you can’t talk with him about these issues then I’d honestly rethink the relationship. The fact that you two are having sex gives more than enough “right” to bring these things up

QUESTION: I (37M) just found out my partner (37F) was hiding 80k of debt

I just found out my partner's student loan debt is essentially double what I expected.

I have been supporting my partner to go school over the last several years. I have cosigned loans and just paid for semesters. They have failed classes and have had to retake things, but that's … not relevant.  I understand we're very fortunate to be in the position we are.

I knew some of the loans had really bad interest rates and I asked her over 9 months ago to look into refinancing…which never happened. In the interim we had a kid, so a lot has been going on.

I got a bug up my butt and finally set aside the time to go through the process and see what rate we could get. I expected there to be $70K ish worth of debt … that actual amount is $150K.

There are so many financial decisions in the last 7 years (since we got engaged) that I would have made differently if I knew there was this much debt. She comes from a poor family with little to no financial literacy. And so I… believe her when she said she just wasn't paying attention and didn't realize it was that much. But fuck …

Now we have a kid and I would have to pay for a Nanny to watch said kid so she could continue school. And perhaps the thing that eats me is I don't see the effort/struggle to ensure she graduates and can get a job after graduation.  Like she's failed classes while also putting in 100's of hours in Diablo IV.

So I just … don't know how to feel. I want to support her dreams, she's a wonderful person. But she does not heed my advice of how damn competitive it is out there and like she could be doing drills or making a side projects outside of class to help differentiate herself. The idea of go to college and get a job is just trashed in tech.  You got a degree? Well they got a degree, had internships, a personal git repo, and open source commits. … it's so competitive.

I've essentially paid for her to live and go to school for years … and I wanted all of that. I accepted that was what we were doing as a unit.

This unexpected debt just has really upset me, cause Idk … Ive given so much and maybe I feel like I'm being taken advantage of? Or my contribution is not being respected? How am I to tell the love of my life … I can't keep supporting you at the level I have been cause … well you accidentally hid all this debt that now I'm on the hook for.

I'm just not sure how to feel

EDIT1: We are married. I did not cosign on this debt I didn't know about. But we're married, ... it's sorta our burden not just hers

EDIT2: People are confused about timeline and situation. We've been together over a decade, engaged 2018, married 22. She did school part time while working full time from 2018 - 2021. Then she went school full time, until prepping for kid and kid this year. I've only cosigned ~50K of debt. The rest is from previous schooling attempts, and I just didn't know about it.

EDIT3: We have talked and are going to go to counseling, and her schooling won't continue (probably).

ANSWER: Why on earth were you paying for their schooling while they were failing classes and both of y'all not keeping up with how much student loan debt they had!? On top of that, you added a kid to this mess.

You both need lessons in financial literacy.

QUESTION: I 20M found pics in gfs phone 19F.  What now?

I 20M and my gf 19F have been dating for 7 months now and the relationship is going great. We rarely fight or argue and when we do we can usually resolve the issues. I recently was looking through her photo gallery on her phone looking for a specific photo and I had the sudden urge to look into her hidden folder. I’m usually not a nosey person and I wanted to respect her privacy but something just compelled me to look. I saw a pictures of her and another guy and it really made me sick to my stomach. While the pictures are from before we meet what upset me was that they’re still on her phone and that she keeps them hidden. What now?

ANSWER: I know when I broke up with my ex and there was a chance we might get together I hid all the photos of us. Giving her a bit of slack, she might have hid them an forgotten about them. Additionally she may have had collected/taken many pictures after that picture she forgot it existed.

QUESTION: I 30F like showering with partners but my boyfriend 35M is hesitant. This isn’t the first time.

I’m 30F have been in a few relationships (3 months - 3 years) with 25M-35M and when I’ve asked if they want to have a shower with me they’ve always been hesitant or don’t want to. Personally I think it’s so romantic showering with a spouse, you’re both chatting away, soaping up, cleaning each other/yourself, sometimes it’s sexual sometimes it’s not.

I’d just like to know what is with the hesitation?!

The men I’ve been with haven’t had body issues and have generally been very comfortable with being naked.

Edit: Showers usually happen after sexy time, a form of aftercare if you will. Some of you are so cute sharing your intimacy stories and I appreciate them so much. Also some of y’all are super judgmental. I’m not forcing anyone to do anything they don’t want to, just curious about why.

ANSWER: I mean, it’s not unreasonable to just want shower time as private time. Just because you’re into showering as a couple, that doesn’t mean they have to be. Maybe they see that as decompression time and not social time.

QUESTION: i’ve faked every organism that partner 18f has given me 18f wlw

i (18f) have faked every orgasm  that my partner (18f) has given me and i feel awful. my partner and i are both lesbians and i was a virgin when i first met her. i had never done anything with a girl and she was way more experienced then me. she likes strapping so we tried it however i have never came from it nor have i when she fingers me. in some positions it feels good but then it stops and that’s about it. i feel like im in too deep now to tell her ive been faking it but at the same time im sexually frustrated. i’ve made her come plenty of times by eating her out and it kinda makes me jealous because i wish i could experience the pleasure that she feels. i don’t know what im even asking from this but i dont know what to do?

ANSWER: “im too deep in now”

“18f”

Nah just tell her and own your mistakes and learn and grow

lying about orgasms will never benefit you, don’t do it again

QUESTION: My 29M girlfriend 26F was planning to go on holiday with a guy she had slept with and I don’t know what to do?

A few months back I posted a situation I was going through on here. My girlfriend had a holiday booked with a friend prior to us getting together, then she mentioned casually that a couple of guys had booked to go along as well. I posted back then feeling very uncomfortable about it. The overwhelming advice was if she goes it’s a dealbreaker and I told her if she doesn’t cancel her trip it’s over between us.

She did cancel the trip and that was the end of it. Her main defence was that the guys were “friends of her friend” and “just tagging along”.

It has since come to light that she had slept with that guy, just before / around when we started dating. Nothing has happened since then (they live in different countries) I can say for certain she hasn’t cheated on me but this now throws it all into doubt; going out partying and drinking on holiday would have been totally different etc.

It’s making me look at the beginning of our relationship and her intentions on holiday in a totally different light and I don’t know how to build back from this or whether it is time to end things. The past couple of months for us have been genuinely stress free and the best we have had and I feel like we had turned over a new leaf and so past mistakes feel a bit irrelevant now

ANSWER: She was planning to cheat on you with that guy.  That’s why she was lying and trying to hide who it was she was going with. You know this.

QUESTION: My girlfriend (F42) thinks I (M33) don’t respect her because I forget how she wants things done (ADHD brain here)

Hey guys,

So I have been dating my girlfriend for a while, and we keep running into the same issue, she feels disrespected because I forget how she likes things done around the house. She’s super particular about stuff. Like, dirty dishes have to go on the right side of the sink, the cutlery needs to be lined up, the dishwasher has to be loaded a certain way. I don’t mind doing things her way, I honestly want to but my ADHD brain just forgets sometimes.

She says I’m hiding behind my ADHD and using it as an excuse. The thing that hurt most was when she said: “If you cheated on me,like my ex did, at least I could blame you. Then you’d clearly be the problem. But this makes me feel like I’m the problem for wanting things done a certain way.”

That one really hit me. For context, I grew up super laid back, no routines, just kind of doing things when they need doing. She’s the total opposite: everything has a specific place, a system, a way to do it. We tried splitting chores so each of us could do things our own way, but she doesn’t want that. She wants everything done her way and done now. And when I forget something, it turns into “you don’t care” or “you don’t respect me.” The thing is, I want to change. I get that structure helps her feel calm and respected. But it’s exhausting when she thinks I don’t care, when really I just have a brain like a sieve and genuinely forget.

I love her and I want to make it work, but I’m honestly getting tired of feeling like I’m failing tests I didn’t know I was taking. My question is: how do you build a healthy middle ground in a relationship where one person needs strict routines and the other struggles with ADHD forgetfulness? What strategies have actually worked for you or your partner to make things easier on both sides?

ANSWER: Honestly, and you might not want to hear this, you may just not be compatible.

My ex has ADHD and a godawful memory for stuff like that, and is also messy/a bit of a hoarder. I am like your girlfriend. I have autism and it makes me feel like my skin is itching if everything isn’t in the right place and properly clean.

When it came time to us being about to move in, we broke up under the realisation that living together was going to make at least one of us utterly miserable. I deserve to have a clean house and they deserved to not feel constant pressure.

We are still best friends nearly 8 years later. We work so much better as friends where neither of our homes are the others’ responsibility.

QUESTION: Silent treatment from my mom (60F) after I (28F) asked her not to post 32 photos of my daughter on FB. Advice?

My daughter turned 1 this weekend so we flew to my in-law's house to celebrate. They just retired and moved into a beachside house, so it was like a cheap vacation. My mom was meant to meet us there and stay over, but she couldn't make it due to her own poor decisions and not having proper IDs to fly

On the actual day of her birthday, my mom posts 32 photos of my daughter to FB. All but 2 were taken by me and texted to her over the past year, so many were meant to be private. Because our social media accounts are not public, I am fine with some photos. I reached out and asked her to reduce it, and delete the photos I felt weren't appropriate.

She got angry, deleted the post, and sent me paragraphs about how her friends post their own grandkids all the time so she wanted to "celebrate in [her] own way." Because she is going through a nasty divorce, she added that "figuring out how to be a grandma to [my child] will have to wait until [she is] healed."

Both in-laws live several states away and this was our first time traveling with our daughter. In one of her angry paragraphs, my mom admitted that she is jealous that we visited my in-laws instead of her (despite the fact that she was meant to be here also). She is pressuring me to visit her next, but her current behavior makes me question that.

I've been getting the silent treatment from her for 6 days. I've sent 3 messages and I've heard that she has spoken to my sister.

Do you have any advice on how to handle this? In one way, I feel awful that my mom missed out on her only grandkid's first birthday and that she is struggling with a divorce. In another way, she is emotionally immature and self-centered.

(I am currently not interested in going no-contact, because our relationship is more complicated than what this post depicts.)

TL;DR - My mom threw a temper tantrum and is giving me a 6-day silent treatment because I asked her not to post 32 photos of my daughter on FB, after she couldn't join us for a family trip.

ANSWER: It's only been six days.  Stop messaging her.  She'll get in touch when she's ready.  Eventually she'll get mad at your sister about something and stop talking to her so she'll switch back to talking to you then.  That's how it works in my wife's family.  Someone is always the good daughter, and the other one is on the shit list.

QUESTION: My mom (43f) promised I'd (25f)go on a family trip (Disney) when I was underage (trip was cancelled for reasons and she said next time I'd go and was promised I'd be payed for) and now refuses to let me go on a single family trip unless I pay. Is that right of her to expect?

So, long story short, when I was like 14-16, my family had saved for a trip to Disney. Come to find out our house was built terribly so my mom (43f now) told me we were cancelling the trip. She then said I'd absolutely be allowed to go whenever they go. Skip to 2019 and my family is planning a Disney trip. I'm 19. I bring up my mom's promise to me and she goes,"you have to pay your way if you want to go" which means I couldn't even stay with them room wise and stuff if I did. At that point it feels like they'd be on a family vacation and I'd just be... Tagging along. I've been told I'm acting greedy for being upset with her but I don't think I am. I was promised something and that promise was broken.

Edit: yes this was years ago and I can pay my way now (not really) it's the principle of the promise and this isn't the first one she's broken. This is just a huge example. She has never supported me since high school. Stop telling me to grow up. I'm just asking if it's okay to be upset in general. Im not upset about the trip, I'm upset about the broken promise.

ANSWER: My mom did something similar - took my youngest sibling to Disneyland with her new BF and his son who was the same age. Swore she’d make it up to us, never did.

But I also knew she wouldn’t, so I didn’t hold my breath and I didn’t wait for it to happen. I also didn’t ask for money or compensation for that broken promise because there was no point.

Does it suck that people like your mom do this? Yeah, a lot. But living by your expectations of how you want others to act or think they should won’t help you at all.

Now you know her word is meaningless, so don’t trust her again.

QUESTION: How do I (40F) rewire my thinking about sex with my husband (39M)?

Sex has become such a chore and I hate “having” to have sex bc I’m not mentally there. I’m tired I’m overworked btwn a full time job and two toddlers. My husband comes home late when all the work is done (that’s his work schedule) and i literally just want to go to bed. We argue all the time about it. It’s gotten to the point where I feel like he’s only nice to me when he wants to have sex so now I low key hate it when he’s nice bc I know what that means. I know this is not fair of me and I don’t know how to rewire my thoughts. For example he texts me I love you at 6pm and in my brain I think damn it I’m tired and I don’t want to have sex. Yikes. Help me.

ANSWER: There’s nothing wrong with your brain. You are noticing a pattern that when he’s nice it leads to sex.

Communicate everything you said here to him and hopefully he can figure out ways to help out more and be nice to you in general, not just when he wants sex.

QUESTION: I feel I should dump my (38f) partner (43m) of 17 years but Im worried about what will happen to him

This is a very long story, I will try to short it the most I can.
I (38f) haave been in a romantic relationship with this person (43M) for 17 years, of those 11 we have been living together at his mom house.
Nobody from my family and friends have ever liked him, but they beared with him for me.
A few months ago, his mom went bananas and kicked me out of the house, called the police on me and kicked me out because "I dont clean enough around the house". Ive been the economic support of this family for all those 11 years he have been living together. Neither my bf or his mom (or his brother untill a few years ago when he finally did find a gf and went away to live with her) work, his mom has a small state pay but its me who buys all groceries for all the family, pays some bills and buys everything its needed, plus my bf being always asking me to buy him videogames (which I also love, but all my money goes for the games he wants).

When his mom kicked me out, I was very very lucky to find that my parents were willing to lent us one of their rent houses (my parents financial support is renting houses) to live. I went to my parent house and he stayed with his mom temporally to plan out the move, take care of his mom a few more months and taking care of our two cats untill its possible to bring them to the new house safely.

Finally, we were able to move with the cats, he has still not bring all of his videogames (big retro game collector, +10000 games) but the cats are safe. We got a huge fight, because the house my parents lent me is smaller than the one we tought it was going to be. Im fine with it, but he is not, he want to force me to demand my parents for a bigger one.
He has been all the time since I told him it was going to be the smaller one pressuring me to demand to change it, some times violent even. 
A friend of him helped is with the move and told me I should dump him, he is not treating me well and has been doing it for years. Im doubtful because even if I know it will be best for me, Im worried about him and his family. If I do it it is going to destroy them and even if they have not treated me well at all, I still care about them.

I have decided to fump him tomorrow, by sms, when he goes back to his mom to keep packing.
I know its a horrible way to do.it, but Im scared that if I do it by call or in person it could be dangerous to me.

I... I really dont know what to do. I need reassurance.
I dont even know if this is the best place to ask. But Im quite lost.

Help?

----‐--------------------------------
UPDATE
 
I did it. Last wednesday, he left to his mom's, I took him to the train and faked it until he was gone, and then I sent him a text and blocked him everywhere. He has no keys of the new house and is 700 km away with no economic means of being back, so Im not worried about my safety.

It hurts, I know he is hurting and confused, does not understand why I have dumped him and thinks we're going to fix it, is trying to contact me through all means, and it hurts me to see him like this. I also feel bad, of course, breakups are not easy. But im strong and my most haunting thought is him being as ok as possible. Im fine.
All of our mutual friends are rooting for me. Even his brother has told me Ive done what I should have done long time ago, and is rooting for me too.

I will be fine. I just hope he can heal someday too.

ANSWER: Call a locksmith in advance to get an appointment to have the locks changed so they can do it immediately after you break up with him. And have friends or family present when he comes over to retrieve the rest of his belongings.

ANSWER: A valid reason to walk away from anyone, regardless of gender, is "I did not enjoy the time I spent with you. And your behavior was not pleasant and made me feel unsafe."

QUESTION: Me (38F) have been with my partner (40M) for over 10 years. How do I break it off?

Me (38F) have been with my partner (40M) for over 10 years. We were engaged about 2.5 years ago and I am gave him back the ring when he revealed he felt like I forced him to get engaged. I have no interest in marrying him anymore and I never get any free space. He's always home. He doesn't pay for anything for me and is stingy with money. I have a 16year old child from a previous relationship and he doesn't help with anything there too. He also doesn't do anything around the house. I do all dishes, pay for groceries, take out trash, clean up after pets. He works then comes home and watches TV or games until bed. I used to be so obsessed with this guy but now I'm desperate to be single. I've tried to break it off several times but he is not listening and thinks we just need to work it out. I want him gone. I want to be single again. I actually want him to cheat so he can leave me asap. Help me. This has not been easy or simple to do. Has anyone been through this? How did it turn out? I need help because even though I've told him to leave, he is still here. How do I get him to leave? He lives in my home and he was paying a monthly rent. He's paid up through next year. He wants to make another lump sum payment for rent but I've decided to not accept it and will be telling him in a few weeks that I want him gone next year officially again to see if he listens this time.

Tldr: lost all feelings in long term relationship and want to be single again. How do I have my partner leave me alone?

ANSWER: He doesn't get to say no when you break up with him. It's not a negotiation, it's you informing you that your relationship is over. He gets to say he disagrees but that doesnt mean the relationship is continuing.

So, tell him again. The relationship is over and start untangling your lives, whatever that looks like. Show him that it is over now.

QUESTION: My [48M] wife [47F] making me uncomfortable with work friend [50M]

Ok I’m kind of spiraling here and having a hard time getting my thoughts down so please bear with me…
Me [48M] and wife [47F] married for 17 years with 2 teenage daughters. She was a stay at home mom for 13 years, went back to work part time in an office 2 years ago.

She made lots of friends, but I could tell this one coworker [54M and widowed about 2 years ago] liked her as more than just friends.

A couple times before group meetups he would text her personally asking if she was gonna go or not and text things like take her time cuz he wasn’t there yet or asking when she was gonna be there  so he would have someone cool to hang out with.

After some group meetups he would text her saying things like how cool it was to hang out or he loves hanging out with her and wishes they could hang out more.

A couple months ago after his birthday party he texted her something like he knows it is super inappropriate but he had to admit he has a huge crush on her and she should probably delete the message and he didn’t want to break up anyone’s marriage.  My wife responds she is flattered and loves hanging out with him and always feels guilty hanging out with the group but she selfishly loves it so much and please let’s hang out more.

I told her before this that he was crushing on her and falling in love with her and she was always dismissive like they are just friends. They never hang out alone, it’s always with other coworkers.

Well last week the group went out and after he texted my wife something like his girlfriend told him out of the blue that if my wife wasn’t married then he and my wife would be together and he responded to his girlfriend yeah probably. So my wife responded to him either “yeah we could probably have fun” or “yeah we would probably have fun”

I only know about all these texts because when she got home she was acting weird and I went and checked her phone when she went to sleep. Needless to say I was gutted. So then the next day I went to see if there was any new texts and I see that she deleted the text where he says what his girlfriend told him and she deleted her response. She didn’t delete any of the other stuff so I don’t think she suspects I went thorough her phone.

She has never given me a reason to not trust her but now I can’t help but wonder what other texts she may have deleted.

I cannot confront her without revealing that I went thorough her phone.

How do I proceed? What’s my first step?

ANSWER: I mean she gave you a reason to check her phone and you did found an inappropriate conversation between them. I think it is better to confront her now that nothing has happened yet and establish and enforce boundaries. Don't wait until this will progress to something far more worse. Or you can stay silent and keep wondering what is happening between them.

UpdateMe.

QUESTION: I (30f) found out my boyfriends (32m) life is a lie.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years. We don’t live together.

Recently,  I couldn’t shake the feeling that parts of his stories never lined up. There were inconsistencies about his life before me, about relationships, about why he moved, about who did what to who, timelines that changed depending on the day, details that seemed dramatic but vague.

I bumped into a friend who had a mutual connection to his ex. He has spoken so badly about her. She is the “crazy ex”.

She told me that almost everything he told me about his life in his home state and their relationship was fabricated. Major events, timelines, reasons for their breakup, things he used to portray himself as the victim, lies.
Now I feel genuinely shaken.

The way he portrayed himself in their breakup was untrue. Significant parts of his life in his home state, events he referenced, timelines he used to build sympathy and credibility, things he said defined him as a person, none of it was real. This wasn’t a difference in perspective or two sides of a story. This was a completely different reality.

He even lied about friendships, his family (I haven’t met them in person yet) and his upbringing. He lied about small irrelevant things too that just don’t make sense.

I believe her because she also has proof of some of the lies.

He has always been the victim in every story he’s told me. Never had a long term relationship other than me and this ex. Only short term ones.

I don’t plan on confronting him about this. I feel quite frightened. I’m not sure who he is. 
I’m worried how to navigate this.

What do you do when you realise you weren’t in a relationship with a person, but with a made up person? How do you heal the part of you that ignored red flags because you wanted to believe the story more than the inconsistencies?

ANSWER: The person you think you love doesn’t exist. He sounds dangerous. If I was in your position I would leave it’s obvious from the lies he doesn’t have a clear sense of self which is why he has to lie to make himself look and feel better. What happens when you don’t make him feel high or excited anymore?? He will devalue you and throw you away. Save yourself.

QUESTION: My (29F) boyfriend (31M) never tells me what he actually wants, and I don't know what to do?

I genuinely need advice on this. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years and hes amazing in so many ways but theres this one thing thats been bothering me more and more lately.

He NEVER tells me what he actually wants. Like ever. If I ask where he wants to eat, its always "whatever you want babe." If I ask what movie he wants to watch, same thing.

At first I thought it was sweet that he was so easygoing but now its honestly frustrating. I feel like Im making every single decision for both of us and I dont even know what HE enjoys anymore. Last week I specifically asked him to pick the restaurant and he literally said "you're better at picking places" and then when we got there he seemed kind of meh about the food but said it was fine when I asked.

I tried talking to him about it last night and he got kind of defensive saying hes just trying to make me happy and that he genuinely doesnt care about most things. But like... everyone cares about something right? I dont want to be in a relationship where Im constantly guessing what my partner likes or just making all the choices.

We're planning a vacation right now and I asked him where he'd like to go since we finally have some money saved up from Stаke for it, and he just said "anywhere you want to go sounds great to me." Even with something this big he wont give me an actual answer.

I love him but I feel like Im dating someone without preferences and its making me feel disconnected from him. Am I being unreasonable here? How do I get him to actually communicate what he wants without making him feel attacked?

ANSWER: I want to say you're not being unreasonable. Being so chill and not having preferences puts the all the responsibility on someone else, and it isn't right. It adds unnecessary stress on your relationship. I think you guys need to find a compromise. Would he be open to couples therapy?

Not to excuse his behavior, but I was your BF when I was married. The reason I couldn't make decisions was because I was raised in a family where I never had the option to choose. Even if it was my choice, I'd defer to my mother, sister, or father as I didn't want to cause conflict. When I did choose, I always chose wrong. I actually had to work on this in therapy because my ex-husband found it exhausting. Now, I take turns making choices. It's safer for me to propose 3 options, and I find that my ex-BF appreciated this approach as do my friends.

QUESTION: The guy (30M) I (22F) have been dating has been lying about his age

I met this guy on a dating app and his profile listed his age as 26. We’ve been dating for around four months now, and things have been going well.

Recently it was his birthday. I found out he wasn’t turning 27 like I thought, he was actually turning 30. I really like him and we have a strong connection, but I also feel very uneasy that he’s been lying the whole time. I’m struggling to figure out how big of a red flag this is. On one hand, I understand why he might have done it, but on the other hand, it makes me question what else he might not be honest about.

Either way it sounds like he wasn’t actually looking for anything long term…. The age difference doesn’t bother me, my circle is made up of people 25-35 anyway and I am the outlier being 22. It’s just the lie.

How do I go about talking to him about this and setting boundaries about lying? I also don’t know if I should stay with him or if this is a big deal…..

ANSWER: There is literally no reason for him to lie about his age as an adult seeking out other adults. I would then consider if he's trying to make himself more palatable to younger women which definitely would raise a few red flags to me.

QUESTION: My (25F) "Grandma In-law" (64F) WONT LEAVE US ALONE! Advice?

So to start, I have never had much of a problem with my husbands grandma while we were dating and the first 2 years of our marriage. This was until, we ended up buying a house from my Husbands Uncle and moved in right away as we were expecting our 2nd child and the house we were renting wasn't going to be big enough for our family. This house is shares a long driveway with my husbands Grandma. I have a big feeling this is why my husbands aunt and uncle wanted to move out as fast as they did. Ever since we moved in we have had problems with the Grandma. We have told her NUMEROUS TIMES to please call before showing up to our house (We love our privacy & our kids sometimes are napping when she decides to show up!) I almost always keep the door locked since we live in the country and I'm a sahm who's alone a lot. She will either let herself in if I end up forgetting to lock it after going outside for something or she will pound on the door if its locked and I don't answer it. Then, if I open the door I'm met with "You're trying to lock me out?" And other comments. She has even resorted to peaking in our windows and walking around our house trying to peek inside. She will also show up sometimes at 8PM when I'm getting our kids to bed.  Whenever she visits she ALWAYS points out "flaws" with my house, cleaning, DIY projects and etc. Got mad at me because I painted chairs that I bought a color she didn't like and I also stained our kitchen table (which all turned out amazing btw) and she threw a fit. I have a 25 month old who's into EVERYTHING and a 5 month old, my house isn't always perfect and she thinks it HAS to be. Her house is a mess but whenever she comes over she always picks apart mine. One day she showed up randomly and I simply said "Please excuse the house, it's a little messy" and she said "a little bit???" Very rudely and laughed to herself". She also makes nasty comments like saying "What, are you starving? Mommy didnt feed you did she?" Whenever my daughter points to the cookie jar. She's super rude, bossy, controlling and even two-faced. She constantly gossips about people behind their back to others and I feel like i have to walk on glass around her. she throws these pity parties very often if she doesn't get her way.  She was having my daughter take bites from a sandwich the grandma already bit all over and I said "no we aren't going to do that" and put my daughter on the floor and then his grandma was like "Ah come on she was enjoying the sandwich". Also to top it off, we aren't able to have parties at the uncles giant barn/house anymore so now she wants all the parties to be here at my house AND TELLS PEOPLE that it's going to be here and I have to occasionally be the one to tell people there's no party here and if we do have a party here, no one helps at all.

My husband and I have TRIED to talk to her so many times. We have tried telling her to call before she arrives, keep her opinions to herself if they're going to be rude, ask us for permission instead of inviting random people over to our house for a party, and the list goes on but it's like she doesn't care. I don't know how else to tell her? I've told her kindly and I've also gotten snappy about it. What would be the best way to deal/talk to someone like this? I don't know what to do or say? Cutting her off is not an option (although sometimes I wish it was.) I don't mean to sound like a negative nancy but I'm at my WITS END and have no idea what else to do????

ANSWER: Here are two phrases for you:

“You’re being rude and I need you to leave”

“Now isn’t a good time, please call next time.”

QUESTION: how do i 22f explain to the people in my life that breaking up with my boyfriend 23m for making jokes about my body is absolutely fair?

i 22f had been dating my boyfriend 23m since uni. we had been exclusively seeing each other for two years but been romantically involved all five years i’ve known him. he is a masters student and i work rn, we went on a trip with his friends last week. so i used to be midsize when we started talking but i have health issues and have gained weight and am very anxious about this. he knows this, and in private he is very sensitive. while at a party, the day of our two year anniversary, his friends made some joke about one of the other girls eating a lot of food and my boyfriend dragged me into it for no reason and said something really out of line that got some awkward laughs and i just felt so humiliated. it felt like i just can’t go back from that idk i felt so awful about my body since this happened and it isn’t even in my control. anyway now he’s kind of acting like a man child and being butthurt about it but everyone in my life including my mother and my closest friends are telling me i’ve made a mistake, that he loves and cares for me and i’ll never find a guy like him but i don’t know..

EDIT: i’m sorry for not responding, i realise from the overwhelming response saying i don’t owe anyone anything that this is most definitely a cultural thing.. i came here to vent because honestly at the end of the day what’s going to happen with my life is what my family wants and i don’t have much of a say in it and people on the internet won’t really understand but thank you all for proving to me that i’m not crazy i just live in a crazy world

ANSWER: You don't owe the people on your life an explanation. You felt disrespected and left. The choice was ultimately yours. I'd advise you tell them to shut up and stop asking about him, but in a nicer way lol.

QUESTION: Why won’t my (29F) boyfriend (32M) let me join his D&D campaign?

Me ‘29F’ and my boyfriend ‘32M’ have been together for 4 years. Although it doesn’t really seem to come up a lot I think he has a slight superiority complex to me when it comes to intelligence and culture/arts/history because I did not go to college but I take the time in my own hands to read and learn about these things that interest me on my own time and am no where near stupid or uncultured, but I digress. Anywho, he just started a new d&d campaign with his 5 friends (30s M) and my dad was an avid player back in the day and gifted me some dice and books and such so I got excited and asked if I could join them this time. I’m not a huge gamer by any means but I do enjoy some RPGs and tabletop games and I thought it’d be fun to do together. Now I would kind of understand if ya know, this was his thing and he wanted to keep it as an independent activity  because we both have that as a need in our relationship but no, no no. His reasoning was “Baby I just don’t know if you would really grasp it and I wouldn’t want you to feel like you couldn’t keep up. But you’re welcome to watch!” …. Zero shade to any d&d players but wasn’t this game literally invented for children. I’m trying to decide if I should talk more in depth about what his reasoning is because right now I just feel like he thinks I’m stupid and would rather know if there’s some other reason?

TL;DR I’m trying to have a better understanding of why he doesn’t want me to join his d&d campaign

ANSWER: I mean, he told you the reason. He doesn't think you'd grasp it. He could have easily said there's too many people in the group already, or this was more of a guys night thing, but he chose not to say that.

QUESTION: My Partner (39M) calls me (40F) 'Selfish' for Refusing to Visit his Traumatic Family this holiday .

I \[40 F\] am deeply struggling with my partner (39M). We have been together for almost three years, living far away from his and my family. Since I met his, two years ago, there's been tension between us. Now, he is deeply upset and sad because I refuse to a ten-day stay with his family for the holidays. He claims my refusal is selfish, exaggerating, and unsupportive, arguing that I should tolerate his family and make things lighter for him when they are difficult, rather than adding to his stress by being nervous myself.

They make me really anxious. I have tons of examples, but to give a couple of them, one of my first meetings with his mother, she shared a family history of incest with me. His sister, on our first or second encounter, asked me about my history with violent relationships and then told me about her own abusive ex-partner. She and his father both tend to get really nervous about non important problems (she started a fight with her boyfriend in front of me the first time I saw her because her family in law sent her a Christmass greeting when she is not a christian. Her mother then told me that if her daughter wasn’t a yoga teacher, she would had become a murderer. I also hated that). I find them overwhelming, conflict-ridden, and prone to extreme emotional reactions. When I try to set boundaries or name the dysfunction, my partner calls me 'immature'. He also says that he accepts my family, so I should accept his. My Question is am I selfish for refusing this trip and, in general, for demanding limited contact?  Am I 'exaggerating' or gaslit? Thank you for your advice.

ANSWER: I think this relationship doesn't really have a future. Your partner doesn't want you to set boundaries and he doesn't want to do it himself either. You feel uncomfortable and unsafe with his family.

There's no way around that.

QUESTION: My fiance (26M) and I (24F) just got engaged. He wants to break up because he feels guilty. How do I deal with it?

My fiance and I have been dating for 6 years. He just proposed to me four days ago. We’ve had a good share of issues in the past mainly surrounding his family. His mom specifically has always been very passive aggressive about me but always nice/ok in person. She’s openly disrespected me and our relationship going as far as lecturing her own son about how we are not a good pair. Well anyway, that took a big toll on the relationship and frankly me as well. She’s done as far as breaking us up multiple times earlier in the relationship. Lately, he’s been very good about standing up to her and telling her to stop and everything else of such sorts. Before he proposed to me, he had a conversation with my family and told them the plan for the proposal and how he told his family. Lo and behold, we get engaged and we heard nothing from his family. He is extremely close with his mom and his three sisters so that was a bit shocking. He told me his family knew everything about the proposal, but turns out he lied and didn’t say a word to any of his family. Two days after the proposal, he told his mom and some of his sisters that he was engaged and clearly they were upset. He didn’t want to share any of our engagement pictures with anyone and didn’t want to announce the engagement on social media or to his immediate and extended family. Well that made me very upset and we’ve had a huge fight over it. I don’t understand how he doesn’t care to announce it when he can see how badly it hurts me that he doesn’t want to show off our engagement especially since he is so close with them. 
Well long story short, we just got done with a phone call. He tells me he feels very guilty over not telling his family about the proposal before he did it and feels guilty for lying to me and my family. He says he wants to break up because him lying will have a long impact on our relationship but that he loves and cares about me nonetheless. Hes lied about a lot of little stuff before but I’ve always forgiven him. He already took down all of our pictures from social media and ended the phone call with a “you deserve better than what I’ve done and given you” I know for a fact he’s not cheating so I’m having a really hard time processing this. How can he end our relationship over this? I know we haven’t been perfect and there was a lot of hurt and drama between us before, but I’ve forgiven him and we both tried to move on from it all, and then he lied to me again. I don’t know how to deal with the break up and how we can be so okay breaking up with me over the fact that he didn’t share the news with his family before he actually proposed.

ANSWER: His family doesn’t approve of your relationship.

And he either isn’t strong enough, or doesn’t love you enough, to choose you.

This is not your guy.

QUESTION: My girlfriend (27f) is expecting me (29m) to change therapists and said in unreasonable for refusing?

I started private therapy a few months ago. I pay £60 a session. I have always found it easier to open up to women so I chose a female therapist.

Outside of sessions she always makes it clear if I am struggling, to reach out and message or email her.

I mentioned this to my gf and she said she thinks that's weird and crossing a line.

She asked if I talk about our relationship to the therapist and I said yes but that I won't be going into any more details about what I discuss in my sessions.

My girlfriend said it was weird I was talking about our relationship with another woman and that I shouldn't be considering messaging her outside of sessions.

I told my gf she was the one making it weird but she just said she things I should change therapist. I refused and told her she doesn't get to dictate what therapists I'm allowed to talk to.

She said I wasn't being reasonable but I just said she was out of order for thinking she gets to choose my therapists. I said I wouldn't be talking about it further and she should drop it.

She just said again I wasn't being reasonable and that I should consider changing.

How would you handle this?

Tl;dr my girlfriend is expecting me to change therapists as I’ve chosen a female therapist. When I refused she said I wasn’t being reasonable.

ANSWER: Your girlfriend is being unreasonable, not you. It is very normal for a therapist to be open to hearing from their patients if they're in distress. She wasn't asking you to text her casually or meet for coffee!

QUESTION: I 32F found my fiancé's 36M secret Instagram account

Me 32F and my fiance 36M have been together nearly 7 years and are planning our wedding for summer next year. We've also been family planning, after having some miscarriages, we've had appointments for health checks etc. My fiance lost his job in April but has successfully found another he is enjoying.

Last year we were in couples counselling because I had seen on his phone he was on only fans. He deleted the account before I could even see what he was doing on it.. he said he was only on it out of curiosity. Anyway, we work through it. And go ahead with planning this wedding.

A couple of weeks ago I see on his laptop, not through snooping, it was just on his open laptop in our office as I passed it. I see hes got a secret Instagram account, following loads of explicit models and he has been messaging these models flirty stuff like "lovely thighs"... The account is a random username and no profile picture. It is also set up using a different email address so it doesn't link to anything on his phone.

Again, after going through couples counselling last year, he's betrayed my trust. We were both happily planning a wedding and very excited for our next chapter, I feel completely blindsided by it. He promised me he'd never put me through this again after the only fans saga, and here we are. I know he loves me, I don't doubt that. But he's not respected my boundaries. He wants to work on this in counselling again but I don't think I keep going through this. He says that losing his job was a stress trigger that causes this behaviour. He says that I'm throwing our life together away too readily but I feel like I don't have a choice after all this happening again.

Does anyone have any experience with this? Is this something a relationship can work through? I do love him very much and I don't doubt he loves me, we do have a lovely relationship, I just don't understand this behaviour.

TLDR; we are planning to get married next year but my fiance has broken my trust again by making a secret Instagram account and messaging naked models. There's a lot of love there but I'm struggling to see a way forward. Is this workable?

Update: Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to read and respond to my previous post. Your advice, care, and support have helped me massively during this difficult time. It truly feels like a huge virtual hug, and I am incredibly grateful for the kindness you’ve shown me.

Regarding next steps, I have the full support of my friends and family now. We have cancelled the wedding, and I am working through what comes next. I know that I cannot continue in this relationship, and I am slowly gaining the confidence needed to move forward. Although I am absolutely terrified of what the future holds, I know in my heart that this relationship is not healthy and the trust has been irrevocably shattered.

ANSWER: The problem is, he will either stop, or be smarter next time so he doesn't get caught. You won't know which one is true ...

QUESTION: My (28M) fiance (28F) can't hold a job and can't pass classes

Hi, my (28M) fiance (28F) is not able to hold a job and can't pass basic community college classes to get a degree/certificate to work somewhere she enjoys. She and I met in college in 2017, where she wanted to get in the healthcare industry (nursing originally). She did decent enough on the general studies requirements, but when it came to math and the biology classes, she could not pass no matter what she tried. She took and failed a math and biology class 3 times, even after getting a tutor the second and third time for both courses (the community college provides tutoring). She tried to do other majors, including general studies, and health administration, but could also not pass the low level classes required to get through the degree (except the general studies degree, but she didn't think that would help in her job search). She's also blamed that she doesn't have a quiet place to study with her parents, so she moved with me before taking the course the second and third time and I made her a quiet zone she can study.

When she first started community college, she was able to get herself a job at Starbucks. She absolutely hated this job and she cited many times that she was failing because she didn't have the proper time to study, due to a 20 hour schedule. So on her third course attempts (math + bio), I told her to quit and focus solely on the school work. She however still failed these courses. The college also says you can't take a course more than 3 times, so thos degrees were out of the wiestion. Afterwards, she ended up getting some odd jobs working at as an orthopedics assistant (lasted 1 month, was fired due to not passing some test she needed to pass), a receptionist at an oncologist's office (she was fired after a week because she sounded too nervous when talking to the customers), and then eventually got another job at a different Starbucks. This is over the last 3 years.

By this point, she had pretty much dropped out of community college, so I suggested she look into IT certs. I bought her a training courses to get an Comptia ITF+, and she said she would study. Well, months later I ask how it's going (she worked at nights, I work mornings), and she says work has been too stressful because she can't work 40 hours a week and do the studying. We talked it out and we had her work 4 days a week for 6 hours each day. Even now, she's saying the work is too stressful and she won't really study for her cert, even though we are now both home at the same time.

For some other context, I work 40 hours a week and make a decent amount, but she keeps talking about buying a home, starting a family, but I don't think we can afford that with our pay. Also, she gets really stressed out easily whenever we talk about finances, or I ask how her studying is going.

I know it sounds like I'm shitting on my fiance, but I do love her and I want her to be in a better state mentally and financially, but I don't know what to do at this point. The only job she's been able to hold is the Starbucks job, but she hates it and talks about wanting to quit all the time. I am worried about our financial future, and whenever I bring this stuff up, she gets really upset. She's also seen a therapist on and off over the last few years to talk about her feelings of being a failure and it had semi helped, but she's still kind of doing the same thing.

I should also mention this whole thing has been making my depressions worse (been depressed for years, even talked to a therapist myself about it). While I do love her, this is not how I expected our life together to go. I was hoping we would both make decent money, so we wouldn't struggle with basic living needs. Don't get me wrong, I can afford it on my own, but I want to be in a more comfortable spot.

I don't know if she can get the certs required for an IT (she's a terrible test taker no matter how much she studies). She doesn't want to work in food service anymore and I don't know what else she can do. What can I do to help her? What can I do in general? I feel so drained with this situation.

ANSWER: Why are you pushing her towards IT? Its a profession that requires constant learning and she is clearly incapable. I wouldn't wish her as a coworker on my worst enemy.

QUESTION: My bf(18M) is letting everything go after I(18F) said "Thank you" to someone who wanted to get with me.

This is probably weird or pointless since this is I guess a high school relationship but I do ask for opinions on this situation if this is alright.

My boyfriend is trying to break up with me and is being incredibly petty over something that happened a few days ago.

What happened was, I was at school during lunch and some guy told me that their friend said I was pretty, I said “Thank you, but I have a boyfriend.” I told my boyfriend what happened and now he is incredibly pissed off at me because I said “Thank you” he wanted me to basically start shit and say “Nono I have a boyfriend” aggressively.

He said to me that it was pathetic of that I didn't wanna start shit.

Reason why I said thank you is because I was scared and didn’t want to start anything or be negative. It was a way to protect myself.

But my boyfriend is NOT having it, it’s to the fact that he threw all of the things I gave him in his closet, and every-time I try to criticize it, he doesn’t want to hear about it. He changed everything that has to do with me, he said I wasn’t worth all of his sacrifices he made. He has a big fear of cheating because we’re all at the age where it is common to happen, not only that, he has a cheating record himself.

We always had a rocky relationship as we both suffer from BPD. Everything mostly went into shambles after the honeymoon phase was over, which obviously that's a common thing that's meant to happen.There are often times we argue all the time and always assumptions about cheating. I always pull back but he always tries to run away.

I would never cheat on him and have no intentions to. But he might.

All of this was over that single situation i tried to get away from and he is not letting it go.

I feel as if I messed up and I do not want to lose him. He is my first real life relationship as I used to date people online before at a young age. We go out together all the time and he is a smart loving guy. I don't want lose him but I know its too late.

Should this be a time where I should just let go? It's hard since I do suffer from BPD as well. Maybe I shouldn't have said "Thank you."

Edit: What I mean by smart is that, he is academically very smart but he doesn't have much common sense. He has a 4.0 and everything he drives, etc. Thats why I find him attractive as we and not wanna lose him. We both have similar interests and everything and we did so much together, it's hard to even want to lose all of this. We went out a lot and everything.

We met since middle school and finally got together around the ending of junior year. Thats why I'm so attached. We understood each other and have so much interests together. We made stories with our characters and did so much. I just.. Dont wanna lose all of this as again,

This is my first IRL relationship coming from a online nerd who used to date a lot of people online

I'm waiting for him to move on but nothings happening and it's been almost 5 days

He helped build my life so much that it's so hard to let go, he gave me the best advice and to do what makes me happy as I am in under a lot of pressure under my parents expectations. We planned college together and having kids. I just didn't want that dream to go

Update 8:18pm: a lot of things happened. He unblocked me and tried to apologize. We tried to have a civil conversation but then when I started to criticize him properly, he snapped and started to blow up my phone calling me whre, and everything. I tried to stand my ground and be the bigger person. 
He hurt himself really bad and he tore up all the stuff I gave and made for him. Hes apologizing as he snapped out of it. I'm scared I don't feel good..

Update 7:31am: I got over him, we're still together but if he keeps going to do this, then we're done. Thank you guys so much for your support. You guys really made me see things and I got into a better mindset. Thank you so much, I'll be the bigger person now.

ANSWER: \>he is a smart loving guy.   
No, he's not. he's an irrational, immature, tantrum-throwing child, and he's projecting his own cheating behaviour onto you. You did NOT mess up. Saying "thank you" is meaningless punctuation in English conversations. Tell him to snap out of it and calm down, or he'll lose you.

QUESTION: My SIL (40F) wants her parents to spend Christmas at my house (32F)

OK so for context, my husband and I have been together for a long time but we've only been married for about three years.

We've always done Christmas Day separately because my parents are quite introverted and keep to themselves and his family have their own routine and their immediate family is quite small too.

Usually we need to travel to both of our parents from where we usually live, about a 3 hour drive. My SIL finds this trip quite tiring and would rather have my in-laws stay at our house to make travelling easier. We live close enough so my SIL.

She thought it was ok to suggest this because I usually spend it at my parents house but the thought makes me uncomfortable because my MIL doesn't like me and has become increasingly hostile since we married. She also has some problems with alcohol and this has caused a lot of tension at recent family get together. When we bought our house she was also getting too involved in what we were doing to the house and we had to set some boundaries.

Because they can be like this, I think this is why SIL is suggesting that they should stay at our house rather than her own house. When we were hesitant and suggested maybe rotating hosting duties, they seemed confused and said they couldn't understand why we wouldn't want to host them ourselves.

What would be a good compromise? I generally get on well with my SIL and I haven't explicitly mentioned not getting on with MIL to her because I want to try keep relations as positive as possible.

ANSWER: That won't work for us, but we'd be happy to see them when they stay with you.

If she continues to push, be honest about your mean MIL - is she your SIL's mom? If she is, it makes way more sense for her to stay with her daughter.

QUESTION: I [35M] found out my girlfriend [31F] lied about a night out with an older married man, not sure if I can ever trust her again or if I should walk away

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for almost 2 years. Earlier this year, she lied about a night she spent out with a 52-year-old married man who used to be a customer at the girls’ bar where she worked in Japan.

She originally told me it was just dinner with a friend, but she didn’t come home until around 4 AM and was pretty drunk. Over time I found out more and more things that didn’t line up with her story, like how she said other friends were supposed to join (which turned out not to be true), or how she said they only went to one bar when it was actually three.

When I confronted her and asked for proof, she eventually admitted to lying about parts of it after I asked her to show me receipts and messages. She still insists nothing sexual or romantic happened, and she has receipts from every place except one bar, which only he has.

I actually messaged the guy months later to ask directly. He said nothing happened, but he’s been evasive and refused to share that one missing receipt that could clear up the timeline. He stopped replying altogether.

This isn’t the only time she’s lied or deleted messages. Early in our relationship, she deleted her whole message history with another male friend she went drinking with and later went to his apartment to “wait for the first train.” She swore nothing happened there either, but she hid it from me and only admitted it when I confronted her with proof.

She says she lied because she “didn’t want me to assume the worst” or get upset over things that looked bad but were innocent. She admits she has an issue with lying to avoid conflict and says she’s going to start therapy for it. Recently she’s been a lot more transparent, gives me full access to her phone if I ask, and has been consistent for a while.

Even with that, I can’t stop replaying things in my head and wondering what really happened that night. I told her that if I can’t get some kind of closure or solid truth, I might not be able to stay, not to punish her, but because I don’t think I can rebuild trust on half-truths.

TL;DR:  
My girlfriend (31F) lied about spending a night out with an older married man and has lied about a few other sketchy situations in the past. She says nothing romantic happened and is trying to be honest now and work on herself. I (35M) want to believe her but can’t stop doubting everything.

How do I figure out if it’s actually possible to rebuild trust after this kind of repeated lying? And if I can’t ever know the full truth, how do I decide whether it’s healthier to stay and try, or to walk away?

Edit: I did not expect this post to blow up as much as it has, but I truly appreciate all the responses. I want people to know regarding an update, that there is not much to do but break up. I obviously won't learn any new information about past events, but it's not necessary at this point regardless. I know my previous questions talked about if it's possible to rebuild trust or not. Truthfully my mind was already made up for quite a bit of time though. I just really wanted to share my story here to see other people's opinions, because so far aside from a couple of close friends I never talked to anyone about all of this. But the overwhelming majority of responses were exactly the same kind of conclusions I felt myself. I just wanted to hear other people to confirm what I already was suspecting was true.

ANSWER: You won't ever find out.

You have enough to make a decision.

Shes lied, the guy likely lied to protect her. She didn't come home till 4 am drunk. Shes lied before,  almost same scenario.

Shes been cheating and you know it. That's enough for you to end the relationship.  If you stay, then accept cheating will always be a problem.

QUESTION: I (26f) discovered bf (26m) using grok for unsettling fantasies and I am not sure if I should bring it up

As title stated I hope this is a valid question to ask. Basically my bf now fiancé has been acting kind of suspicious lately (not wanting to talk much, being on his phone a lot, not wanting intimacy) and I was able to get access to his computer. There was no search history available as it was all deleted but luckily I was able to see he had recently purchased grok premium and had his twitter logged in on his computer (I asked him what he used it for - he said work but that it wasn’t that good). Of course there was no history for grok either but luckily grok remembers everything so when I asked it to recite past conversations it turns out over 55% of their conversations were all sexual. Apparently he uses this often so that is not a small amount either.

Of these conversations I found out many of them were about kidnapping, incest, and mainly nonconsenting fantasies. Of these, over 10 were saved to his private notes for later and one of them was a detailed list of ingredients needed to drug someone and methods on how to do it without being caught. I can buy some of the other taboo stories being just for masturbating or something but the drugging in particular was very detailed with several questions and follow ups months later. Even one asking about how the cold would affect it. There were a few other concerning ones about how to isolate someone over time and these were all the ones saved permanently. I am feeling creeped out by this but is this worth discussing? Obviously people can have fantasies but something about this feels like I should bring it up. I haven’t been able to find many situations like this online, especially since it’s ai

Edit:

Well guys I hate to leave an embarrassing update but since this got some traction I owe a bit of an explanation. I left our shared apartment tonight and texted him asking him for an explanation on what he was doing on the app. I know everyone said to just leave but I couldn’t help it idk I needed an explanation but in fairness I was prepared to leave.

Well he was dumbfounded and admitted to using grok for nothing more than generating sexual ai images and had no fucking idea what I was talking about. Even though I had asked grok for history from his account he had only had the app for a couple of weeks and as we discussed I realized some of the history on what he had asked was almost a month before he even tried grok in the first place. He’s now understandably kind of upset that I even assumed he would be asking it that. I’m still confused on how it generated the history in the first place but just goes to show do not trust ai even if it does have timestamps

ANSWER: Hey! I'm not an alarmist, and I've been with/been involved with people who have fairly dark fantasies. This is not that. Please take me seriously when I tell you that you are unsafe.

Confronting a partner with this kind of history in his phone is likely to be unsafe. As someone who has experienced intimate partner violence and works with survivors, I would not recommend confronting him - if you feel that you must, do not do it at home, and do not do it without another person who is present physically and aware of the situation. 
Leaving a relationship can be complicated, scary, expensive, and time consuming, but I urge you to do so quickly. Next steps include telling someone you trust about what you found, then creating physical/geographical, financial, social, and emotional distance from your boyfriend.

Edit: it's also worth mentioning that when assessing for risk of harm (to self or others), professionals are trained to look for a plan, means, and intent (to identify actual risk vs just venting or fantasizing). 
Your partner at the very least has a detailed plan to harm someone, and could very well have both the means and intent to do so. That specific detail is why this is about more than dark fantasies and you are not safe to stay with him or confront him alone.

QUESTION: I F22 am scared for my bf M28 to see my boobs. How do I get comfortable enough to show him?

I’ve always been insecure about my boobs. They’re side-set, have stretch marks are a bit bigger so they’re a little saggy, aren’t perfectly round and I have quite big nipples and of course, they’re uneven. I’m terrified to show them to my boyfriend. I told him this at the beginning of our relationship and he hasn’t been pushy at all, but I’d like to take the next step with him. He hasn’t touched them or seen them (obviously), but he does like to rest his head on my chest and kiss it through my clothing and he says that he finds me beautiful no matter what. He’s told me that he’ll find them beautiful, but he can’t possibly know that. He might take my shirt off and find me disgusting.
Does anyone have any tips? Does the look of boobs matter a lot?

ANSWER: Came here to say this boobs are boobs and he's a man so he will like them. If he complains dump him immediately

QUESTION: My boyfriend (M25) resents me for having an abortion (F25)

Hi everyone,

Bit of a difficult post of write but I could do with so advice. I (25 F) had an abortion around 9 months ago, when I first found out I was terrified and didn’t know what to do. Me and my boyfriend (25M) have been together for 9 years, but we have had a lot of difficulties throughout the years such as him deciding he wanted to break up twice through this time as he was unsure about the relationship.

This has left some scars on the relationship, because he becomes withdrawn, less interested in the relationship which leaves me anxious throughout. I’ve asked him to come to therapy with me to resolve these issues but each time he has declined to do it. He has became this way over the last few months which again made me feel anxious wondering what the behaviour was about.

In addition to our difficulties over the years, I believed we were not in a good place financially to have a kid yet- we didn’t have our own place, I was at a job for minimum wage, I’m studying to become a solicitor which is costing me a lot of money at the moment. He, on the other hand, said he would help a lot financially, with the time of bringing up a baby while I study, and general other support.

Despite this, I just felt like because of past behaviour of him leaving, my own experience with relatives becoming single parents due to their partners leaving etc. I didn’t want to put myself in a position that I would become a single parent, with little finances if everything went wrong- as realistically babies are a beautiful thing but can strain any relationship, particularly one where there is unsolved issues.

My boyfriend sat me down yesterday and said he’s having feelings of resentment and coldness towards me as a result of the abortion. Throughout the abortion he supported me with the decision I.e, taking me to the appointment, taking care of me for the weekend but never voiced any of his strong feelings through this.

Now I’m sat here wondering what to do. I understand his worries when he says you never know if you can have children in future as I’ve said I would be more than happy to have kids from 28 when I finish studying, but now he doesn’t believe me? Any advice would be appreciated.

ANSWER: Sorry OP but it doesn’t seem like relationship that will last. Even before the abortion he was on the verge of leaving. Even when you will be in better financial position you will have at the back of your head that he might leave. Is it worth living in such anxiety?

QUESTION: My (28M) gf (31F) got very drunk yesterday and I don’t know if I should trust her?

My (28M) gf (31F) went out yesterday to a costume birthday party. She’s friends with the birthday guy. They both had some affectionate messages that she showed me a couple months back, which at the time caused a discussion and she reassured me that nothing was going on between them and I trusted her at the time so that was it.

So yesterday I sent her a message around midnight to update her on what I was doing since I was having dinner with some other guy friends. I saw she uploaded a story where she was dancing with another girl and there were other guys in the back, and minutes later she deleted the story.

I was curious and asked her why she deleted that, and she responded four hours later, but her messages were not making any sense. I also asked her why did it take her so long to respond, and after a couple weird messages she finally responded saying that she didn’t even notice the time and that she didn’t like the story so she deleted it. Judging by the messages she was very drunk. She then says that she’s drunk and is driving home. I got pissed and told her that she shouldn’t have drunk so much knowing she had to drive home after and to let me know as soon as she gets home.

Now the drinking and driving is definitely something that bothers me a lot, but also, I feel kind of disrespected because she went out and got very drunk in a party with other guys I haven’t met specially with a guy we had a discussion about. I guess I feel insecure because of a couple things she has said and done in the past. For example she once said that when she drinks “her legs open by themselves”. Also that she’s a very sexual person. Also she once said that she liked that she looked like a bitch on one of her instagram posts and a couple other things.
So yeah, honestly I would like to trust her when she goes out but if I know shes drinking I feel uneasy. Is it wise to bring this up to her and tell her that I don’t like it when she drinks?

EDIT: I got word from a mutual friend that also went to the party that she was being flirty and handsy with the guy I mentioned above the whole night. At the end of the party this mutual friend saw them both getting into the guy's car to "have drinks". Yeah, that's bs. I just broke up with her and blocked her on everything.

ANSWER: What do you want to know that she didn’t already tell you. 
She is not a keeper it’s just your turn. Either enjoy the ride or move on.

QUESTION: My(25F) Bf(30M) left after seeing ex's engagement post

Okay so, I '25F' have been dating my boyfriend '30M' for a little over two years now. We just moved in together a few months ago. Last night we were doomscrolling on insta reels and his ex's(32F) post popped up abt her getting engaged

I don't rly know much about their relationship in detail other than her cheating on my bf with her current fiance while she was engaged to my bf (they were together for 5 yrs and it's been 3.5 yrs since they broke up), so ik that it didn't end well with them and it's just a sour topic so i never rly bring it up. I don’t follow her but she's kind of famous on insta as she is a food vlogger and I watch a lot of that content that's y she popped up.

Anyways when he saw it he like frozen and became tense i asked him if everything was ok and he said yeah but i asked if that her looked tense was it because of the post he just brushed it off and rolled over to go to sleep and then thing is we didn't even rly cuddle when we cuddle like almost every night when going to sleep.

I woke up around 2 a.m. and he was gone. Like, completely gone.  he was nowhere in our house. I called him, like, 10 ,15 times. No answer ,Phone was switched off. I even called one of his friends, and they had no clue where he was. I was thinking of calling his mom but ik she would have blown his phone up so i decided to wait and call my frnd she also suggested to wait a few hours so i did

Then around 3:30 ish  he finally calls me back,i ask him wtf is he doing And he just says I'm fine pls don't call me rn ill explain later and he hangs up b4 i could say anything properly

I tried calling again obviously bcoz what does that even mean like I don't get why he would even be upset about that post seeing they broke up so long ago I can't imagine leaving your gf over this at night. He didn't explicitly say anything abt the reason he went off but I'm pretty sure it's bcoz of the post. I stopped calling him after a few times as hes not going to pick up i rly don't know what to do.

He still hasn't returned, and I don't know what to do when he does.

What is the best way to determine if this is a one-off panic attack due to unresolved trauma or if this is a sign of a deeper issue in our relationship?

TLDR: BF left in the middle of the night after seeing his cheating ex got engaged, turned his phone off, and called back hours later only to say "I'm fine, don't call." How do I handle this fallout and the conversation about his unacceptable behavior

Update- https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/223AzlHLSa

ANSWER: If he’s that upset by his ex getting engaged that he can’t talk to you about it and has to go out all night, then he’s not over her and shouldn’t be dating other people seriously.

You should take a break and he should see a therapist. Alright for him to be upset, freaked out even, and to need time alone. But to be so not in control of his feelings that he can’t even express to you in a rational way what he’s doing and where he’s going, is excessive.

Is this his usual way of handling issues? If so, he has growing up to do. If not, he definitely still has a thing for her.

ETA: text that magically disappeared from my original post and corrected that he should seek therapy, not OP.

QUESTION: I (26F) tried to slow ghost my former best friend (26F) of 10+ years but she won’t take the hint. Do I tell her directly that I want to part ways with her completely?

UPDATE: I sent her a long message - tried to keep it kind and respectful but explained all the reasons we wont be friends anymore. She read it and was ‘typing’ on and off for more than an hour but hasn’t sent her reply yet.

So I’ll call my former best friend Megan. We were best friends from age 11 until about age 24, where it all went wrong. As it stands, I don’t want to have her in my life. She has caused me a lot of pain and I no longer trust her. She hasn’t gotten the memo though, and keeps calling and texting saying ‘it’s been so long let’s hang out!’. At first I tried to allow it to fizzle out gradually but the more I do, the more persistent she is. I’m feeling guilty and don’t know where to go from here.

So, the context: Megan and I decided we wanted to move to the city together after we graduated. The city is expensive so we had to move into a share house with other people, which is very normal for people in our age and location.

We found these two guys our age who were looking to balance their house with two females. They seemed like a great fit for us. They were very involved in their church life as Christians. They weren’t ‘bro’ kind of guys, which suited us as we didn’t want to live with guys who were into partying/drugs lifestyle or who might persue us sexually. A wholesome home in the crazy big city.

I’ll try to keep this short but this is a LONG story. If any of you have seen Baby Reindeer on Netflix, that’s what happened with one of the guys. That’s the TLDR. I’ll call him Tom. Tom became obsessed with me - at first positively and then extremely negatively. He hated me with a passion. It was hell. I didn’t understand what I did wrong.

He would send me massive paragraph texts about how disgusting I am, so much that I had to block him from being able to message me on anything. I wasn’t messy or noisy, actually I spent as little time as I could in the house because of him. Never cooked or used the common area to avoid anything he could get angry at me over.

I was working in hospitality so would get home at 1am - 2am and he would be waiting at the window, big light on. My room was next to his, and as soon as I was inside my room he would make as much noise as possible - banging on the wall, walking up and down, grunting and groaning. He always knocked on my door when I was sleeping to ‘talk’ to me.

Meanwhile, he was a completely different guy to Megan and the fourth guy. Because I was always out and they had similar schedules, they’d spend lots of time together. I could overhear him when speaking to them and he was acting as the most well adjusted, thoughtful, kind person. Crazy.

You might be wondering how they couldn’t hear the commotion at night. Megan is deaf in one ear and sleeps on her good ear, so if she’s asleep she can’t hear anything. The fourth guy had the bedroom downstairs and had to sleep with his medical equipment on, which is pretty loud.

Tom bitched about me hardcore to the others. I heard him doing it a lot. His main point was that I kept him awake at night. Thing is, I did keep him awake at night because he was up  waiting up for me. But he left that part out.

It all got so bad that my dad called him to have a conversation to try and get him to stop all of this. My dad, who had a career as a psychologist said ‘baby I won’t tell you what was said but I can tell you he’s obsessed with you and you should lock your door at night.’

So how did this ruin my friendship with Megan? Well for the first months I kept it all to myself. Because it was all happening in the middle of the night and over the phone, I kind of wanted to pretend it wasn’t happening and if I told them, it would make it feel real. I also didn’t want them to feel awkward. But when it got too much and I told Megan all about it - she did nothing. She didn’t really respond. I expected her to be horrified, but she was all ‘that’s between you two, I’m staying out of it.’ That was it.

She continued to be friends with him. One time - they didn’t know I was in the house and Tom was on a rampage about me to Megan downstairs. I stood in the hall and heard it all. For literally 45 minutes he was ranting - ‘she’s the most uninteresting person I’ve ever met. There’s not one interesting thing about her. She so unmotivated. All the wants from her life is to be looked after by men and watch reality TV. I have no respect for her at all.’  Megan didn’t join in, but she also didn’t combat him, she listened. And as my boyfriend pointed out to me - she’s definitely said mean stuff about me for him to even feel comfortable saying all of that to her.

After that, I left the house and just cycled around in the dark. I put a message in the group chat saying I heard everything, and I bullet pointed the reasons why all of that wasn’t true at all. Megan didn’t say anything to me about it. Tom came to my room the next day and demanded I move out. I said no (I was waiting until both mine and my boyfriend’s contracts were up so we could move in together). The next week, he moved out. I think me overhearing all of that outed him as being awful and he was embarrassed. Megan went for a farewell dinner with him to say goodbye.

That was over a year ago now. I tried to forgive Megan. She came to my place and I explained my whole experience and she did apologise. She was sorry. I tried to move on after her apology - we went to a festival together and hung out a few times. But I can’t shake it. She didn’t act like a best friend at all through that situation and I do not trust her. Now thinking of her makes me think of him and how she left me alone in that situation. I’m much happier in my new life in my new home with new best friends.

That leads us up to now. She keeps on messaging and calling trying to rekindle and I know that I’ve tried, and I know it doesn’t work. I don’t want to confront her because she already apologised for that stuff, and I don’t believe in making people feel bad when they’ve already been sorry. But I know that she lost my friendship in the way she acted during that time.

Do I tell her or keep saying I’m busy?

TLDR my ex best friend sided with our housemate who was making my life hell - I don’t want to be friends but don’t know how to make that clear to her.

ANSWER: 'Hi Megan, I haven't really wanted to get into it because you have apologised and there's nothing to be done about it now but the whole situation with Tom really changed how I feel about you and I can't see myself having any kind of friendship with you going forward. I think it's probably best if we don't contact each other any more.

QUESTION: Me (F22) how can I romance my husband (M20) if I’m his caregiver?

We’re newly weds, barely hitting a year in December. Last month my husband was hit by a car while riding his bike home from work. He fractured parts of his back and many other issues. I’ve been dealing with lawyers and managing his doctor’s appointments. I care for him now while he’s on bed rest.

He’s been getting depressed and today he tells me he is craving romance. Usually when he tells me this, I give him a romantic bath, or go out to dinner, or even get him gifts, or plan activities together.

Now with money being strict, and him incapable of travel, all my ideas of romance are blank

I have no idea how to romance him like I use too. I’ve just been under so much stress and have been busy taking care of him, he says he feels like a patient rather than a cherished husband

What can I do to make him feel loved and romanced while he’s in this condition. If we need anything more right now, it’s romance

ANSWER: This is a tough situation and you have my empathy. My husband was previously in a care taking role for me, however a work accident had had us swap roles and I understand how complicated this can be.

My best suggestion is to ask your husband what would make him feel cherished. It's too big a burden to put on you to solely come up with the ideas and hope you land on the right one. You guys need to have a conversation about what romance will look like for you both now. I know conversing about it dosnt exactly scream sexiness, but I can tell you that being confident in knowing what your partner wants and then being willing to do that is hot.

If you have the energy, you can also do some online research in disability communities. Talk to other couples who have experience with romance and caretaking. Read some articles. Then talk with each other and see what fits within your desire, timeliness and budget.

Also, it can also help to try and broaden your ideas about what constitutes romance. Presents and adventures are wonderful but so is a hand written card left for him to read or a head rub while you talk about your day.

I wasn't 100% sure since you said romance but if you are using romance to also include sex then I would definitely recommend again heading to Google to research disability, caregiving,  and sex.  If you would like more direct links let me know and I can share some resources.

Lastly, being a care taker can be tough. Make sure you do what you can to care for your self as well. While it might feel selfish to focus on your needs it absolutely isnt. If you get too burned out and run down then your ability to care for your husband is detrimentally impacted. Take a little time to pamper your self or care for your self and see how your husband reacts to a more relaxed abd happy you.

QUESTION: Update: My (32F) husband (36M) became a robot and I don’t know how to help him.

[original:](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hlgv6r/my_32f_husband_36m_became_a_robot_and_i_dont_know/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Hey everybody, here’s the update. I wrote this a couple days ago but couldn’t post it because it was too soon.

My husband came home at around 6 o’clock, and after he had something to eat I took him to the bedroom to talk.

I sat him down on the bed and told him I was worried about him. I didn’t know exactly how to phrase my worries so I just showed him my original post.

When he finished reading the post he starting crying, like full on crying. In all the years that I have known this man, I had never seen a tear roll down his eye. I held him for a few minutes until he could recompose himself, and he told me everything.

He told me that the world was in a “shitty place” right now, and that we’re bringing a child into a stressful time.

He said when I became pregnant he felt he had to step up. He needed to take care of things because it was his responsibility.

He said that the weight of carrying the family was so much harder than he anticipated so he thought if he “doubled down” he could get through it. But the more he tried the “darker the tunnel got” and eventually he couldn’t see an end.

He said that he feels like he’s “constantly drowning, and the only breath of fresh air is on the car ride between home and work.”

He said that sometimes the stress is so much that he throws up, but doesn’t tell anyone and instead keeps going with his day. He then pulled out a pack of gum from his pocket and said “this was for when it happens.”

I asked him why he couldn’t tell me any of this, and he said he didn’t want to “burden me with the truth.”

He said that, he thought if he told me everything, that I would stop seeing him as a “protecter and provider”, and that I would inevitably stop loving him.

Hearing him say that brought tears to my eyes because I didn’t know where he got the notion I would feel that way.

I asked him if he wanted to quit his job but surprisingly he said the job doesn’t bother him. He said the work in of it self was fine. It’s just now he feels an added weight to provide because not only was he fortunate enough to keep his job in the pandemic, but we also had a kid on the way.

He said that some days he feels like packing a suit case and running to some tropical island for a week and not telling anyone. But then he feels guilty and doubles down even more.

I told him that maybe he should go on a trip. I said that he deserved a break, and maybe if he did exactly that he’d feel better. He tried to protest, but I insisted. In the end said that he’ll only go, if we go together. Like a romantic get away between spouses.

Once things start to clear up and before the baby is due, he wants to take a week off from work, drop the kids off at Grandma’s house and have us go on a vacation. Just the two of us, like we used to when we first got married.

He also said he wants to take the day off tomorrow and just sleep in, so that’s the plan. I’ll call his boss tomorrow and say that he’s sick and can’t come in, it’s not like they’ll make a sick man come in to work. There’s a pandemic going on :).

Right now he’s playing with the kids and it doesn’t feel like he’s doing one of his chores. He actually seems to be enjoying himself.

For the first time in months I don’t see the robot, I see my husband.

Edit: Hey everyone, I want to thank you all for the support. I read all of your comments, and I appreciate all of you.

I didn’t expect this to get so much traction, so I want to clarify some things.

First things first, my husband says hi.

1.  I wanted to clarify about the chores people are taking about. I want to say that I know as a SAHM the bulk of chores goes to me. I cook and clean and do laundry because I know it’s my responsibility. My husband’s only chores are doing dishes, vacuuming every three days, and a few other “house maintenance” stuff.

2. I did in fact call in sick for my husband, but I made sure that I said he had a migraine. I saw on google that it wasn’t a symptom of COVID if it was an isolated symptom. His boss was okay with it and said he can come back whenever he feels better.

3. The pregnancy wasn’t an accident. We both did want to have 3 kids because we were both raised in 3 kid families. We actively tried for the first 2, but for baby number 3 it was kind of a “if it happens it happens” kind of thing. We’re both happy with the amount of kids we have/ will have and are hopefully done. We are not considering abortion nor adoption.

4. We realize that a one week vacation isn’t enough to get rid of his stress and are both trying to come up with a solution that alleviates his stress in a more sustainable way. Right now we’re thinking about setting up an hour or 2 a day that’s, “daddy’s time.” No kids, no me, no work. Just for him to relax.

5. To those of you who think this fake; there isn’t any way I can change your minds about this situation so I’m not really too bothered. I just hope you this never happens to you guys.

You all have been supportive and really a wonderful bunch of people. I really think we can get through this, and it wouldn’t have been possible without you guys.

I’m not going to reply to comments because, like last time, it’s an overwhelming amount. But just know I’m reading these as they come in.

Goodnight everyone, it’s been great.

ANSWER: As someone whos come out the other side of this i think you could not have handled this better than you have. I actually felt a bit emotional reading this so well done.

I think a break from work is a big one and its very hard to work out whether the stress coming from the job is simply he's working to much or that the specific company is burdening him.

A day off followed by a week away with no responsibility so he can recharge his batteries is well due but i think after that week knowing what feelings going back to work has will be the key to whether he should be looking for another company. If all he feels is dread then looking for a job whilst remaining at the company will give him a new take on life. Its a scary thought, especially if hes been there a while and/or gained ranks but even a lateral move should help his mental health.

In general i think youve now set tje tone that you two can discuss these things and work to positive outcomes and it sounds like you've got the material for a long happy marriage, i wish you well in everything in the future.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My girlfriend told me she was with a friend, but that friend was with me picking out an engagement ring. How do I confront my girlfriend about her lie?

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hi97h9/my_girlfriend_told_me_she_was_with_a_friend_but/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Hey guys! Oh my god, where to begin! My last post got WAY more attention than I could have ever imagined. Suffice to say, it was a tad bit overwhelming. Seriously, the amount of people begging for an update was a bit dehumanizing in a way. Like I wasn't a person going through something, but more so a "story". But I understand, haha.

I just want to say thank you so so so much for all of the support and wonderful comments. I got a lot of great advice that helped me tackle the issue head on. I also got a lot of really really kind comments and messages. It was awesome.

I also got a lot of comments that made me realize how toxic this sub can be. There were MANY comments that just said things like "she's cheating, it's over" and "don't even confront her, just leave". It's advice like that that can ruin relationships that just need a little work.

And thank you to the people that told me to hit my girlfriend, told me I was an embarrassment to my gender, and best of all, told me I should encourage an affair because it would lead to great experiences for me later in life. You gave me a good chuckle.

ON TO THE UPDATE.

I decided to confront my girlfriend. I thought about using some of the lies people suggested, but they just wouldn't make sense. To say I ran into Justine somewhere: well, I told my girl I had to stay home and do stuff around the house, and that's why I couldn't go with her to see my SIL. To say Justine was helping me pick out jewelry: it doesn't make sense for her to come all the way to our house to help me pick out a piece of jewelry unless it was a serious piece of jewelry (like an engagement ring). If I just wanted to get her a piece of jewelry as a gift, I'd ask her friends for suggestions or ask them to send me pictures of jewelry she might like. It all happens over text. None of the excuses made sense. So, I decided to be honest.

I basically just said that I knew we'd been thinking about marriage and she probably knew a proposal was coming soon so I invited Justine over to help me find her the perfect ring, and that so happened to be the day that she said she was going to see her, so... what's the deal?

She immediately started grinning like an idiot and prodding me about proposing and the ring, but then we got back onto the topic of where she was and she confessed what she was really doing. No, she wasn't cheating, and no, she wasn't picking out a ring for me (the amount of times that was commented was crazy).

So, some people are dog people and some people are cat people. Well, me, I'm a snake person. I grew up with snakes my whole life. But I never felt I was able to get one because my girlfriend has always been uneasy about living with a snake which I completely respected. Also, the process of buying and raising a snake is very different than that of buying and raising a dog or cat. It's quite complicated. So you could imagine my surprise when my girlfriend showed me a picture of her holding the cutest Kenyan sand boa I have EVER SEEN!

Needless to say, my girlfriend was going to surprise me with a snake! We're picking her up next week (let me know if you want a pet tax, she's so cute). I definitely did not expect this and I feel bad for ruining the surprise, but oh well. Life is good! Sorry if this isn't the ending you guys wanted or expected, just a snake haha. Thanks for reading!!

TLDR: snake

Edit #2: did you guys really award me 130 snek awards... I love reddit

ANSWER: I'm glad to see honesty and communication triumphed.

Congrats on your future engagement, your new pet, and a happy resolution!!

EDIT: I'm also chuckling at the TLDR.

Snake, but not the 'snake' that everyone was thinking. ;)

Depending on how you think it would go over, I'd be tempted to name the snake 'Justine.' :P

QUESTION: UPDATE: my son and his "friend" are a couple. How do I let them know it's okay?

I tried yo post this before but it got removed as I hadn't waited 48 hours. Hopefully this time it works!

Hello, lovely people. As promised I am back with an update for you on all what happened the other day. [Here it is, if you missed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fv7ec7/my_son_and_his_friend_are_a_couple_how_do_i_let/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Want to top this off with a big thank you to everyone who left such lovely, thoughtful comments. I honestly didn't expect so many people to see the post, I was thinking maybe an absolute maximum of 100 people and even that seemed like loads. It was lovely to hear back from so many of you, and I'm forever grateful for the fantastic advice most of you gave. Also overjoyed by my new adopted reddit children haha you're all doing amazing and I'm very proud of all of you. Also big thanks to all of the lovely people who sent me such sweet messages of support, and to those of you who reached out to me because you felt you needed someone to talk to. If anyone else feels that way and is in need of dadly advice, do feel free to give me a message and I will do my best to help out :)

Okay you all want me to shut up and tell you what happened haha. My son was busy with some assignments both for his freelancing job and his uni work most of the day and I didn't want to disturb him so I waited until after dinner to chat. "Friend" went to have a bath while my son and I watched telly. I tod him face to face "Son, I love you very much. You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to, but I want you and [friend] to feel comfortable being yourselves in my house and you don't ever need to hide anything from me, alright?"

Well, it turns out a hell of a lot of you were right. Son burst out laughing and said "oh thank God, I reckoned you'd clicked on but didn't say anything because I didn't want to make you feel weird". Basically we've each been pussyfooting around the topic because neither one of us wanted to make the other uncomfortable talking about it. We had a bit of a chat and he confirmed that I'm right in thinking they've been together since their first year of uni and that's why they moved in together in second year. However, apparently I'm not as brilliant and intuitive as I thought because apparently one of his friends in secondary school was his boyfriend for a year and I had absolutely no idea haha. He went and talked to the boyfriend after his bath, and then we all had a bit of a further chat. Sadly a lot of you were right that the reason boyfriend doesn't have a good relationship with his parents is because he came out to them a few years ago and they effectively disowned him, so I made sure he knows that he's a part of our family now.

Sorry if that isn't all as exciting and groundbreaking as some of you had hoped haha! I'm glad this is something my boy no longer feels he has to keep from me and I'm very glad he's happy with his partner. Thank you all again for the help!

ANSWER: >Sorry if that isn't all as exciting and groundbreaking as some of you had hoped

No, this is pretty much exactly what I was hoping for.

QUESTION: [UPDATE]: My (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before I get married.

First of all thank you so much for all the replies, I didnt think this would get so big. I have read pretty much all of them (special shout out goes to the person who says this was fake solely on the fact that I write like a man, whatever that means XD)

Also thanks for all the gold and silver, it's appreciated although if you wanna spend money give it to charity or something.

&#x200B;

I went and talked to him this morning I told him that his father is not going to look at me and he needs to respect that. He was adamant that it needs to happen and accused me about lying about my virginity. I was trying to be calm and rational but he was not having it and just became more and more angry. I told him if he really loved me he would stand by me on this and tell his father no to which he slapped me and said he didnt need to prove anything.

so I ended it and left him. I am currently back at my friends house being miserable and eating pizza which is pretty fun.

so yup. Thanks everyone :)

ANSWER: Wow, just as controlling as we expected. To accuse you of lying and SLAP you is real fucking bold on his part.

Good work getting rid of him. You'll be much better off. Glad you have a good friend on your side.

QUESTION: My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat. UPDATE

Original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hu9xlv/my_22m_vegan_girlfriend_21f_wants_me_to_get_rid/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

TL;DR My gf is a passionate vegan and wants me to get rid of my beloved cat because cats eat meat and kill mice.

First of all, let me say thank you for everyone who offered advice. There are over 7,000 comments on my original post and I have dozens of PMs. Frankly I'm still pretty overwhelmed with the magnitude of the response. I did my best to read most everyone's comments but obviously I couldn't get to everything!

I would also like to preempt this post by saying, as many users pointed out, that my GFs extreme views on domestic cats are not representative of the vegan/vegetarian community as a whole. I do think that, sometimes, new vegans can be a little overzealous. In reality, most of us are just doing the best that we can to not hurt animals! I did not expect to generate a big debate in the comments.

So, we broke up, obviously. I would never, ever give up my cat Mittens. Many users said that this situation was about control, not veganism, and looking back, I do see a pattern of control on my GFs part. I was blind to it I guess.

I called my GF and said I was not willing to give up Mittens under any circumstances, and given the recent issues we'd had, and our incompatible views, I thought it was best that we parted ways. I said she deserved a partner that shared her values. She then asked if we were breaking up, I said yes. There was some anger on her end but otherwise the situation actually went better than I expected.

So, yeah. That's really it.

Oh, and several users did ask to see a picture of Mittens. I have uploaded one to imgur:

Thanks again to everyone who offered advice. It really helped.

QUESTION: yesterday I froze during sex and my girlfriend asked if we should stop, I said yes and she backed off. I've never been treated like this before.

I am 23(M) and I've been raped before. Twice. I've been sexually assaulted too and this has affected me and subsequent relationships a lot. 2 days ago my girlfriend (23) was in my lap and we were making out and suddenly the images of rape came into my mind and I froze. She obviously sensed it and asked if everything was okay but I couldn't answer and I'd begun to sweat. She got of my lap and asked if I wanted to talk but i still couldn't say anything. Then she asked if she should leave the room and I gave a small nod. She just grabbed her phone from the table and left. This has never happened with me. Nobody has listened to my no before. It feels weird, different ? I don't know.

Next morning when I woke up she had made breakfast and left me a note saying if I wanted to talk I could call her anytime. She came over after work and I thanked her for listening to me, I was almost in tears. She welled up too and said no obviously means no, but hesitation means no too. And that she would never knowingly hurt me. I've never been treated like this before. My parents were shit, and almost every relationship I've had (3) were also similarly shit.

But she's different, she's been my rock when I've fallen low, she cooks for me because she wants me to be healthy, she leaves notes of affirmation all over the house for me to find and is generally the most genuine amazing person I've ever met. I want to show my gratitude to her and want to tell her how much she means to me but I don't know how ? Also it's still weighing on me how my say matters to her. Never in my life have I ever been treated this way.

So how do I tell how much she means to me ? And will I stop feeling this way ?

EDIT:- oh my god, y'all. I never expected this kind of response! I'm trying to read through them all but thank you so much!

To clarify a few things, almost everyone who commented suggested therapy. Therapy is super expensive and I'm already working to pay for school but yes I've started therapy, it's been about 5 months now. Just taking baby steps here.

Secondly y'all gave a ton of good ideas but I think I'm gonna write her a letter and maybe arrange for a small picnic for the two of us. I know she'll love it.

For those saying I should propose, that's definitely the plan, just not now.

And to those who shared their (similar) Experiences, thank you. It gave me an insight and I hope things look up for you.

And for all those who said I'm a 'pussy' for getting raped or I'm lying, I'm sorry but I can't make y'all believe me. I hope y'all feel better after this.b

Again, thank you so much for your kind comments. Y'all are amazeballs.

ANSWER: You could read her this post. If you wanted to show her with your actions then you could plan a special day doing the things she enjoys.

QUESTION: Update: My [36M] wife [34F] keeps tying my boots after I've told her to keep her hands off of them. I tried to teach her a lesson and really hurt her feelings.

[Original](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gpa82s/my_36m_wife_34f_keeps_tying_my_boots_after_ive/)

I've gotten a few requests for update but didn't want to post until I felt like I really had anything to say. A lot has happened in the past two weeks so I'm going to try to go over it as best I can.

My wife and I started talking again. We had a very serious conversation and I did apologize for what I did to her running shoes, and then I told her I had to speak some truth and I wanted her to promise me that she wasn't going to roll her eyes, interrupt me, scoff, or get sarcastic with me, which she did. I told her that I was not kidding about my boots, that while most of the time I caught geriatric transports, falls, and nausea, there were instances where response time was of the essence and I didn't have time to play around with my boots in the middle of the night. I told her that there have been times when my intervention has been critical in saving a life, when my training has helped me recognize an underlying emergency, or when a call I made ensured that a patient was prioritized upon arrival at the hospital. I explained that a lot of the shit I see, I don't tell her about because I don't want to give her nightmares or make her worry about me. She actually listened and didn't dismiss what I had to say. She responded that she was trying to help by keeping things neat.

I responded, "But you're not. Sweetie, I'm not trying to be mean, but you're not helping. You're hindering me. One day it may be the difference between life and death. I need you to not touch my gear. It's where I know where it is, it's where I can easily find it in a short amount of time, and if you move it, you are impeding an emergency response. I don't care if it looks neat. It serves a function, it doesn't look pretty. If you want to help me, please leave my gear where I put it."

A few nights later I had my friend Officer Rich come over. Officer Rich was one of the two cops that did CPR on the victim that night. The three of us sat on our deck and had a few social distancing beers. He talked about getting there, doing CPR, giving Narcan, waiting for the ambulance and getting her back shortly before we got there.

He then pulled out a few photos of car accidents that I had worked. He showed them to my wife and pointed out, "This car went into a tree. Your husband crawled into the wreck, put a collar on the driver, and stayed in there giving him oxygen until we could get him out." "Your husband pulled a three year old out of this wreck." "Your husband recognized that the driver had a stroke and took her to a stroke center, which likely saved her life."

After that, I told her I had something I wanted to show her and I asked her for the same promise I'd asked earlier. When she agreed, I showed her a video on YouTube of a police bodycam from an overdose. This video showed how critical time is in getting someone back, and the training someone goes through in order to give the drug, do CPR, and utilize an AED.

I told her, "I'm not trying to attack you, I don't want to have a fight, but I want you to understand what I go through. That I hope every call I go on is transporting a boo boo, because otherwise it means that if I don't do everything right someone could die. If I don't get out that door as quickly as possible, someone could suffer brain damage while they're waiting for me to give them oxygen. If I'm upset and shaking because I had to waste time opening my boots, I might miss something critical and someone might not make it."

She acknowledged that she understood and told me she hadn't really thought about the danger of what I do until the other night when she saw the photos of the wrecks. I told her that I think she has OCD and needs to see a therapist because it's hurting our marriage. I listed examples of her throwing important things out, moving things without permission, and messing with my gear. I offered to go together and said I'd be willing to work on things together.

After I pointed out the pattern, she agreed that it was time to speak to someone. She wants to think about whether she wants to go together or go by herself, but she has promised me that she's going to try to change her patterns. I brought up her saying she thought I was going to hit her, and she acknowledged she'd been with guys who flew off the handle with little provocation and scared her. That she'd never seen me get that angry and it triggered her because she didn't think I was capable of blowing up like that.

She's been very emotional lately and has been going through mood swings. She's been worried about me going out on calls. The other day she started crying and said, "I hope you know how much I appreciate what you do." Knock on wood, since we had the big talk, she hasn't touched my boots.

Is everything resolved? Not by a longshot. But she seems to have a new appreciation for what I do. Thank you for all of your responses. I wound up not showing her the thread, because a lot of it was pretty harsh towards her. I recognize I cherry picked incidents that didn't put her in the best light, and there's a lot more to her and our marriage than that. She is the person I chose for the rest of my life, and I want us to work.

tl;dr Let my wife into my world a little more, she let me into hers, and she hasn't touched my boots since.

ANSWER: I'm glad things have worked out well so far, and I hope they continue to do so and that your wife gets the help she needs to be able to live more comfortably with her (potential) OCD (or whatever it turns out to be that drives her need for neatness).

QUESTION: [update] my [32M] best friend [30 F] asked if I would be her sperm donor for her surrogate, I am in love with her but sje has no idea.

I appreciate all the feedback, most of you were nice. There was a few idiots telling me I needed to be Alpha and be more manly.. but whatever.

Anyway the consensus with my RL friends was I needed to tell her. We do Brunch on Saturdays because she does Yoga Sundays so we met up this morning.

I could barely eat and she could tell something was up. She got worried thinking I was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks.

I sat her down and told her everything how I realized I was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. I told her that I never said anything because I did not want to jeopardize our friendship. Her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face.

I honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and I honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      Then she started crying, sobbing really  and she lightly hit my chest. She half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to screw up what we have.

We hugged and I told her that there is no one on this earth I would want to have a child with but her. We talked for hours ,in fact I just got home. We have decided that we want to focus on us for now. I want us to be at that point that we can do it together.

I know that this isn’t a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end.

However I am pretty sure if there is such things as soulmates she is mine.

Thank you guys and gals for giving me the courage to tell her

ANSWER: Please, please, PLEASE live your BEST life and enjoy this woman while you have her! This post made me SOOO happy and i hope everything works out greatly! Good luck!

QUESTION: Update: My dad's (43) girlfriend is trying to get rid of me (15 f).

[op](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hz8rlm/my_dads_43_girlfriend_is_trying_to_get_rid_of_me/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

[last update ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ibccth/update_to_update_my_dads_43_girlfriend_is_trying/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Hi! Since my last post I spoke to my grandparents and told them everything. I asked if I could stay with them if I wanted to and they agreed. I then spoke to my dad again and tried to tell him how I felt and what I had heard. I didn't want to film or record because I knew that he would be mad at that and wouldn't listen. He didn't believe me again and thought that I was jealous of having to share him with someone else. I got upset and told him that I was leaving so he could live happily ever after without the burden of having me around. He looked shocked but didn't say anything.

I had already packed my bags and had brought some things to my grandparents house already. My dad didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My grandfather picked me up and I've been there since. I haven't gone home and I haven't heard from my dad. My grandparents told me that they would handle my dad and that I shouldn't have to be the one doing it.

I'm upset that my dad hasn't called or texted me once to see if I'm ok. At the same time I'm feeling so much better being with my grandparents. My grandmother is probably the sweetest person ever and my grandfather is a little rough around the edges but he's really a softie.

ANSWER: I'm so glad that your grandparents are such awesome people who will show you the love that your dad should have been showing you all along, and that they are willing to deal with your dad for you - it's too big of a burden for you to need to carry yourself. Maybe some day your dad will realize what he's done, but always remember that allowing him back in to your life should be your choice and done on your terms.

QUESTION: I (M28) broke up with my ex-fiancée (F27) of 4 years 2 weeks ago after catching her in a huge lie and then finding out 3 days ago that she commited suicide because i wouldn't take her back. I am in need of some serious advice as i'm being blamed for everything.

Hey guys,

I need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?

A little background:

Me and my ex-fiancée had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. I was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. She was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.

Back in April of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. Tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. I once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.

It all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in June because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. That was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. I didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted me and wanted to talk.

Imagine my surprise when she confessed to me that there was another guy involved and how all this time she was hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. I fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. It made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.

Heck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.

Everything was kinda OK until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message "Sorry bro" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. The picture was of my ex-fiancée at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. I fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. She was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.

When i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. Her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.

She cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. I was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.

I told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. She begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.

I did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fiancée had comitted suicide. Her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.

I am at a fucking lose, ex-fiancée friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over.

I am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.

ANSWER: NOT YOUR FAULT. She made the choice to cheat, she made the choice to take her own life.

Not your fault.

QUESTION: Mom had an affair 18 years ago, I [18M] am the product of it. My dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.

Update 3:

Hey guys, and update has already been posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ccpwcu/update_mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am/). Please don't message me so angrily any more.

Update 2:

Sorry for not updating, my grandpa passed away yesterday morning.

Nothing happened to me, but my situation is a secondary concern right now. Regardless, I think I will be alright, thanks to your amazing support and help.

My sister is aware of everything, and told me not to worry, she has my back and I have her support.

I promise to update when and if there are any significant changes, right now I need to support my grandma.

Thank you again to everyone.

Update:

Sorry to disappear, nothing bad happened to me.

Managed to talk with my mom yesterday, but I chickened out half way through what I had to say :(

The good news is that I am not being kicked out, or disowned, etc.

Thank you for all your support, everyone, I will follow through and call financial aid at my college in a few hours, and take it from there.

My grandpa had a stroke a week ago, and my dad is helping my grandma with setting up a live in nurse, so he wasn't around yesterday.

I will let you know how I manage.

Thank you again.

Pretty much the title. I have no idea how to process all this, and I am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(

Both my older brother and sister went to the same college. My brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. Both had their college paid by our dad. Dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.

My brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.

My sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.

I got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. I always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.

Instead I was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how I am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.

Dad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. He said it was never is place to say anything since I am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.

Apparently my grandparents know I am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.

My siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as I am because there was never a hint of anything being off. I might be naive, but I always thought I had a great relationship with my dad. We go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when I had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. I never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. I mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. It's a story he tells from time to time. He likes to talk about stuff like that about me.

My mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have "the talk" with me, but she never did.

I feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. I am not even sure I will be able to go to college any more, I always assumed my parents will pay for it. I never had a job, and I am not sure what job I can even get to support me through college, I have no idea how to apply for loans.

All my mom has done is cry and apologize. But nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.

I don't even know if I am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, I feel shame leaving my room, and if I will be asked to move out I don't know where to go. I don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.

I am angry at my mom, I am confused about where I stand with my dad. There's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. I feel rejected and I have no idea what to do to fix this situation.

Anyone have any idea what to do here?

Do I apologize to my dad? What do I say to him?

Idk, I've been stuck in my room these past few days, reading and browsing reddit. I have no idea what to do.

Edit: Comments are coming in faster than I can reply, but I am making a list with all the advice about financial aid, health insurance, getting my own phone plan, etc, things I didn't even think about before. Thank you everyone.

I will try to answer as much as I can, but there's more comments than I can handle.

ANSWER: You need to have a calm conversation with your mom. See if you can still live at home or if they're kicking you out. You need to know this immediately to decide your next steps. If they're not kicking you out, that's basic decency. If they ARE kicking you out, talk to your siblings to see if you can crash at theirs, and live with one of them. If not, crash at a friend's until you can get on your feet.

If they seriously won't help you with college (and your mom won't help you either) start applying to jobs. The jobs you're going to apply for are going to suck, but if that's the only way you can pay for college and shit, then you gotta do what you gotta do.

Start applying to grocery store jobs and fast food jobs. Customers WILL suck, as people are fucking awful about their food. Customers in general will suck. You can apply online. Retail jobs, especially ones with commission. This means clothing stores like Holister, Nordstroms, Macys, Dillards, whatever there is available. Also jobs like ones at a car dealership, but beware commission only jobs. If you don't sell cars at the dealership, you don't eat. Get a job that pays a base per hour PLUS commission if possible. If not, you're going to get paid minimum wage like at Gamestop. Which sucks. But it's something.

Apply to your local community college. You'll definitely get in. Classes are FAR cheaper than a regular college, and you can get your common core classes out of the way there for cheaper (aka your History 101, Political Science, Government, English, one science course, one math, etc). It WILL take longer but it's fine, the classes are easy. After you're done with those you can get your Associates and transfer to a Big College. I reccomend this before going to the college you actually got in to because it is cheaper. You will work at the same time. Get ready for lots of ramen and cheap food OP.

As for loans, do you have any credit currently? The reason I ask is that the higher your credit score, the better loan you can get. That is the easiest way to earn credit. If you only have a debit card, start building your credit. Capital One or Discover have student credit cards that start you off pretty ok. You can apply for these online. Use the credit card that you apply for. Let's say max $100 per month. ~~Pay off about 50-75 dollars on it and leave a little bit that you owe for something called "revolving credit." This will help your credit score.~~ The first loan you're going to get is going to suck ass. Go to your local ~~bank where you have your debit card~~ credit union and ask them about student loans.

Apply for scholarships at your local community college and google scholarships. There are so many out there and sometimes people don't even apply! It's free money at that point. You're going to have a busy summer OP.

Ask your siblings if they can pull some money for your first semester at the community college. Then get one of the jobs I told you about before and start saving. If you do college slower, no one will judge you. You're paying your own way.

I wish you the best of luck OP. I'm so sorry this happened to you and that's really shitty of your dad to do this. Most colleges have therapy or counseling for free or reduced price and your area should have a local psychologist or therapist with sliding scale. Head over there.

Also, do you have medical insurance under your parents still? Or are they taking that away too? What about your cell phone bill? Car insurance? It's important you ask these questions so that you can proceed with your eyes open about if you actually need to pay for those things (I hope not OP. But please make sure).

I'm sending all my love to you. My wife was kicked out of her parents' at 17 and she had to do a lot of this herself too, and I work and study too.

Edit: Thank you kind stranger for the silver! Holy shit, thank you kind stranger for the gold!

Edit 2: Many users have said this and I've learned not to have anything owed on your credit card. Thanks to everyone who educated me! You learn something new every day!

Edit 3: holy crap, a platinum! Another gold! Thanks kind friends!

Edit 4: It's been pointed out to me that it's better to go to a local credit union for a loan and I absolutely agree.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] You were right. I ignored every single one of your comments and eventually caught my wife with the other man

This is a tough pill to swallow, and I can't say I hadn't been warned. [This is my previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g8d98r/wife_had_been_flirting_with_her_coworker_she_said) Many folks asked me to follow up with an update so here it is, fresh from the oven.

After reading every single comment of the reddit post, my brain just couldn't overcome the catastrophe and the collapse of the world I had built for me in which my wife is my love, my best friend and partner, as well a the person I admire the most. She was entirely perfect, and made me happy for many years. I thought no couple in the world could have what we had. We were both very happy for a long time. We were both attractive, we were both inherently good, had big hearts and were individually wildly successful in our careers.

After the reddit post, I moved to an airbnb and eventually with family to think things through. It was a terrible time but a psychologist helped me recover from a terrible mental state. It coincided with the pandemic hitting very hard in my city (I caught the virus), which didn't help.

During this time, we kept talking and my wife was very sorry and continued saying they hadn't met. I knew it wasn't true but was willing to forgive the woman of my dreams, who continued being in the highest altar of my universe.

Fast forward last saturday morning, I went back to our place, ready to forgive her and talk things through in the most mature way possible. And well, there she was, but I was the one who received the biggest surprise, to say the least. The guy was in my house naked, and so was my wife. The guy from the messages, the guy from the pics. The one she said she didn't even like. I caught him hiding in my bathroom as my wife was putting her pajamas on. When I saw him hiding in my bathroom, he uttered "sorry dude". For a second I asked myself, is this were I kill him? But I instantly replied "I got nothing against you", because the guy was just nailing this hot woman. Even if he was doing so in a house full of pictures of me. Pictures of our wedding and our families. Pictures of my dead father who would be so sad to see how the marriage he never witnessed was going to end. He has always been the reason I try to make the world a better place. He passed away two months before our wedding.

I'm sorry. I still love her to death. But I understand enough is enough. Even if my world collapses, I hope I can build a new one without lies and in which I'm not just a blind believer under an altar of a fake god.

Godspeed.

ANSWER: God fucking speed man.

Your wife will never be sorry for what she did. But she’ll keep saying she’s sorry dozens probably hundreds of times to try and keep her word from crashing down.

But you will be manipulated no more. Do not leave your marital home under any circumstance. Find a good lawyer and start filing for divorce.

You will come out of this a better man. There is light at the end of the tunnel!

QUESTION: HAPPY UPDATE: It has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34F) can’t have kids and she still has not “gotten over” it. I (35M) am seriously considering a divorce.

ORIGINAL POST: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b1982e/it\_has\_been\_7\_months\_since\_we\_learned\_that\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b1982e/it_has_been_7_months_since_we_learned_that_my/)

Hi all. First off, I want to apologize for not responding to every single post reply or PM. I am genuinely touched by the sheer amount of support I received and I spent quite a few hours crying my eyes out as I read your messages and well wishes.

The night after I wrote my original post, I wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/Witchy_Woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Dear \[Wife’s name\],

I love you more than you can imagine and the most I want in this world is for you to be happy. I understand that as a man I probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. I’m doing my best to help you but the fact that you won’t help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. I honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don’t make an effort to get better. However, I want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. I’m ready to talk whenever you are.

With all my love,

\[My name\]”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. The next morning (March 16th), I woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed OJ. When I walked into the bedroom with her food, I saw her reading my letter. When she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. Full on, Niagara Falls level crying. I hugged her tighter, told her “I love you so, so, much”, and started crying too. I honestly don’t know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. It could’ve been 10 minutes, it could’ve been an hour, I didn’t care. When she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. Reddit, you guys don’t know how thrilled and proud I was when I heard those words. She then asked me if we could go on a trip to Japan because in her words “I really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.”

I was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. She’s always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels I saw in her eyes the same spark that made me fall in love with her 8 years ago. We just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. We have a 5AM Uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return.

We’re not quite out of the tunnel yet, but we can see the light at the end.

EDIT: I'm going to bed. Thank you to everyone who followed my story and offered their well wishes.

ANSWER: This was so wholesome. I'm so happy for both of you, and you're being a wonderful husband to her. I hope you both enjoy Japan !

QUESTION: My son and his "friend" are a couple. How do I let them know it's okay?

Hello Reddit. Please bear with me regarding my formatting and things. I have read the rules and things, but I'm an old fart who is rather on the wrong side of 40 so I'm not overly well versed in the art of efficient internetting.

My boy is 20 years old. He's absolutely my pride and joy, and there is nothing he could do that would ever make me love him less. For the first half of his life, I regrettably wasn't involved very much. His mother and I parted ways when he was just a few months old and at the time I was struggling with a heroin addiction and was absolutely not as present in his life as I should have been, nor was I suited to fatherhood at all. I saw him, at most, two to three times a year for the first 12 years of his life. I won't discuss details because that's his private story to tell, but when he was 12 he revealed to me that he was being badly mistreated at the hands of his mother and her boyfriend. Despite not being the best father at the time, I didn't want my boy suffering any more so I got myself cleaned up and sorted out in order to get full custody of him. I've effectively been a single (and sober!) father ever since and he has little to no contact with his mother. He's everything a man could want his son to be; he's uniquely kind and fiercely loyal, he's unflinchingly brave, he's incredibly generous and, despite the horrors he suffered as a child, he's unfailingly positive and sunny to the last. Somehow I of all people was bestowed with the honour of watching him grow from a sweet young boy to the greatest man I have ever known. I cannot stress enough my pride in him.

When he was 18, he got accepted into a top ranking university on the other side of the country. I was sad to see him go, but simultaneously overjoyed that he got into his first choice and was starting a new chapter in his life. He comes home once every other month, and on the month's he doesn't come home, I go to visit him. He's doing well in uni, has made lots of friends and seems incredibly happy there, which I'm obviously chuffed about. Since his second year, he's lived with his "friend" in a flat off-campus. I've strongly suspected since his early teens that my son is gay, and I now more or less have confirmation that this is true and that his "friend" is actually his boyfriend.

So, for this COVID-19 faff, my son decided he'd rather come home and quarantine at mine than stay at his uni flat. His "friend", however, would be left alone if my son came back as he's a Candian and his family are back over there, and I gather he doesn't have the best relationship with them anyway. He asked if it would be okay if "friend" tagged along to my house and I said of course, no problem.

They've been back at mine for about six weeks now. They think they're being subtle I know, but I've caught them doing coupley things on several occasions now. The "friend" has slipped up a couple of times and called my son 'babe' and 'sweetie' in front of me, which I pretended not to notice for the sake of saving embarrassment. There have been nights where we'll be watching a film with the lights off and, thinking I can't see, my son will have his arm around the "friend". One day I walked into the lounge and I'm positive they'd just been kissing and were trying to cover it, though I admit I have no confirmation on that one. The most solid evidence, however, came a few mornings ago. I get up very early to go for runs in the morning (hence why I'm making a reddit post at five in the morning haha). As far as I was told, my son was sleeping in his childhood room and his "friend" was in the guest room. I don't know what possessed me to do so, but on Tuesday morning I cracked my son's door open to check on him like I used to when he was a kid. Lo and behold, they're both asleep, snuggled up together, in my son's bed. That's more or less solidified for me that they're together. I didn't say anything, just shut the door and went for my run, and I haven't mentioned it to them yet.

What I want advice on is this; how do I let my son and his boyfriend know that I'm okay with them being a couple and they don't have to feel like they have to sneak around in my house? I want them to be comfortable here and I want them to know I support them both no matter what. Or is that not a good idea? Am I better off leaving it alone and waiting until they tell me themselves, if they ever do? I obviously don't want to force either of them out of the closet, but at the same time I hate feeling as if they feel like they're being forced into the closet in my house. What's my best course of action here??

TL:DR - my son and his "friend" are staying with me for quarantine. It's abundantly clear they're a couple, and I want to let them know it's okay and they don't have to sneak around in my house. What's the best way to go about it?

ANSWER: My mom sent me a text that said, “You never have to admit anything to me that you’re not comfortable with. But if Jasmine was ever more than a friend, I’d want to make sure she knew she was loved here too”.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My grandparents don’t approve of my relationship with my black boyfriend, and don’t want me (F24) to marry him (26). I don’t know what to do, since I don’t want to lose either of these people (my boyfriend and my grandparents).

Hey guys, thanks for all your responses on my [previous post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0fmrl/my_grandparents_dont_approve_of_my_relationship/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

It was all really good advice, but the very best out of it all was the suggestion that I come clean to Sam. I did that, and he reacted in a surprisingly calm manner. I asked him how he’s taking it so well and he told me he’s experienced something similar before.

His cousin had come out as gay a few years back, and he told me how his own grandparents reacted very poorly to his cousins revelation. He told me they absolutely refused to acknowledge the fact that he was gay and said some pretty hurtful stuff along the lines of how his homosexuality would embarrass them in front of all their family and friends etc. They wouldn’t allow the cousin to bring his boyfriend to family gatherings, and threatened to cut him out out of their inheritance unless he “got his head straight”.

He then showed me pictures of his grandparents laughing along with his cousins husband, pictures of them at his cousins wedding etc. He told me they eventually grew out of it and as they go to know him they really bonded with the guy.

Sam joked that he wouldn’t give my grandparents a choice and that within a month they’d be in love with him.

Well I think it’s working. Sam and I have dinner at my grandparents house every night, and each night I notice them more and more at ease and more avidly taking part in our conversations. Sam and my grandpa are both WW2 enthusiasts, and my grandpa absolutely loves having discussions on the subject with Sam.

I decided to update this post because last night something very special happened. I got there before Sam, and I could _see the disappointment on their faces when they thought I had come alone_. They asked where Sam was, when he was coming etc. Then they said we wouldn’t start eating until he arrived.

I’m just so incredibly happy that I get to keep both relationships.

ANSWER: This is beautiful, well done Sam, and well done you, kill them with kindness, all the very best to you both.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My(m21) gf(f23) obsession with Pokemon is embarrassing me

Link to the previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i02wzl/mym21_gff23_obsession_with_pokemon_is_embarassing/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Tl;dr: Turns out you all were right, I was an asshole. My friends are no longer welcomed in our house and now I'm playing with my gf.

I've decided to post this update becauce you were all right. I didn't have a gf problem. I had friends problem.

So I had a talk with my gf like one of the users have suggested. I explained to her that I'm not ashamed of her hobby, I just didn't want her to know what our friends were saying behind her back. She said she doesn't care about their opinion, she's just doing what she's enjoying the most. I apologized to her. She has also agreed to move her pokemon plushies so they wouldn't take up so much space.

Fast forward to today, few hours ago our friends have visited us. It didn't take long for them to start making fun of my gf. This time I got mad - she organized her plushies so they were all in our bedroom, she has not even once mentioned pokemons nor did she opened pokemon go app.

Long story short they were forced to leave. I've realized they don't have problem with my gf hobby - they have problem with my gf and I have enabled their behaviour by not reacting sooner. Told them they are the ones who needs to grow up & to visit us again once they will stop being boomers.

To show my gf how sorry I'm and to better understand her hobby I've downloaded the app myself. So now I'm trying to level up as much as I can because she has a mission when she needs to trade a pokemon with a friend, but to do so I need to be at least 10 lvl.

Thank you for all your comments, even the mean ones - they worked as a wake up call I guess.

ANSWER: Very well handled bro. Your decision to play Pokemon with your girlfriend is the best you could make and you're gonna have lots of fun together. I started playing Minecraft with my boyfriend when we started liking each other and it is even now after three years a god bonding activity and a common hobby

QUESTION: UPDATE:My girlfriends father discouraged me from proposing because their family isn’t thrilled about us having “Dark Babies”

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hx9boq/my29m_girlfriends27f_dad_discouraged_me_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Thanks for all y’all’s input it really helped and most of y’all were right on the target.

Yesterday afternoon I sat my gf, Naomi down and had a conversation with her about what her dad said to me. I tried to leave out any mention of proposal and told her I was in their neighborhood and decided to pop by (Terrible lie, I know but she bought it). I told her what her dad said about us having dark babies and asked if she had any similar feelings about our kids popping out half black. She looked at me like I was out of my mind. She told me she didn’t give a fuck about the color of her kids as long as I was the dad, which was reassuring. She was not so happy with her dad. She wanted us to take a drive over there and talk with her parents about it.

That evening we dropped by unannounced and when her mom opened the door to see us she immediately asked Naomi to show her the ring. Naomi was confused and I about shit myself. I, like a dumbass, didn’t call ahead to her parents that I hadn’t proposed. I guess her mom thought we were going to surprise her with the engagement and assumed I had already proposed. I was speechless. They began speaking in Korean, but from context I assume her mom was asking if I was too cheap to buy her an engagement ring. And Naomi looked at me and started hugging and kissing me. My secret was out and I told her I had already asked her parent for their blessing. She was a few seconds from crying but sucked it up so we could speak to her dad.

Like I said in my og post my future father in law isn’t great at English so he and Naomi spoke in Korean. According to Naomi, she asked him why he told me that, and he said that he was worried about their extended family not viewing our babies as Korean and being rude to them or me for being black. I guess this did not come across well in English, because he was just concerned for me and our kids. He didn’t care that our babies would have dark skin. This was a huge relief. Her father isn’t the racist their extended families are (but like, fuck them who cares what they think). I am just so glad that our future kids are going to have grandparents that are going to love them. Only downside is now Naomi is expecting my proposal so I really got to knock her socks off.

Thanks so much for all the help.🤟🏿

ANSWER: Good news is you’re pretty much guaranteed to get a yes! Let us know how the proposal goes! Do you have any idea how you’ll surprise her?

QUESTION: Update : Wife (38F) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. It's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks I am going to abandon her and "our twins"

It has not been that long but i need again advice from you guys about the same topic.

[^((Original Post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cyh5cv/wife_38f_is_convinced_that_she_is_pregnant_even/)^()^)

I called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . He seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  He said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. I sat her down and we talked. All she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . I tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. I asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. She said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. Now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . So I did. She kept changing subjects or saying that " A mother just feels it. You wouldn't know how it is " then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her "gut feeling ". She got very agitated and was crying telling me that if I wanted to leave her i should simply leave but I shouldn't call her a liar.

&#x200B;

Somehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.

After she did i went on her computer. I do never snoop on her. But i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . Oh boy. She was in 2 facebook groups. One was a normal Mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. In the "normal" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her "belly" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the "grace of god that kissed her tummy" the "gift of life was given to her " and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. They were feeding in each others delusions. A woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. My wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. So many women were making her fear that i would leave. Saying things like men can not stick to a woman . Many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not "handle the pregnancy".

I was really fucking scared. I researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361851/). So to say the least i could not sleep. I was and am still very afraid of losing her. She woke up and I tried to act like nothing was wrong . We were going to the doctor. And it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. She was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. Things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. He was really tactful when talking to my wife. He tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. We tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. She got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . She began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . We could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . She could not breathe. The doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . She had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. Did an EKG to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.

At that point i really had no other option than to inquire about Involuntary commit. So I could not do it myself . I needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . After that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there "against her will". So far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . My wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. When i last her she was furious with me. She said i was taking away her freedom which I am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. She is so mad at me. I feel like I am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. I love her with all my heart. I am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . I feel like i failed to protect her. At this point I am just rambeling . Sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . I feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . Sorry for spelling mistakes

edit : I will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! When I gave my vows I meant trough illness and bad times. I am not only on the ride for the good times. If you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. Would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? I am here to stay. I will not divorce her. She is not a "fucking psycho" she is sick. I hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.

Sorry for the rant. But if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. I understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it Beginns to mess with their mental health  and I respect that but I won't do that.

Edit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. She was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks

I don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as I was so distraught. But I was not a sedative. I think it was something along the lines of Valium or Baldrian. Over the counter stuff mostly.

She has family. She is estranged from most of them. Her sister is now at our place to help.

Also refrain from such stupid comments like "I'll bet she will leave bro. She is cray how did you marry her" because they are not helpful at all. Specially the bets that are going on that my wife will leave me once she gets better. Just seems like you want me to divorce. Get a life.

ANSWER: I remember your first post so vividly. I am so so sorry that things blew up this way, but you did EXACTLY the right things here. She is going to be getting the help she needs. There is literally nothing you could have done to protect her from her own mind. You did what was right and it is so clear you love her. I hope things go well and she is given the help she needs.

QUESTION: My girlfriend [21F] of 18 months asked my [22M] preference about her pubic hair and now finds me "revolting"

So yesterday my girlfriend casually asked me how I prefer pubic hair to be groomed. She usually keeps hers short, but neat. I assumed she was just looking to change things up and wanted my opinion so I answered honestly and said that I find completely shaven attractive, but in the grand scheme of things I couldn't care less, it's not a turn off if there's hair, and that I like the way she has it now.

Well it turns out she had had a lecture today at college (she studies psychology) and the topic was on peadophiles. Apparently one of the talking points was that pedophiles are attracted to the lack of body hair.

When she told me this, I asked her "are you seriously calling me a pedophile because I find completely shaven attractive?! Can I just point out that you're 21 and not 12?" She basically skirted around my questions and then stormed out of my apartment when I kept pressing her on it. As she left she called me revolting and is now ignoring my calls and text messages.

What. The. Fuck.

Honestly not even sure where to go from here. We've never had any issues and was planning on proposing in the next year. Where has this even come from?!

TL;DR: Girlfriend pretty much called me a pedo because I told her I liked shaved pussy when she asked me my preference.

ANSWER: Just because pedophiles like no pubic hair doesn’t mean all people who prefer no pubic hair are pedophiles.

Just like all dogs have four legs doesn’t mean all things with four legs are dogs.

QUESTION: My boyfriend isn’t okay with me being promiscuous in the past. [Update]

Update to: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqzpmb/my_boyfriend_isnt_okay_with_me_being_promiscuous/

Thank you for all the advice. I ended up bringing it up yesterday and it instantly turned into an argument again. He asked me why I’m defending ‘thots’ so much yet again. Asking me why I cared so much about what he thought about woman who sleep around. He then went on to say I should of known better than to sleep with so much guys and that I ‘knew what I was doing’. He said I was straight up a thot in my past but he loves me and is willing to look past it. Yeah no. I stood my ground and said I can’t be with anyone who sees woman like that and that I wasn’t going to let him talk to me like that. I broke things off and he called me stupid for thinking he would let me break up with him and that turned into a whole new argument about how I ain’t ‘loyal’ and I ain’t no ‘ride or die’ chick. I also blocked him on all my socials and he is still making accounts to contact me on. Definitely made the right decision to end things.

Also to the people who messaged me saying he was right and that I deserved to be dumped. That nobody likes a used up chick, and many other unkind words, it was so unnecessary and I hope you step on a lego.

Edit: Typos and Thank you for the rewards. ❤️

ANSWER: >he called me stupid for thinking he would let me break up with him

eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

when he contacts you again consider making it clear to him that you'll report his harassment to the police if it continues. then do so if it does.

QUESTION: My wife (33f) is denying we're married and wants to be called my 'girlfriend'... I'm confused

My wife (33f) and I (29m) have been married four years now, coming on five. We have generally had a good relationship and a good marriage.

We had a reasonably expensive wedding, which we're still paying for now. I get the bill every month to prove it. My wife took charge of planning the wedding, so it was to her tastes. She seemed to enjoy it at the time and for the first few years of our marriage, she would look back at the wedding with me happily and without issues.

In recent months I've noticed my wife's attitude to a) our wedding and b) our marriage itself shift. It began by her (I thought jokingly) referring to herself as my 'girlfriend'. She told me to buy her a 'girlfriend' card for Valentine's Day rather than a 'wife' one, for example.

I thought she was just playing around at first. But this behaviour has only escalated. Two months ago my wife stopped wearing her wedding ring. I was understandably upset and asked her if there was something wrong. She told me everything was fine and she just 'doesn't the sensation of jewellery on her hands'. My wife has never liked rings and jewellery so this could be the case.

But when we are with friends, my wife will get upset if I talk about her as 'my wife' rather than just a girlfriend. She will go as far to interrupt me if I'm talking/telling a story to 'correct' me on our relationship. Initially, this was something our friends laughed at, but now everybody just finds it understandably awkward.

One of our friends was talking about their own wedding, which is scheduled for early next year. They asked for advice from my wife about how she'd planned ours and my wife responded with 'what wedding?'. When our friend continued talking about the table decorations my wife had used, my wife visibly teared up in front of the whole group and had to step outside.

Later that evening, I asked her directly if she has a problem with our relationship or if I'm doing something wrong in our marriage. She assured me that everything is fine between us. From my perspective, outside of this issue, our relationship is as strong as ever. We are considering kids in the near future, our sex life is great, and my wife recently suggested we get matching tattoos as a renewal of our love.

Is there advice anyone can offer on why my wife might be acting like this and what I should do?

ANSWER: You need to sit down with her seriously and make sure she's okay. This does sound like she could be having a break down and needs some help.

QUESTION: My wife gave birth to a (black)baby that clearly isn't mine, and I'm divorcing her. But I'm worried about the relationship between my two kids and their new half-sister.

A month ago, my wife gave birth to a black baby girl. We're both white, so she was forced to admit that the child was a result of a one night stand last year.

I've started divorce proceedings, although we're still living together for now. Between our two boys(aged 2 and 4, I've had paternity tests for them and they came back positive), her infant daughter and her having lost her job due to COVID, living together as amicably as possible until the divorce is settled is an unfortunate necessity.

Naturally I have no ill will towards the baby, and I've been disgusted by some of the comments I've heard from family members, friends, coworkers and others, all who seem to be fixated on the racial angle of this. As if the most salient part of this isn't that my wife cheated, but that she cheated with a BLACK man and that the baby is BLACK.

What really worries me is that my two sons might pick up on these narratives. They're too young to really understand what's happening now, but I'm worried that as they grow to understand the situation that they might grow to resent their half-sister for "breaking up their parents marriage". And worse that their resentment might express itself in a racist fashion, under the influence of the aforementioned racist narratives.

Any thoughts on how I should try to influence my son's away from that perspective? It probably doesn't help that we live in a suburb with very few black people and their half-sister is really the only black person my children know.

ANSWER: Hmmm I’m no parent, but I think telling the boys to love their sister no matter what, would do the situation some good. Or at least to keep that message consistent through their upbringing.

QUESTION: UPDATE :My (26M) girlfriend (25F) has grown distant after I got beat up defending a group of girls being harassed

First of all I want to thank every single one of you who commented on my last post. The love and support I received was immense and it actually made me feel a little better in the mess of it all. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. All of the following happened yesterday so excuse me if I ramble a bit , it's all fresh in
 my mind.

ORIGINAL POST
--------------------------
Mandatory:  I have been with my gf Sarah for 3 years and been living together for 1.5. She is honestly everything I have ever wanted and I planning on proposing somewhere next year.

So 3 weeks ago I was out with Sarah at a local bar drinking and having a great time with her as it was just after quarantine had ended where I live. At around 3 am we decided to head home. As we headed to the parking lot where we had parked we noticed a group of 2 girls and a guy who was clearly drunk trying to hit on them and get them to go to his house. The girls were clearly very uncomfortable and trying to find a way out. Sarah told me that we had to do something and I told her go call the cops and get someone as well because the very leat I wanted was her to get hurt during this.

So I approached the group and try to pretend I was the boyfriend of the one of the two girls and long story short I got my ass kicked. The guy was at least 6ft4 and 220 lbs where as I'm 5ft11 167lbs . I'm fairly mascular myself but there was no way I could have taken someone that big, I knew it from the start. At least from all the noise we had made a lot of people rushed the scene and the girls got away safe. I was rushed to the ER because the motherfucker had broken my ribs which had punctured my right lung. Yay.

After that incident Sarah has grown a distant from me. Even though she visited and stayed with me at the hospital she hasn't been the same since. And I thought she just needed time to move past this. However 5 days ago she told me that she is not the same person after what happened and she doesn't know if she feels safe with me after I got beat up like that. Honestly hearing that hurt me more than when I got my ribs broke. She has  moved to her parents for the time being and she told me she needs time. Meanwhile I had no one here to help me so my brother left his 2 boys and wife to move in with me. I know I'm just venting at this point but I don't want this to be over like that. Reddit is there anything I can do to salvage the situation?

UPDATE:
_______________

Until yesterday it had been 14 days since my last contact with Sarah. My brother had left 4 days prior because I felt bad keeping him away from his family for so long, plus I could take care of myself to some extent. So around 2 pm while I was making lunch I hear the doorbell ring. I go to open the door and there she is. Sarah. With tears in her eyes, eye bags, frizzy hair,looking like a total mess. During the time we've been together I've seen her in her ups downs but I'd never seen her in such horrible  state before. So I let her in she sits on the couch , we haven't still said a word as we were both dumbfounded. I was so overwhelmed by emotions, I wanted to hug her, I wanted to full on blast on her, I didn't even know what I wanted to do. So I did nothing and waited for her to talk.

After 5 or 10 minutes of silence she starts sobbing and saying she's sorry and, then full on crying. At this point I can barely hold myself together. So I hold her hand and  try to calm her down so I can figure out what is going on. After a while she finally somewhat calms down and starts talking. And that's where it got bad.

Something that I didn't include in the original post, because it wouldn't make sense to anyway is that Sarah's mother has been divorced and remarried once. From what Sarah has told me, her biological father cheated on her mother while she was still a kid and that's why they broke up. And that's also why she doesn't have any kind of relationship with her father. It seemed odd when I first learned about it, but I didn't question it. That is not the whole story though.

Sarah's biological father didn't only cheat on her mother. He was a drug addict pos, that also used to beat her up frequently. Without getting into a lot of graphic detail  in one instance when Sarah's brother tried to intervene and protect her mother he ended up getting beat up too. So when she saw me intervening and getting my ass kicked in the bar incident it triggered some kind of PTSD in her head that she could not control . That's why she had grown distant and eventually left. It all spiraled out of control and she could not handle it.

In those two weeks we'd been apart she'd barely eaten or slept and even made some really dark thoughts which I'd rather not go into. She told me is a horrible girlfriend for  leaving me alone in my condition and that she doesn't  expect us to be together again after that,which I told her  isn't the case.

So we have a very long road ahead of us. My number one  priority right is getting her to see a therapist, which I suggested we can do together if she's scared to do alone.

So yeah that's where we are at. Some of you were right, that there was some deeper issue behind what happened but I could not have possibly known.

I also wanted to take this opportunity to say something that I got messaged about a lot. I got a lot of comments and messages saying that I was a moron for what I did at that parking lot and that I should mind my own buisness next time and not play the hero, etc . First of all I did not initiate the fight with the dude. As I said when I got there  I tried to pretend I was the boyfriend of the one of the girls in case. When that didn't work I got between the girls and the dude trying to create some space between them and that's when he started to push me and eventually  started throwing punches.

Secondly no matter how hard I hit the gym I would never be able to take that guy one on one. As I said I'm pretty fit, and  I've been working out for several years but the fella was a lot bigger than me. Unless I had a gun or something, which isn't legal in my country I was doomed.

Finally  for the people telling me to mind my own business, well let me you that what exactly what I was doing. It is mine and everyone else's responsibility to look after the ones who can't protect themselves is this shitty world. No, I do not consider myself a hero, nor did I do it for the show. I did it because in some other instance one of those girls could have been my girlfriend, sister, mother needing help. And these girls  were somebody else's girlfriend, sister or mother .  If I was put in that situation a hundred more times I would  act the same.

Edit:I also talked to her about the proposal I wanted to make this year. I was planning on doing it as a surprise but in the way the things have turned out I figured it would be better if she knows it first. We both agreed it should be delayed for now.

ANSWER: As a girl, I want to thank you OP for standing up for the two girls. Not a lot of people would have done that, especially if they knew that they weren't as strong as the other person, and it takes a whole lot of courage. I'm glad they had someone to protect them and we really need more people like you

edit: thanks for all of the awards yall :)

QUESTION: UPDATE: I(24M) adopted my little sister(8F) after our parents passed away, GF(23F) isn't so excited about it

EDIT: Link to the original if anyone's looking: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/e1py86/i24m\_adopted\_my\_little\_sister8f\_after\_our\_parents/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e1py86/i24m_adopted_my_little_sister8f_after_our_parents/)

Hey people, it's been a while since my original post and I have some free time today and not much to do with it so I'm gonna write this, why not.

A lot happened since my first post, in the end, my GF, now ex I guess, couldn't deal with the fact that I had a new priority. I admit that I wasn't the best at managing time between them two and I would spend a lot more with my sister than my GF but I think that's understandable, maybe. In general, my GF was on and off with my sister, one day she would be the nicest person to her and the other would completely blow her off and be borderline mean. I had a few talks with her that it needs to stop, but it would only end up working for maybe the rest of the week and the next it would be back to square one. About three weeks ago it erupted into a big argument, she accused me of not loving her anymore, and that I play favorites. I told her they're not my children to be playing favorites and that obviously for some time my sister is gonna need a lot more attention, since you know she lost her parents. In the end, she went back to her ultimatum, sister or her. I was angry at this point, because she has been mean to my sister that day, and I told her she can pack her shit and find a place to sleep tonight. I haven't seen her since and quite frankly I don't really want to. We texted for a bit, basically both sides confirming its over and arranging when she can come for the rest of her stuff.

As for my sister, she's a lot better. She doesn't stay in her room all day anymore and she's slowly going back to her talkative old self. She still doesn't like being alone but it was the same before the accident, so since my gf moved out, we've been sharing a bed for comfort. She still wakes up at night crying sometimes so it's better when I'm there and frankly it's a lot more comfortable. One thing I really regret is my sister heard that whole fight and she started apologizing to me for breaking me and my GF up, I ensured her it's not her fault at all and if anything she helped me see for who my GF really was. She still goes to her therapist and it's really helped a ton, she doesn't need me to be there while she falls asleep and doesn't panic when I go to the shop for 15 minutes.

All in all, these past 3 months have been the hardest time in my life but eye opening to my ex's disregard for my family and kind of me too. Sorry for no happy ending, I guess this is how real life is.

EDIT2: I would love to thank everybody for kind words individually but with this amount it's crazy, so I wanna give everyone who gave me advice and kind words a HUGE THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY YOU'RE ALL AMAZING. These numbers are overwhelming and I can't even express in words how it feels that so many people care, it's really something else. Didn't expect that strangers on the internet could make me cry either, so once again a huge THANK YOU.

ANSWER: One of the most mature and sensible posts I have read in a long time.  How very lucky your sister is to have you in her life.  Keep guiding and supporting her in this exact manner and she'll be just fine!

QUESTION: My girlfriend told me she was with a friend, but that friend was with me picking out an engagement ring. How do I confront my girlfriend about her lie?

Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hjkgnj/update_my_girlfriend_told_me_she_was_with_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

God this is a doozy. I swear my life feels like a movie right now. Sorry for the weird formatting, I'm on mobile and this is my first time posting on a sub like this.

I (28M) am planning on proposing to my girlfriend of 3 years (26F). Now, I suck at picking out jewelry. Im the type of guy that doesn't see a problem with heart shaped jewelry (seriously why is it considered so ugly?) so every time I want to buy something for my girl, I usually consult one of our mutual friends. My girl's best friends are all friends with me as well and we all get along well, so asking them for help picking out jewelry is something I'm used to.

When it came time to pick out a ring, I consulted my girlfriends best friend Justine (fake name). Justine and I are quite close and she knows my girlfriend better than anyone, including me. So, when my girlfriend when out to visit her sister and baby nephew, I invited Justine over to the house to help pick out a ring.

Justine and I looked through a few catalogues, but decided it was a dead end and it would be better to go to professionals at a jewelry store. However, I didn't know when my girlfriend would be coming home, so Justine and I thought of a clever text to gauge how much time we had. I asked her when she'd be coming home, as I was ordering takeout and wanted to know when to tell them to have the food ready by.

She responded by saying it would be a few hours, she met up with Justine to go shopping. Now, obviously this took me by surprise since Justine was standing inside my house. I showed Justine the text, and she looked as confused as I was.

It isn't out of the ordinary for my girlfriend to meet up with people out of the blue like that for shopping, lunch, etc. She's a very spontaneous person and loves making plans on the fly. So ordinarily, I would have believed this text in a heartbeat. However, obviously this had to be a lie.

When she came home she acted completely normal, and I played along but it's been really hard to act like everything's fine. We got takeout, ate together, and cuddled on the couch after. So far she's caught on a little that somethings upsetting me, but I just can't tell her what. Looking at her kills me.

I don't know what to do. My girlfriend and I have zero trust issues and we tell each other everything, so this lie is killing me. I want to ask her about it so bad, but if I tell her I knew she was lying, I'd have to explain why, and I really don't want to do that. What do I do? I know she lied to me but I don't know how to confront her about it. Should I just forget it? This won't stop gnawing at me. Please help!

Edit: I'm sorry for the lack of responses, it's been a hectic day and there's a lot of comments. Thank you to everyone who has commented so far, I appreciate them all!!

Edit #2: sorry again for the lack of responses, guys. It's really been a crazy day. My parents are moving and I've been helping them. Also, I've never experienced this many comments on a post in my life!! I am going to talk to her tonight once we're both finally settled in after such a busy day, and I will update tomorrow.

ANSWER: I know you say you can’t tel her why you know, but I honestly think you should. You don’t want this to bug you forever and propose to a girl that could be potentially hiding something. Just say you were hanging out with Justine because you needed help with a gift, so you know she wasn’t with her. And see what she says. Trust and communication is important and it would suck to know you propose to a girl who could be doing you wrong, but also just as bad to sit there and let that lie eat you alive.

QUESTION: My (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before I get married.

My fiance proposed to me about 8 months ago. We decided on having a relatively small wedding which is in two days. Everything was going great. He seems absolutely perfect and we are very much in love.

I am a virgin and so is he, he wanted to save it for marriage and I wasn't fussed so I agreed to saving it. He has told me earlier that in his family the father checks the virginity of the bride the night before the wedding. I laughed this off as it seriously sounds like a massive joke. No turns out he was dead serious. He wants me, the night before to open my legs up in a small ceremony type thing so his dad can check me while him, his brothers and uncle can watch so that they know I am still 'pure'.

I told him fat chance I am going to do that and he was begging to me to go through with it and how important it is for him. He said he knew it was slightly embarrassing for me but his mom did and it will prove how much I love him and that I have nothing to hide anyway as I am still a virgin. I left and he was crying, it was very dramatic tbh.

I want to call off the whole wedding because of this and never talk to him again. But at the same time its only one thing and other then that we are genuinely perfect for each other and I dont want to spend my life with anyone else and it is very important to him and his family.

What the frick frack do I do. I am currently at my friends house and I might stay here for the night. tomorrow would be our last day as an unmarried couple and I am straight up panicking.

ANSWER: This "tradition" is disgusting.

He's essentially asking you to expose yourself to every male in his family. It's nuts. Not to mention reeks of control and abuse.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My (26F) boyfriend (35m) choked me until I passed out during sex, waited until he "finished" to check on me.

[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gnq99t/my_26f_boyfriend_35m_choked_me_until_i_passed_out/)

Before I get into anything, I am safe, and I am okay and recovering.

Thank you to everyone that commented and reached out to me. Your advice and words of wisdom meant so much to me. Well, everyone but the guy that messaged me to tell me that "guys won't like me" if I tell them why I broke up with my now ex-boyfriend.

I can't go into a lot of details, but the clinic I went to sent me to the hospital, where I had a full work up done, and met with a DV advocate and police officers. The scale of injuries were severe enough that I was granted an immediate order of protection.

This was the [last text message](https://imgur.com/a/yaI8A7X) I got from him before I changed my number. I have a feeling that many posters were correct, that this was the test to see how far he could go.

All of my big things are in storage at my parent's house, and I've been rotating between a couple different friend's houses the past couple of nights. I have plans to move a couple cities over, so I will be as far away from him as possible. My advocate set up an appointment with a therapist, and I met with her this morning.

I'm not sleeping much still, but I am surrounded by good people that will help me get through this.

Thank you reddit. The clarity you all gave me probably saved my life.

ANSWER: “No one can manage your chaos like I can” what a bullshit, CRINGY, young adult vampire romance novel-esque, I-got-this-quote-from-tumblr, wannabe dom, literally embarrassing thing to say. Apart from the final message (which is straight up evil and shows how inflated his sense of self importance is), that message alone has just given me secondhand embarrassment that I may never recover from. I might need to seek compensation from him.

But seriously I am super proud of you for fucking him off and recognising how messed up he is. Your life is going to be a million times better without him. You got this.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My fiancé (26F) and I (27M) decided to break up but she couldn't move out due to the lockdown. After about four months isolating with her, I've realized I don't want to break up anymore.

Original post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hmuoa5/my_fianc%C3%A9_26f_and_i_27m_decided_to_break_up_but/)

Although I didn't get to reply to any of the comments except for one, I made sure to read all of them in my main account, so I would like to thank everyone for their great advices. Here I am now, excited to tell what happened in the course of 5 days.

So the day after posting that, nothing really happened. I spent that day reflecting on what kind of future I see and want with her. I also thought a lot about the past; how we messed it up, how we both got too lost in our jobs... etc. In my original post, I asked if what I'm feeling could be just an infatuation that would go as quickly as I came. But I realized that my feelings for her never really disappeared to begin with. It's like my heart just went in a deep sleep and I forgot how much feelings I carry for her.

I think some of you may know (and have pointed out) that I'm not really good at communicating my feelings. I tend to keep things to myself, and my fiancé is one of the few people who can be patient with that. Some suggested to write a letter instead, or a note, or marry her in sims... I ended up with drafts of sappy letters that I ended up scraping and a sad attempt to recreate us in the sims. But still, I wanted to make an effort to show her what I couldn't say through words.

I've heard about her wanting a few DLCs in the sims in the past, so I had the idea to buy a few for her (sims' DLCs are pretty expensive especially in our currency..). Surprised her by stealing her laptop for a few hours and once I gave it back to her, she was elated and so happy. It was really nice seeing her get so excited over it. We played together that whole day and tried to solve the mystery in Strangerville (a game pack in the sims). It was so fun.

The next day, I found her in the kitchen trying to bake something. It was a blueberry cheesecake recipe she saw on youtube. I basically became her cooking assistant that day, helping her as much as I could and we ended up with a pretty decent outcome that I bet would've tasted better if I hadn't messed up so much. She still said she had so much fun and loved the cheesecake though.

The next day, which is just yesterday, something important happened. We were basically just snuggled up on the couch playing when our sims just autonomously "tried for baby" in the bed. It was hilarious and we initially laughed about it but then we got pretty silent. She then closed her laptop and hugged me tightly then, without saying anything. I think that was my realization that "oh, she feels the same as I do.." so I knew I had to speak up. I'm still impressed at myself for managing to talk yesterday without choking up, basically opening up the conversation like "are you planning to go to your parents soon?" and she said no, she doesn't feel like it yet. I asked her why, she told me she wanted to stay. I told her I wanted her to stay too. We went to sleep that night just huddled together. And even though we didn't really explicitly say it, I think we're now aware of each other's feelings and it feels like a really huge improvement to me.

Earlier we ate breakfast together. We weren't as chatty as we've been the last few months but the silence was comforting. We also watched "Knives Out" together. We haven't had \the\ conversation yet, but I'm going to bring it up to her tonight. I'm really glad this whole ordeal went much nicer than I expected it would and I'm relieved I didn't let my doubts get the best of me. Though I still have to get better with how I communicate things, I'm going to learn for her.

Thank you to everyone who left nice comments in my original post. I apologize again if there are any mistakes in my post, I'm not a native english speaker nor am I from the USA.

TL;DR: We both feel the same towards each other. We're yet to have the "talk" but I know now, without a doubt, that she still loves me, too.

Edit: last update in my comment https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqdh6u/comment/fxy0mgg Thanks everyone!

ANSWER: Okay hi. I posted this thinking the same people who saw my last post would respond, and seeing that a few users wanted an update back then, I thought what the hell, why not give them a little update right now and leave it at that. Now I have 5x more the audience I had the last time...

Right now my fiancé is sleeping next to me. Yes we had the talk. As soon as I posted this, I logged out and gathered myself so I can tell her what's been in my mind for months. It's not really something so 'exciting'. We basically just sat down together and talked about what went wrong before. I told her the things I said in my last post, and she admitted to worrying about what happens after the lockdown gets fully lifted too. We both acknowledged that we worked too hard to become financially stable so that we can get married. Right now though, all we could do is promise and talk about how we're going to manage our time better, since we have no idea if our country is ever going to return to normal (the curve is not getting flattened at all and the quarantine is about to get extended again). And then we talked about our feelings. I got to tell her I love her again, for the first time in years probably, and she told me the same. After that it was back to a lighter conversation, we basically just bonded until she fell asleep.

I honestly thought only a handful of people would see my post. I made sure to use reddit because this isn't really a big platform in our country and I was sure she wouldn't see this post, but now that there are like 20k upvotes as I'm typing this, I think she might stumble upon this post sooner or later... Well then, I know she's going to be whining a lot about this but she'd be glad to know that a lot of people found our relationship "wholesome".

Thank you all for the kind comments. I know some people are thinking "why haven't you just talked to her in the first place" but getting some perspective from other people really did help give a push. I think if I left myself alone with the thoughts I was having, things would've gone a lot worse, so I'm really grateful. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the awards I received since this is just a throwaway account though, but it's still cool. I'll try to answer as many questions as I can and then log out.

Thank you again :)

QUESTION: [UPDATE] I accidentally found out my (28M) fiancee (27F) has been creating erotic fan art/fiction for years. I am not judging but when i mentioned it to her, she became furious (i have never seen her so upset). I am really confused.

Doing this on a new throwaway because i cannot remember the password to my original throwaway account.

Original Post is Here: [OP](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g86svn/i_accidentally_found_out_my_28m_fiancee_27f_has/)

She came back after i sent a large apology message, apologizing for laughing at her fan fiction and it was not done out of malice and more out of awkwardness.

We had a long talk about it, i explained i wasn't that comfortable with her keeping such a large amount of her life secret/hidden from me. She also admitted that often times when she was saying she was working late in our home office what she actually meant was she was writing/drawing stuff and just wanted to be left alone.

I told her i had no problem with her hobbies, which made her happy. She also told me that she is so embarrassed because a bunch of it is self inserts of her, and some of it would make me unhappy reading it.

I asked her to show me, and she eventually agreed. I read some of it and it didn't bother me at all, (imo to me fantasizing about fictional characters isn't a huge deal as it is simply a fantasy and not real).    I asked if some of the things she writes are things that turns her on, and i told her i am willing to try anything at least once.

Yesterday night she actually sat down next to me, and started writing while i was next to her on the couch, and she didn't seem embarrassed at all anymore. So i guess this is good.

Thank you for your help.

TL;DR; Me and my Fiancee were able to work things out, and she isn't so embarassed anymore about it, and is willing to share with me. Thanks for the advice!

ANSWER: She was scared at how it would be recieved. I can admit that some of my past writing I'd be kind of embarrassed or ready to get made fun of for it. Some partners in the past have not been kind. You showed a maturity and a kindness to your fiancee that I'm sure speaks volumes in her mind. This is kind of communication and growth I wish more people had. Congrats.

QUESTION: My (28f) dog attacked my stalker after he broke into my house. Now my SIL (32f) says my dog is "too dangerous" to be around my niece (4f). Feel like I'm going crazy.

This is kind of a complicated story but I’ll just get into it. I used to be in this controlling, kind of abusive relationship. When I finally broke it off a year ago, my ex started showing up places, trying to get me to take him back. Eventually, it developed into full-on stalking. He would show up at my work (and took to just waiting outside of it after he was banned), leave notes on my car when I was at the grocery store, leave all kinds of flowers outside my house and then stick angry notes on my door after he saw me throw them in the trash, wrote me all kinds of weird, obsessive emails and letters. I’ve had to change my phone number three times. The behavior escalated over time, and got scarier/more threatening. In one instance, he started a small fire in my driveway but the police couldn’t get enough evidence connecting him to it. It was after that instance that I put cameras in my yard (I previously only had them pointing at my doors).

I was horrified to learn that the police couldn’t do shit about any of this until my stalker actually was caught doing something illegal, like breaking into my house. At which point, I might already be dead. I decided I wasn’t spending the rest of my life waiting for the other shoe to drop, so I got a handgun and a concealed carry permit, took some self defense courses, and started doing strength training. I also looked into getting an attack dog, but after all the money I’d sunk into my other methods of protection, they were prohibitively expensive. So I went to my local animal shelter and got the scariest, meanest-looking dog I could find. This is where Thor comes in. He’s a 100 pound American Bulldog, looks like he’d rip your throat out on sight, but is basically a gigantic teddy bear. He loves every person he’s ever met, is incredibly sweet and gentle with my 4-year-old niece, enjoys other animals, and even loves the mailman. I just kind of accepted that he probably wouldn’t do anything to protect me from my stalker, but it didn’t matter that much because having such a huge dog made me so much more confident. I brought Thor everywhere I could, and was working on getting him trained enough to be an emotional support animal, so I could bring him inside places with me (I absolutely would not do this until he was trained well enough to not disrupt a regular service dog).

Last month, I woke up in the middle of the night to Thor whining. I was groggy and thought he had to go to the bathroom, so I got out of bed and opened the door. At that point, my house alarm went off and pretty soon after that, I was face-to-face with my stalker. I started screaming and went to run for my gun. Before I could do anything though, Thor ran across the room in full attack mode. The memory is really blurry for me, but there was blood all over my living room and I remember my stalker was eventually able to escape, at which point Thor chased him outside and then came back to me.

When the police showed up, they said Thor was a hero who’d probably saved my life. I don’t want to list what they found in my stalker’s car after they caught him (and I’m shaking a little as I type this) but I’m sure he was going to bring me somewhere and kill me. It looks like he’s going to prison for a long time though, so my nightmare is over. Pretty much everyone in my life thinks Thor is a hero, except my SIL. She and my brother have a 4 y/o (the one I mentioned above), and she says she doesn’t want Thor around her (the child) anymore. She says since Thor has “snapped” in the past, he could do it again, so he’s not safe to have around kids (We used to see each other a few times a week before she decided Thor was dangerous). The way she words this makes me really angry because Thor didn’t “snap”. He saw a stranger break into his home, heard his owner scream in terror, and reacted to defend me, himself, and his house. Nothing about that screams “dangerous around children” to me, unless my niece is also going to break into my house and threaten me.

This is also a very emotional issue for me because Thor isn’t just a dog to me. He’s my safe place, my hero, the one who protected me and kept me safe when no one else could. I’ve also gotten increasingly anxious since this happened, and I can’t go anywhere without Thor. I barely leave my house, pay to pick up my groceries from the store instead of going in because I know Thor isn’t allowed inside, and all my friends know that if Thor isn’t welcome in their house, I’m not coming either (although they’re perfectly welcome to come hang out at my house instead). I am really going through it, and am working with a therapist to overcome this (luckily my office is still fully remote but I need to be able to go back to work once we’re in person again). But I really really need my brother and SIL’s support. I think my SIL thinks I’m just pouting and that’s why I won’t just leave the dog home and come over without him. I don’t know how to explain to them that the fear hasn’t stopped just because my stalker is in jail. It’s actually a lot worse than it was before. I’ve already suggested they come over and I crate Thor, but that wasn’t good enough for her. What can I do to make her understand the situation better?

tl;dr My dog took down my stalker after he broke into my house. Now I have severe anxiety and am too afraid to be without him, but my SIL thinks he’s unsafe around my 4 y/o niece. I don’t know how to make them understand that I really am too afraid to go anywhere without him and not just trying to win an argument.

ANSWER: Because there have been plenty of helpful comments already regarding what to do with Thor (great name!) and your SIL, I just want to make sure you’re also taking care of yourself. What you’ve been through is horribly traumatic that few people in the world have experienced. I know you’ve gone to great lengths to protect yourself with classes and the like, but now that the imminent physical threat is taking care of, it’s time to take of the emotional scars your stalker has inflicted on you.

Please seek out some trauma therapy. You deserve to be able to live without the constant cloud of fear hanging over you. Please seek professional therapy. You’ll thank yourself so much for being kind enough to take care of your mental health.

Best of luck to you and lots of pets for your perfect doggie!

QUESTION: My (39/m) husband wants to kick our (17/m) son out as soon as he graduates.

And I'm not so sure I agree. Our son is a senior atm but, he's expected to be graduating this year. He'll be turning 18 in August and that's when my husband wants to kick him out. He's persistent in his beliefs and unwavering he wants him to spread his wings, to handle life on his own. That also means we won't be giving him any sort of financial aid, etc.  It's not as if our son is lazy. He's a very hard worker and spends most his time cracking the books or at after school football practice. But, he wanted to hold off on College just until he can get a good idea to what he wants.  Personally, I found it very mature of him to want too but, my husband disagrees and thinks it's a sign of him being lazy and immature. We've been arguing non-stop.

My argument is so long as he is working and helping out what's the harm in him staying? Why should one be expected to abandon their kids the moment they've become adults? He's our only child; our baby. I want him to leave when he is ready. Why push him out so soon? I sort of feel that as a mother I've failed if I'm abandoning him so soon when he isn't ready.

ANSWER: I have a close friend whose parents did this to him after his 1st year of college. Completely shut off all financial aid or even communication with him, saying that "it was for his own good." 2 years later, someone who used to be the smartest and most hardworking person I knew is working as a pizza delivery driver and other odd jobs  just to make ends meet. He lives in a crappy apartment in the worst part of town. This is a guy who was the top of his class and voted most likely to become successful. If you want your son to have a good life, help him. That spreading his wings philosophy is bullshit, and in my opinion something that lazy parents use to get rid of their kids. Children are a lifelong commitment and investment, not something to be disregarded after 18 years.

QUESTION: I (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.

Throwaway, because reasons.

TL;DR: Found my gym socks in the garbage covered in poop. Asked girlfriend about it. She started yelling at me and crying and left.

I don't even know where to start with this. I'm dumbfounded. She just stormed out the house and I'm sitting on the bed asking myself A LOT of questions.

I live a pretty normal life, and I thought so did my girlfriend. We've been together for a few months and after things got serious, we moved in together. We started sharing a lot of the household responsibilities, but the one thing she was adamant on doing was the laundry. She would come home and find me in the bedroom getting the laundry together and would quickly ask me to go do something else. I'd come back to finish the laundry and she would have already started it. I always thought it was sweet and never her job to do it alone, but hey, if it makes her happy to do it all the time, I wouldn't stop her.

This is where it takes a turn for the weird. I keep all my socks and underwear in the bottom drawer of my dresser. I also go to the gym frequently, so I always keep a good supply of clean gym socks ready to go. I never kept count, but I know by just a visual glance I several pairs. This morning when I went to grab a fresh pair to pack for the gym, I noticed there were several dress socks, but no gym socks. Again, not weird, they must have been in the laundry. I went to check the laundry basket and it was empty, so I checked the washing machine and dryer. Both were empty. I couldn't figure out where all of my gym socks had gone. So, I did the very natural thing of asking my girlfriend what had happened to them. After all, she is the one who does the laundry all the time. She went silent, turned red and ran out of the room. When I went after her to see if she was okay she wouldn't talk to me. I told her I wasn't mad, I was just looking for my socks. She kinda mumbled "I'll don't know." I still wasn't mad, of course, but I was super confused. Socks just don't disappear. So I asked her again, even laughed about it and she just looked at me and got mad and said "I'll buy you new ones!"

The first thought that went through my head was she had somehow managed to destroy my socks while washing them. I thought the sight of that was actually pretty funny, so I joked with her about ruining my socks. Wrong. Thing. To. Say. She started immediately crying. Like, full on sobbing. At this point I don't care about the socks anymore, I want to know what's wrong with my girlfriend. I sat down next to her on the bed and put my arm around her and asked her of she was okay. She just kept saying she was sorry and that she would buy me new socks. I tried assuring her again it was okay. Even went so far as to say I would buy new socks and she didn't have to. I sat with her for a few minutes trying to calm her down and eventually had to get ready for work. I told her loved her and got my things together to leave for the day.

On my way out I grabbed the garbage to take outside. When I got outside I lifted the lid off the garbage can and I noticed a small plastic bag sitting on top of the garbage already in there. I could see through the bag (kind of the semi see through ones) there were socks in the bag. Since I was sure she had somehow managed to ruin the socks washing them, I wanted to see for myself. I opened the bag and immediately regretted my choice. There, inside the bag, were several pairs of my gym socks covered in what looked like poop. As soon as the smell hit me I knew it WAS POOP.

1. We don't own any pets.
2. We don't have any kids.
3. WHOSE POOP WAS ON MY SOCKS?

Work could wait. I couldn't go the rest of the day wondering why my gym socks were covered in poop and inside a plastic bag in the garbage can. I grabbed the bag and walked back inside. As soon as my girlfriend saw the bag she flipped out and started yelling at me. She said I shouldn't be going through the garbage and that I was disgusting for bringing it back into the house. I asked her to calm down and that I just wanted an answer as to why there was poop on my socks. I wasn't blaming her of anything, but she started accusing me of blaming her. That's when it clicked. I don't know what it was that lead me to ask this, but everything leading up to this moment had just been so crazy. I asked her "Is this your poop?" She started sobbing again and ran out of the house. I didn't go after her this time.

So, now I am sitting on my bed with a bag a poopy socks on the floor and a lot of questions in my head. The only conclusion is that she used them after going to the bathroom. Which that alone has its own set of questions above everything else. I sent her text asking her to come back. She hasn't responded yet. I don't even know what I'm going to say when (IF) she gets back.

UPDATE:

I had to leave for work and am now at work. Yes, I threw away the bag of poopy socks. She texted me back and she's clearly embarrassed, but felt she owed me an explanation. She said she didn't want to talk about it in person and that we could discuss it over texting and to NOT bring it up in person. I'm condensing the conversation and filling in some gaps as best as I can. Her responses are super short, but I'm getting the idea.

I flat out asked her if it was a fetish. It is not a fetish. She confessed to using the socks after going to the bathroom. I found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own. I had no reason to question the amount of socks she ever has because who pays attention to that kind of thing? She thought I would notice and think it was weird since she doesn't own many socks. She admitted she has done this for a long time. Her reasoning, as best as I can understand, is that because she is a germaphobe (her word) and she is afraid toilet paper will tear and is afraid of getting her hands messy in ANY WAY. She uses socks because it covers her entire hand. After she's done with them, she throws them away. She used mine because she didn't have other socks.

So, my girlfriend has a fear of getting poop on her hands so she wipes with socks, and has done so for a lone time. It could be worse, I guess. I hope we can laugh about this later. I'm trying to find the humor in it now, but I'm still weirded out.

QUESTION: My parents falsely accused my brother of being a creep and it's really affecting him.

My brother is 15, my sister is 17, and I'm 23f. This is really stupid and it shouldn't have happened but it did. Now I just want advice on how to make it better. Also this is the story my brother told me as I wasn't there.

He was in his room playing on his phone minding his own business. He got up to take out the trash. He came back to lay down im his bed. As he was laying down he noticed there dog walking out of his room. He ignored it.

Later on his sister 17 noticed clothes were missing. She went looking for it and found it in my brothers room. The problem was that is was wet and slimy. She immediately told our parents and they thought the worse. My dad, mom, and brother argued about it.

Rude things were said. Apparently mom said I knew you were weird but not this weird. My dad said I raised a predator. In the end my parents asked me to pick him up and let him stay with me for a couple of days. When I picked him up he didn't say anything and just sat in silence.

He spent the entire time in the room he was staying in. He only came out for dinner. He skipped breakfast and lunch. His eye's were always red when he came out so I assume he was crying. I've never seen him cry. Most of the time when he's upset he just has a stone face so what they said must have got to him.

Finally at the end of the week he's parents called me and said they wanted to talk to him so they came over. Before they came over I tried to talk to him but he ignored me. When parents came they apologised to him. Over the week they noticed more of sister clothes in his room until one day my dad caught the dog with my sister clothes.

My brother just said okay and went home. I tried to ask my parents if he could stay longer but they said that wouldn't be necessary. Later on I got a call asking me what did he do over my house because he's just been in his room all day at there house. Is there anything I can do to help him feel better?

Advice would be greatly unappreciated.

Edit little update:Good news. He can stay with me until Sunday. I had to lie a little to parents to get him to come. I told them he should get out the house because he spends most of his day sitting in one spot with online school.

They didn't believe me a first but I said it would be a chance to get him out his room. They finally agreed. He was about to go to sleep so I came just in time. I think the plan right now is to just spent time with him this week. I'm broke so it's gonna be mostly home stuff.

I tried to talk to him on the car ride. I asked him if he's okay. He said he's fine and we had a little conversation about his school. So at least he's talking now. He's in the spare room so everything is okay right now.

ANSWER: Your parents need to apologize to your brother PROFUSELY. Beyond that, I sadly have no other advice to offer. I can understand why he's upset.

QUESTION: My boyfriend (35m) drugged me (26f) with Benadryl because we got into an argument before our road trip and he wanted me to sleep the whole time.

Update: posted on throwramerr1 if anyone sees this, due to the 48 hour rule. Just wanted to go ahead and post and let y’all know I’m okay. 
 
Update 2: Here was the post that got removed

Holy shit, y’all. 
I haven’t been on reddit since I posted my original here and I did NOT expect this. I had to make an extra account with similar name to post because of the 48 hour thing, but I know a lot of people were genuinely worried about me so I wanted to go ahead and post an update (sorry if that’s not allowed).

Thank you guys so much, I can’t even believe the support/response I got. I ended up calling my brother and telling him about it and asking him how I should handle it, and he got in his car to come get me before I even finished telling him what all had happened. Him freaking out more than anything else made me realize that I wasn’t overreacting. I didn’t tell my boyfriend I was leaving until my brother was parked on the street and I just walked out with a few things. So now I’m in a messy breakup situation where he’s already tried to come by my moms house even though I told him I didn’t want to see him and that I’d get my stuff eventually, both from his parents house where he’s currently at and his actual house. Things are gonna be weird to figure out but I just wanted to let you guys know that I’m totally okay, thank you. I can’t reply to everyone who reached out/messaged so I hope you guys see this and know I appreciate it.

Monday we decided to make the 8ish hour drive back to our home state and quarantine there instead for a few months. Right before leaving, we got into a big fight because I wanted to stay at my mothers house for a while, he doesn’t want me to, among other things I won’t get into. Well, before leaving we decided to eat dinner so we didn’t have to stop anywhere.

Fast forward to our drive and not long after hitting the road I passed out. Don’t even really remember falling asleep. Woke up one time for a while, drank some Gatorade which he gave me, and then I fell asleep again. I thought this was extremely weird because I wasn’t tired hardly at all and we didn’t even leave super early. I kept commenting on how weird it was that I was tired the whole drive and slept 90% of it.

Yesterday the tension eased a bit and he made the offhanded comment that he wishes he could drug me more when I “act out” and argue with him. I ask him what he’s talking about. Proceeds to tell me he put Benadryl in my drink and that’s why I slept, so he didn’t have to deal with me. He literally said this as though it wasn’t that big of a deal! I’m still reeling from the conversation and completely floored. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or not but something tells me I’m not, and it’s extremely fucked up to put medicine in drinks. I don’t know what to do

ANSWER: Leave him. That is a very big problem. Now he knows how to keep you at bay, he may exploit it for his gain.

QUESTION: Me [52M] just found out at least 4 of my 5 children [33F][30F][28M][24F][14F] are not mine. Wife [51F] wont say anything.

Note: Please do not use ancestry kits as a paternity test. If you genuinely want to check your child is your own - get a proper paternity test at  your local MedLab (medical lab). Ancestry tests are not accurate, and should not be used to test paternity. In my case, it simply raised the alarm to get a proper test.

--------------

I apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. I posted this on  r/relationships but it was locked, and the mod suggested I ask on r/parenting. But I also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so I want to ask for advice here, too.

--------------------

First of all, I'm sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, I am not really in the best state of mind. My world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. I just want to write as much context as possible so I can get the best advice needed. For obvious reasons, I am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.

---------------------

Background: I met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. We have 5 beautiful children together - really, I consider them a total blessing regardless of what I'm about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago I thought that we had the perfect marriage. We were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, I feel like I've done everything a loving husband should do. I am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant I work long hours and maybe haven't always been there when she needed me, but I want to stress that I've never felt our marriage was in any trouble. And never in a million years would I ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she's always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.

Now, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. And the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested I was not her father. She confided this to me privately, showing me the results and I could tell she was visibly upset by this. Of course, the first thing I did was reassure her that no matter what, she's my daughter and I'll always love her unconditionally. But secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. It comes back and I am indeed not her biological father.

This news really broke me. I'm ashamed to say I broke down in tears in front of my daughter. The combination of finding out about my wife's infidelity and how upset I was making my daughter by how I was reacting. I really wish I had kept it in for her sake, but I didn't.

Following this I asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. I wanted to know the extent of my wife's infidelity - if it was a one off, I could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. However I didn't want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really I didn't think it was appropriate to tell her yet.

We tell the other three what has happened, I reassure them that I love them unconditionally and that I'll always be there dad, but that I need to know how long this has been going on. God, I can't begin to explain how touching their reaction was. They didn't care I wasn't their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken I was. I feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.

So we have paternity tests for each of the three done. Not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. Which somehow made it worse. It's like, she wasn't just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? I can't explain how this make it worse, but it just does.

So I confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. She doesn't confess. She doesn't even take it seriously. She says the tests must be flawed. All four? How the hell am I supposed to take that seriously?

I keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. When I bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. "We've been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?" etc. But how am I supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?

Now that I have rambled and explained what has happened. I guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice

1. How can I reassure my children this doesn't change anything between us? I feel like the way I have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times I reassure them.

2. How do I handle my youngest daughter? I feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and I will need to tell my daughter something. I don't want her to know the truth until she's older, but I also don't want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.

3. Is there anyway, anyway at all, you think I could or should save my marriage? I've been with my wife my entire life it's almost impossible to see a life without her. I know that the answer should be a clear cut "leave her", but we have 5 kids together. If there's anything that can be done to save our marriage, I want to consider it seriously.

tl;dr: Found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. Wife refuses to confess her infidelity. Unsure of how to do what's best for my children and marriage.

--------------------------

Edit: Thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. I have not replied to as many comments as I should have, but I've read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. I'll continue reading any comments or messages you send me. Again, I can't begin to thank you for all your support. If this is resolved I might post an update, but if she continues to lie then I don't think I'll bother, as there's not much more I can add. From the advice in this and the r/parenting thread I've decided to:

1. Get second tests just in case some freak accident has occurred.

2. Confront my wife with all four of my older children present.

3. Tell my youngest of the situation. Ask her if she wants to have a paternity test. It will be entirely her decision.

4. I'm 100% going to get some form of therapy. My mental state has really been deteriorating over the last couple of weeks, and I owe it to my kids to hold it to together.

5. Depending on whether my wife tells the truth, and what her explanation is (if any), I have not ruled out some form of counselling. But at the moment I think divorce is inevitable unless she changes her attitude drastically.

6. Contact a lawyer and prepare for divorce, if it comes to that

Once again I'd like to thank all of you for the time you took to express your support and share advice.

--------------------

Edit2: I guess I should clarify some things that people have been asking

1. How did the ancestry results suggests I wasn't her father? My family is entirely Irish. No relatives outside of Ireland other than my immediate family, and I even have the stereotypical red hair. My daughter's ancestry results showed nothing from the British isles/western Europe/northern Europe. That's what set off alarm bells, but it's by no means conclusive, hence the paternity tests.

2. Which two children share the same father? My two eldest daughters share the same father.

3. How did your wife conceive your children? Our eldest daughter was not planned. All the others were planned. Each time we conceived several months after we started trying. Our first three planned children were both our ideas, while she pressured me into having our youngest. She was in her late thirties and wanted one last child before it was too late, and eventually I agreed. She was conceived several months after we started trying, too.

4. Are you infertile? I don't know. I've never had a fertility test done. But the fact that none of our planned children are mine makes me think that I might be. I will have a  fertility test as soon as possible.

ANSWER: Ok wow, im sorry 
She refuses to address the situation? Have your children all confront her at once ... Intervention style

QUESTION: My (23f) boyfriend (24m) wants to move in with me. I want him to live alone first.

My boyfriend and I have been together 10 months. He lives with his parents (50s M+F) and younger brothers (10, 16, 18), no sisters. Before current events he was over my place basically every night. A couple nights ago he said that he wants to move in with me, if I'm up for it.

I've been to his place more than once, and I've seen how their dynamic works. His mother does everything for all 5 men in that house. Cooking, cleaning, the works. Basically all they have to do is put their laundry away after she washes/dries/irons/folds it. The reason the parents aren't forcing them to contribute is that this was the parent's agreement. He works, she's a stay at home, so she raises the kids/runs the household and he pays for everything, with one of the clauses being that as she's doing everything there's no need to involve the boys.

As a result, my boyfriend cannot do anything. I don't know how much of this is actual cluelessness and how much is him trying to get out of stuff, but he has told me, completely sincere (and I checked this with his mother), that he can't even fry an egg. Which is why, when my boyfriend suggested moving in together, I said I wanted him to live alone first.

His plan was basically to go straight from his mother's house to my flat. I told him my hesitation, which is that he can't do chores. He then offered to pay more rent (75%) in exchange for me doing all the chores. I said no. I don't want to be his mother, or his maid, I want to be his girlfriend.

Then I told him I wanted him to live alone. Go from his mothers house to his own place, figure out how to do all the things he's never done for himself, learn some basic life skills, and then revisit us living together.

This has caused a HUGE argument, biggest we've ever had. He's taken me saying he has no life skills as an insult, which it kind of was to be fair, and has basically said that clearly I don't want to live with him at all as I've pushed the moving in time back and have only said we'd "revisit" after a few months of him living alone, and I did say "revisit" because I wanted to make sure he actually knew what he was doing and wouldn't immediately switch back to offering more rent for no chores.

This was all a couple nights ago and he's just stopped talking to me. He's at his mum's, he's online, he's talking to mutual friends who have said he is responding, he just won't answer any of my calls/texts. He's told our friends what happened and they're all on his side, saying I was really mean/cruel. I love him, and I do want to live with him eventually, I just don't want to live with him if I'm doing everything, and the one thing I don't want is him paying extra for me to do all the housework.

Is there some sort of compromise, or some option I'm not seeing? What can I do to fix this?

TL;DR: Boyfriend is incapable of doing any household chores. He wants to move in together. I don't want to be his maid. We can't find a compromise and I would love any suggestions.

Update: he called me and agreed to talk. He then basically said that he was never going to be willing to learn to do anything, and even suggested dividing up the chores then I do my half and he hire a maid to do his half. Suffice to say this was something of a turn off and by the end of the conversation we broke up.

ANSWER: You don’t need to fix anything. Your boyfriend needs to learn to take care of himself, not just expect you to be Mommy With Benefits. If he’s insulted that you said he had no life skills, he should go get some. How is he not wildly embarrassed to be 24 and not do his own laundry, anyway?

QUESTION: [31M] Husband cheated on [27F] me with his fit and skinny gym friend

I came home from work early (I'm an OB nurse so my hours are pretty unpredictable) and found female sneakers in the garage that weren't mine. At that point, I sort of already knew what I'd be walking into. My husband has recently become very fit and has been consistently going to the gym, during which he made a female friend who he even brought home for dinner last week. She's beautiful and thin and everything I am not, which instantly made me feel horrible. So, I talked to him about it. He encouraged me to build my confidence and reassured me he loved me and would always be loyal to me.

I walked into the laundry room from the garage and sort of tiptoed around the house before going upstairs. They were having sex. In our bed. With a framed picture from our wedding above the nightstand next to it. I silently left the room and got back in my car with tears streaming down my face and drove to get food and just sat in my car crying since. Its now almost 1am (walked in on them at 7pm) and I've returned to the hospital. He called me asking why I wasn't home and I told him my shift is extended but in reality, I'm laying in one of the on call rooms bawling my eyes out as I type this.

I feel so worthless and ugly and stupid. I don't even know how to proceed. On one hand I want to divorce him and never see him again, but on the other hand, I'm an ugly woman....its not like I can do better. I just want to die. I feel so gross and the self-loathing is getting too much right now. Advice please.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for the kind comments and support. Please stop commenting, however. I think I've heard just about everything (including some horrible things about my weight). I don't care about "internet points" or whatever and the notifications are getting crazy. Reading through these comments has been a nice way to keep myself sane these past few hours. I still have no idea what I am going to do and I know everyone wants me to leave, but a marriage is more than can be illustrated with a couple of words on a website. He was a great husband and I can't help but feel at fault for neglecting myself weight-wise. I don't know if I will stay, but that's all I really know right now.

&#x200B;

Edit: I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did and while I'm incredibly grateful for all the nice and supportive comments...please please please stop messaging me about how I should stop eating or laugh at me for expecting a faithful husband while being overweight. It is incredibly upsetting and I am already going through a lot. I feel I need to clarify since everyone seems to care that I had food after I found out. I had been working a shift from 7am to 6:30pm during which I had been all over the place. I had lunch at 11am and nothing else until I left. I was starving and hurt and driving around with tears streaming down my face. Please stop harassing me about that.

ANSWER: When you see a woman that you don’t find particularly attractive or skinny walking down the street with her partner, do you think “she deserves to be cheated on?” I really don’t think so. You wouldn’t be this mean to anyone else, so why treat yourself this way?

QUESTION: UPDATE: My (40m) ex wife (40f) wants me to be with her in her last days

Link to my first post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ieage6/my_40m_ex_wife_40f_wants_me_to_be_with_her_in_her/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Quick recap: My ex wife, who Ive known since I was 10, cheated on me but is now dying and wants me to be around before she dies.

It's been almost 3 weeks since I've posted and a lot has happened since. I got some solid advice from a lot of you guys, especially some who messaged me their personal experiences. I'd like to thank you guys from the bottom of my heart.

So here's what happened...

As many of you guys suggested, I talked to my wife. We had a long discussion about the whole situation and I assured her that no matter what, she is and always will be my first priority. I also assured her that while I wanted to say my good-bye, I would never act like her husband. It would be more like me seeing a childhood friend or something like that. I also told her I would never spend the night nor would I be alone with her.

She was more comfortable after our talk and was pretty ok with the idea of me seeing my ex again. As you guys guessed, she really felt like she was forced into being ok with it when my sister asked but this time, she really was ok.

So I talked to my sister and after a long, long heated discussion about what my "role" would be in the visit, she agreed to the boundaries my wife and I set.

A week later my sister and I came over to our old marital home. It was surreal cause while the emotions from years before came back to me, I didn't feel any sadness nor hatred or anything negative. I saw my ex, who was waiting for us in the living room and she cried when I walked in. Most of you suggested she was faking it but while she was still strong, you could tell almost immediately something was wrong with her. I indulged her with a hug and we talked for a few hours while my sister made lunch. I showed her pictures of my kids and told her stories about what they're like. Honestly, I didn't know how I would react after I saw her again but it just feels like seeing an old friend you haven't seen in a long time. There was no hate or anything like that.

I walked around the house and it was pretty much the way it was when I left over a decade ago. Im not really sure how I feel about our wedding photos still framed and pictures of us still all over the house but it wasn't really my place to say anything.

The three of us had lunch and played board games all afternoon. It honestly felt like we were back to when we were kids and the three of us would hang out together. It was nice.

I left at around 6. She was sad but she understood. When I hugged her good-bye, she whispered "I love you" to me but then said how she's happy I was able to find the happiness she couldn't give me. That part got to me to be honest and I was fighting back tears. I told her I'd see her again soon and she asked if I could bring my kids next time. I told her I would and left to pick up dinner for my family.

I told my wife everything that happened and she was quite happy about the outcome. I guess it helped that I brought home her favorite food but she also agreed to let me bring the kids next time.

Overall, it was a great experience seeing her again. I feel like I needed that and would've regretted not doing so.

Again, I'd like to thank everyone who gave me advice. Also, please don't roast my ex too much. She made a mistake and paid the price but it doesn't mean shes an evil person.

This will be my last update. Thank you very much, reddit.

ANSWER: As you noted in the OP, you were over the marriage.  No reason not to be there for a friend.  I'm glad you went through with it.

QUESTION: My(26M) gf(24F) told me she is pregnant but I am sterile

I am from a SEA country and my first language is not english.

Backstory: I got into an accident after my college and will never be able to have kids. None of my family members know of this. They know about the accident but not about this. I have always wanted to be childfree so it did not affect me much mentally.

I have finished my Masters Degree last year and never dated before. I got a very high paying job directly through campus placements. My parents immediately wanted me to get married after getting a job but I wanted to work on myself and explore a bit. They said no and I said that it was my wish. All my life I did what they wanted and for the first time when I talked against them, they were not happy. This was last year and they gave up after covid started.

So I picked up some dating apps and went through them but no luck. Then my parents introduced me to a family friends daughter and we clicked kinda. Looking back, I was a fool. She said yes to anything I said and never complained about anything. I felt kinda weird about it. I wanted her to express her interests but she always said she was interested in whatever I do. Well, i did not think much about it.

I said that i wont have kids ever and she surprisingly said ok. I was like damn, she is probably the one as it is very hard to find a partner who is childfree in my country (or atleast i thought), but we were in the initial stages and I have not told about my accident. Long story short, we had sex a month ago, i used condoms because safety first. The next day on, she started ghosting me a bit. I thought it was due to my performance in bed and wanted to give her some space. Then she texted infrequently and only replied OKs and Ks and one line answers. I thought maybe she wanted to end the relation and was sad but left it at that.

Yesterday, all her family came to my house and she claims shes pregnant and the father is me. Needless to say, I freaked the fuck out and wanted to collapse on the ground. I did not say anything while they were talking about marriage and stuff that needs to happen because I got her pregnant.

Please advice me on what steps to take now reddit

UPDATE: Let me start off by saying im very very grateful for all the redditors who took their time to read and give me advice. I was overwhelmed by the amount of comments and how many of you said it might not even be my kid. Looking at it from a different perspective gave me much more insight on the whole situation. I called my boss and took today off.

I called up some clinics to get tested and was given a slot on Friday afternoon. Then I went to the store and bought some pregnancy tests and asked only her to come to my place tomorrow ( i.e today morning). I also called my parents and my before I said anything, my mom asked me if I had any good news, I was shocked by what she said and asked me what exactly she was talking about. She then played dumb and I knew that the situation was more fucked that I thought. I cut the call and cried all night till 3am, grown ass man crying for the first time since 8th class.

She came today morning with her parents even after I told her to come alone. They were under the impression that I was gonna discuss engagement plans with them. I told them to wait outside and called her in and they threw a fit. I told they can all go back or let her alone come in, they said ok.

I took out the pregnancy tests and gave it to her and told her to prove that she was actually pregnant and told her where the bathroom was. She started screaming at me(never done this before, I was shocked at this), then she went out the door and called her parents in. Now everyone is screaming at me in my own home because I asked her to prove the pregnancy not even a DNA test. I told them all to fuck off and one hour later my parents and they all came to my home and they spilled the beans. She was never actually pregnant(as many redditors said), my parents were afraid that I was getting old for marriage and wanted me to marry and give them grandchildren. They said that in arrange marriages, no need for the people to actually get to know the spouse because parents choose only the best for their kids. They planned this all and were only waiting for me to have sex with her to do this. I broke down and cried again. All my life, I did exactly what my parents wanted, always scored high and never asked for anything. I told them to get out and never talk to me again in between crying and they said parents know whats best for their kids and I should do what they say. Then I got extremely angry and told them to fuck themselves in my native language which was very bad. For once, I think they knew I was serious with them and they all left. I blocked them all before sending my parents a message to never again contact me in my life even if one of you is dying.

Cried for some more time, went through some dog videos and went through all my messages on reddit and I feel like I owe you guys this update because it was you guys who helped me do this. That is all and I hope you have a wonderful day.

ANSWER: 1.  Get tested to see if you are sterile 
2. IF she is pregnant get the baby tested
3. Make plans accordingly if you are the father or not.
4. On a final note... you may need to step away from your family for your own health.

QUESTION: [UPDATE]My (33m) wife (32f) said her ex’s name while we were having sex

[Here’s the original post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i6li7j/my_33m_wife_32f_said_her_exs_name_while_we_were/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Thank you everyone for your help and advice. I did my investigating before talking to her. I went through his social media first but nothing explicitly saying anything was going on. There were a few mentions of “his love” in some comments but that could mean anything.  I did look at the phone bill and there looks to be calls with him pretty regularly.

On to hers, I was able to get on her phone when she was asleep. (She must of forgot I knew the code) Nothing in texts and no weird calls. (So she deleted them) I did find some apps she tried to keep “hidden” like Snapchat and Kik. Sure enough, there’s their conversations. And pictures. (I took pictures of all of it on my phone to have as proof) She exploded when we had the conversation and left with our child to her mothers.

I contacted a lawyer and am in the process of a divorce and figuring out custody. I’m heartbroken and am more angry than anything else. I’m angry at her but I’m also angry at myself for dismissing so many red flags.

ETA The conversations I found were confirming they were having an affair. The pictures were ones they were exchanging, including nudes

ANSWER: Don’t feel bad about missing red flags. You give the people you love the benefit of the doubt because you trust them. And she betrayed that trust. So don’t go blaming yourself because you didn’t do anything wrong, she did.

QUESTION: (Update) My [21M] girlfriend's [21F] grandfather is a Michelin Star chef and is visiting. I am supposed to cook for them but I cannot cook. What the fuck am I supposed to do?

[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hccy33/my_21m_girlfriends_21f_grandfather_is_a_michelin/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

Hey guys. Thank you all for your advice. My gf's grandfather came and we had our dinner yesterday, so this is an update to that post. I just want to say first, I am drunk, so please excuse any typos.

Anyway, I was really freaked out all summer about wanting to impress him. I was seriously considering  pulling the Skinner scam and buying takeout and disguising it, but I decided to just go for trying to make something myself. I spend pretty much all of July trying to make steak. I started with cheap stuff, and it was really, \really\ hard at first, but I learned from my mistakes.

I wanted to go all out, so I bought really nice steak to make when the day came. I made three. One for all of us, and it ended up being better than I hoped, though obviously not Michelin Star quality. I also brought some really expensive (at least for a college student) Cabernet to pair, although he actually brought rum, so we had both. It's around midnight on August 16th here in the Eastern United States; this happened on the evening of August 14th (he came early due to changes in our school schedule). He said that the steak was nice. He and I went out for burgers and hotdogs the next evening (today, but technically actually yesterday). It was just him and I. We also had a metric fuck-ton of beer. All in all, it was a really positive experience, and we got along very well. I'm glad I didn't risk trying to pass off steakhouse food as my own, though I still want to try to see if I can fool my professor's friend. Maybe after the pandemic has passed (grandfather, gf, and I all got tested before meeting for dinner).

I really love my girlfriend :)

ANSWER: So glad you didn't try to fake it. Holy shit that would have been bad, and you would have had to live with the deception. Congratulations, and good work!

QUESTION: Update: My sister (F22) ripped up my(F19) Stan Lee autograph and I haven't forgiven her even tough our mother (F46) is pressuring me to

Thanks for the great advice. So a lot has happened after mom and sister left and we took the money that was menat for my sister's car down payment for the restoration.

My grandma called me and asked what was happening.

I explained to my grandma what happened and tried explaining who Stan Lee was. Surprisingly she understood just perfectly. I was relieved. For a moment I thought that my dad and I would get shit from everyone.
My sister started giving me shit about telling our grandma and being a "snitch". I told her that she asked me and I just told the truth.

But what took the cake was that my sister apparently ranted in her friend group chat about me and how she couldn't understand my behavior. She again ridiculed my hobby and so on. One of the dudes was really pissed and they had a big argument in the gc. The dude was so mad that he posted the screenshots in his insta story and they spread like wildfire. She is now being ostracized by our community with a few exceptions.

My mom and sister came back in the morning. They didn't talk much to us . My mom  came in my room and asked if we found somone that restored the picture. We had a short dry conversation till she asked me why I was making such a big deal about it. And I shut her up like you guys told me to. I started by explain who Stan Lee was, how long the painting took me, how much it meant to me, equated it to the monetary value and ended it with "it is not only about the autograph. It's about the disrespect you both showed me and how little you seemed to care about me. You said that it was not worth it to destroy family over materialistic things but your daughter destroyed my most valuable possention because I didn't lend her my jacket "

Ya'll my mom cried. She apologized profusely. She said she just didn't know how to deal with it and just wanted the tension to be over and as I was more cool headed than my sister she selfishly expected me to be the bigger person.

My mom and dad are now talking to my sister very seriously because she has yet to apologize for everything.

ANSWER: I'm glad your mom came to her senses. I hope they stop supporting your sister and make her act like an independent adult.

QUESTION: My husband is mad that I let my 16 year old son bathe our 2 year old daughter.

Last night I had a really bad migraine and my husband was at work. I asked my son(16m) if he could give his sister(2f) a bath since my head was killing me.

He was perfectly fine with this and when my husband got home he found me asleep. He woke me up asking if I had made dinner or given our daughter a bath yet. I told him that I had a migraine so our son gave her a bath. He screamed at me saying that this was not ok for him to do unsupervised.

He said that my migraine was no excuse to not take care of her. Then my son hears him yelling at me and tries to get him to stop. He hasn’t spoken to either of us since, what should I do

Edit my son is not related to my husband

ANSWER: I had a 2yo sister when I (M) was 16. I changed her diapers, gave her baths, etc. This should not be a big deal.

Edit: Somehow I'm the top comment, but [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h7nxf4/my_husband_is_mad_that_i_let_my_16_year_old_son/fumip08?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) has extremely useful, important information for this situation.

QUESTION: My little sister just told me that our parents said that they regret having her

I(20m) have a younger sister(6f) and she always hangs out with me whenever I’m home.

Yesterday I was playing video games and she walks into my room crying. I ask her what’s wrong and she said that our parents just told her that they regret having her. I confront my parents about it and they said that they find her extremely annoying and that if they knew that she would be like this they have aborted her.

The part that pisses me off the most is that the reason they think she is annoying is that she is mentally slow and often doesn’t understand certain things. We got into an argument and afterwards my sister wouldn’t leave my side. They want me moved out within 2 months but I don’t know how my sister will handle not having me around to comfort her.

I’ve been extremely worried about leaving her due to the way she gets treated, what should I do

ANSWER: Something's wrong with your parents to say that to a six year old. Do you have some close relatives to talk to?

If you move out can you reside nearby? Your parents may be willing to let your sister visit often or spend the weekend.

Children can grow up fine even if there's just one person who cares about them and makes them feel loved.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] Mom had an affair 18 years ago, I [18M] am the product of it. My dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.

The reaction to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ca66sv/mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am_the/) put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on me to write this update.

I am not sure if it's what's you want to hear, but things are more or less back to a "normal" state, if you consider other events.

Unfortunately, my grandpa died at the beginning of this week, and I am still processing it.

I did manage to talk with both my mom and dad, and I know where I now stand in relation with them, as well as my siblings.

I am not sure I would have had the courage to say what I had to say if not for the amount of help and advice in the comments.

I think it is safe to say both my parents love me, and what happened two weeks ago was an overreaction to a fight between my parents. It makes me uncomfortable knowing I am not aware of my own environment, but a stranger in the comments can tell me what's happening in my life with only a few lines of text from my side. A lot of comments were spot on about what is happening in my life.

I have so far went through 40% (I estimate) of the comments, but I have given up, there are too many for me to keep up with.

The conclusion is that I am definitely going to college, it will be the college I have always wanted to go to, and I will have the same experience as my siblings. The money to pay for all this already exists, my family is not going bankrupt as suggested, my dad just had a mental breakup with all the issues around my grandpa and his fight with my mom.

Even if my dad would have went through with his decision, my grandma let me know my grandpa left me and my siblings a sum we will have to split between the three of us, but enough to put me through college.

What started the entire scandal was poor timing on my part, my parents just had a fight, and then I showed up "hey, pay for my college".

My parents were talking about us, their children, and mom said something to the lines of "to think you wanted to split up when I came back pregnant", or something like that, I was not there, this is what she told me. I guess dad was talking how proud he was of his children, and mom wanted to express her "gratitude" for dad raising me as his own, and dad took it as "the affair was the best decision I ever made" or something like that. And their fight escalated from there, and mom told dad something like "what makes you think any of them are yours".

Yeah, it went downhill from there fast. Shortly after that my dumb face showed up, and here I am.

Dad and mom have since made up, mom is still a mess, dad is not handling my grandpa's passing away too well either.

I did talk with my siblings, and my sister raised a storm and rode it here while blasting my parents on the phone, ha ha. My brother was calmer, but made his feelings known in no uncertain terms as well once he got back home.

My grandpa passing away sort of kept spirits calm, I guess, and shifted the focus to dealing with that.

Reading the comments was a mind opening experience. I felt unprepared for the world out there. Many have asked how I had no idea how to apply for loans or grants. Well, in my defense, when you go year after year after year knowing you have nothing to worry about, that your college as good as paid for already, you don't really have to worry about anything else. Of course I knew there are loans and other things students have to be aware of, but it didn't apply to me.

I went from "I am going to college, can't wait" to "you're not my son and I will not pay for your college" in less than 24 hours.

Others have been prepared for this, at the very least they knew they had to get a loan, or get a job, look for a place to live, and so on. For me it was a sudden change in reality.

Going through the comments I managed to put a list together with various "tips and tricks", what jobs are available for students, how to find a place to live, how to get a credit card, a bank account, a cell phone plan, and so on. Really good stuff that I think, even after the return to normal, will help me.

My parents have been called more names then they go by, and that was uncomfortable to read, and I haven't even read all comments. I can't even imagine what else lies in the comments, waiting.

Dad is very sorry, apologetic, about his reaction and behavior. I understand his reaction, but I still feel hurt by it. I understand he was not in the best place of mind, but I can't control my feelings either. We will be alright, and this hasn't irreparably damaged our relationship.

Mom hasn't handled everything that well. But she is coming around, and she answered some more questions for me.

When mom had an affair years ago, and got pregnant with me, my parents started divorce. Mom moved in with the man she had the affair with, but after a few months that guy decided he wants nothing to do with it. He kicked mom out, and she had nowhere to go. So my grandparents took her in, because she was still the mother of their ~~nephews~~ grand kids (I am getting a lot of heat for this "mistake", but know in my family's culture, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well). Mom and dad got back together, after a lot of work, dad took me as his own, and that's my life since then.

The man who is my natural father is not in the picture any more. Dad didn't really know who he is, and mom hasn't heard or seen him ever since. He was fully aware mom was pregnant with his child, I guess he had more important things to do. But it doesn't sound like he was about to cure world hunger, she met him in a bar, not at a fund raiser.

And I don't feel a need to know any more about who he is. I thought about the matter the last two weeks, since I've been aware of everything, and haven't really felt a desire to know who he is, where he is, if he is still alive, if I have other siblings out there.

I was suggested to go and buy a DNA kit from 23andme, maybe I can find him that way, but I think I will avoid doing this specifically so I don't find him or he finds me. As far as I care, I have a mom and dad and a brother and a sister, and that's my family.

Moving forward I do plan of getting a job, and becoming more independent, but not in an attempt to distance myself from my family, but to feel like I would not be lost in the world if my family suddenly disappears.

My mom admits I've been babied way more than my siblings, and that they should have prepared me more for what's coming next.

I did learn where I stand with my family, and it's safe to say that I am loved, and I have options. I thought I am isolated, but my world is wider than I thought. Grandparents, siblings, my aunt, my cousins, all have my back.

I think my parents are human, and they make mistakes, and even though this was not their greatest moment, I think I will look at everything as nothing more than a weak moment in an otherwise wonderful relationship.

Thank you.

Edit: in my family's cultural background, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well. Stop calling me names, it was not a mistake, please.

ANSWER: Sorry about your grandpa, but I'm relieved it ended on a good note.

It looks like you've already sorted out how you are gonna deal with this from here.

Thanks for the update and good luck!

QUESTION: UPDATE: My wife gave birth to a (biracial)baby that clearly isn't mine, and I'm divorcing her. But I'm worried about the relationship between my two kids and their new half-sister.

Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/in7j0h/my\_wife\_gave\_birth\_to\_a\_blackbaby\_that\_clearly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/in7j0h/my_wife_gave_birth_to_a_blackbaby_that_clearly/)

&#x200B;

Unfortunately my last post was locked, but I received a lot of helpful PMs from people. I'm particularly thankful for those who've lived through a similar situation(or have family and friends who've done so) and sent me advice on how this affected them and how to navigate the situation. I'd also like to thank the hundreds of mouthbreathing bigots who spammed my inbox.

The big takeaway for me was that if I'd need to lead by example here, not excluding her in any way because of her paternity so that she and my sons would see her as a full member of the family. Also that I need to be more active in confronting the bigoted and ignorant nonsense I've been hearing, and teach my sons to do the same to protect their sister. I've spoken to some of those responsible since and made clear my feelings on this, and that she is to be treated as a member family, and that if I ever find out that they've said things like that to my sons or their sister that they won't be allowed around us anymore.

I've spoken to my wife about this, and we're more or less on the same page. She's been begging me to forgive her and not go through the divorce, but that's not going to happen. Even if I didn't consider the cheating unforgivable, I just dont feel any love for her any more, other then a platonic affection for her as the mother of my children.

My sons are handling this as well as can be expected. The 4 year old doesn't fully understand, but is upset by the change in the household, thankfully he's easily distracted. The 2 year old is thankfully too young to comprehend what's going on, but has definitely picked up on how withdrawn his mother has become. They're both fascinated with their new little sister, so there's that silver lining.

My wife OTOH isn't in good shape at all. She was depressed even before the birth, and now with everything- our divorce, her infidelity being revealed and the backlash from family and friends, PPD, and the exhaustion from raising an infant- she's barely functional. She's seeing a therapist, and I've been pressuring some of our family and friends to be supportive of her because even if they think she deserves it her current state is making it harder for me and our children.

It's become very obvious to me that even after the divorce is finalized we're going to have to live together for a while longer. She's in no shape to be taking care of three kids without someone else around to support her, and I'm not willing to deprive her of her sons by seeking sole custody. It's also too difficult financially, since she's lost her job because of COVID.

As for the baby girl, she's healthy and fairly easy by baby standards. Since I've been helping care for her, I've bonded with her and I've discussed the possibility of adopting her with my wife. She can't contact the father, as the only thing she knows about him is his first name. And given our coparenting situation it feels like adopting her as my daughter would be the best outcome for all involved-

HOWEVER, there's been a wrench thrown in that plan. It was brought to my attention that there may be a way of finding the baby's father, namely by having her DNA tested by AncestryDNA. If the father or one of his relatives has also taken the test, we may be able to find him through there DNA match database.

If I'm being completely honest I'm not happy about this. I've already started to think of the baby girl as my daughter, and having him in our lives would massively complicate the family dynamic. Plus we live in Seattle and she met him in Philadelphia, so god knows how they'd even make it work if he wanted to be the kid's father.

However, I recognize that this is a selfish reaction. If we have a chance of finding her biological father we owe it to her do so, if only so that she has access to her paternal medical history and so that she can have a relationship with him if and when she chooses to do so. I've read a few accounts by children raised by non-biological parents and a common thread is their desire to meet their lost biological parent, so thats that. We've ordered an AncestryDNA kit for her, and I guess we'll decide our next steps once we get the results back in a couple of months.

ANSWER: The way you’re dealing with this with a level head is commendable and that child is very lucky to have you. Many people wouldn’t respond how well you are and you deserve a ton of credit for that. Your life was thrown upside down and you’re still putting the baby’s best interest first.

I hope everything works out well for you. You deserve that.

QUESTION: My (20F) boyfriend (20M) said that I was embarrassing him while I was giving birth to our baby

Update post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hv4wc1/update_my_boyfriend_said_that_i_was_embarrassing/fyt0y1e/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

We have been in a relationship for 1 year and we had a baby boy last week. I had a natural birth and my bf was there throughout the whole process. I screamed A LOT and each time I did he whispered something like "can you stop screaming, you're really embarrassing me". I also threw up a few times and I saw him cover his face in shame. When I held the midwife's hand for comfort he whispered "let go of her, stop being so embarrassing". He also said that my birthing position was embarrassing and called me a few vulgar names.

I'm really upset about his behaviour that day, especially when it was when I needed his support the most. When  I try to talk to him about it he denies ever saying it and that I'm being silly...

Edit: I know that there are a lot of comments but I am reading them all, and I just want to thank everybody for the advice and support so far. :) 
I spoke to my mum about this but she is the very traditional type and although she said his behaviour is wrong, I should try couple counselling first. I really don't think he is going to listen to me when I suggest getting help but I'll try. I am also going to talk to my public health nurse.

Edit 2: Thank you so much to everybody who commented and dmed me with words of support and those who have also been in similar situations. I have since tried to discuss the option of couple counselling to him but to no avail, which didn't surprise me. My mum has agreed to let me stay there until I can find a new place for myself and baby. I haven't said anything to him yet, I've been advised not to so I am still planning out how I am going to take the next step.

ANSWER: I'm surprised your midwife didn't tell him to leave the room when he was acting like that.  I'd hate to see how he copes with a crying baby.  Keep your eye on him, seriously.

QUESTION: (update) Boyfriend (18M) is upset that my (18F) brother (26M) didn’t let him spend the night with me when I was very drunk and passed out.

First post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i3il7r/boyfriend_18m_is_upset_that_my_18f_brother_26m/

Based on the advice of you guys, my parents and my brother, I broke up with my boyfriend.

So I asked my boyfriend what he expected to happen that night if he was allowed to spend the night with me. He repeatedly said nothing but let slip that maybe he hoped we’d have sex in the morning. So you guys were right, he wanted to have sex that night with me and he probably would have if he was allowed to spend the night with me.

Even the thought of it gives me a lot of stress. I always knew rape is a danger a lot of women (and men) face, but never felt it so close to me. Maybe because I’ve always been with people I trust. I don’t know. I never thought it could happen so easily to me. It would have happened to me that night if my brother hadn’t protected me the way he did.

I’m going to be a lot more careful about my own safety from now on. I won’t be as trusting to strangers and I’m now learning my drinking limits so that I won’t overdo it especially where I might be vulnerable. My brother also told me to never accept a drink from the people I don’t 100% trust.

Thanks reddit!

ANSWER: Yeah he was. In the end he was angry that I was accusing him of something, I had to block him he was texting me non-stop.

QUESTION: I(23M) found a sextape on my girlfriend's(23F) phone. And it wasn't ours.

I've been dating this girl for over 5 years. She's very special to me. Even at this point, I can't help but hope she's not too worried about why I've been acting so oddly. I honestly was planning to marry her sometime in the future as soon as we settled into our adult lives.

One day we were chilling at her house when I asked her if she could send me the funny picture she took earlier that day of one of our puppies. She was busy on her pc so she told me to just grab her phone to send it to myself. When I went into her phone gallery I noticed a "hidden" folder which I hadn't seen before. out of curiousity I opened it. It was filled with her nudes. Most I've already seen. Some of which she's never sent to me before. I thought maybe she was stockpiling for whenever I asked for any. I clicked on a video. It was a sextape. It was from the POV of the guy but the thing is. I dont remember ever filming it. It 100% wasnt me. trust me, i know what my own schlong looks like. My girlfriend recorded having sex with another man.

For the last 5 years. We've had a few share of fights, but nothing too serious. She'd always make me feel loved and I could tell she really cares about me. Or at least I thought she did. After I returned her phone to her, I quickly got up and went home. I couldn't stay there any longer. And now I'm here. I dont really know what to do. I'm planning on confronting her and breaking it off but right now I'm just so in shock. 5 years down the drain. and I feel like I just lost my best friend. I'm not really sure how to feel. I can't think straight. What would be the best way to handle this situation?

ANSWER: Did you see a date on the video??

If it was during the past 5 years then that could be a problem, but you should probably come clean to her (in person) so you can gauge her reactions/see if she's lying.

It could be a huge misunderstanding, but it could also be a huge breakup. I say just get to the bottom of it.

If it does turn out to be a breakup, at least you found out before settling down with her.

QUESTION: My [36M] wife [34F] keeps tying my boots after I've told her to keep her hands off of them. I tried to teach her a lesson and really hurt her feelings.

Yes, I know the title is bizarre and I can't believe I'm actually writing this. My wife is a neat freak. Always has been. She throws notes on my desk out assuming they're garbage, my belongings get rearranged to the point where it takes me hours to find them, it's something I've come to accept. I'm not happy about it, but we have a pretty happy marriage on the whole.

I am a volunteer EMT, and I keep my boots unlaced up against the wall next to my clothes hamper so that I can throw them on along with my uniform if a call comes in during the middle of the night.  Well, my wife has taken to tying the boot laces when she sees them untied. Not only does she tie them, but she tightens them and double knots them to the point where I need to undo the knot, open up the boots, and let a little slack out to fit my feet into them.  I ignored it the first two times, but the third time she did it, I made it a point to bring up to her the next day.

I very calmly said, "Hun, I appreciate that you want everything neat, but please do not touch my boots in the future. Time is of the essence when I'm going on a call and at 2 in the morning I don't have the time to unlace them and open them up. It's not just a minor inconvenience, it's people's lives, so I would appreciate it if you left them alone."

She rolled her eyes, said I was being dramatic, and that she wouldn't help me out by keeping my things neat in the future.

Well she never stopped. No matter how many times I've asked her, told her, begged her; she just laughs and says, "Well you know how I am!"

The other night a page went out for a CPR in progress.  I went to throw my boots on and they were, once again, tightened beyond recognition.  So I'm sitting there on the edge of the bed, cursing, trying to get my boots open, and fumbling due to the stress of the situation.

My wife opened her eyes, groggily looked at me, and asked, "Don't you need to go on that call?"

I know I was in the wrong here, and I regret it. I slammed the boot into the ground and yelled, "Yes! I do! I would have been out the door five minutes ago, except SOME STUPID MOTHERFUCKER FUCKED WITH MY GODDAMN BOOTS AGAIN!"

My wife got up without another word, walked into the bathroom and slammed the door. I got my boots open and went on the call. By the time we arrived, the police had gotten her back, so I didn't have to do CPR, but I was sweating and shaking thinking my delay could have cost a life.

I got home and my wife wasn't talking to me. She ignored me the entire day until we finally sat down and talked. She said I had scared her with how angry I got, that she thought I was going to hit her, and she didn't know I was capable of getting so angry. Note: I have never raised a hand to her, nor have I ever yelled at her before; I am absolutely not a violent person in any way shape or form.

I apologized for yelling at her, and acknowledged that I hadn't meant to snap at her, I was frustrated with the situation as I needed to get to the person in need of CPR as soon as possible and it was a delay that didn't need to happen.  I, once again, pleaded with her not to touch my boots because lives were literally on the line.

She told me that if I was going to overreact and make her afraid then she would never touch my boots again because she didn't want to live like that.

Last night, before I got into bed, I had a sinking feeling, so I went over and checked my boots.  I was very disappointed to find them tightened up again.  So I decided to show her how it felt. I went over to her closet and pulled out her running shoes.  I unlaced the shoelaces on both of them, removed them from the shoes completely, curled them each into a little coil, put them inside the shoes, and put them back.  I then went to sleep.

At 6:15 I was woken up by my wife screaming, "How could you!? Why would you do this?" holding up both laceless shoes with tears in her eyes.  My wife likes to go for an early morning run and I knew she would want to get out the door as soon as possible.

I smiled and said, "You know how I am! I just like things neat!" She continued sobbing and walked out of the room.  So, by the time she was all laced up again, it was raining so she missed out on her run.  I actually feel pretty terrible about that because I really only wanted to delay her, not ruin her plans completely.

At this point, she's alternating between crying that I went out of my way to hurt her and ignoring my presence. I acknowledge that what I've done has been pretty childish and not at all constructive. I just don't know what to do.

She said, through tears, "You admitted you were totally in the wrong for yelling at me, and then you turned around and took it out on me in a different way! What is wrong with you?"

The problem is, to her, an apology means taking on 100% of the fault.  When I apologized for blowing up, she took that to mean she was 100% in the right and that my feelings were completely unjustified. So at this point, I haven't apologized for ruining her run, because she'll take that to mean that she wasn't wrong to touch my boots.

I've tried to have these discussions but it's in one ear and out the other.  We have such a good relationship otherwise, but I feel like this issue has reached a tipping point and it's going to continue to result in arguments until we resolve it.

How do I make things right with my wife while still letting her know that I won't tolerate her disrespecting my property anymore?

Edit: Wow! This blew up! I went through comments for six hours last night and I still have 1.8k to get through.  I promise you I am reading every one of your comments and appreciate the advice.  A couple things to address points that keep getting brought up.

1. My wife has never been diagnosed as having OCD. As an EMT, I'm very careful about labeling someone as having a disorder as I don't have the proper qualifications to make that diagnosis. I do agree that it's time for her to see somebody, get a proper diagnosis, and address these issues.
2. My boots lace up in the front and zipper on the side. They're not a full unzip but rather an unzip to open them up a bit. The way my wife is tying them makes them impossible to get on even with the zipper down. They're weather proof and great for standing on rough terrain or the highway after accidents. They're only about a year old and were actually a gift from my wife. I've not considered Velcro before, I'm a bit hesitant to do that as I don't know that they wouldn't catch on things or wear out quicker.  I've tucked the laces in but she still tied them up.
3. This is a bit of compulsive behavior on my part. I don't leave my boots in the garage because my mother was a smoker growing up and that's where she would smoke. So I would end up with ashes in my shoes and having them reek of tobacco after. So I developed a habit of wearing them into my home. Also, if I leave them there, they're likely to get moved someplace 'safe' where it will take me even longer to find them.  Putting the boots in the closet, she found them and tied them.  Putting them under the bed or out of sight they were found, tied, and moved to the closet.
4. I honestly believe that a footlocker or any other kind of box would get moved to where I would have to wake her up to find it. If it's locked, then my keys are likely to go missing. For some reason, sitting on my dresser is not appropriate but in the pocket of a jacket downstairs in the closet is.
5. I am likely going to start putting my boots in the car. Though I had to laugh at the people suggesting decoy boots. As much as it may seem like it, I'm not living in a Spy vs. Spy cartoon.
6. I am a volunteer EMT. We respond from home. We don't have sleeping quarters, and I work the overnight shift so I sleep during my shift, get out of bed when a call comes in, drive to the building, and take the ambulance to the scene. This is typical of volunteer organizations.  Paid EMS is more likely to have sleeping quarters or even require EMTs to be in the truck throughout their shift. Community based EMS is more likely to take 911 calls and respond to emergencies whether paid or volunteer.  Private EMS is more likely to take transport requests such as to/from dialysis or chemotherapy as well as hospital to nursing facility discharges.
7. To those who have told me that I don't have the right to use the word lifesaving, on my dress uniform I have pins for 3 defibrillator saves and 4 for CPR saves. I've crawled into a car wreck to open someone's airway and bag them until we could get them out. While transporting a patient I recognized signs of internal injury and ordered we divert to a trauma center, where he was put directly into emergency surgery that saved his life.  Did I do these things entirely by myself? No, of course not. I would never claim that I was the sole reason someone lived. However, I am, at my very basest level, as vital link in the chain or survival. So while I can't claim complete credit for any of the things I've done, I would certainly put a lot of blame on myself if someone didn't live because of something I failed to do.
8. I have a full-time job that I work 8-5 Monday - Friday outside of EMS.  That is why I volunteer on the night shift. My wife works as a payroll manager for a mid-sized office.  I earn about $10,000 a year more than her.  We've been married for two years. While I lived on my own before we were married, she didn't move into the apartment until we got engaged. So, I think to her, that was my place, not ours, and she didn't really touch my things.  I was with another EMS organization until we moved to a new town after our engagement.  When we bought the house, I joined the local volunteer squad as an EMT. My wife regards my job as part of my identity while she sees the EMS as something I volunteer to do. She would say, "This is my husband, he is \[job title\]," not "This is my husband, he is an EMT."
9. Thank you for all the awards on this post. You're all very kind. I appreciate so much that you took the time out of your day to acknowledge things and want to help me.

tl;dr Wife keeps tightening my boots when I'm not wearing them, delaying me on ambulance calls. I finally had enough, and she's calling my response abuse.

ANSWER: Your wife’s behavior sounds compulsive. She likely has a major anxiety disorder that manifests in this way. Which explains her “inability” to stop herself from the rearranging and the lacing and whatnot. She needs therapy and medication pronto.

BUT that doesn’t explain her minimizing the importance and urgency of your job. EVEN IF you weren’t literally saving lives, I’d be pissed as fuck if my partner trivialized my work and dismissed my need to be organized and prepared for my job.

I’m skeptical that your marriage is truly as great as you say it is, and I’m concerned that you’re just in the habit of subjugating your own needs to keep the peace due to your wife’s “quirks”.

QUESTION: I [46M] promised my son [18M] that his mother and I would match whatever he saved for a car upon his high school graduation. He ended up with a lot more than we could have predicted, and now we don’t know what to do.

When he turned 16 and got his license, we allowed him to use an old car from a relative. At that time, my son had around $5k in savings. We made him a promise saying that we’d match whatever he ended up with at graduation. Reasonably, we thought he’d maybe double that to $10k through jobs and we’d match for a reasonable $20k car.

He now has $35k to use for a car. He said he did have a little over $10k but that he bought smart stock options in April and now will have around $35k after tax (personally I don’t think he did anything besides get stupid lucky).

He is insisting that we follow through with our promise and match that. Financially, it’s not a huge dent for us since he also surprised us with a nice merit scholarship (that he did earn). The problem arises in that we really don’t want to break the promise we made to him, but we also strongly believe that an 18 year old driving around in a SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR car is a very bad idea. He can’t even take it to school until his sophomore year, and the insurance on that will be a nightmare.

What I am asking is, would the better course of action be to break the promise, and likely face resentment? Or keep it and cough up the money?

Thanks in advance for the advice.

Edit: Talked about it with my wife; we are considering a couple of avenues atm including trust or maybe fixed income until it can be used for med school. My son uses Reddit and considering that this is on r/all now, I’m just waiting for him to see it and burst into my home office room.

Edit2: He’s super duper close with his girlfriend. I told her, and she said she’d talk him out of it. Personally, I totally understand where my son is coming from. I wanted a car like that at that age too, and my parents did end up indulging just a little bit, but now I can see how it was a waste of money. I only used it for two years. I’ll make an update post in a few days about what happens.

ANSWER: Personally a $70k car is a lot for an 18 year old.

I'd match the $10k and put the $15k towards a house deposit for him - you honour the money match but don't put so much to a car, which will depreciate and lose value.

The tough bit would be the sell!

QUESTION: My wife "baby-trapped" me

I put baby-trap in quotation marks because I'm not sure what she did is the actual definition of baby trap, she didn't have a kid to make me stay, just against my will.

So my wife (32F) and I (34M) have been together for eight years. We have a little girl (5F) and a baby boy (2M). I love both of them more than anything and I finally feel like I have everything. A beautiful wife, two healthy kids, a great career, and a big house. The token "American Dream", minus the dog, I'm allergic.   
When we talked about kids before, my wife always said she wanted two. I only wanted one, it would be easier and we'd have more money for vacations and stuff, but my wife maintained it's important for a child to have a sibling. I grew up with four and my wife with none, so I guess I understand where she's coming from.

After our son and getting through the baby years and sleepless nights for the second time, I didn't want to ever go through that again. Both kids were very fussy and colicky. But when he was a year old, my wife began casually mentioning a third. I would laugh it off but finally she sat me down and said we have to have a third. I said no, we agreed on two, but she said she wanted four and three is the compromise. I refused and said I wanted one and we have two. She got angry and called me selfish for taking away her dream of wanting a big family.

A couple days later, she apologized and we had sex. I noticed her drive increased exponentially but so did mine and I was happy to engage her. She was on birth-control, I had a condom, it was all good. Thinking back on it, I probably should have figured something was up, but I was barely handling two little kids and work on top of housework and yardwork and everything.

I came home from work one day, while the kids were at their grandparents. My wife had a huge smile on her face and she sat me down and showed me a positive pregnancy test, literally dancing in joy.

My first thought was, "oh shit." My wife noticed a less-than-happy expression on my face and started screaming at me. She berated me for not being supportive and this was a "miracle from God" and I should be grateful. I said I was sorry and hugged her and said I was super excited for the baby. My wife was delighted and later that night she was calling all family and friends to happily tell them the news. When she was talking about the nursery and how we'll convert my office into a room I started to get a little suspicious. Everything was so well thought-out and it seemed like she'd been planning this for a while.

When she was asleep, I took the condoms out of the cupboard and ran them under water. Holes.   
I nabbed her phone and saw she'd set a password. That was odd. Nevertheless, my wife has a terrible memory so I tried her birthday and it opened. Further up were texts with her best friend of my wife complaining how I wouldn't come around. Her best friend suggested "arrange an accident" with a winky face. My wife agreed and said she was going to come off of birth control. It went on for a little while, ending with my wife saying that yes, we were going to have a 3rd.

So I woke her up immediately and asked her if this had really been a "miracle"? She got that deer-in-headlights look and burst into tears. She wailed and then she got angry. Through tears she screamed I had no right to go through her phone and it's her choice whether or not she wants to take BC, the side-effects are bad and she was sick. She also brought up if I really didn't want a third kid, I should have had a vasectomy. She told me to go sleep on the couch, I laughed out loud and said no, I'm sleeping here, you're leaving. So while wailing she packed a bag and left to her parents. When she called the next day I told her I just need some time to myself. She said that's fine but I need to come around for our child. I told her I wasn't sure if it'd be "our child" and she cried more.

It's been two weeks since then. Governments recommended to stay at home and I knew staying home by myself while also working with two kids would not be ideal and she wanted to see our kids. So we're  in the same house, she constantly keeps on stopping me and trying to get me excited for our kid and planning the nursery and names and how happy our kids will be to get a younger sibling. I've been ignoring her entirely.

What do I do? Staying home with her is bad enough and I don't know if I should leave her over this. I don't trust her anymore. She entirely betrayed it. I'm angry. But I have another child on the way.

ANSWER: [Reproductive Coercion ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_coercion)

This is a form of abuse.

Speak with a lawyer, get a therapist.  This is NOT okay!

QUESTION: UPDATE: Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.

Orginal: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c13s1w/wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids_last/

TL;DR: Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July. Wife got pregnant anyways. It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery. Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating. Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.

Update TL;DR at bottom

First I just want to thank everyone who reached out and offered their story about similar.  I can't believe how many people are told they're completely sterile and end up being able to have kids anyways.

I took a lot of what you guys said to heart.  I had an ex of mine from years ago end up cheating on me, and it really left a scar for a while.  It wasn't until I got more involved with sports and getting in better shape that I was able to try and move on.  My wife and I actually met in a soccer league we were in together. We've had so much trust for so long that I thought those fears had gone away.  It wasn't until now that I really started to feel shaken like that again.

But I didn't want to let my past get in the way of what could be just a huge blessing.  A few people really articulated the right way to communicate my feelings in a way that wasn't accusatory and respectful of my wife, who's never really given me a reason to doubt her.

It's not uncommon for her to sometimes be home late, and she'll usually like to go straight to bed. I didn't want to dump this on her immediately and decided to give myself a night to sleep on it.  I got up pretty early just being restless, went for a run, and cleared my mind. I couldn't wait any longer.  I made our favorite omelets, and told her I needed to talk about something.

"You know I'm not Ashley, right?"

She knows me well.  Ashley's my ex who cheated.

So first I apologized.  I apologized because I let this build up in my head for so long without talking with her about it sooner.  What should be blessing has been nothing but insecurity and fear for me.

We talked for a while.  I told her how happy it made me to see her ecstatic and excited for the baby. I told her how much I loved the relationship that we've built together, and I felt like an asshole for questioning her loyalty.  She had never given me a reason not to trust her and that I still couldn't emotionally get over the thoughts of infidelity because of my ex.  She thanked me for telling her, and she knew how hard it was for me to get over that.  She volunteered to have us get a paternity right when he/she's born, which made me feel a lot better at first.

But something still felt off.  I honestly don't know why, something about how she was so eager to get a paternity test, and almost not mad at me at all for having kept this from her.  Normally she would have been upset that I didn't bring it up right away, but there was just a weird feeling I couldn't shake for the rest of the day.

It seemed like she was saying all the right things, but I couldn't get rid of this clawing feeling inside my head.  Maybe I'm just being paranoid.  Maybe there's a gut feeling that I need to listen to.  But I ended up going to the appointment alone, as we "decided" it would good to see if I still needed the surgery.

Turns out it's obstructive azoospermia.  I've read so many stories about people who were supposed to infertile end up getting pregnant. So I brought that up, and how my wife's pregnancy was affecting me. The urologist thought it would be pretty unlikely that I wouldn't need surgery to have a kid with how mine was presenting itself. He mainly tried to skirt around the topic, and mostly pushed me towards making sure she was actually pregnant.

Being there didn't really help.  I feel like I just got more uncertainty.

She had another night being out to 8:30 last night.  We talked about scheduling an appointment to verify the pregnancy when she got home. She seemed a little confused, but then quickly agreed. She promised to do it in the morning.  I asked how work had gone, and she gave me a kind of non-commital answer about her boss pushing her too much and being stressed out.

There's nothing huge there, but she just seemed off.  I really couldn't put my finger on it.  We were still acting all lovely-dovey, but something just felt wrong, and I couldn't talk about it without repeating the same conversation we had Sunday.

I've been trying to throw myself into work to distract myself, but I haven't been able to focus.  We have a joint checking account that we'll sometimes move money in and out of, but really only use it for groceries or household items unless we talk about it beforehand.  This morning she moved half of it to hers, about $1700. We don't do that, she's never needed to before.  And I checked our health care portal, and she made the appointment for the one time Thursday that I mentioned I was busy working on-site. We were supposed to go together.

I'm starting to go crazy. How do I bring this up that isn't me just having the same conversation again?  I'm looking into getting a second opinion for myself.  But I need a litmus test from objective outsiders to know if I'm really losing it or if this seems weird to someone else.

TL;DR Had good conversation about my ex-cheating before and those issues, something still felt off.  Urologist said I had obstructive azoospermia, implied I should "make sure my wife is pregnant" and didn't think I could be fertile.  Wife is taking money from joint account and booked her doctor appointment when I can't go.  Getting a second Urology opinion, also slightly going crazy.

UPDATE:  I've been trying to center myself.  We talked calmly for a bit on the phone.  She claimed she moved the money out in anticipation for the deductible payments she'll have with different visits.  I didn't bring up anything else, but she seemed a little impatient with me, probably rightly so, and implied we'd have a longer talk when she gets home.  I'm just trying to not overreact right now. I don't know what to think, this is either a misunderstanding on my side and Im a Father! Or...not.  Thankfully she's not working late today.

Thank you those who are trying to keep me grounded.

UPDATE:  I went for a long run to clear my mind.  Gotta shower, and then my wife should be home.  I'm going to go into the conversation with no judgement, just objectively walk out the facts and why I've still been struggling personally with some of them.  Regardless of what happens I'm done with any confusion left between us.

Thanks to those who messaged me and gave advice.

Happy Update https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c2grcq/happy_update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for/?

ANSWER: You got any sick time? Call in sick on the day of the appointment and go anyway. She technically already kinda agreed to go together so make it so. She can’t argue with that.

QUESTION: UPDATE: yesterday I froze during sex, my girlfriend asked if we should stop and I said yes and she backed off. I've never been treated like this before.

some of y'all wanted the link to the original post, here it is
 https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j1ur51/yesterday_i_froze_during_sex_and_my_girlfriend/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I thought I'd update y'all since so many people commented on my previous post.

As I said in earlier, I wrote her a letter and it was much more difficult than I thought it would be. But I wrote what was in my heart and how much I loved her and thanked her for supporting me.

I made some of her favourite snacks and took her to a small park nearby. We ate and watched the sunset together and then I gave her the letter I wrote. She cried and hugged me and we sat there talking about future aspects. And then I showed the post to her. She welled up again and asked if she could come to a few therapy sessions with me so that she could understand better what I was going through. Also it might help her not burn out. I will talk to my therapist about it and we'll see how it turns out.

But that's about it. We went home, watched a movie and went to bed. I seriously feel so lucky to have her in my life

Here's to hoping for our best future together.

Oh and, I seriously cannot thank you guys enough. Every single one of you who commented (even the rude ones) have made a difference. Seriously y'all are amazeballs. (I know many said to not say it ever again, but I like it so)

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.

ANSWER: I cannot tell you how great it is to see a positive story on this sub.

Also, holy shit you actually communicated. Five gold stars to both of you!

QUESTION: My [23F] boyfriend [25M] used the dog's savings for a computer

I know the title is a little odd but it was the best way I could summarize what he's done.

I have an 11-year old senior German Shepard. He was hit by a car in 2018 and we went through a very difficult recovery process. He had seizures, urine issues, constant fear of anything going fast near him like I couldn't throw a ball anymore. We had another puppy but our senior was so stressed we had to rehome her. You would have sworn he was displaying abused behavior but he was just scared.

He's moved past all of that and I'm so proud of him. The vet prescribed zoniamide for his seizures and so far he's been recovering well. We were discussing ways to improve his "mobility". Its like a walking cane, but for dogs, and it has sensory objects on the end to prevent him from bumping into furniture. We tested it in the office and his mood improved instantly but at that time I couldn't afford more treatment for him so I opted to come back.

I met D earlier this year while walking him. He's known since day 1 that my dog requires special treatment and I would absolutely provide it. Everything went well and he wasn't controlling or abusive. Everything just "clicked" but its my fault because I was too comfortable. We were talking about finances and I told him about my debt and the money I was saving up for my dog. After paying off the debt from his previous treatments I didn't want to open another card so I started saving cash in a little fireproof chest. He stole it. Yesterday, I went to his place I noticed he has a new setup. I was asking him where he got the money from and we fought and he said "he's half dead anyway, you need to let go".

He's not even close to dying. He's a little older but he's nowhere near dying age. We go to the veterinarian regularly and everything checks out as well as it can be given his circumstances. No one has ever mentioned death, we've only been looking at the future and improvements.

I'm so upset, what do I do? We're both students I don't want to call the police and ruin his future but that was for my baby to get what he needed so he can walk around my home comfortably.

ANSWER: Uhh, what? He stole your money, you should be filing a police report.

You deserve that money, he needs to pay it back. Dump him and call the cops.

QUESTION: Yesterday, my(33m) wife's (34f) best friend (female) contacted me and told me that her husband and my wife were having an affair and my 3yo daughter is actually his daughter.

Wife and I have been together since high school. Married for 10 years. I'm really drunk, so pardon me for this gibberish.

My wife's best friend Megan and I work for the same company( different departments ). So yesterday, she wanted to meet me after work and told me that she had to tell me something. So I met her and she immediately broke down and started crying. I tried to console her and asked if something was wrong and she told me that my wife and her husband were having an affair.

According to her, this affair has been going on for years and she also told me that her husband was my daughter's biological father. She confronted her husband and he didn't deny anything.

And when I confronted my wife, she tried to deny everything but when I told her that Megan told me about it, she broke down and started crying.

I really don't know what to do. I mean, everything was a lie right? My little girl Taylor is not mine and my wife blatantly faked everything for years. What do I live for now? I just don't know what to do. Just here for some advice. I'm sorry if this felt like a rant.

ANSWER: Sober up, reach out to family and close friends for support, get a lawyer asap and follow their advice to the letter. Sorry you are going though all this. I can't imagine how messed up your world is right now.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but I’m the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. Do I say anything?

Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

So I got lots of feedback on what to do here. A good majority of the commenters told me to say something. To clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but I was never planning on doing nothing. Of course you gotta tell your bro if they’re being cheated on. I just was not sure how to approach the situation.

Some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. Some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which I ended up getting from Alison, the third party friend. Some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me I was a bad friend. Some were sure he wouldn’t believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. Well all of you were somewhat right. Here’s how it went down:

I messaged Alison early on in the day, shortly after I made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. I said to Alison that I needed to tell Aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. This was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages.

Aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that Alison came over too. We all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about Mary. Alison showed him the text screenshots of Mary talking to her ex, and also told Aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters.

What was the most surprising was his reaction. He took it very well. He first got very quiet, and just nodded. Aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. He was not aware of the hookups, but he and Mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn’t allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. He told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. There were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. He knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn’t true.

We started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. He cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would’ve given her anything. Then he got angry. At her, and even more so at the guy. Some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her.

Ultimately he told us that he’s going to be breaking it off at least for now. We told him a million times how much better he deserved. He’s definitely not going to marry her.

Thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. We saved a good man from heartbreak!

Edit: Jesus Christ this exploded fast. Thanks for all the kind words people 😅

ANSWER: >she doesn’t allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time

Every. Single. Time.

Extreme jealousy is a projection.

QUESTION: HAPPY UPDATE: Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.

https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c225le/update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids/

I'm sorry to drag ya'll through the worst of my insecurities.  I definitely channeled quite a bit of my negative shit into what I posted.  But hey, that's what anonymous people are good for sometimes I guess.

Anyways, we finally sat down after she got home last night.  I told her everything that was going on.  The Urologist, the money, the upcoming appointment.  I told her how, even with all her reassurances, too many suspect things kept happening.

She agreed how everything looked, and immediately apologized.  She didn't realize how much my last exs cheating was still affecting me.  She knew I was off going into the weekend, but thought we addressed that. We talked about it Sunday, but I can get pretty internal with all these worries and not show them outwardly.  And so while she had thought we were communicating, I wasn't.  We decided to start from the beginning and go through everything together.

The money was the real problem for me. She agreed how inconsiderate it was with where my head was at to do that without mentioning it.  Apparently the prenatal visits are so structured that they want you to set up a payment plan with them right away, and she wanted to make sure it was squared away to keep the appointment.  She offered without me prompting to call them with me tomorrow to verify that, or if I really wanted we could move the money back.  She does get better rewards out of hers so it kind of made sense.

We read up on obstructive azoospermia, and it doesn't seem like they're often invincible forcefields.  It seems like only the actual absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) actually guarantees complete infertility, so it is possible for some to get through. We're going to go back to the original specialist I was working with last year and hopefully get a clearer picture.  It turns out the appointment she made was the only time they had available so soon, and figured it'd be best not to wait.  I told her I took off work to go with, and she was relieved I could join.

Once again, she said all the right things and seems genuine about getting us on the same page.  After going through each thing I was just wishing I believed her a little more before. She's stressed out with work and when she'll have to take off, but she really seemed to want to go out of her way to alleviate my concerns. She even offered an open phone policy if I needed.  We did look at the text I had seen, and it was just a girlfriend.  I declined though right now, since I don't want to be that husband.

This has really made me take a deeper look at what's in my past and how that still affects me today. Even thinking back to this weekend, it was so hard to see in the moment how much all the uncertainty was affecting me.  That level of anxiety literally makes you question what around you is real.  I think the trust but verify is the best way to put it. I was just trying to verify without any of the trust is all.  This has all put a strain on our marriage right now, but I'm feeling a bit more like we're a team again working towards easing that.

She thought that an NIPP ASAP was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.  I'm not big on therapy, but I can probably agree that it will most likely help.

I'm feeling a little better about everything.  Thanks again to everyone who reached out and shared their own story (Every other comment here I read was a story of a family member who was supposed to be barren and ended up popping out triplets), and most of all those who helped me try to communicate fairly through all of this.   It's time for me to hopefully be a father.

TL;DR  Use your words. - Wife and I objectively went through everything.  We both apologized, getting a NIPP soon and hopefully a therapist.

UPDATE: The paternity test came back intially positive for anyone that's going to see this : )

ANSWER: > She thought that an NIPP ASAP was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.

Glad to see this was her atitude.

QUESTION: My girlfriend said something to me yesterday that felt like a punch to the gut

Me (17m) and my girlfriend (also 17) have been going out 8 and a bit months. We didn't have sex together straight away and first did it only a few weeks ago. I was a virgin before that so I'm not experienced at all and so far I've not been able to make her cum.

Before dating me, my gf was dating my brother. It was awkward at first but we're all okay now. Anyway so last night I tried my best to make her cum but in the end she told me to "just stop" so I did. Then she said "your brother turned me on so much more than you do". I was so shocked by her saying that I didn't know what to say back. She got dressed and left the house and we haven't spoken yet.

I just feel so confused about how I feel. I know I'm not as attractive as my brother but I didn't think she would say that. Am I just being a baby and getting upset over nothing? I understand she's probably fed up and she might have just said it in the moment.

ANSWER: I guess you brother was the one that broke up with her. She's not with you for you man, she with you for your brother, if she liked you she would teach you. Leave her.

How old is your brother?

Eddit: thanks for the gold, kind stranger.

QUESTION: Update: My (25M) girlfriend's (25F) sex drive has completely disappeared

Warning: long update ahead. Here's the link to the previous post- https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iq1ebc/my_25m_girlfriends_25f_sex_drive_has_completely/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb

Thanks to everyone who replied to my previous post. There were some mixed responses, with some people suggesting I insist on addressing it with her because she's hiding something, with others recommending I give her time to open up on her own.

Ultimately I decided to sort of go for a combo of the two. Friday, when we were both done with work, we sat down and had a discussion.

I told her that I could give her the space and time she needed till she was ready to talk to me about it, but I couldn't leave it unaddressed. She needed to acknowledge that there atleast WAS something that she didn't feel ready to tell me, and that was fine, but she atleast needed to acknowledge its existence, if only so I stopped feeling like I was going crazy.

She started sobbing when I was done and then she started explaining everything.

Some background that I didn't mention in my previous post because it didn't really seem relevant is that my girlfriend has PCOD. One of the consequences of this is that she finds it very difficult to lose weight and has been insecure about her body for most of her life. About a year ago (completely of her own choice, I have always told her that she's beautiful to me no matter what her weight), she resolved to start losing weight, both for her health and to feel better about her body. She started going to the gym a couple times a week, and I was supportive and also cut out all my own junk food consumption in solidarity.

Since the lockdown started and gyms shut, apparently she started slowly gaining some weight back due to stress eating and lack of exercise. I am ashamed to say I did not even notice that she was torturing herself over her weight all this while. She admitted that she stopped having sex because she was terrified I would stop finding her attractive after seeing her naked. I reassured her that I think she's gorgeous and attractive no matter what and I tell her this everyday, but she was afraid that would have changed once I saw the weight she had put on.

The rest of the conversation consisted of me reassuring her that she's beautiful and her appreciating but not really believing me. After a bit, she asked me to change the topic, and I reluctantly agreed. We had a fairly quiet dinner, she was a little sad and relieved at the same time at having told me, I think. And I was busy scheming.

The next morning before work I told her she looked lovely again and she gave me a wan smile, like she appreciated it but didn't really believe me. But that was okay. I was gonna convince her. I asked her to pick up the groceries that evening because I was gonna have a meeting run late.

The moment she left home, I got to work. I dug out some fairy lights and a bunch of candles from storage and started setting them up in the living room. Made a couple of playlists and charged the speaker. Snuck down to the florist and bought a giant bouquet.

Some more background, I hate dancing because I suck massively at it, while my girlfriend loves it. She used to go dancing every month or two with her girlfriends before lockdown. I'd join in sometimes because it was worth how happy it made her, but she definitely missed it way more than me.

So when she got back, naturally I greeted her with what were probably the most ridiculous dance moves in the history of mankind.

I'm not gonna lie, folks. She laughed. She laughed a lot. She took a short video, and we both laughed while watching it later. My movement resembled a five year old practicing kung fu more than it resembled dancing, and I had stuck a rose in my ear for maximum ridiculousness. Totally worth it, though. I have no idea how she ever thought she's ugly, her smile is just so fucking radiant.

We danced like idiots for a while before I switched to the slow dance playlist. It was definitely the happiest I'd seen her in a long time. I'd been a bad boyfriend and somehow missed how much she missed everything else. I should have done it months ago.

I told her all this. Told her she's the most beautiful woman in my eyes and always will be. And yeah, we had sex. Last night was all about her. She needed to feel special and I had been missing that for too long.

I offered to make dance nights a weekly thing afterwards. Kind of as a substitute for the workouts she's been missing, if she wants. She tore up a little, she knows how much I hate dancing. She told me that wasn't necessary.

Apparently sex is just as much of a workout as dancing. And we have a lot of missed workouts to catch up on. I'm certainly not complaining.

In all seriousness though, I'm gonna dip into my savings a little and order a home treadmill. She can't afford one right now because of college bills, so I'll surprise her with it :)

Thank you to everyone who helped me out with their advice!

Edit: Oh wow, I am completely overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support here. Thanks for all the awards! I just logged back into this account but I promise I'm going to read each of the replies. One thing I saw pop up a couple of times that I just wanna reassure you guys about is that she's mentioned wanting a treadmill but not being able to afford one several times in the past, so I know she wants one.

However, I figured that it's dumb to take the chance, and one surprise was good enough, and if there's anything this whole experience has taught me, it's the importance of communication. So I'm going to bring it up at dinner tonight that I comfortably have enough saved up to purchase a home workout machine (since I saw cycles/ellipticals being mentioned, we'll figure out which one we want!), and that I'd love to buy one for our home for both of us to use. Thank you all so much once again for your advice!

Edit 2: RIP me, lol, the comments are coming faster than I can read them now. There's no way for me to reply to every one of them, unfortunately. There are a lot of fantastic suggestions for diets, exercise machines, dance classes and everything in between, so thank you so much for all of them! She has a great endocrinologist, who's advice she will ultimately be following, but there are some great points to bring up with him. It is really touching and overwhelming to see all this support. Thank you all so much!

Final Edit: She loved the idea of getting some equipment to do our workouts at home together, so we're going to sit down and do our research tonight before picking the one we like most. We've gotten some fantastic advice here and we'll be looking at ellipticals, bikes, rowing machines, Just Dance on the Switch and a bunch of other stuff that you guys suggested.

To all the people who commented to insist she's cheating on me because I'm a simp (lmao), thank you for setting the exemplary standard for being macho. Insulting strangers online is so delightfully masculine. The lovely folks who told me to dump her "because she's fat" get the "disappointing but not unexpected shitheads" shout-out as well.

For the overwhelming majority of people, though, I am just breathtaken by the kind and supportive comments we've gotten. Thank you for the treasure trove of advice and LPTs, and all the love! You folks are amazing!

ANSWER: Dude. Epic BF status achieved. Masterful approach and not just to get sex again but in a way that's like wholesome and meaningful to the partnership in a huge way. Dont beat yourself up on faltering every now and then on noticing things.

Communication on both sides, even in a long relationship can be tricky when its the most sensitive stuff, especially body image insecurity.

Grats on being a good human and an excellent BF. May your days be filled with rampant workouts as you both deserve as such.

QUESTION: FINAL UPDATE: My GF was raped and became pregnant. I broke up with her when she wouldn't abort the baby.

Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/

TLDR: My GF was raped. Wanted to abort. Talked to mother. Decided not to abort. I left her.

Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/
  
TLDR: GF calls me, reveals Mum made her not get an abortion because GOD CARES. She wants me back and arranges for abortion she wanted all along. Some of Reddit think I'm a baby killer.

Update 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/boai5u/update2_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/

TLDR: Mother tries to get me arrested for kidnapping or domestic abuse or some loony stuff.

I just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. This will be my final update.

A few days ago, the abortion was carried out. During the weeks beforehand, my GF went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. She was also tested for any STIs (she's clear!).

She went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. A few days ago it was successfully carried out.

They went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. GF said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours.

When she came home, she cried and cried and cried. She says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life.

We took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). While in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before.

She's amazing, man. Seriously.

Update on the Mum! So my GF received a call from her Mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion.

My GF and I have an agreement that if Mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. In this instance, she answered, didn't know what to say, and gave it to me.

I told the Mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. I then said "How Jesus of you" at which point she hung up.

My GF didn't find it funny...

Anyway, that's it.

Good luck to everyone in their lives.

Also, if you're going to message and insult me via PM, just be warned: I've killed ^a ^baby before.

ANSWER: My only caution is maybe go easy on the baby killing jokes in front of your girlfriend.  
  
Why?  because even though this is what she wanted, and she feels relieved having gone through with it.  It's still kind of a big deal. It's still a sea of mixed emotion.   It's a bit like if you were to start making rape jokes infront of your girlfriend.  (maybe not that bad,  but still bad.)    Avoid the baby killing jokes at least until she's the one who starts making them comfortably.

Also,  on the one hand,  stand up for yourself and your girl against the crazy mom.  But also,  don't do things to egg her on.    Stand your ground without widening the rift.  Your girl will respect you more.

QUESTION: I (28/M) got beat up in front of my (29/F) g/f.

It was late and we were walking about the park. I went to the Restroom. I come back and some jackoff is sexually harassing with my g/f. Shes very uncomfortable (doing her best not to panic)and lets him know so and that her boyfriend is nearby. He's not listening. I approach him and kindly tell him to fuck off or I'll call the Police. Dude is very clearly drunk as I can smell the beer on him. As we turn to leave he grabs her ass and tells her to leave me and come to him. I turn around and hit him. My girlfriend has been a victim of sexual assault before and she's doing her best not to breakdown. I'll spare you the details other then I got my ass kicked. He left after that. My girlfriend had a panic attack in the car after that.

I just feel letdown I couldn't help her.  I feel embarrassed, emasculated. Shes been a victim of sexual assault before so this harassment is traumatic. I wasn't able to hep her. I wasn't there for her. I feel worthless. I could have held it in, I could have just left earlier like she wanted. its been two days and she's still traumatized over it. She has an emergency therapy meeting today and hasn't been to work. Shes been crying and I've attempted to help her but, it's clear I can't.

ANSWER: What if you hadn’t been there? That guy is definitely a scumbag but I’m glad you were there (even if you got beat up) cause he most likely would’ve done a lot worse to her if she was all alone. The event definitely brought back horrible memories for her, and I’m so happy she’s in therapy. My advice is to just be there for her and emotionally support her as well. You saved her that night now be there for her now.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My childhood "friend" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while I was sleeping. She told everyone and now he's being ostracized from our friends. Except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place [NSFW]

[Link to Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cxr0sp/my_childhood_friend_went_through_my_boyfriends/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

So a couple things have happened in the last few days, and I figured you guys would like to hear what the police finally settled on.

First, I'd like to clear up something first - the theft and distribution of this media was, in no way, shape, or form, the fault of my partner. He is just as much a victim of a crime as I am, if not more. This has been an emotionally tumultuous time for him. He is my partner and my foremost concern here is him.

It's honestly absolutely terrible that so many people blamed him for this situation.

I spoke to a lawyer...and my Dad. The lawyer is my father's friend who is giving me advice for free. If this goes to court, he'll be representing us.

Anyways. Monday, I got a call from a very polite female officer, asking if both my boyfriend and myself could come in to the station to make a criminal report. The first officer to phone me was mistaken - while this does fall under revenge porn, it doesn't fit "sexploitation". She would have had to actually coerce him into sex acts for that.

In my state, this is only a misdemeanor crime. Fortunately, it's a charge for every imaged stolen/shared. It also matters that there are two victims.

The police spoke to the people whose names I provided, most of which confirmed that Sarah had shared the photos. They'll be taking her phone as evidence and they'll ensure that the media is one hundred percent destroyed.

That all made both me and John happy, but as a lot of people pointed out, this stuff could easily already be on the internet.

(All of this has been approved by my partner, before anyone asks)

So I turned around and submitted copyrights for all of it. I spent a shitton of money copyrighting over a hundred images and videos. Then I paid for a domain name and "made" a website - all it says is "UNDER CONSTRUCTION". Then I registered John and myself on several different pornographic media hosting sites and posted "CONTENT PENDING COPYRIGHTS".

THEN. I posted on Facebook.

"Recently, someone I consider a friend broke into John's phone and stole images. She then proceeded to share these images amongst some of my closest friends.

Not only am I disappointed, hurt, and betrayed, but this person placed John in a very disturbing position - one where he had to defend himself from sexual assault accusations. This person DID NOT come to me with these concerns, deciding that she would rather gossip with others under the guise of "concern".

Had I ACTUALLY been assaulted, this person would have been spreading horrible moments of my life to others, taking away my voice as a victim. How horrific, how absolutely monstrous does a person have to be to do something like that?

In actuality, this person stole intimate videos that were, in no way, intended for her. "Stolen" is the best word for this media because, well...

Most of you know me as an entrepreneur; I own a small business, I pick up freelance jobs, I dabble in several money making ventures. None of this is a consistent income, so John and I have been brainstorming on how I could possibly generate a passive income.

So we started making pornographic media of a relatively popular kink. We had generated enough content to finally build an online following, and then our content was stolen and John's name was dragged through the dirt.

Shame on all of you who has participated in this shit flinging and pot stirring.

Because of this person and ALL who participated, I have had to out John and myself as sex workers. I've had to speak to the police, a lawyer, my goddamn DAD. Shame on all of you.

From this point on, any person sharing these COPYRIGHTED images and videos will personally hear from my lawyer.

If anyone has legitimate concerns about my relationship, come to my goddamn face instead of spreading bullshit behind my back.

Thank you."

Since then, I've been receiving non-stop calls and messages from people apologizing, asking questions, and, unsurprisingly, people are arguing about my expectation of privacy on Facebook.

Sarah tried to call but I hit ignore and texted her, "You may contact my lawyer," and then gave her the number. She hasn't responded.

All in all, I'd say that things are looking up. Sarah is, rightfully, being charged with a crime or twelve. John's name is clear legally. Important people in my life know that I'm not being abused.

People are reaching out to John to either apologize for misjudging the situation or to congratulate him on being a porn star.

So that's good, I guess.

I want to thank everyone who gave me good advice and urged me to go to the police and speak to a lawyer.

Edit: To everyone that is saying this is fake based on "the timeline", it is possible to speak to both a lawyer and the police in a four day period.

I submitted the copyrights online from my bed.

Y'all are apparently just bad at adulting. I wasn't going to sit on my ass while my partner's name was sullied by horrible accusations.

I was, an still am, angry. So I got shit done.

Edit edit: I am not releasing the videos.

Another Edit: Since everybody is up in arms about me submitting copyright claims, [this is where I got my information](https://saltyworld.net/how-to-copyright-your-nudes-to-avoid-revenge-porn/)

This is getting out of hand so I'll be logging off. People asked for an update, so they got it.

Copied from a comment I posted:

Nobody seems to understand that this isn't about getting Sarah arrested.

My lawyer told me that, no, John could not get in trouble for what we're doing and, yes, I could go ahead and post on Facebook to try to control the narrative.

He did not give me advice on the criminal case because my interest wasn't - and still isn't - the criminal case. As of now, I've achieved everything I wished to do. The police are going to ensure that the videos get deleted.

I don't give a fuck if she's charged.

ANSWER: Damn. Sarah messed with the wrong girl. You seem awesome. Props for taking control of the situation, and turning the tables on a terrible friend. I hope she pays dearly.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] I (28M) Is about to propose to my gf (28f) of 7 years, but then I discovered something. Need advice.

Hello guys. Im providing an update to my earlier post

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b0h9as/i_28m_is_about_to_propose_to_my_gf_28f_of_7_years/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

I dont think there is a need for me to see her again next week. So here’s what happened.

-She texted me she got home and about to sleep at 11:44 PM (she’s closing deals in another city and has to rent a place)

-I tried to facetime her 11:51 PM just to say goodnight, she didn’t pick up. I tried messaging her but no response.

Remember that spare phone that’s with me where her google account is logged in? I browsed on her activity history quickly to find out what shes up to, and was surprised there’s a “google assistant” command recorded at 11:48 PM.

I played and listened. There’s her voice and a voice of another guy. They were goofing around at the google home device. So yeah.

I confronted her and barraged her with a lot of messages, she only replied at around 1 AM.  She kept on denying she’s cheating.

Then I laid all the evidences, all the screencaps and even the audio clip recording from the google assistant.

She finally admitted.

I am single.

ANSWER: When she comes back from her little single girl fantasy vacation she’s going to realize the enormity of what she’s done. You’re going to have be strong enough to weather that storm.

QUESTION: Can't wait until Thursday....My(48M) wife(44F) is going to be SHOCKED

[\\\UPDATE\\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/)

So, wife and I have been together 17 years.  We are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator.  About two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  So off we got to the GP, who gives us a consult to a Rheumatologist.  Come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  Fast forward to a month ago, when our North Texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  She woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were HUGE, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  And even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  So, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  So, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from Ireland and custom designed, and have words in Gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of "repair", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  She was absolutely GUTTED.  I assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but I could tell, to her, it was.

Begin Sherlock Holmes Mode.  I googled until I couldn't google anymore.  I was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  I searched some more.  I finally found his personal Facebook page, and I message him, and wait......and wait......

I finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her Da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  I express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  I go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  She tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.

Fast forward a couple of weeks.  I get a message on Facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  She explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and MOLDS in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  She sent pictures, and I confirmed that YES - THOSE ARE OUR RINGS!  She said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.

I open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  OF OUR RINGS.  She went ahead and had her BROTHER, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  I asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and I was allowed to keep my old one.  She told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  I asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.

Our "New" Wedding Bands will be here Thursday.

Trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has NO IDEA any of this took place.

\Edit - I rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her I was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed.  The absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to NOT tell her as we tell each other EVERYTHING.  So now I not only need to figure out HOW to do this, but NOT to spill the beans until then.  (Our friends nicknamed us Mickey and Mallory as well as Marshall and Lilly from "How I Met Your Mother", because we literally tell each other everything)

\Edit 2 - I thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where I actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (VA Nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so ALWAYS goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when I originally proposed, I waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and...."waited".....am thinking of a repeat.

\Edit 3 - And to those of you saying "I" am awesome, not in the slightest.  SHE is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends.  She is the reason I breathe, and supported all of us when I went back to school to achieve my two doctorates to advance my career.  She is my hero.  I wake up every day to earn her all over again.  This was one small thing I was able to do to bring her happiness, her joy is why I have a heartbeat.  And I don't give  a good flying f\ at a rolling donut if I seem sappy.  If a man isn't allowed to get sappy over his wife, he shouldn't have one.

TL;DR Wife had to have rings cut off due to swelling from arthritis, I went Hardy Boys and found original jeweler, who had passed away, daughter found original molds/order, and recreated rings without my knowledge and mailed them out.  Was seeking advice on how to give her the new wedding bands.

[\\\UPDATE\\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/)

ANSWER: Your idea of recreating the first proposal is PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

She will be so surprised.... This is so cool.

I’m excited for you :)

QUESTION: Should I [40F] report my niece [17F] to the police?

My parents are going away for Christmas, so before they did they hosted an early Christmas party at their home, which my whole family went to including me my husband and our 16 year old daughter Laura.

My sister and her daughter Rachel were there too. She's a year older than Laura and they don't get along. In fact we try to avoid them as much as we can due to amount of times that Rachel has upset and tormented Laura. Rachel is naturally very smart and is always top of her class, and is also very pretty. While I've always been happy for her and wished her the best, these things have constantly been used to excuse her. My sister even went as far as to accuse Laura of lying because she is jealous of Rachel's looks and talents.

Laura took up boxing last year and has progressed really well. She's going to compete at a higher level next year and her coach is extremely proud of her. My sister has insisted that the boxing is nothing more than ''a phase'' and has gone out of her way to downplay it in favour of her daughter's academic stuff.

At my parents place Laura went to sort out some presents under the tree, and Rachel followed her. She was wearing stiletto high heels, and when Laura had her hand on the floor Rachel stamped on it. She was in agony.

We went to the hospital, and after a follow up visit to the doctor today Laura needs extensive physio, and will not be able to box for an indefinite period. She's in floods of tears because of this.

I was raging at my sister, who is so deluded that she insists that it was an accident. I'm sorry, but after years of calling Laura ugly, stupid, fat and anything else she could think of do you really expect me to believe that this was an innocent mistake? Rachel for her part put on the crocodile tears for everyone, and only her parents believed it.

My husband wants to tell the police and I do too. I warned my sister about this, and she broke down crying too, saying that her daughter's teachers have encouraged her to apply to the top universities because they think she's got a good chance of getting in, and that if she ends up with a criminal record then that will be ruined.

No sympathy from me. Frankly Rachel took something that my daughter loves away from her and left her in huge amounts of pain. She shouldn't just have her chances ruined, she should get locked up.

I know it sounds awful of me but she did an awful thing and needs to face the consequences. Laura is utterly heartbroken and Rachels parents won't punish her.

ANSWER: You should have immediately reported it to the police, although in my experience, they won't do a thing about it.

Definitely file a police report. Even if nothing comes of it, it's on record and can be used against the sociopath when she does it again to someone else.

QUESTION: Update: My (21) little sister (12) was given 1-3 weeks to live. What can I do to make her enjoy her last days?

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5idc1/my_21_little_sister_12_was_just_given_13_weeks_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

Final Update:

I first want to say thank you to everyone who commented and said wonderful things. I got a lot more responses than I had thought I would, so I apologize for not responding to so many of you.

My sister actually survived longer than the doctors anticipated, but she passed away on September 1st. It’s been a very hard couple of days and I’ve been grieving, as has my family.

We were able to use a lot of your ideas and play board games, take pictures, laugh and share stories. I was able to hold her hand and kiss her as she went. She was given pain medicine and went peacefully.

I wanted to say thank you to one redditor who actually sent us board games to play. She normally felt pretty lethargic, but she did get to play and enjoyed it. We will continue to play these games as a family, and think fondly of when she played with us.

My family is now in the process of planning her funeral and laying her to rest. She will always be in our hearts and I know she’s in a better place and not in pain.

Thank you again to everyone ❤️ it will always mean so much to me and my family for all the thoughts, prayers and advice I was given.

ANSWER: Do not stand at my grave and weep  
I am not there; I do not sleep.  
I am a thousand winds that blow,  
I am the diamond glints on snow,  
I am the sun on ripened grain,  
I am the gentle autumn rain.  
When you awaken in the morning's hush  
I am the swift uplifting rush  
Of quiet birds in circled flight.  
I am the soft stars that shine at night.  
Do not stand at my grave and cry,  
I am not there; I did not die.

EDIT: Thank you to all have posted and gifted.  Reading OP's post hit home fairly hard, as my father passed away in 2010 and his birthday is coming up soon.  So I wanted to share this as a reminder to myself and share some solace with OP.  OP, should you read this, take care of you and yours, okay?

QUESTION: My 8 year old cousin accused me of spying on her while she showered

My(17m) family is having a reunion at our house and my cousin(8f) often lies to get people in trouble.

Yesterday I had to use the bathroom and accidentally walked in on my cousin in the shower. I apologized and left but when she got out she told everyone that I was spying on her. Several of my family members believed her while others knew that she was lying. Since they were staying at our house for a week I have to spend the rest of the time in my room not leaving unless I had to use the bathroom.

It’s Aggravating to have almost half of my family think I’m a creep and get punished for it. What should I do

Edit:I didn’t hear the shower running because my hearing aids had died and I didn’t have anymore batteries

ANSWER: Never be alone in a room with her. Try and avoid her at all costs. That's a really slippery slope to fall down. Im sorry you have to go through that.

QUESTION: UPDATE - I think my SIL’s (23/F) best friend (23/F) is trying to get with my (25/F) husband (28/M) and she’s encouraging it. Am I delusional?

My original post got locked because I didn’t use a ThrowRA account, so I made another account to post the update, so it doesn’t happen again (I'll post a link on my old account for proof that this is my new account).

ORIGINAL post for anyone hasn’t read it (the update is below) –

Link –  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ift0zm/i\_think\_my\_sils\_23f\_best\_friend\_23f\_is\_trying\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ift0zm/i_think_my_sils_23f_best_friend_23f_is_trying_to/)

My SIL (23/F) is my husband’s (28/M) half-sister, she was the product of their mother’s infidelity. His father divorced their mother when he was 12 after he found out through a paternity test she wasn’t his. My FIL refused to have anything to do with my SIL but continued to have a relationship with my husband, because of this my SIL is very clingy to my husband. My husband is also very protective of his sister and generally doesn’t tolerate anything negative being said about her, which is why I’m posting this here before mentioning anything to him.

My husband and I bought a house last year which has its own indoor swimming pool. My SIL was super excited when she saw it and asked if she could use it sometimes with her friend. We said it was fine, as long as she gave us a notice before she turned up. Her and her friend (Chloe) have used it many times before but almost never when my husband is home (he is a lawyer and works long hours). With lockdown, my husband has started to work from home. My SIL asked me if she and Chloe could come over and use the pool, I told her I was uncomfortable with them coming over as I’m pregnant and don’t want to accidentally expose the baby to anything risky. My SIL then asked if she and Chloe quarantined for two weeks would they be able to come over, my husband said it was fine.

Two weeks later they turn up to my house. My husband was in his office, so they go straight to the pool after making small talk. My husband ends up coming out after an hour and we’re hanging out in the kitchen. My SIL walks in to get a drink and she starts talking to my husband. Before she goes back to the pool, she says “Chloe’s going to be so happy to see you”. It was weird because my husband and Chloe aren’t close. Chloe comes into the kitchen two minutes later and spends the rest of her time talking to my husband until he excuses himself to get back to work. She’s super giggly and smiley when she talks to him. He would say something sarcastic and she would laugh like it was the funniest joke she’s ever heard. It honestly felt like she was flirting with him. Before she went back to the pool, she gave me this weird smirk-y look. Before they leave, they ask my husband if he’s working from home everyday of the week, he confirms he is.

The next two weeks, they come over to the house to ‘swim’ every single day. Except, Chloe never gets in the water. Instead she hangs around the house in her bikini (she was previously wearing a one-piece if it makes a difference) every single day. Whenever my husband comes out to hang around me, she quickly interrupts him and keeps him talking until he has to go back to work. I made lunch for us all and when I excused myself to call my husband down, my SIL quickly stopped me and said Chloe could call him for me. They shared a look and Chloe looked really happy when she went to get him. Chloe has also started to get touchier with my husband. She’s put her hands on his chest and arms, stands or sits really close to him. To my husband’s credit he does usually create space between them whenever she does something like this.

The reason I believe my SIL is in on this is because she’s made a few pregnancy-related jabs at me recently. She told me a story about how one of her friend’s boyfriends was cheating on her and then said something along the lines of “did you know a lot of men start cheating when their wives are pregnant?”. She’s also made comments about how I look chubby now and it looks weird next to my husband because he’s ‘well-built’. If she spots my husband out of the office she quickly goes to inform Chloe.

I know pregnancy hormones can mess with a person’s brain so I’m wondering if I’m just looking for something that isn’t there. My SIL sent me a text yesterday asking if they could come over to swim next week and I really want to say no but I know she’ll whine to my husband if I do. I ideally want to have a conversation with him before then but I’m not sure if I should mention the flirting.

Am I being delusional?

TL;DR – SIL’s and her friend are constantly asking to come over to use our pool but her friend never swims. Instead, she waits around to start talking with my husband. She seems very flirtatious whenever she talks to him but I’m not sure if it’s just pregnancy hormones getting to me.

UPDATE –

Well, I read and reread all of the comments on the original post to try and figure out how I was going to bring up the issue. Turns out, I didn’t have to. We were watching a movie and my phone lit up with another text from my SIL telling me she was now going to be here at 1pm the next day to swim with Chloe. My husband saw it and told me to tell her not to come. This is really weird behaviour for my husband because he tends to do anything to accommodate my SIL and very rarely refuses her anything. I asked him if something had happened and he shrugged it off and we kept watching the movie.

A few minutes later he paused the movie and said he wanted to ask me a question. He asked if I’d noticed Chloe never swam when she came to our house. I wish I could say I was calm and collected like the comments were advising but… I ended up laughing hysterically. I was honestly just so relieved he’d brought it up instead of me having to be the one to do it. I think my husband thought I was losing my mind.

When I finally stopped laughing, he repeated the question and said he wanted a serious answer. I said, “of course I’ve noticed” and he awkwardly replied “so… you must’ve noticed the other thing too”. To summarise the conversation that followed: My husband hadn’t noticed Chloe was flirting with him the first few days because he was so busy with work, he wasn’t really paying attention to anything else. He said when she started getting handsy is when he suddenly had the ‘light bulb’ moment that she was into him. He says he didn’t want to unnecessarily stress me out, so he never mentioned anything, but he was worried I’d noticed too and thought he was interested because he hadn’t immediately shut it down. He realised we would eventually have to have this talk, but he wasn’t sure how to bring it up (oh the irony). He did privately speak to Chloe and told her he was happily married and wasn’t interested in starting anything with anyone else. Apparently, she never took him seriously because she kept doing it.

In the end, he called his sister on Sunday to tell her either she got her to stop or Chloe couldn’t come over anymore. His sister ended up having a tantrum and said a few nasty things about me/the baby/our relationship. She insisted I was somehow behind his request and made some comments about how I was controlling and insecure because I looked like a ‘beach whale’ and Chloe was younger and hotter. He was pretty pissed at this and said if she said something like that about me again, he would stop speaking to her. She claimed I had baby trapped him and when my husband pointed out we were already married so I didn’t need to ‘trap’ him and that he was the one who wanted to start a family she kept insisting I had manipulated him into feeling that way. She claimed he was unhappy in our relationship and he always looked ‘tired’ because I was forcing him to slave away to fund my fancy lifestyle, whilst I sat on my ass all day. He pointed out he chose to be a lawyer knowing he would have to work long hours and I had only recently left my job, so her accusations were baseless.

She said some other stuff along the same lines but the thing that made my husband finally snap was when she said ‘it’ (the baby) was already ruining everything and it was just going to get worse when it was born and he should’ve dragged me to the abortion clinic whilst he had the chance. He told her neither her nor Chloe were welcome in our home anymore until they apologised for how they’d been behaving and for the things my SIL said. He said he wasn’t sure he could ever forgive or forget what she’d said about our child even if she did apologise and he couldn’t believe she would even think something like that, let alone say it. Apparently, she started crying and said she was sorry, that she didn’t mean it and she was just scared to lose him and that she wasn’t thinking clearly. He hung up on her. He showed me his phone and she’s been calling him and texting him since begging him to reply.

He asked if she’d said anything to me. I was debating whether to say anything or not, but he kept insisting he knew she had said something, and he wanted to know what it was. I told him the things I mentioned in the original post and a few other things she had said. He asked me why I never mentioned anything when she first said it and I mentioned how he got really defensive whenever I said anything even slightly negative about his sister and he… got defensive. I pointed out he was doing it again and after some back and forth he admitted that “maybe he was a little bit defensive when it came to her” but he promised to stop and he wanted to make sure we could talk about anything, including his sister.

He ended up mentioning wanting to try couples counselling. He said it wasn’t because he thought there was something wrong with our relationship but apparently he has been speaking to his dad a lot recently and he mentioned one thing he regretted about his marriage with MIL is that they never went to therapy until the cracks in their relationship were too big. In his current marriage they go, and it’s helped him avoid the mistakes of his first marriage. I agreed, so we’re probably going to try that soon.

My husband thinks my SIL will eventually turn up even if we tell her not to, but he promised he’d deal with her if she does.

So, reddit I guess you were right. I really did just need to speak to him. Thanks for the advice and comments, I enjoyed reading them all.

TL;DR – We talked. Husband already confronted both the friend and SIL. SIL said some really shitty things so we won’t be contacting her for a while. Communication is key folks! ;)

ANSWER: I love a good update, your husbands a keeper!! Good on both of you!! So so so happy it all worked out.

Love you, and your baby, and your husband who is willing to stick up for you and himself and your baby 💕

Edit: my first awards! Thanks reddit friends! ❤️

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (38m) just found out that my brother (19m) has been perving on my wife (37f)

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hy4vqw/i_38m_just_found_out_that_my_brother_19m_has_been/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

This update was long overdue so I apologize to everyone who waited for this. I've had daily messages asking me about what happened and now that I'm in a better place to actually talk about it, I can tell everyone about what happened.

First of all, thank you to the redditors who pointed out that I should tell my wife first before confronting my brother. You were right, she did appreciate the fact that I gave her control over the situation.

I told my wife the next day after posting and needless to say, she did not take it well. She says she feels violated and unsafe in her own home. See, the thing is my wife and I have been together for almost 15 years so we literally saw this kid grow up. We took him out to the movies, to the beach, etc. We sometimes even joked to my parents that he was our practice baby. My wife has a tendency to distrust people in general, as a lot of people in her life have let her down in the past. Imagine how hurt and betrayed she was when she found out someone she trusted and loved dearly betrayed her like that. Honestly, if I wasn't consoling my wife then, I probably would've gone through with the initial idea and beat the ever living crap out of my brother.

After she calmed down and went to sleep, I called my sister and talked about the situation. My sister and I are close, given that we're Irish Twins. I feel like she needed to know cause she has 2 teenage daughters herself and who knows what my brother would do to them if given the chance. We talked and she was clearly mad. She loves my wife like a sister and they're quite close themselves. She said she would support whatever decision we make and that our brother would also be unwelcome at her place for the foreseeable future.

Then we confronted my brother. At first he denied it but when I showed him the evidence, he started ugly crying and begging us to forgive him. I gave him an ultimatum... Either he lets me in his phone laptop and delete everything, or I call the police. There was so much more shit on his computer than I initially thought. So many more stolen pictures of my wife that we're definitely taken without consent. The fucker even recorded the audio of us having sex. Who does that? So after hours of me looking for as much shit as possible, and pretty much clearing most of his hard drive, he eventually left without much of a fight. Oh and we definitely threw out my wife's defiled underwear and are most likely going to have the room he stayed in cleaned professionally.

I checked and thankfully he didn't have any hidden cameras anywhere. Oh and if you're wondering how he got pictures of my wife in a towel... The shower for the masters doesn't have hot water yet so my wife uses the shared one in the same area. She would usually walk out of the bathroom with just a towel on and go change in our walk in closet. This shouldn't have been a problem cause the guest bedroom was in a different part of the house far from the main bedrooms and it had its own bathroom so my brother had no reason for being there.

Needless to say, my wife is still shaken up about the whole thing, which is why I didn't think about writing an update until now. I'm sorry but my wife's well-being is my priority above anything else.

My mom eventually called me asking what happened. She seemed very confused so I figured my brother didn't tell her anything at all. I told her what happened and needless to say, it did not end well. She kept asking me to forgive my brother and take him back in. She ranted about how difficult it would be to support him and how what I'm doing is breaking the family apart. I let her talk till I eventually said my brother would no longer be welcome in my home. I told her that she needed to get him therapy and that until then, there's no chance we would ever see him. My mom told me she'd talk to my sister about it and I said... Good luck, she's mad at him too.

Not sure what's going to happen to our family now. The reason why we got the big house was cause we wanted everyone to come over during the holidays and stay with us but Im not sure if my parents will at this point and there's no chance my brother is ever coming back anytime soon. Thankfully my sister is 100% on my side and we're going to talk about what we're doing for Thanksgiving soon.

My wife hasnt really been the same either but she's getting better now that my brother is gone. We're talking about therapy which is something she's very willing to try out. We took a drive to the beach earlier (chill guys, we didn't leave the car) and talked about the future. We both agreed that after this whole covid thing is over, we're going to finally start our family with kids. We want two. Being a mom is something she always wanted but we both wanted to be financially secure enough to give them a good life and for us to also be in a position where we didn't have to work so much and just spend time with them. The sparkle in her eyes when we talked about our life together with kids told me that while things arent good right now, we're going to be ok.

I honestly can't wait to be a dad myself.

So yeah, long story short brother is gone, wife is still sad, sister is on my side but mom isn't and I'm going to be a dad in a few years.

Thanks to everyone who gave me their advice. It honestly helped me clear my head and make the right decision to tell my wife first.

Oh and to answer questions that may come up...

No, we did not go to the police. My brother deleted everything voluntarily and left without a trace. I'm sure the pictures are still out there somewhere but thankfully they aren't too explicit that it would severely damage my wife's reputation.

And no, we aren't going to try and get pregnant or anything like that. We plan on adopting which is something we both talked about early on.

So again, thanks to everyone who messaged and commented. I may not have read everything nor have I replied to everyone but rest assured you are all greatly appreciated.

ANSWER: How securely did you delete the files? Otherwise they may still be recoverable.

Sorry to see this, friend. It sucks but it sounds like you and your wife (and your sister!) are together in this. That's a good support network to have.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My (20F) sister's (28F) behaviour towards my boyfriend (21M) is horrendous

Previous post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g9j503/my_20f_sisters_28f_behaviour_towards_my_boyfriend/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

(i'm on mobile. i apologize for any mistakes)

Hi. First of all, I'd like to thank each and every one of you for your help. I'm really grateful for the support I've received here and all those little messages some of you sent me really made me understand the situation I was in. The many MANY comments I read here gave me the strength I needed to talk to my sister. Thank you, guys.

I should probably tell you that this might not be the perfect badass ending you all were expecting, and I apologize for that. I've always had a hard time standing up against my sister. Like I said in my original post, my boyfriend doesn't like confrontations either and he's also a huge people pleaser which makes this situation harder for both of us.

Nevertheless, I finally decided to talk to my sister yesterday. She was actually sitting in my living room in her underwear and bra, and I completely lost my shit. I told her multiple times to wear some clothes but she said it was too hot which it was not. She then made a small comment about me being insecure about my bf liking her or something like that, and that made me angry.

I sat her down and we talked. I told her she was making me uncomfortable. She was making my boyfriend uncomfortable, and we wanted her to leave. She looked very shocked by it because I don't think I have ever talked to her like that. She immediately apologized though. She said she didn't know or some bullshit which I wasn't going to fall for this time.

I gave her an ultimatum. She needed to pack her shit and get out in three hours. She looked very emotional and she apologized a lot, said "sorry" a lot and told me she loved me. She said she would never intentionally try to hurt me. If I "misunderstood" her actions, it wasn't her fault. She kept saying she didn't know. She said she was just trying to be "friendly" to my boyfriend which is not true at all.

I asked her if sexually harrassing someone was "friendly" to her, and she started crying. By this time, my bf who was in our bedroom (avoiding my sister and her skimpy clothing) came to support me. She kind of directed her questions towards him. She asked him if she was making him uncomfortable (He said yes) and she cried and apologized. She then tried to gain his sympathy by saying that I was kicking her out when she had no place to go. She also lied that I was always mean to her. She completely ignored me and asked him if she could stay. She had nowhere else to go.

Of course he said no. What the fuck did she think. I will forever remember the look on her face.

So yeah, she actually refused to leave, cried a lot and said she was jobless and she didn't have money, no place to stay, no friends etc. I told her she had no friends because she was a bitch (the first time I said something like this to my sister) She then tried to guilt trip me to let her stay by repeating the words "I'm your sister" "family" "I love you" etc. Me and my boyfriend helped her pack all her stuff and put it next to her car. I told her that she can stay in her car, I didn't care. I wanted her to go.

It wasn't really "epic" like some of you wanted. I was actually crying a little while I was shouting at her because I was shaking so much. At one point my bf had to tell me to calm down. It was just so overwhelming. I'm just glad she's gone.

She did leave eventually. She was calling someone and I'm pretty sure she went back to her own flat. Thank god she's not going to my parents because I don't think she knows how to quarantine. I know she won't quarantine and this was the main reason I was hesitant to kick her out.

2-3 hours after she left, my mom called me and yelled at me for kicking her out. I shouldn't have been shocked when she accused my bf of bothering my sister. My mom also asked me what kind of man I was dating, I should leave him etc. I should've expected that, really. I tried to reason with her but my mom was just angry at me. She asked me things like "how can you do this to your own sister" and similar bullshit she should be asking my sister. At that point I was so fucking angry. I was in tears and shaking. I just told her to fuck off in anger and hung up.

It was just a weird day. I'm proud of myself for finally standing up to my sister, but I also don't really feel like getting up from my bed. My bf is back to his cheerful self and I'm happy about that, but I just feel like such an idiot. I should've realized my mom would never take my side a long time ago.

I just don't understand what I did to make my mom so angry at me. Why doesn't she love me? I have done everything she asked me to do, but she never takes my side in things. I just want her to fucking love me and support me for once. It just never happens and I feel like I'm a fucking idiot for even trying. I think she regrets I was even born.

Anyway fuck that. I'm done trying to reason with them. My mom will never believe me. Pretty sure my sister lied to her so mom keeps calling and trying to speak to my bf.

I'm currently thinking of cutting off all of my family. All they do is make me feel like shit. I deserve better than that. My boyfriend deserves better than that

I apologize for venting. What's done is done. I don't regret it. I'm glad I have my boyfriend and he loves me unlike my family and we finally have some alone time. He's been so moody, but right now he's actually cooking and stuff and he hasn't done that ever since sister came here so yeah. I'm glad she's gone. My boyfriend is glad she's gone. I finally have some peace and quiet in my home.

Thank you so much to everyone. I don't think I can thank you all enough. Some of you talked to me, sent me messages and it really opened my eyes. I'll take care of myself and my boyfriend now. Thank you :)

Edit: thank you everyone. I've been reading your comments. I'm still shocked by the support I've received here. Please know that I appreciate it so much, even though I may not be able to reply. Thank you.

ANSWER: You said not to expect a badass ending but you were a stone cold badass. I'm so proud of you for self-advocating and for protecting the man you love from a sexual predator. I know that must have been incredibly painful but the worst part is over. The infections gone. It'll still hurt, but keep yourself 'clean' and away from her and you'll make it. Well done!

QUESTION: Update: I heard my bf’s parents say racist things about me

[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/goaks4/i_heard_my_boyfriends_parents_say_something/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

I decided to tell my boyfriend what happened. I told him last night, at 2AM. He was livid. I barely had time to finish the story before he started packing our bags. He kept on apologizing for the situation he put me in, and I could see how horrible he felt about all of this. He told me he wanted to talk to his parents about what they said and asked if I wanted to be a part of the conversation or if I’d rather wait in the car. Not being a person who likes confrontation at all, I hesitated but ultimately said I wanted to be there. I just didn’t want to actively participate in the conversation, I was too uncomfortable.

He woke his parents up, sat them down and told them what I had heard. They were clearly extremely uncomfortable and kind of just stared at him, like they couldn’t believe he was doing this. He told them it was unacceptable and how ashamed he was of them. He also told them that when/if we would decide to speak to them again, they better be ready to sincerely apologize and do better, because he wouldn’t tolerate anything else. He also mentioned that their opinion would have no impact on who he would decide to marry. His mom looked like she wanted to say something but he didn’t let her, got up and we left. We were quite shaken up on the ride home, but he took the time to explain to me what he knew of why his parents behaved this way.

Basically, he remembers his parents making racist remarks here and there when he was little (not just about black people but POC in general). He didn’t really know it was wrong until he got out of his hometown and realized his parents were very wrong in their views. With time, he saw his parents less and less, because their views regarding race and other issues just didn’t align with his at all anymore and it would create animosity every time he visited them. When he met me, even before we became a couple and were just friends, he would often post pictures of us on Facebook and his parents would see them. They never mentioned anything. When they learned that we were a couple, they said they wanted to meet me, and he wasn’t sure of their sincerity. He said they talked about me when they would call him, and for a whole year, my bf basically tried to make sure that they were actually okay with our relationship. His parents kept saying not to worry, that they had learned from their past mistakes, asking him to trust them. After a year, he finally believed them and that’s when he decided to introduce us. He was so happy to see how nice and accepting they were towards me. He said it himself, he was too naive.

He was pretty much crying telling me this, but I could tell he tried not to because he felt responsible and didn’t want to make it about himself. Maybe it makes me dumb, but I don’t blame him. I know him, and he wouldn’t put me in a situation like that on purpose. I believe him when he says he truly thought they changed. He apologized numerous times and told me I never had to see them again, and that he wouldn’t either for a very long while. He was already not close with them, and this situation didn’t help at all. He made it a point to say that what his mother said about him wasn’t true (that he wouldn’t marry me because he knows they would disapprove).

We talked about it a lot since last night. We barely slept. And I decided I do want to stay with him. A big majority of the comments under my last post told me that my best option was to leave him, a lot of it coming from POC. And I understand why. But, I do love him very much and I really do not want to leave him because his parents hate our relationship. I think I would regret it. I’m not saying it’ll be easy and maybe I am making a mistake, but I want to be with him. Maybe it’s disappointing to a lot of you, but it’s my decision.

btw I didn’t contact daily mail, they published my post without asking me

Thank you all very much for your advice. x

ANSWER: So glad your bf stood up for you properly! No wavering, nothing; you told him and he immediately took action showing you he was on your side. Good stuff.

QUESTION: Update: My(F24) boyfriend(28) if 10 years has become incredibly secretive of his phone, laptop, social media, and car

[og post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqz54g/myf24_boyfriend_28_of_10_years_has_become/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

So I found out he was cheating on me with an underaged girl.

Yesterday morning after confronted him and asked flat out if he cheated on me. He admitted that he had receive a blowjob from another woman. He said he blocked her on everything, but she kept creating instagram accounts to contact him. I asked why he hid this, and he said he was ashamed and was looking for the right time to say something.

Something in my gut told me he still was lying, so I snuck into his room and stole his phone while he showered, he forgot to take my thumbprint out of his phone. I looked at his most recent texts, and a few hours before he had texted an unnamed number, “I told GF I was cheating on her, we might not be able to see each other for a while. If you need me message me on insta”. I have never been so hurt by anything in my life, I felt my heart drop as I read the text, I looked at past texts and saw pictures of his dick and her body and him saying she looked better than me.

I moved on to his Instagram, and like a lot of people said, he had a second one he used to dm women. I found a conversation with the girl he had been talking to that started in August 2019, and suggested he had been fucking her since October 2019. For at least one year of our relationship he was unfaithful. I checked the girls profile to see if she was better looking than me, and saw in her bio the name of a high school near us and C/O 2023. My stomach turned and I had to stop myself from throwing up. He was fucking a 15 year old girl. At that point I had seen enough and decided to leave the apartment. I screenshoted everything and sent it to myself. I went to my friends place where showed her everything.

I felt so disgusted and guilty. A bunch of the people that commented on my first post spoke about how he groomed me, and I just now am realizing how right they were. If I hadn’t let our relationship continue and told the other young girls what he did, it might’ve stopped him from doing it to other girls. I refuse to look back at his Instagram because I don’t want to know how many young girls I helped him either rape or abuse in some way. I feel so gross for defending him. I also feel disgusted by the fact that it’s very likely I performed oral sex on him hours after he had slipped his dick into a high schooler. That evening we began the process of reporting him and hopefully he will be thrown under the jail very soon. I’m going to try to do what I can to right the wrongs I did with this, and am planning to get an STI test and some therapy to get past this and raise my self esteem again.

Thanks for those of you that tried to help me.

ANSWER: Wow. I’m glad you left and reported him to police! He is a predator and needs to be locked up. Although it may not feel like it, I promise you will be ok!! 💕

QUESTION: I (38m) just found out that my brother (19m) has been perving on my wife (37f)

Throwaway cause I'm still the only one that knows

Background: My brother has been staying with us since lockdown, after his University closed. He couldn't stay with our parents cause they just sold the house and moved to a 1 bedroom apartment and our sister lives in a different part of the country. He was the "oops" baby so I hope that explains the age gap. My wife and I have a 5 bedroom home but currently don't have children yet (we decided to adopt 2 kids in our 40s) so we let him stay here.

My brother has always been... Different. He's a bit of a loner and doesn't have a lot of friends outside of his online group. He's a shy geeky kid but he's otherwise alright (or so I thought) when you get to know him.

So here's what happened

The wifi doesn't quite reach my brother's room so he usually does his school work and other stuff in the dining room. A few nights ago, I was walking to the fridge after waking up in the middle of the night (wife and I sleep early) and saw my brother working on something out and as I got closer, I saw a very compromising picture of my wife (cleavage shot as she was gardening). He noticed me and quickly closed the window like he was watching porn. I was too shell shocked to say anything at that time and he just smiled awkwardly and ran to his room with the laptop.

When I realized that something was up, I knew I had to find out. The next day, I asked my brother to pick up some groceries and some lunch for us and while he was away, I went to his room (something I've never done since he moved) and, well, it wasn't pretty. I saw a couple of my wife's bras and some of her panties which I can only assume he used to pleasure himself. I took his laptop and fuck it, decided to snoop. I knew his password cause I borrowed his Crunchyroll account to watch this anime my friend recommended (I don't usually watch anime).

There I saw some of the most sickening entries I've read. There were pictures of my wife in a towel, her working out, her in compromising positions, etc. All taken without her consent by the looks of it. The fucker even logs every time he touches himself to the image of my wife. The creepiest part? He sometimes listens in on us when we have sex. My wife can be a bit loud but we didn't think it would be a problem since his bedroom was in a different part of the house (guest bedroom).

I left the room feeling like I needed a shower. It was absolutely disgusting.

Now I don't know what to do. I find myself fighting the urge to pummel him into next week every time I see him. I haven't told my wife yet cause I'm 100% sure she will feel violated and disgusted so I want to find the best solution first before doing so. I so desperately want to kick him out but I he has nowhere else to go. Even if I do, what should I tell my parents? The truth? This will most likely break the family apart. I do plan on telling my wife soon but if I do, I can almost guarantee she would want nothing to do with him and would never want to visit the family if he's around.

I'm so fucking lost right now. Any advice will help. Still fighting the urge to beat my brother to a bloody pulp.

Edit: if you're wondering, I did take pictures as proof.

Small update: I told my wife. The redditors who said I should tell her first before anything cause she was the victim were absolutely right. I'm giving her all the power to decide what to do about it. A lot has happened but there are still things that need to be settled. Too long to add here and too incomplete to make a new update post. Hopefully we'll have everything settled tomorrow or the day after. I'll write the update once everything is settled and I calmed down.

No, I'm not going to beat up my brother but I have thought about it.

And to the people asking for the pics... You're disgusting. Hope the women in your life are proud of you. That's my wife, please have some respect.

ANSWER: MAKE A COPY OF EVERYTHING!

Edit: Oops pressed enter too soon everything, but you need that evidence. Take pics of what you found in his room and where you found it. Take it away. Tell your parents to collect him, confront him then kick him out.

He absolutely DOES NOT nor CAN'T be trusted to be in your house or around your wife.

Also tell her ASAP. She'll feel betrayed if you kick him out without telling her. She deserves to know. If you're not telling her because you're afraid of how she'll react then that only proves that he needs to go AND you need to tell her. I'm sorry man.

QUESTION: I [31m] told my girlfriend [30f] that she is not a trophy wife or status symbol and that we are similar in attractiveness, she views it as me calling her old and ugly

A bit of background my girlfriend and I are 30 and 31 respectively. We have been dating for about a year. I work as a high-level engineer at a good firm and my girlfriend works as a payroll specialist at a good firm too. I make significantly more than her (3x).

Things were good in our relationship until I showed her my retirement/savings. She now doesn't see the point of working and has started framing our relationship in that, she is the beautiful one and that I am the nerdy engineer that was lucky to have her. Before, when we met she was all about making it her own way, eventually starting her own company with her sister in sourcing and recruiting. But now she jokes about driving a Range Rover and wearing Lululemon and going to Yoga.

We were having a discussion again about this 'trophy wife' stuff she brought up that I was nerdy back in the day while she was very popular. I told her she is not a trophy wife, that yes she is attractive but its not a huge difference between us.

I told her had it been the case that I met her when she was 22 and I was my current age than sure, but she isn't 22 anymore. After I said that she just started crying like crazy.

She started saying that I think of her as ugly and used up that her best years are behind are. She just told me that if I am not happy to be with her, why am I even here? to stop wasting her time.

I tried to talk to her but she was in no state for a conversation. I don't know what to say, guys, for me, I just wanted to say that I think we are of similar attractiveness. Like I don't think anyone when they see us turns their head and is like oh she is with him the cause of money? Or damn he is so lucky to be with her. I think it's mutual. She was the one that if anything went after my attractiveness first.

&#x200B;

What should I do? I like the fact that we both work and I don't want to change that dynamic. And I don't want her to think too that she is above me that I am so lucky to have her. I want her to think of us as equals and in my attempt to do that I hurt her feelings. What's the next move?

&#x200B;

Tl;Dr- ever since my girlfriend found out about my savings she has more often entertained the idea of being a stay at home wife. She has tried to bring up the fact that she was more attractive than me as justification why I am so lucky to be with her and why I should accept this.

ANSWER: I think there are two perspectives for this:

1) she is insecure and she said that that you guys would be 'equal'

2) she never thought you guys were equal

Edit: OP, what happened?

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (20F) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend’s (27M) phone.

It’s been a long night. Thank you all for staying patient. Also this will be an immensely long post, so buckle in.

First off I just want to say thank you for the massive outpouring of support and love. I’m still trying to work through all of your PM’s because I’d like to respond personally to each of you who were kind enough to send me loving words of support. I have been pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people who have commented and through reading every last one of your thoughts. I never imagined this post would gain nearly this level of traction and visibility and it’s my hope that if I can provide some description of the course of legal action taken and what advice I used from Reddit users, other unfortunate partners who stumble upon CP and find this thread (at least in Canada) will have some idea of what recourse they can take.

I also want to state that for anybody who doubts the validity of my claims, I understand. This is an absolutely fucking insane sequence of events and as much as I wish I had the energy to make something like this up for some arbitrary Karma, I don’t. To provide proof I have sent photographs of identifications and the related arrest paperwork to mods and have worked with them to verify all of what I have written.

Yesterday I was picked up by my best friend Alex around 2:30. We drove around and talked for a while. I went to school, discovered it was closed (my scatterbrain completely forgot about spring break) and then we went back to his house to discuss all of the comments you had been leaving and come up with a course of action. We drank, talked and after a few hours took a short break from staring at my phone to play some apex.

Alex dropped me back off at my house around 930. David was home, in my room, and immediately I noticed how he was exceptionally quiet and distant. He said he had to admit something to me. I prepared for him to admit to possessing CP but instead he told me about how he had taken some photos of me sleeping; he felt really embarrassed about it but he just didn’t know how to bring it up. I feigned surprise and asked him if he had anything else on his phone he wanted to admit to me. He  said no. I asked him to look me in the eyes and tell me that, and he did. I don’t know why I was hoping so badly that he would be honest with me about the CP but I really thought he’d admit to it then and there. Instead he admitted he had been feeling suicidal the last few months but didn’t think he would act on it. He asked me if that changed my perception of him and I said no. He grew quiet again and I left to go shower. When I came back he was getting changed and said he was going to walk for a bit and grab some food. It was about 1030 at this point. When he left, I finally lost it and broke down. I grabbed my cat and hugged him and cried and cried and cried. I was so tired and wanted to shut my brain off so badly.

I grabbed my phone and dialed the non emergency RCMP line for my city. Shaking and crying I explained to the lady on the phone that I had discovered CP on my boyfriend’s phone. She put me through to the report line and I spoke to another Constable who told me I would be contacted by another officer who would provide more details. I waited for around 10 minutes. The officer advised me that he would need me to come in and provide a recorded audio/video statement. I asked if I could do it over the phone and he said no, it must be done in person so that if this goes to court, Crown Counsel has clear evidence that I was not coerced into stating what I witnessed. I don’t have my full licence yet and because of the late time I wasn’t able to make it down there on my own via transit so the cons table said he would come pick me up, asked me if David was there and if I could safely leave without arousing suspicion. Luckily David knows about my close family-like relationship with my best friend, so I made up a lie about how my best friend got in a fight with his dad and he wanted to talk to me about it. David didn’t seem to question it and I waited for the officer to arrive.

He called me from a blocked number and I walked outside and down the block to his SUV. The constable and another officer greeted me,  I got into the front seat and we drove to the station. During the ride I asked him about whether seizing the phone on my own was a good idea. He explained that I had done everything correctly; laying low and getting my thoughts together to take it to police without notifying David. He said if I had taken David’s phone on my own that it would not have been admissible as evidence in court; they would have returned it back to him and he could have deleted all the evidence since suspicion had been roused. It was about 11:15 at this point. They placed me in an interview room and I sat and waiting for about twenty minutes. The officer came back in and explained the process of the interview, that it would take some time and to be as thorough as possible with my answers. He said we could take breaks and brought me some water.

He started off by asking me details about my life, where I grew up, past employment etc. After that portion he asked me about David, what our relationship was like, whether he was nice and kind to me and anything else I knew about him. I told him he was sweet, that he had been nothing short of lovely in the time we’d been together but I did express that things had been moving very quickly. He agreed. He then got me to explain how I came upon the photos in question, so I did. Then came the worst part. He asked me to go through, one at a time, the photos I explicitly remembered details of seeing and to describe it in very, very graphic detail. ie positions of the children, their ethnicity, any identifying characteristics such as clothing, circumcision etc. It was intense but by some grace of God I was able to keep my composure and not burst into tears (mental/emotional exhaustion was fully setting in and I was almost thankful for not having energy to bawl) and provide a clear statement to the officer. He asked me if I would testify in court and I said I would. The officer left a few times during the interview to discuss with his supervisor more questions to ask during the interview and the legalities of the seizure they would attempt. The full interview took around three hours including all the sitting and waiting.

After I had been sitting for what felt like an eternity the officer came in and explained that they felt my interview provided enough reasonable cause to seize his phone and place him under arrest. They explained how the process would go and whether I wanted a no contact agreement.  I said yes initially but the officer asked me if it would be easier to not have one in regards to sorting out his belongings. That made sense to me so I chose not to move forward with the no contact agreement.

We got in the constable’s car and drove down to my house with 2 other officers in 2 different vehicles, 3 in total. I told them I was more comfortable in a squad car than standing outside (I didn’t want to face him) so they moved me to the back of the cop car. I’ve never felt so anxious in my life. I asked them to be mindful of my cats and not let them get outside; they promised they would make sure of that. About 15 minutes later I saw them bringing David out in handcuffs. My heart which had been dissolving in my stomach’s acid all day felt completely gone. I curled up in the fetal position in the back of the squad car and waited to be told I could go back inside. After another eternity (my phone had died by this point but I know it was well past 330) they came back and explained he was under arrest but being released with promise to appear in court at a later date. I was told by the officer I could go back in, and that they would help him find his way back to the place he had been staying previously. The officer gave me a victim services card and a hug and instructed me to snuggle my cats tightly, that I did a brave thing and to be well.

I went back into my house, put Planet Earth on for background noise and called my other best friend Paige who had been keeping up with me about this since I sent her my reddit post. We were talking for almost 45 minutes when my door burst open. It was David. He was frantic, his eyes were wild and he was hyperventilating. My jaw dropped; officers said they would be escorting him back to his prior residence and I was not at all mentally prepared to see him again. Paige asked me if everything was okay and I told her David had walked through the door, I would call her back. Immediately David came to the bed where I was sitting, dropped to his knees and sobbed violently. He said he didn’t know I would be here, he just came to grab a couple more of his belongings. He asked me what the cops had asked myself or told me. I lied and said that they said they had only told me they had suspicions of possession of child pornography. He sobbed more and loudly said “That isn’t me, that isn’t me, this isn’t who I am” and cried more and more. His body was wracked with sobs and he apologized over and over again. It was immensely difficult to witness and I wish I could have told him to get the fuck out but I just sat there immobilized, in shock. It was well close to 5 in the morning and I hadn’t slept or eaten much in nearly 48 hours at this point so my body and brain felt like they were essentially non-functioning.

David began and said that this had been something he struggled with after developing an intense porn addiction in his early 20s. I asked him if he had ever been abused sexually and he said no. He said he knew how horrible it was to seek these images out, but had no inclination or desire to ever touch any children, he had never acted on these thoughts and never would. I asked him why he had never sought treatment before, and he admitted that he was terrified of what people would think, he had no idea what resources to access and he felt ashamed. He said his previous suicide attempts in years prior were directly linked to the fact that he considered himself a pedophile. I nodded. I asked him if they would find anything on his phone that would incriminate him and he said yes, they were going to. He admitted they were very explicit photos and I asked how he even found them; I don’t recall we ever got to that. He promised me he didn’t use my internet to access it but I don’t really believe that. He apologized to me more times than I could count and asked if I hated him. I told him I wasn’t sure that I felt hatred for him but I was sure of being beyond disappointed in his actions; I told him how terribly I felt betrayed and hurt and violated. I expressed my sadness in what he had done, the innocence of these exploited children, how he had so much potential to do so much good in the world and how disappointed this was the route he chose.

Then I heard a loud knock on the door and lights outside my windows. Three officers were outside, two of whom I recognized from earlier and they asked me if David was here. I said he was, and they said they were coming to perform a wellness check because Paige had called in. I realized I had completely forgotten to text her back and let her know I was okay, bless her heart. The officers took David outside and they each asked him if they had any cause to worry about his actions tonight and he promised them they did not. I told them I was okay; that I would finish my discussion with him and if I had any issues I had them on speed dial. They nodded and left.

David sobbed and sobbed for what felt like a millennium and I just sat and well, endured it. Tears just ran and ran and ran from him. He said he knew what he was saying was cliche; that he was sure I expected to hear this great big apology. He said if I thought he was being manipulative he could understand but assured me he was at his rock bottom and wanted me to know how horrible he felt about not only what he’d done, but what I had to go through. I just nodded. There was silence for a long time, I think by this point it was around 8 or 830 in the morning. I don’t know how long I stared at my TV screen that said “Are you still watching: Planet Earth?” but it could have been a lifetime. I had no concept of time or what to do or say or what was the right way to feel. I think David was either silent or had fallen asleep against my bed. I didn’t know or care, I was just numb. I would have probably sat like that until I died but two of my four cats descended on my bed and meowed for food. I got up, fed my little critters and cats and came back to my bed. My brain wasn’t capable of thought so I stared at my tv screen until I passed out sometime around 9.

I didn’t sleep for long because when I woke up and checked my phone it said 11:30. David was awake and crying still. When he realized I was awake he sat up and looked at me immensely pained. I just stared at him. He started apologizing and apologizing more. He expressed his life was over, he had nobody and nothing and that I was his greatest light in life, how he never wanted to lose me. He expressed how much he cared about me and how he would do anything to win my affections back; to get me to give him a second chance. I shook my head and he sobbed, sobbed, sobbed,  apologizing non-stop. At this point I finally asked him to leave. I told him I needed space to sort out my emotions, and I needed to get some sleep.  I asked him if he would be okay. He nodded and grabbed his things. He said he would get out of my life and not contact me if that’s what I wanted him to do. I said nothing. He expressed how much he loved me and again how sorry he was, and that if there was every any chance of anything happening between us ever again that he would be there. He said I love you about ten million times and grabbed his bag and stepped out of my door.

I’ve been laying in bed since then and writing this. I just want this to be over. I just want to move on and figure out how to sort the mess that remains. Also I think I forgot to add that his court date is set for June. As far as sentencing, if he’s found guilty of possession of child pornography I believe he could be sentenced to 18 months max and a minimum sentence of 90 days.  I will post updates again if I feel  they are important; otherwise I will update again in June when he has been sentenced and let you know what charges are laid.

Thank you all again for your support, kindness, and love. I have never in my life experienced such an outpouring of generosity and compassion and I would have been so lost without some of your advice. I’ll continue working on replying to your PM’s, but in the meantime I think I’m going to try and finally get some god damned sleep.

TLDR: Filed a secondary report over the phone, provided a audio/video interview to police and they arrested David and seized his phone. He signed a promise to appear in court in June. He awaits sentencing.

ANSWER: Oh my god. You are so brave and I am so happy there are people like you in the world. You did the right thing. I’m so sorry for your heartbreak and for everything you are going through. Thank you for your strength and your courage.

QUESTION: My fiancé (25M) spent our entire savings (which we both were saving for our wedding and honeymoon) to buy a gaming pc. What's worse is that ever since he got the pc, he has totally ignored me (27F) he has absolutely forgotten that I even exist in his life.

My fiancé and I got engaged in December last year. In January this year, we both together decided to save money every month for our wedding and honeymoon. In 6 months, we saved around $8000. Last month, my fiancé's bestfriend bought a new gaming pc, so even my fiancé wanted to buy one, so he asked me, but I denied it because we both already had laptops. I told him that he can play games in the laptop that he already has. He repeatedly kept asking me if he could buy a pc and I finally agreed to it (now I regret it so badly).

After a week, the pc finally came and with the pc, a new table and chair also was delivered. Apparently he had ordered a gaming chair and a table as well. That night, I asked him how much it all cost and he was a little hesitant to tell me. After a while he told me and I was distraught when I heard that he had spent our entire savings of $8000 to buy the pc. We had a very big argument that night and I scolded him for spending all our savings because that savings contained not only his money but my money as well. And we were saving it for our wedding. After everything I told him, his final reply was "I will earn it all back soon". I don't trust those words at all.

I thought anything worse than this couldn't happen at this moment, but it has. It has been about 2 weeks since he got the pc and since then, my finacé hasn't gotten up from his new chair. Ever since he got the pc, he hasn't even seen my face. The only time he talks to me is when he is hungry, he calls to me and tells me to get him something to eat/drink. I call him to watch TV and he denies it saying that he's busy. I call him to sleep together and he denies it and says that he'll sleep later. His sleep schedule has been fucked. He plays games the whole night and sleeps as 5am and wakes up at 2pm. He's asleep when I'm awake and he's awake when I'm asleep. From the past 2 weeks I've been so lonely that it feels like I'm alone at home and nobody to even talk to. He is ignoring me so much that I think he has absolutely forgotten that I even exist in his life. I honestly feel like his waitress now a days because from the past 2 weeks, the only interaction we both have is him asking for food and water and me giving it to him.

He has also 100% stopped doing all the house chores. From the past 2 weeks, I have been the one doing all the house chores and it's getting very hard for me to do it all alone. We used to share our responsibilities and do all the house chores together, but from the past 2 weeks, he isn't even taking care of himself. He is barely even brushing his teeth and taking a bath, let alone do the house chores. Also he is actually supposed to be working from home, but ever since the pc arrived, he hasn't even touched his laptop to work and he's isn't even seeing his phone to check if someone has called/text him anything regarding work. I'm now genuinely afraid that he might lose his job.

Everything that is happening right now is so bad, I called my parents and told them about it last night and they almost had nothing to say. I'm thinking of calling his parents tonight and telling it to them, and maybe they can knock some sense into him. I honestly don't know what else to do now. I want to burn that pc. It would be very nice if someone suggested me something about this. Thank you very much for reading this and thank you very much in advance for your comments and suggestions.

Tl;dr : My finacé spent all the money that we were saving for our wedding to buy a gaming pc and now all he does the whole day is play video games. He has totally ignored me and he has forgotten that I even exist in the house. He has also stopped doing all the house chores and has also totally ignored his work that he was supposed to do from home.

ANSWER: So.

I game. My husband games. We are both avid gamers - him moreso than I - and he lives and breathes his computer. When I read this post out loud and he heard the amount that your (hopefully ex) fiancé blew on his computer, he asked “Does the computer suck his dick while he games? Does he shit into the chair and it power the computer for him? Even as a hardcore computer gaming enthusiast, I would have to make a considerable effort to spend even HALF of what he did. I don’t know how that’s physically possible even with top-of-the-line hardware. He either grossly overpaid, or he’s telling her that’s what was spent on the computer, but he’s lying and blew it elsewhere because of the amount of unnecessary shit that he had to buy in order to get to that number in the first place. That’s fucking insanity.”

It’s been 15 minutes and he’s still ranting about how unbelievable that amount is to spend on a computer.

If I were you, and my fiancé pulled that stunt, I would tell him to marry the computer since he’s so dedicated to it that it requires all his time and our joint wedding fund.

I’m just going to leave it at that.

QUESTION: I think I got reverse catfished last night

I matched with this girl on Tinder. She was significantly bigger than girls I normally date. But we have literally everything thing in common so I figured I’d give it a shot. So after talking for a few days we decided to meet up at this nerd bar last night.

I get there and pick a table. After waiting a few minutes this beautiful woman comes over and starts trying to flirt with me. That’s very strange so I assume she must be after something. Free drinks, drugs, my kidneys, I don’t know.

So I explain to her that I’m actually waiting for someone and I don’t want to give a bad first impression by chatting up some other woman when she walks in.

That’s when she springs it on me that she’s actually the one I’m waiting for. She told me how she’s lost about 130lbs over the past couple years and she wants to make sure guys are actually interested in her and not just her body.

And she was also testing me to see if I would ditch the fat girl if someone hotter showed up. So here’s the thing, I don’t know how I feel about being “tested”. I don’t want to live my life questioning every decision I make like she might jump out from around the corner at any minute.

But she’s also really attractive and very cool otherwise. I’m not sure how I should proceed.

Edit: I didn’t expect this to be downvoted so much. I guess people just prefer the standard “I just walked in on my fiancé and my father, brother, and best friend all had their penis’ inside her at the same time. Should I still go through with the wedding?”

ANSWER: When you’ve been that big for awhile people tend to only notice you for what’s on the inside. Suddenly losing weight and being valued for your outside can lead to some trust issues. Can you imagine maybe that friend she had for years suddenly trying to sleep with her because she is hot now? Or maybe being ignored at work as the fat girl and now suddenly everyone wants to hear what you have to say because it comes in a pretty package. Her outside package might have improved but she still is the same girl she was before the weight loss. She probably just wants to make sure she is valued for who she is not what she looks like.

QUESTION: Update-My(26M) brother(29M) is married to, and cheating on my best friend(26F) and I’m conflicted if I should say anything.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ivquss/my26m_brother29m_is_married_to_and_cheating_on_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Thanks for all the help I got in my last post. As much as it pained me to do so I decided to do the right thing. Pam should know that my brother is cheating on her.

I decided to give Jim a chance. I called him and told him that, I can’t keep this secret. It was tearing me up inside to do so. I couldn’t think about anything else. I told him I loved him so much but I couldn’t let him do this to someone else I loved like family. He begged me to reconsider. He didn’t try to guilt me or anything. But he did say that he needs his younger brother to just be there for him. I told him I couldn’t. I asked him what he would want if it was me getting cheated on, or our little sister getting cheated. He said that he understood that it’s wrong but he was just exploring himself. I told him that thats no excuse. I told him, that he had until that evening to tell Pam, and if he didn’t I would have to. We then hung up and I just waited.

At 11pm I called Pam and stuck up a normal conversation. I asked her how things were with my brother, she said it was all fine and that, they’re thinking about having kids. I really couldn’t believe my brother made me do this but I had to tell her. I told her that what I saw. She was livid she refused to believe me. Luckily I was able to show her the screenshot of my brother being in someone else’s bed. She then told me she needed to hang up.

I haven’t heard anything from my brother. But as of today, Pam is leaving him. So I guess that’s good, she won’t have to be hurt by him like that, and I can be there for her. My brother hasn’t answered any of my calls or texts, so I don’t know when we’ll talk again.

At least I still have Pam and my sister I guess.

ANSWER: >At 11pm I called Pam and stuck up a normal conversation. I asked her how things were with my brother, she said it was all fine and that, they’re thinking about having kids.

Think about it this way. You not only saved Pam from an awful marriage but you potentially saved kids from being brought into a dysfunctional family, which can cause so many different problems for the child. You did the right thing.

QUESTION: My wife [27] is a flight attendant, I [27M] found lingerie and heels in her luggage

We've been married for almost 2 years now. My wife works as a flight attendant and is often doing long journeys to other countries. Her work has not slowed down during the covid quarantine as I thought it would so she is constantly working and has been tested negative several times now.

Our anniversary was last week and she was not going to be home for it so I decided to give her a surprise card and one of a few gifts, but I was going to bury it in her luggage suitcase before she was about to leave. That is when I found new looking white lace lingerie that I have never seen before, as well as a pair of heels that I do know of because I got them for her. As soon as I saw it there was ringing in my ears and it felt like the world had come to a halt. I have been trying to come up with reasonable explanations as to why she would have it, but none of them are in character for her as far as I am aware. That's why now I am fearing the worst, infidelity. She doesn't know I saw it because I didn't leave the gift and card but she has been back home since then and gone again. I am going crazy with the thoughts of her with another man but I don't have concrete proof before accusing her. I don't know how I'd even get solid evidence. Reddit please help me on what to do now because I am in a very bad place emotionally right now

ANSWER: Part of me wants to tell you to wait until she’s back and tell her you’ll help unpack her luggage, just to see what she does or if it’s sill there/used/whatever.

But I can only imagine the thoughts that would go through your head. Just not knowing an answer and having to live with it is too much to deal with.

Confront her

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My girlfriend has been sleeping with my roommate.

Don’t know how to post a link to my original post. You can find it on my profile.

First of all, thanks to everyone. While there were some rather unpleasant responses (like the guy who called me a pussy for being upset or the woman who messaged me to say that if I couldn’t satisfy my girlfriend I should let better men do so because she deserved it) the overwhelming majority were kind and sympathetic. I couldn’t respond to most because there were so many but I assure you, you are appreciated.

I talked to my landlord who was sympathetic and offered me another apartment if I continued paying my lease. It’s an informal arrangement where I’m still legally residing and paying for my old apartment but staying in another.

As expected, my now former friends took my old roommates side and I’ve cut them out of my life.

I’m not doing the best I could be mentally. I’m all alone and dealing with personal insecurities, loneliness and heartbreak. Still, at least I’m out of my earlier situation. I’ve taken a week off work and arranged to see a therapist.

All in all, my situation isn’t great but it’s unlikely to get worse and I’m working on improving it.

EDIT: I have been completely overwhelmed by the response to this. I have literally hundreds of messages of support and lots of comments urging me to stay strong. There is no possible way I can respond to all of them so I just wanted to say thank you to everyone. You’re all amazing!

ANSWER: I know you’re probably feeling a lot of sorrow and anger but don’t let it destroy you. Eventually you’ll look back on it and feel grateful that it happened. I went through a situation similar to that and couldn’t be better today. Just face your problems head on and move past them. Consider yourself liberated from somebody who doesn’t deserve you. Stay strong.

QUESTION: My (28F) Stepsister (29F) slept with my ex-fiancé (37M) and married him. It’s been 5 years and my family think I should be over it already.

I changed some minor details for the sake of remaining anonymous. Also, sorry this is so long once I started writing I found it cathartic and couldn’t stop word vomiting all over the post. TL;DR at the bottom!

When I was 23 (now 28), I was engaged to Ryan (was 32, now 37). Our engagement ended when my stepsister Kelly (was 24, now 29) begged me to leave him because they loved each other but Ryan was too afraid to break up with because he didn’t want to hurt me/my family. When I confronted Ryan about it, he denied it, said she had been trying to come on to him for some time and he never mentioned it because he didn’t want to ruin our relationship. He begged me not to believe her and so we continued how we were. Kelly grew resentful and made nasty comments about how I was forcing a man who didn’t even love me to marry me because I had low self-esteem constantly. A month later, she sent me a video of them having sex in my bed and multiple screenshots of him telling her he loved her, how he wished she was the girl he was marrying, how he hated that I wouldn’t let them be together. I was devastated and angry, but my best friend convinced me not to go nuclear on them and instead to quietly move out when Ryan was at work the next week. So that’s what I did. I contacted my dad and my stepmom and asked them if I could move in temporarily. I removed the money I had contributed into our joint account for wedding expenses and transferred the rest to him before closing the account. Once I got settled in, I sent all of the screenshots she sent me to all of our relatives and his.

Ryan tried to get back together with me multiple times, but I ended up blocking him when I found out he had proposed to her with the same ring he gave me (I left it behind). Now Kelly is my stepsister from my mom’s side. I have another stepsister (36) and stepbrother (38) from my mom’s second marriage and a half-sister (26). They all went to the wedding. Whenever I tried to express I was hurt by the fact they were just supporting Kelly/Ryan as though what they did to me meant nothing they would shrug it off and say they couldn’t cut them out completely because they were family. I haven’t spent a single holiday with my mom’s side since, neither has my older biological brother or sister. I only see my mom and half-sister when I invite them over to my place as Kelly/Ryan moved in with my mom and my stepdad a year after they got married. Our relationship is very rocky, but I’ve grown closer to my dad/stepmom and their children (an older stepbrother and two younger half-siblings), who have all been very supportive since this all happened, so it’s not all been bad.

On new years day my boyfriend (now husband) proposed to me. We had a small engagement party which I invited my mom and half-sister too. They never turned up because I was “excluding half of our family”. I never invited my stepdad or stepsiblings because they were pretty hurtful when it came out that Kelly/Ryan were sleeping together. They claimed it wasn’t their fault I got in the way of “true love” and made me out to be some sort of vindictive Disney villain for being angry with them. We were planning to have our wedding ceremony this summer, but in late February my husband suggested we postponed until next year because he was concerned COVID would get worse and we would have to cancel/reschedule anyway. I ended up finding out I was pregnant a month before our original wedding date, so we had a courthouse wedding on that date with the plan to hold the ceremony next year. Only my dad’s side of the family were aware of both the pregnancy and the wedding.

My stepmom likes to knit so she’s been making some stuff for the baby. Recently, she posted about the things she had made on facebook with a caption talking about how excited she was to have another grandchild soon. I was tagged in the post. I have zero issues with the post. I never told my family I wasn’t going to inform my mom’s side, it wasn’t that I intentionally hid it from her she just never seemed very interested in my life/relationship so I never brought it up.

My mom called me an hour later to demand to know if I was pregnant and how she couldn’t believe I hadn’t told her she was finally going to be a grandmother. She has since invited me and my husband over to her house multiple times, I’ve declined every single time for the obvious reason. My stepdad, who I’ve barely spoken to in 5 years has reached out to tell me how excited he is to meet the baby and my husband, same with my siblings. Even Kelly reached out to my husband to congratulate us. I was furious.

The next time my mom and stepdad called me I finally laid into them. I told them I didn’t want them to keep inviting me over when they knew I would be forced to see Kelly/Ryan if I came, I told them how hurt and angry I still am over what they did to me and how my ‘family’ dismissed my feelings, I told them how they wouldn’t throw Kelly/Ryan away but they were so quick to leave me out to rot whilst I was going through the worst betrayal I’d ever experienced in my life, I told them I wasn’t even sure I wanted people like them in my child’s life.

My mom was crying hysterically and kept saying I was being cruel, and I couldn’t deprive her of her first grandchild. The thing is, my baby ISN’T her first grandchild, my sister has two adopted daughters already who my mom doesn’t even try to bond with. She kept wailing about how I might be the only person in our family to even give her grandchildren (my stepsisters are both having a hard time getting/staying pregnant and my half-sister has proclaimed herself to be child free).

My stepdad got angry and defensive. He claimed I was petty for holding onto something that happened 5 years ago. He pointed out how I had found someone else so I should understand how love works and sometimes two people just can’t help themselves. You love who you love, basically. He said Kelly/Ryan were happy together, so I should be happy for them the way they’re happy for me and my husband. The ironic thing is my sister told me Kelly/Ryan looked like they were on the verge of divorce and they argue constantly (my mom complains to her about them) and how my siblings all hate him but pretend they like him for Kelly’s sake.

I ended up hanging up because I was so angry and when I get angry, I start crying, I didn’t want them to think they got to me.

Since, I’ve been receiving texts and calls nonstop from my mom’s family. They’re all essentially telling me I should be over things already. It’s gotten to the point me and my husband have switched phones so he can screen my messages for me, and I don’t have to read them.

TL;DR – My stepsister slept with my ex- fiancé and married him. I’m now happily married to someone else and we’re expecting our first child together. My family thinks I should be over it already since I’ve moved on, but the anger is still there, and I have no interest in forming a relationship with my ex or my stepsister again. They’re now putting pressure on me to try and get me to forget it ever happened.

How do I make my family understand just how unforgiveable what Kelly/Ryan have done to me is? I would prefer not to go completely no contact but is that my only option here?

ANSWER: > Just out of curiosity did you mum and stepdad have an affair?

I'm pretty sure they did but my mom denies it whenever we've asked.

QUESTION: (Final Update) My [22f] boyfriend’s [24m] new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile

[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b6fd8u/my_22f_boyfriends_24m_new_tattoo_makes_me_feel/)

[Link to update](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b78m0s/update_my_22f_boyfriends_24m_new_tattoo_makes_me/)

&#x200B;

Super long post incoming so apologies in advance.

I wasn't going to bother with this update but after all the support and love I received from people in this sub I feel like the least I can do in return is give some closure for anyone wanting it. Before I begin I just want to thank everyone who gave advice, I didn't respond to everyone but I read almost every response. I stopped reading my Pm's because a lot of the messages I was getting were graphic and negative but I appreciate the few of you who were positive and helpful in your messages and I'm sorry if I didn't respond to you. Now on to the update:

It's been a crazy week and a lot has happened since our argument. My bf spent two nights at his sisters and during this time I decided to just send him a link to my reddit posts instead of writing him a letter. I felt like everything I needed to say was in those two threads and it would be good for him to read people's opinions. His sister read through them too and that started a massive argument between them that revealed some shocking information that led to my bf coming back home and completely breaking down.

We spent the whole night talking where he revealed he's been using a lot of drugs recently and drinking a lot more to deal with his grief. He told me he feels responsible for his brothers death because while I was pushing for us to file for custody he was on the fence about the idea and now he feels his brother would still be alive if we had filed for custody over him when I first suggested it. He said because of this he's been developing a lot of feelings of resentment towards me (I don't really understand why and neither does he) which he recognises as being unjustified so he's been bottling them up along with everything else which essentially led to him flipping out when I brought up his tattoo. Obviously I knew he was having a hard time dealing with his brother's death but I must have been viewing the world through rose coloured glasses because I never would have realised how bad it was if he hadn't told me.

I was really hoping it wouldn't be the case but unfortunately a few of you redditors were right on the mark. He regrets the tattoo and discovering I wasn't happy with it either sent him over the edge into panic mode and he tried to use it as an excuse because the very idea of regretting the tattoo or wanting to get rid of it makes him feel even guiltier. Truth is he hates the tattoo and he tries not to look at it at all. He apologised about a hundred times for reacting the way he did and for not considering he was making me look at the tattoo in general, as well as during sex. He completely understood where I was coming from when I brought it up, he just reacted the way he did because he essentially had a "mental breakdown" in his opinion.

I apologised for my "jack off" comment. Initially he was quite shocked and did take the comment as an insult but after reading the reddit post he understood what I meant and was very forgiving. He apologised for accusing me of never caring for his brother.

We then talked about the argument he had with his sister...

Up until now I was under the impression that my bf went on his own to get the tattoo done, but it turns out his sister went with him to his first session and it was her who convinced him to get a portrait on his chest whereas my bf originally wanted to get a drawing of his brothers favorite stuffed animal. Not only this but during their argument it came out that his sister wanted him to get such a drastic tattoo because she was hoping it would cause a rift between us. Apparently she felt like I was tearing their family apart by trying to file for custody and she doesn't want me dating her brother anymore.

If that sounds totally ridiculous to you, it's because it is. Not defending her actions, what she's done is absolutely deplorable, but a history of mental illness bipolar/schizophrenia does run in their family. We're certain his sister suffers from bipolar disorder as well, or possibly something else, but she refuses to be diagnosed.

My bf didn't go around to all our friends, that was his sister lying. She was the only one he told and he's promised to set the story straight for any family members she mentions it to. We've both apologised for what we said and we're going to stay together and work through things together.

In the short term we're going to be getting in contact with a grief counsellor and try out some of the suggestions for how to make things less awkward in the bedroom. In the long term we're going to consult a tattoo artist to see what can be done in terms of lasering it off/turning it in to something else. Bf doesn't feel comfortable lasering it off and currently his favorite idea is to get a heap more tattoos to try and make it less noticeable. I'm a fan of this idea as well.

As for his sister, bf is currently debating whether to cut her out of his life or not. I don't think he should, I feel like he's lost enough family but I'll respect whatever decision he comes to.

I think that just about wraps everything up. A huge thank you again to everyone for all your advice and help, it really helped me get through this horrible and awkward situation.

I mean this in the nicest way possible when I say I hope I never have to post on this subreddit again.

tl;dr - We both apologised for what we said in the heat of the moment. Boyfriend revealed he regrets getting the tattoo and it was his sister who convinced him to get it in the hopes it would break us up. We're seeking grief counselling and considering getting more tattoos to make the current one less noticeable.

ANSWER: I’m so glad for you guys that this worked out. Grief counselling sounds like a really positive step forward. 
Wishing you all the very best for your future, whatever your partner decides to do with his tattoo and his sister.

QUESTION: (UPDATE) My stepfather killed my mother and then killed himself. I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, I guess in some way I wanted to give you people an update on what has been going on with me. When I posted my first post, I was slightly drunk, it was the night the police showed up at my house and rang the doorbell and I was confused. All of your messages, messages from random strangers, helped me in some way. I’d like to thank whoever sent me that poem by Mary Elizabeth Frye - Do not stand at my grave and weep, we used that for the invitation to her party. And also Bianca who painted that beautiful painting of her which she sent me by email. Thank you.

Also, fair warning, this might be quite a long post, this might trigger someone and I’ve been writing this post over several days as more information keeps trickling in and the picture of that night is becoming clearer and clearer. I think I'm also mainly writing this for myself.

What happened that night (the 22nd of July) is just still so surreal.

I'm sitting at my mothers desk right now, in her little office in our apartment that I grew up in, in Berlin. Her presence in some way is all around me. It has been 23 days since the police showed up in front of my door at 3 in the morning and asked if they could come in. Since my stepfather hung himself. Everything has been so confusing

It's all sort of a mixture between crying, screaming, yelling, throwing things, and just emptiness. I go through phases (someone linked that famous post about grief and god it's so accurate) and it's really hard to cope. Since that night I haven't ever actually been alone. This is somewhat exhausting to me in some ways but probably also very important.

I’m going to go through the series of events and facts because I also want to set it right, since in the media (since some of you found the articles online and connected the dots) there is so much false information, it’s hard to believe.

My Mother and my stepfather were together for 8 years and he has only been living in Berlin since then. He has children from his previous marriage, that is all I will say. I am my mothers only daughter.

He did not call me and confess to what he did (as many report) but he called some vaguely mutual friend who he walks his dog with sometimes. This was some time after 11 PM. At this point he was already up at the summer house. It takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes to get up there. This means my mother had been dead for about 2 hours (it says so in the police report as well).

The summer house did not belong to my stepdad, but to my mom. She poured all of the little money she had and renovated it by hand. It does not in any way belong to him.

The police showed up at my moms and my apartment late at night, they didn’t know the address of where he might have gone and were also worried he might come and harm me since he had the keys to our apartment as well. I was watching a movie with a friend of mine.

I posted on reddit a few hours later, the news articles started coming out the next day, connecting my stepfather to a celebrity. I posted because I needed help.

This celebrity and my stepfather are by no means „friends“ they are acquaintances and there is no reason for him to be brought into any of this.

That was wednesday night/thursday morning. On friday I was at the LKA (criminal police) and gave a 3 hour statement about them and their relationship.

(This next part is about my feelings and mainly about my mom, feel free to skip it)

Since then my whole world has been turned upside down. My mother, the person I honestly loved most in the whole world was just torn from me. It feels like I have this big bleeding hole inside of me. I’m not crying all the time, sometimes I feel ok, but more like empty.

My mother has been with me my whole life, the whole 21 years and I’m not just saying this because she is dead, she is honestly the best mother you could wish for. She is goofy and caring, her laugh is infectious, she has such integrity. She is the most animated person, when she tells a story she will get up from the table and gesture all around. Her eyes are so shining. I think I might show some pictures of her, because I want people to recognise her beauty. I want the whole world to know she is gone. Because this is an honest and devastating loss to the world, believe me.

She is so talented. She got her bachelor in Art History in America, she has worked odd jobs all her life. She’s always been a hippie. When I was little she started working at this English-language summer camp in Thüringen in Germany and she used to take me there for many weeks with her, on a hill, on a farm in the middle of a giant forest.

She’s a magician in the kitchen, she can open the fridge door and magically make something out of leftover ingredients that nobody would ever think tastes good (noodles and carrots anyone?).

She likes to make everything herself. She would let milk go bad and make her own ricotta, I have a thousand jars of her homemade chutneys and jams. She baked her own bread years before the pandemic. She made her own vinegar, her own syrups and alcohol and her hot sauces are legendary. I used to come home and open the fridge door and I’d ask her which of the many bowls she had covered with little plates were edible, and which weren’t ready yet.

Since she’s dead I have found so many started experiments of things I don’t even know what they are. I wish I could ask her. There are so many things I wish I had the time to ask her. Writing this is making me cry again.

At the beginning of the pandemic, March I believe, I moved back in with her and she ordered 14 different bottles of white wine on Lidl and every night we’d drink one together while we cooked and I’d write notes on the color and the taste and we’d give it a 1-10 on the Lidl scale.

She’s one of the funniest people I know. And she is so forgiving. Even when I was younger we would get into huge blow up fights sometimes and we’d scream. But five minutes afterwards she’d come into my room and she’d apologise and tell me she loved me more than anything in the world.

We told each other we loved one another all the time, sometimes just randomly and hug each other. I’m so so grateful for this.

I would say we had a rare mother-daughter bond. I love her with all my heart, she has always been my idol, my role-model. If I’m even half the person she is, as generous, hilarious, creative, emotional, forgiving and understanding, I will be lucky. I see her face in front of me all the time. I can hear her laugh.

Fuck, I’d really give anything for her to be with me right now. Anything. It really tears me apart.

If it weren’t for her, I would have probably been dead 1 1/2 years ago. She pulled me out of my dark holes, she loved me unconditionally. She isn’t just my mother, she is my best friend. And I will never ever forgive him for taking her from me. Especially since more and more facts are coming out.

(End of emotional bit)

It’s important to preface that I knew their relationship, or to be more exact, I was the closest to both of them together. And it’s important to understand that he wasn’t some creepy, abusive, scary bad guy.

I loved him. He was like a best friend to me. When he came into my mothers and my life, I took him in with open arms. I’ve confided in him, I’ve told him secrets, we’ve had running jokes. We made bets with each other that I usually won and he had to pay up. He was my family.

This makes me feel just as conned. I feel cheated. I feel like I’ve been blind. I’ve had bad fights with him as well and I knew about their fights but I didn’t see this coming, not even a little bit.

I would never put my mother in harms way. I guess this is why she must have kept things hidden from me.

The murder happened in his apartment (they had separate apartments) and afterwards he drove his car up to my mothers country house that they both spent every weekend at. Hunting mushrooms, planting and building things, going swimming in the lake thats right in front of the door. This was their refuge and I’m assuming this is the reason he went there.

Since the day this has happened I’ve always assumed he blew up about something, lost control and he killed my mother while he wasn’t clear headed. This is what made sense to me. That he killed himself because he killed my mother. Because he didn’t know how to continue.

But the more time goes by and the more facts we uncover (we being my mothers friends and I, not the police), the more it seems it was the opposite.

That he killed my mother because he wanted to kill himself. And that he was covering something up.

Since the night the police showed up, they’ve been asking me if I could know where their laptops are, they both had a laptop. And both are missing. They found the empty cases, but they’re gone.

This sparked suspicion in us. His phone is gone as well, my mothers is not, the police gave it to me. Then there are the other facts. (TRIGGER WARNING) Despite what it said in the media, she didn’t have multiple stab wounds in her chest. There was only one very precise and very small wound that caused her death. He only let someone know what he did after he was up at the house. When he arrived at the cabin, he apparently parked normally, even greeted one of the neighbours.

The pieces are falling into place. That this was cold blooded.

I don’t really know why I’m writing all this down in a word document and why I’m going to post it on reddit, but I need to share.

I feel so much hatred and so much anger. I feel it boiling underneath my skin and it keeps threatening to come out. I’ve smashed so much stuff, I’ve gotten so angry. Sometimes I snap and I scream at people and other times I just cry and beat my pillows. And sometimes I’m very calm. I can still feel joy. And my mother has this amazing circle of friends that I’ve known my whole life and who are supporting me. I saw her body in the coffin and I will never be able to get that image out of my head. She was so tiny, it breaks my heart.

I’ve also slept two nights at the cabin and in the dark every shadow looked like my stepfather. I’ve become scared and started locking my doors at night. Murder used to seem something so far off, something that happened to other people, in a different world, separate from mine. But now it’s not. And I won’t let him spoil her place, her house. I won’t let him take that away from her and from me. I refuse.

I just miss her. I miss everything about her. It hasn’t been that long yet and all I want is for her to hug me and say my name and say she loves me and that she thinks I’m an amazing young woman. I want her to cuddle with me in bed which she did for so many years until I felt myself too old.

I want to sit at the kitchen table in the morning with her and have her ask me what I dreamt about last night and have both of us talk about our dreams. For her to talk with me about my story ideas and my poetry and to talk with her about the book that she was writing and will never finish.

It just hurts so much, I don’t know how to ever get past this. She has always been the most amazing person I know and I can’t get over this. I don’t know how to get over this. I feel lost. I feel like I have to grow up very fast now and carry her with me.

Theres so much more to tell. So much. But I should probably stop somewhere. I would appreciate all advice.

Thank you for reading.

ANSWER: Hello again. I [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hw6zxn/i_dont_really_know_what_to_say_the_police_just/fyy4wjl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) on the original post because I went through something so similar.

I want to thank you for the update; it couldn’t have been easy to write. But more than that, I’m glad to see you on Reddit just to know you’re still around.

The part of this post that most struck me was you spending time in the cabin. I remember the days in my father’s house after his murders and suicide so vividly, and looking back on it, I wish I hadn’t gone there at all. Which leads me to this: you don’t have to do things the hard way. You don’t have to make things harder on yourself. When grief as raw and shocking as what you’ve experienced takes over, we sometimes want to swim in it because at least feeling something is better than remaining numb, feeling hollow. But I want to lovingly and gently encourage you to make sure you’re taking care of yourself.

I also want to reiterate how useful a trauma-informed therapist can be. I was dead-set against therapy after my father’s crimes happened. I thought I could handle everything on my own. After all, I’d always been the “strong” one. I waited a year to find a counselor, and if I could change a single thing I did, it would be that—I’d have sought out help sooner. I didn’t really know how to ask for help at the time—it took me years to learn how—but it would’ve been immeasurably useful to have someone help me through all of that.

Like you, I was in my 20s when my father killed his girlfriend, her daughter, then himself. That was sixteen years ago. There is a life on the other side of all of this trauma and heartbreak. I promise. And the book I just finished writing about it was finally handed in on the last day of July. Maybe someday it can help you (and others).

I have thought of you many times since your first post. My offer to reach out at anytime stands. Any. Time.

Edited to add: quite a few people asked about the book in this thread and via DM. It’s with my agent now, so at earliest it would be out in a year (books take forever). The title is We Run To Crush The Grass. Thank you for the interest, but please focus on OP. She needs the love and kindness of strangers.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My best friend wants me to work with my rapist on her wedding

OG post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hxyq72/my_best_friend_wants_me_to_work_with_my_rapist_on/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

First of all, thank you so much for the support on my first post. I did not expect it to gain that much attention. I guess a lot happened since then? I don't know if it's even been a week yet. But this is going to change my life, perhaps for the better.

There were hundreds of comments, and I'd thought I'd address a few questions regarding the rape itself. I don't appreciate how some of these were asked, but I'll share anyway for the sake of clarifying things.

1. Was I under the influence? Yes, but I remember vividly saying no. I was drunk enough to have all my strength and mobility wonky but I didn't black out or anything. The force he used on me didn't seem that of someone who was drunk, he looked completely sober, but I could be wrong. I remember a couple of times when I was trying to lift myself off the bed and he would push me back down, I remember the expression on his face. Like you guys said, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.That's all I'm willing to share for now, the only person who knows all the details is Tina. Is it bad that I wish she knew nothing now? Maybe it would hurt less.

2. Why didn't I report it? Because I saw how that turned out for other girls I knew. I've had a few other friends (not Tina) who have had the same thing happen to them and nothing came out of reporting it, and it made them feel worse. Just the few comments calling me a liar stung, so I can't imagine how I would have felt back as my unstable teen self. Not only that, I was scared of what Rod would do if he found out I had reported him. There was just something about him that made me never want to cross him.

Reading all your comments, it seems pretty clear that how Tina was treating me was extremely inconsiderate and I should find a new friend. Although it was a huge slap in the face, I came to my senses and believed that I couldn't be around someone who would do that to me. Some of you said to expose them during vows, but that's just not the kind of person I am, and it might not turn out well. A few of you gave me example texts I could send which I am extremely thankful for, but I decided to send this.

"I've had time to think about it, and I just can't be your maid of honor anymore. It's so hurtful that you are telling me to pack up my trauma for who knows how long until your wedding day.I just can't do it. I don't think I will come at all knowing that he's going to be there. I'm sorry."

It's pretty weak, but it's probably the "meanest" text I've ever sent. An hour later, I get a call from Josh. He asked me what was going on with me and Tina, and that she was extremely upset. A part of me snapped and I said "I don't know, what's going on with you making someone who raped me best man?" I don't usually blurt things out like that. He was confused and I repeated myself. He was silent for a few seconds and then asked if he could come over. I was a little wary of the idea but I said sure.(I know, we should be social distancing but this really needed to be discussed.)

He comes to my apartment 40 minutes later without Tina. I have never hung out with Josh one on one before, it was always with Tina. Josh always had a really cute and sweet personality, and I've always approved of him when it came to dating her. He was really only a friendly acquaintance to me though.

We sat down and spoke for over an hour.

Tina had told Josh that the reason I wasn't coming to the wedding was that I didn't want to work with Rod...BECAUSE I HAD A CRUSH ON HIM...and thought she was forcing the relationship too much. So basically, she said we had a petty girl fight. My jaw hit the floor and I was fuming. She had obviously never told Josh what Rod did to me. I shared that Rod had raped me back in high school, and that Tina knew about it. I asked if he knew too.

He said he didn't, but at one point Rod did mention that a few "crazy bitches" falsely accused him of rape senior year. This obviously didn't include me, since I only told Tina and a few family members.. Josh believed him at the time, but I guess after hearing ME say it it's starting to dawn on him that his friend was a liar.

Here's something that I didn't expect...Josh shared with me that he was raped when he was a kid by an older brother of a friend he had. He said that if he was forced to work with said brother on a wedding, he would absolutely refuse. He apologized heavily on behalf of Tina, but I won't forgive unless she says it herself.

I know some of you may think Josh is lying, but I believe him.

I could see it by Josh's face and body language that the realization really weighed down on him, and I felt bad. In a way, we were both going through a betrayal. I asked if he was ok to go home, and he said yes. He thanked me for telling him and left. I don't know if I'll stay in touch with him, but I was beyond furious with Tina at this point.

I was expecting an angry text coming from her, and sure enough, I got it at like midnight. She went off saying that I'm gonna end up destroying their marriage, how could I do that to her, etc etc. I just pressed the block button and went to bed. Quickest decision ever made.

I'm feeling a little down in the dumps right now, yet slightly relieved. I'm going to try to connect with other friends and try to move on from this. If I'm feeling brave enough, I might try to find these "crazy bitches" and see if we can make a case against Rod. Knowing that there are other victims makes me feel so guilty I want to scream. Sorry it's not too happy of an ending, but I think it might have been more unhappy if I decided to go along with it. Thank you Reddit.

ANSWER: this is a somewhat wonderful update.

while disappointed to see your "friend" (tina) failing at being a friend, it brings me great pleasure to see josh is a great human being and you are no longer working with this scumbag named rod.

you just saved yourself a lot of headache and emotional pain and probably saved josh from a horrible person. win win really.

EDIT:

Mistake - apparently i forget the names of shitty animals

QUESTION: I (14M) hit my (16F) cousin and now my family is upset and no one but my dad believe me.

I know based off the title in being judged extra hard. I don't condone hitting a womann and if i could go back I would. What's done is done and now my family is in turmoil.

So my aunty and uncle came to my house to talk to my parents. I though this was stupid because of Covid but they went ahead and came anyway. They brought my cousin who we will call Carly.

Me and Carly get along fine but yesterday we did not. We started to argue about about a game system. It was a stupid argument of who got the good controller and bad controller. Everything went down hill when I would not give her the good one (It's my system).

She tried to take the remote from me, but in the process slapped me across the face with her nails. I started bleeding so I got up and walked to the bathroom. I don't know if she had an adrenalin rush, but all I here is "MY NAILS!". She grabs me and punched me in the face. In the heat of the moment, I punched her in the stomach and she fell over screaming.

Her dad comes up the stairs and without asking any questions b-lines towards me. He grabs me, then my dad came and grabbed him before he could hit me. Him and my dad were yelling pretty bad. My mom and aunty are talking to my cousin.

My dad tells them to get out of his house. As of right now I have gotten text messages and phone calls from my family calling me a woman beater. My dad is the only person to believe me. My mom is saying she believes me, but is acting cold.

How do I fix this and stop my family from braking down even more? I blocked my cousin and her parents, but I don't know what to do know. I also feel like my uncle really wants to fight me.

Edit: I changed female to woman

ANSWER: I say this as a mom of daughters you absolutely have the right to defend yourself. Girls don't get a free pass to just punch you in the face and beat on you because you're a boy. Had you really beat her up it would be a different conversation maybe but you met her force with equal force. You didn't start the physical altercation but you should not just be expected to take it. A man should never hit a woman, but a woman should also never hit a man.

QUESTION: I (18F) found out that my mom (42F) has been lying about why my dad (45M) "abandoned" me 15 years ago. I don't know how to move forward.

For most of my life I was just raised by my mother, since my father left us when I was 3, and we are very close. My mom has always been vague about the details of the divorce, just that it was very painful and sudden, and that he never had interest in getting custody of me.

A couple months ago I was going through documents looking for my birth certificate, and I came across their divorce papers. Surprisingly, my mom was listed as the one who filed for divorce, contradicting her story that he left us. I figured there must have been a reason for this, like him being abusive, but I know that my mom is sensitive about the topic so I didn't want to bring it up. I asked my aunt, her sister, but I was just told to drop it.

It's been bugging me, so I found him on Facebook. His profile was completely private, but his profile picture showed him with a little boy, who must be my brother. I found his business email online, and against my better judgement I emailed him asking if he would like to meet for coffee. He agreed.

Last week we met, and he was completely not what I was expecting. He was THRILLED to see me, almost cried, and wanted to hear everything I had been up to for the past 15 years. I asked why he left, and that's when I got his side of the story:

Towards the end of their marriage, my father confessed to my mom that he is bisexual, and that during high school and college he had a serious boyfriend. He was ashamed of his sexuality, which was why he hid it from my more traditional mom. My mom was angry, but didn't divorce him because of it. After the divorce he began dating his boyfriend again, and my mom freaked out over me being "exposed" to this. My mom petitioned for full custody, and was granted it. Over the years my father has attempted to reach out to my mom about me, but she has never budged.

I asked my mom about what really happened, no bullshit. I told her dad's side of the story, and she tearfully admitted that it was true. She insists it was not out of anger or bigotry, but because she genuinely believed that it was best for me to stay with her.

I am just so shocked still. She lied to me for years, making me think my own father did not want me. My dad and I are reconnecting now, but I have missed so much. Next week I am going to meet his husband and my 7 year old brother. I live with my mom, but I can't speak to her right now. She is begging me to forgive her, but I'm so angry and I don't know how I'll ever not be angry with her.

ANSWER: I’ve never been in your situation, but one thing I’d suggest, given such a big event happening to you, is to give yourself time and allow yourself to not to have to make any decisions for a while

QUESTION: My (25M) girlfriend (24F) did not appreciate my reaction to seeing her naked.

There is currently this trend on the tiktok app of girls surprising their man by walking into the room naked, and filming their reaction. I've seen these videos before and normally the reaction is the man gets a smile on his face and they obviously get it on.  It's cheesy, romantic, funny, whatever.

My girlfriend is working from home during the pandemic and I work in the hospital. I got home from a 12 hour shift of potentially being exposed to covid-19, and just wanted some beers and to go to bed. I guess my girlfriend thought she would get the same reaction when i walked in the door and saw her naked.

I barely had enough energy left to give any reaction let alone a good one. I basically just told her i appreciated the gesture but i was exhausted. She got moody at me basically comparing all these other tiktoks where the man gets excited to see their girl naked. I told her all these tiktoks have men working from home, not walking in the door after a 12 hour shift in a hospital during a pandemic. She then took this as an insult at the fact that she's currently working from home, when this wasn't my intention at all.

Since this happened a couple of days ago, she's acting like i don't find her sexy at all and giving my sarcastic answers. What do I even say to her?

ANSWER: I’m a pretty insecure person so I can understand why she feels upset because she’s feeling rejected.

However, my boyfriend also works as a paramedic for 12 hr shifts too and I know better than to try to get affectionate or do silly things like this right when he gets home from work. Because same as you, he has to do his whole shower, decontamination process and is probably starving and exhausted. Even before covid, this was a thing.

I think there’s a middle ground here where you let her know you certainly didn’t mean to make her feel rejected and that you think she’s beautiful, but she has to “read the room” and realize that when you get home from work you’re not going to have the ideal enthusiasm that she’s obviously looking for. She needs to learn to cut you a little slack and realize you’re not an object that needs to give her attention whenever she feels it’s the right time without any thought to how you feel. I think you guys can have a respectful conversation that provides some reassurance but also lets her know she needs to adjust her expectations a little bit because you’re only human.

Wishing you luck and thanking you for everything you’re doing, seriously. Take care of yourself.

Edit to add - I think it’s also okay to let her know it’s okay for her to feel rejected, but it’s what she does with those feelings that matter. The second you tell her you appreciate the gesture but you’re exhausted, she needs to learn to have a little bit of empathy and let that guide her reaction other than her knee jerk insecure habits. Sometimes if a person is feeling insecure they take every little innocuous action from their partner as a sign that the belief they have about themselves (that they’re not good enough) is true.

QUESTION: Boyfriend won’t stop telling me I have B.O.

I have been with my boyfriend for over a year and everything has been great except for one thing. 
Every single day, at least once, he will tell me that I stink and smell of b.o.

When we met I showered every day, applied regular deodorant in the morning, brushed my teeth three times a day. Now I am so paranoid about smelling bad that I shower at least twice a day, I apply new industrial strength deodorant every few hours (I have a reminder on my phone), perfume,  and I brush my teeth anytime I eat or drink something that isn’t water.

I feel like I’m going crazy. I didn’t think I smelled bad in the beginning and I don’t think I smell bad now but I obviously smell bad to him right? Im that weirdo that keeps “sneakily” smelling their own armpits. I have been to the doctor and he has said there is nothing medically wrong. It has honestly gotten to the point where I literally shove my arm pit in friends and families faces asking if I smell bad, they all say I don’t smell like b.o. at all, one friend even said I smelled too clean like a lush store.

I am getting so paranoid. He won’t cuddle or anything when he says I smell. I really don’t know what more I can do?

Update  - so unexpected edit. I waited for him to make a comment this morning so I could talk to him. It was less than an hour after waking up that he said “god you stink” I had already showered and put on deodorant. 
I snapped and asked what exactly was he smelling because, at this point I’m one of the cleanest people on the planet and if I still smell bad to him then we should just break up.

He got all  panicked and upset, I eventually got out of him that this is what he father always said to his mother. Apparently his father told him that is was a sure fire technique to have a woman never leave you because “she will feel too low to cheat, will love only you, and will always be clean”.

Needless to say, his father is wrong. He’s packing his things and moving out of my house today.

ANSWER: Holy shit, that update. His father basically groomed him to be an emotional abuser. So glad you ended that; hopefully he learns from this.

Edit: clarity

QUESTION: My(20f) boyfriend (22m) assumed I was into rough sex because of my race and now I feel unsure about us

My boyfriend and I was going to have sex with each other (it was supposed to be my first time but not his)
Things started off normal, kissing. Then he started pushing me on the bed and holding me down, no foreplay or anything. I was obviously shocked and scared because I didn't expect that. I was screaming stop and no and he stopped. He looked confused and asked what was wrong. I told him like wtf, I thought we were gonna go slow. He was still giving me a confused looks and at that point, I was annoyed. I reminded him I was a virgin so I would prefer to take things slow. He said he knows that but he thought I'd like it rough. He also told me he's never been with a black girl before and he thought black girls like rough sex. I was mad and I said no, I'm not ok with rough sex and I was mad he used a stereotype on me. I didn't want to have sex anymore and I asked if he could just leave me alone so he left.

I'm just so confused like how is this even real. I've never even heard of that as a stereotype. Idk if it's a porn thing or not (I don't watch porn, just not into it) but even if that's a thing, I'm mad he just assumed things about me. He knows I'm a virgin but he still was rough with me. I'm unsure now bc idk what else stereotypes he has about me bc I'm black.

Edit: he's blowing up my phone asking me if we can talk about things and saying sorry. I feel bad for not responding but I keep thinking what else he thinks about me. I feel empty inside because he turned into another person when he got rough. He went from sweet to cold and scary. I think once I'm calm, I will talk to him.

Edit: all of these messages have been overwhelming. I'm going to call him now and hear what he has to say. I will update after. Thanks for the advice, this has been very helpful.

Okay last update cus I can't make a new post and this is getting really cluttered with replies.

So we talked for a while. I'm done with him. I read the comments and I decided to hear him out, I gave him the benefit of the doubt that he didn't mean to hurt me. He told me he thought black girls like it rough bc his friends girlfriend like that (she's black) and the porn he watches. I tried explaining how that's racist to think that and consent. He said he was sorry for rushing into it but he was raised in a racist community so 'give him a break'.

I tried explaining that's not an excuse to act out his fetishes on me especially without asking. He got mad at me and I was too. We argued and then I broke up with him.  I am really upset rn, I thought he loved me but I guess not. All I wanted was to share a special moment with him and he ruined it. I told my friend and she said to give him another chance but I disagree. What he did was too weird and creepy for me to forgive him. Anyways thanks for all the advice, I should have just broke up with him immediately but oh well, too late now.

ANSWER: You have a ton of answers but also, I just want to say I'm proud of you. When I lost my virginity at 17, I wasn't as confident and assured as you are now. You knew how to communicate and you knew how to shut things down. That is a hard fucking skill and I am proud of you for exercising it.

QUESTION: [Update] I walked in on my son having sex with my brother's wife

Original post
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqhhan/i_walked_in_on_my_son_haveng_sex_with_my_brothers/?utm_source=reddit-android

On mobile

I first want to thank everyone for all the advice I got from my original post, im sorry for not replying to any comments, (I think I only replied to one comment) my head was all over the place. I'll try to keep this update short.

As was suggested by many of the comments I decided to tell my husband first and proceed from there, my husband lost it(he first thaught it was a joke). We talked about the issue and we decided we should first talk to our son before telling my brother.

We confronted our son with what I saw, he already knew what was going on as he saw my reddit post and put 2 and 2 together, he didn't deny anything he confessed, he told us him and SIL have been having sex since February last year( he was 17 at the time). My son said it started on SIL's birthday  party he attended they got drunk and had sex in a bathroom and they have been meeting at hotels ever since and sneaking off at family gatherings.

After my son's confession my husband just lost it and told my son to leave the house and go and to our condo in town as he didn't want to see him in front of him at this moment. When my son was gone my husband stormed into my brother's room and told my brother everything( SIL was not in the house at that moment).

My brother lost it and packed his stuff took the kids and left, he asked where my son had gone he said he wanted to teach him lesson, we didn't tell him and he eventually left. SIL didn't return I think my brother might have called her or my son warned her and she is afraid to come back(her things are still in the house).

In all the screaming and shouting my daughter's heard everything and are devastated that their family might be ruined they miss their brother and are afraid my husband won't ever let him in the house again.( my husband hates all forms of infidelity to the core and has always drilled this in our 2 eldest children that they must never cheat on anyone or be in a relationship with someone in a relationship)

I know I did nothing wrong in this but how will I ever look my brother in the eye again, he won't answer and calls or text my husband said i should give him time to heal. My son has left the condo because he is afraid of what my brother will do to him and is now hiding at a friend's and he won't tell us which friend. No word on SIL.

INFO: SIL was the one who initiated sex the first time my son and her slept together, she was the one booking hotel rooms, buying my son dinners and lunches, my son was even receiving an allowance from her.

ANSWER: The fact that your son won't tell you where he's at and nobody knows where your SIL is, has me thinking that they may be together.

QUESTION: Should I (48m) tell my wife (44f) that I received a sex tape of her in the mail?

Throwaway.

This is an odd thing. Wife and I have been married 20 years. I’ve never suspected her of cheating and our sex life has been outstanding.

First of the year, I receive a package in the mail. It’s a DVD addressed to me, and a typed note that says “your eyes only”. It’s my wife having sex , separately, with three guys. She was younger, much younger, based on body and appearance and hair style it was around the time we were going out—either before, during, or after we were engaged (she grew her hair longer for the wedding and kept it that way).

First I’ve no idea who sent it to me other than one of those three guys in the DVD - none of which I know. I’m assuming it’s one of my wife’s ex. Second I’ve know idea why they sent it. Are they trying to say she was screwing around on me? The tape isn’t time stamped so I don’t have a frame of reference. She kept her hair short for years until we were engaged so it could have been during a block of time, certainly before we dated.

And also what are they trying to achieve if this was taken before we dated? I know my wife had other partners. Hell I had three times the partners she did before we married but that was 20 years ago I think we’re past that. But apparently this person or persons isn’t.

The whole thing is strange. I’m not sure what’s going on. I haven’t told my wife, I’m not sure how she would take it. She’s very sexual and adventurous but I don’t think she’d like the idea of her past catching up to her. But I don’t think I’ll get to the bottom of this unless I tell her.

EDIT - update. I’m overwhelmed by the responses. Thank you for your interest.

I did speak to my wife yesterday afternoon. Some mentioned letting her watch it in private and I gave her that option. She did and we talked at length. Some of it is a bit clearer now.

The two “amateur” looking videos are two roommates, taken on the same night. That’s why the camera doesn’t move and that’s why the room is the same.  I asked why the bed looks different and she replied the sheets were a bit messy so they changed them before they had another go.

The other is a boyfriend she dated when her and I met, before we actually started dating. She knows this man is friends with one of the before mentioned roommates and thinks it’s him who got the three videos together and sent them to us.

Why?

She admits that last summer he tried connecting with her on Facebook. When she did he tried to make it sexual again so she stopped. She thinks he sent the DVD to cause an issue with us.

For the first time I now have doubts. Her answers are logical but seem a bit off to me. And honestly I may be just upset that she did two guys in one night - I know it was 20 years ago but that’s still hard to take call me shallow if you want. Also she didn’t seem shaken by the DVD or the fact I had it, merely irritated that this person sent it. I had the idea she’d rather I didn’t have it but now that I did, oh well.

It still leaves many questions unanswered, such as why the tapes are from 96-97 and the DVD was made in 2013 but I’m just getting it now? That many be minor but it may be everything. Plus how does this gentleman know where I live - Facebook doesn’t give you that information. Being in contact with someone does so now you see why I have doubts.

Thanks to you all for your concern and feedback. I love my wife and cherish her, and her past is her past, but for some reason it’s slapping us in the face right now. I will take some time between the two of us to figure out what is truly going on.

EDIT II - I want to clarify something. I’ve been getting a lot of feedback, mostly negative, where everyone is irritated with me that I’m upset with my wife for being with two men in the same night. None of my business, it was 20 years ago I should man up, that sort of thing.

Look, i said it was hard to take. Most men understand their partner was with different people before them. But SEEING their spouse with two men on the same night is hard to handle. I didn’t say I was changing my view of her, or leaving, or any other angst you want to put on me. It’s just a difficult thing for a married man to see and realize. I’ll get past it , but it’s not an easy thing. And for everyone who says “it was 20 years ago lighten up” I challenge you to sit back, grab a beer and watch two young men have intercourse with your wife on the same night and see how you feel about it. Frustrated at best. You won’t love her less but you’ll not feel great afterwards trust me. So thanks for everyone calling me an asshole but until your in that position I’ll ignore you thank you very much .

FINAL EDIT - this will be my final edit. Thank you all for your support but all I will say is, it’s time for me to make some decisions. I hacked into my wife’s Facebook account - childish and immature I’ll admit but I did it nonetheless. And I found things disturbing enough that I need to think long and hard about what I do next. I’ve given her the benefit of the doubt through this entire thing , now a shadow had been cast and I’m questioning her more than ever before. Heartbroken is putting it mildly. It’s time for me to work on my life and my self. Thanks to everyone and their interest .

ANSWER: definitely tell her! if her past is coming to catch up with her, she should be aware of it. also, youll never know what really happened until you ask.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My (40f) husband (39m) admitted to me that he has been cheating on me with his cousin for a majority of our marriage.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/icia89/my_40f_husband_39m_admitted_to_me_that_he_has/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

I want to first say that I appear all of the support I’ve received after posting my first post. I have thought a lot on the suggestions that I’ve been given and decided to go forward on some.

I’ve talked with my mother about the situation and she’s agreed to take in my children until this situation is dealt with. I’ve also approached my husband about divorced and put my demands about wanting full custody of our children as well as the house and other things. He hasn’t put up a fight regarding any of those and has agreed to it.

It’s been really hard into swallow all of this and I’m looking for a lawyer now to help with the divorce. My mother has also suggested to keep the real reasoning of our divorce away from our children as long as possible, especially my eldest daughter (14).

This’ll be my second and last post of this matter. I again want to express that I really appreciate all of the helpful comments and suggestions. Thank you all for the support. ❤️

ANSWER: Sorry you are going through this. Sounds like a mind fuck. I hope for the best for you and the kids.

QUESTION: UPDATE TO: I found out I have a daughter who thinks I was her mother's rapist. It wasn't rape. What next?

Ten days ago I requested advice and the post got removed after a day because I didn't use a ThrowRA.  I'm reposting it below, along with an update, since some people asked for one. I alerted the moderators I would be doing this, so hopefully it will allowed.

ORIGINAL

I received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a DNA match and she is my biological daughter. It was a long and emotionally charged letter. She said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish I had caused her and her mother and grandparents. The letter was gut wrenching.

I was shocked but also skeptical. I have been married 25 years and I have three great kids. I have never raped or abused a woman ever! I thought this had to be a prank or scam. I had done home DNA ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child I wasn't aware of. But when I logged into my account, there she was.

I did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, Terry (fake name), I had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  We broke it off mutually and remained friendly. The very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. It was a casual hookup and I remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. Also unprotected. Afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. We both went home the next morning for summer break. Terry didn't come back to college the next year, which I gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer.

One of the reasons Terry and I were incompatible was religion. She was Catholic and I'm Jewish. I was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. My supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a Jewish ex-boyfriend. But who knows, maybe she had other reasons.

It kills me that I have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. I can't imagine growing up thinking I was a product of rape. That has to be so hard psychologically. I am in pain for a child I didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.

I have been debating what to do. I have not written back to my daughter. I badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). My wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. My best friend says I should hire a lawyer. I don't know what to do and it's eating me up. Advice, please!

UPDATE

I hired a lawyer. He recommended that I respond to my daughter's email to unequivocally deny the rape allegation. I wrote her a short message and described how and when Terry and I met. I was careful not to attack Terry and to offer sympathy. I explained that our sex was consensual. A week went by with no response.

Two days ago my daughter wrote me and said Terry now claims she was raped a month after she and I had sex, and that she was told by her doctors that the baby was born premature 8 months later. She's basically saying she was misled by her doctors. I find that very hard to believe, but if it's true it is awful and if it's not I guess it gives Terry a way out without exposing her big lie which is maybe best for everyone.

Yesterday I spoke to my daughter for the first time. She was crying and so was I, so it wasn't easy to say much. Before we hung up, I told her that I loved her because she's my flesh and blood, and I hoped we could get to know each other and meet my grandchild. She sobbed so much after that, and said she's been waiting her whole life to hear those words.

My wife and I told our kids about a week ago. They are teenagers and took it really well. All three are interested in meeting their new sister and niece. My wife....my beautiful, caring, bestest friend ever....she's been nothing but supportive. She has offered that we invite my daughter and granddaughter to visit over the Christmas holidays, even suggesting we pay the airfare and offer them our guest room. My daughter is going to call me again tonight and I'm going to propose she come, or offer to fly to her if she's more comfortable. We have a lifetime of catching up to do.

Meantime as for Terry, I feel like my daughter and I were robbed, but I really don't want to dwell on it. She hasn't reached out to me and I don't plan to either, though I'm prepared to be cordial if she does, and to listen to her story and be open minded.

EDIT:  I'm overwhelmed by all the love coming at me from Reddit. Thank you all for your support, compliments and helpful opinions. Really, really.
I promise I will post an update!
Silver and Gold! Feels like I'm Burl Ives. Thanks, kind strangers.

ANSWER: Well damn. All I can say is that I am so glad that you have a wife and four kids who are so open minded. This is a situation that seems like something straight out of a movie, and I cannot imagine the kind of stress and anxiety and sadness and everything you have been feeling as a result of it. I'm really pleased to hear that things are turning out well with those who matter the most: your spouse and your children, despite the awful lies of another person. I wish you all the best!

Edit: and your grandkid! How could I forget the grandkid.

QUESTION: Terrified that my (25F) husband (28M) has been having sex with me while I'm asleep. Now I'm pregnant.

For some  context, I have a serious medical condition that requires some pretty heavy medication. It does a lot of things, including destroy my sex drive, and knock me out for long periods of time. My husband and I were married before I was diagnosed, and he's supported my through diagnosis and treatment. He's a wonderful man.

We used to have a very active sex life, and it has been a considerable strain on our marriage that I never feel in the mood. I feel like a terrible wife in this regard, and I miss being able to do what we both enjoy.

To be clear, when I take my medication, I am dead to the world. You could blast a fire alarm next to me, and I wouldn't wake up. You could pick me up and toss me around, and I might not wake up.

Lately I've felt worse than normal. Really sick, dizzy, uncomfortable ect. I went to my doctor, scared I might be sick with COVID, and it turns out I'm pregnant. 5 weeks.  But I haven't had sex with my husband in at least two months. Maybe more. I did not cheat on him. I was not assaulted by anyone, anywhere, that I know of. This was not immaculate conception.

I told my husband and he was surprised. It's probably a million in one chance I got pregnant, due to the medication I'm on, and my condition. He was shocked, then excited, and I was just so relieved he didn't accuse me of cheating that I didn't stop to consider why he didn't.

It's been a few days. I've been thinking about when I first started taking my medication. It was hard for him to adjust to me not wanting to have sex, and he used to joke that I could just lay there and watch tv while we do it. Or, and here's what makes me scared, he used to joke that he could just have sex with me while I'm sleeping, and that way I don't have to deal with it, and he can be satisfied. He's mentioned this a couple of times, but always lets it drop when I'm not okay with it.

I've started thinking about all the times I woke up in the morning and had uncomfortable pelvic pressure that usually only comes for me after I have sex--my husband likes to be rough and I don't really mind, we were always pretty wild in bed or adventurous. Or bruises I've had that I can't explain.

I confronted my husband about this. About me being scared he did this to me, and at the least why he wasn't surprised the dates don't match up. He was angry I would accuse him of something so horrible, and insists that I'm just misremembering the last time we had sex. The medication does play with my memory sometimes, but I remember the last time we had sex. I remember every time we have sex now because I don't enjoy it.

I don't want to panic. I don't want to talk myself into being convinced he's been having sex with me while I'm asleep, and I don't want to talk myself out of this possibility just to protect our marriage. But I'm terrified. This is the only possibility I can come up with. And if it's true, I don't know what to do. I've been heartbroken for a while over the idea that I wouldn't be able to have kids. Now I'm going to have a baby and I'm so, so happy. But what if this baby happened because of what my husband did?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I think my husband has been having sex with me while I'm asleep because of my low sex drive, and now we have a miracle baby that may be a byproduct of it.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I just wanna say the response to this has been insane. Thank you so much to everyone. I'm really lost and I don't know what to think or do. I'm going to take some time to think about this, get additional information and resources depending on however this is going to go, and figure it out.  Just to be clear, however, because there are too many responses to answer directly, NO, I have never given permission for my husband to have sex with me while I'm sleeping. YES, I have asked him if I have ever instigated something while asleep, sleep walked, sleep spoke, or did anything in my sleep related to sex, and he answered no we have NEVER had sex outside of a time when I was fully cognizant and aware of what's happening. And YES, I am keeping the baby regardless of what happened. If people are interested, I'll post an update when there is something to write. Again, thank you, thank you for all the support and opinions. They all matter.

ANSWER: Have you had a dating ultrasound yet? The first appointments generally use your last period date along with general ovulation dates to determine how far along you are, and then they will do an ultrasound to see what stage the fetal growth is at to confirm.

Because 5 weeks and 7-8 weeks (with your estimate of 2 months), I just wonder if perhaps you're a little further along? I don't want you to doubt yourself,  but a couple weeks is not a lot to be off by...

I also would talk to your dr to figure out your memory lapses, because sex a week or two later and remembering it a little off could be possible.

But listen to your gut, you know you and you know your husband. Cover all of your bases until you feel safe.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My [24M] girlfriend [21F] keeps threatening to kill herself if we break up.

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hitc7k/my_24m_girlfriend_21f_keeps_threatening_to_kill/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Some of you guys have been asking for an update in my messages so I figured I might as well make a post, although it's probably not the „happy“ ending most of you were hoping for.

It's been about a month since my original post and pretty much all of you told me to break up and not to worry about her doing that. I wanted to do it. And I tried.. but it was just the same thing all over again. She started to cry, she kept calling and leaving crying voice mails that she's gonna do it. I just didn't know what to do. So I told her that we can stay together... but I'm just so broken.

She was always being mean to me and she always bullied me, at least for the last 2 years or so. She calls me ugly, makes fun of me and always tries to humiliate me. I was used to do that and I just kind of took it as it were. That I can't do anything about it.

But lately she started hitting me. Now, I'm 6'3" and she's 4'11" so it's not that it's painful physically, but it just hurts emotionally so much. Whenever we get into an argument she punches me in the face. Or in the stomach. I'm just broken and lost. I've lost all my confidence, I lost all my friends because she didn't like any of them. And it just sucks.

I just accepted that this is how my life is and it's probably not gonna change. I'm so sorry for disappointing everyone who believed that I can do it.

I'm sorry.

Also, I'm not from the United States. The Police won't assist me in the break up, they don't have any 72hr psych and they told me that they can't do anything unless she actually tries to kill herself.

EDIT: I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna drive to see her tomorrow, take my parents with me as support and I'm gonna end it. I just can't anymore. Thank you guys.

[update on the situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hxmh12/update_my_24m_girlfriend_21f_keeps_threatening_to/fzflu41?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

ANSWER: You need to leave without her knowing or set yourself a time limit and block her number, because you are actually in an abusive relationship.

I am 1 year free of mine now, he would always threaten to kill him self. It was unbearable thinking he might do it, one night I came home and there was a shotgun on the shoe rack.

One day I couldn’t take it any more, I jumped up without a word and just started packing and didn’t stop. The entire time he screamed, cried and hurled abuse at me, even threatened to kill ME then himself.

I just kept going, my heart was in my mouth and I was shaking the entire time but I didn’t say a WORD. I didn’t even look at him, just kept packing my overnight suitcase.

I ran out of the house, called a taxi, jumped in and never looked back. I blocked his number when I reached my destination and had about 70 messages, all the same bullshit. Don’t get me wrong, he did try to contact me for about 6 months, but each time I just blocked and blocked again without even reading the messages. Now, I hear nothing from him. I know he’s not dead as I would have heard by now.

I’m not saying there isn’t a possibility that your girlfriend isn’t serious, but I AM saying that it is 100% not your problem and 100% not your responsibility.

When you get into a relationship with someone you sign a verbal and spiritual contract. You agree to be respectful, to be courteous and to care for that person. You are a team and you are equals, and you should never deliberately hurt that person. 
If you do deliberately hurt that person you’ve broken the contract and essentially forfeit the right to be in that persons life, yes they may forgive you but they are under no obligation to. There is no way to get back trust once it’s broken, no matter what people think.

Your girlfriend has broken the contract and continues to put herself before you, she does not value you, she does not love you, she does not respect you. She only values, loves and respects herself. She wishes to control you in any way she can, and she has found her way. She will NEVER release you from these bonds, you must release yourself. It won’t be easy, but it WILL be worth it, because believe me there is a life outside of this and outside of her.

If you stay, you will regret it for the rest of your life, I swear to you.

QUESTION: My(28M) wife(27F) left me for 3 months and recently begged me to take her back, I said no and no everyone seems to be against me, I need some advice strangers

Well let me give some background information as the situation will be hard to understand without it.

7 years ago I got married to the girl of my dreams Denise(Fake name), we had been dating for 2 years before that and it was like a dream come true, that changed after our marriage. After our marriage she constantly started feeling down and out of it and eventually I got her to go to a doctor who sent her to a therapist and from there we found out she had depression to do with things from her past that she was trying to forget. I decided to be as supportive as I could be, I took care of most of the house work, despite working 40 hours a week and told her to just get herself in order and if she needed to talk to me I would be there for her.

That was 6 and a half years ago, before she left she was still depressed, she basically only lays in bed and complains, she does nothing, we had no intimacy, no sex, no cuddles, no going out, my entire day was filled with work and house work. Day in and day out I worked my ass off, came home to a mess of a house and started cleaning up, starting dinner and so forth at the end of the day I was exhausted and all I could expect was for Denise to unload more of her trouble on me and complain about herself, me and everything around her. I could not even hang out with my buddies to get away from it all as she would relentlessly call me saying she was scared and everything so I also had no social life, not that I had time for it anyway...But despite it all I pushed through hoping that sooner or later she would break out of it and we could have a proper life together as I loved her and as they say for better and worse and this was quite clearly worse, possibly the worst it would ever be.

4 months ago she got a new therapist and 3 months ago that therapist suggested she needed time away from me as her depression started when we married so I may be the cause of it, the moment she told me I was crushed, I started doubting myself, blaming myself, worrying, but beneath it all this creeping sense of having done everything for her, having sacrificed years of my life as a cashcow and a servant for her to lay in bed and this is my thanks? It is my fault now? But I rejected that feeling, trying to talk through it, but she decided to leave and stay with her mother, saying she needed time away from me and that I may be the cause of her depression and so forth, honestly the entire argument is a blur in my head.

I spend the next month when she moved out calling her, her family, begging and humiliating myself just to get her back, apologizing for everything I may have done wrong, honestly I was close to ending it all as I was so hopeless at that point. But that month passed and as it passed I couldn't help but feel relieved, I came home and it was quiet, I could indulge in my hobbies which I had not done in years, the place was not a mess every time I came home, I could relax and two months in I even realized I could hang out with my buddies again, grabbing a beer, enjoying life and slowly I started to realize that I had been miserable this entire time. Slowly that turned in to more and more realizations before I realized I honestly did not love her anymore, I felt like my youth was wasting away, I could do much, much better than this, I felt like I was a caretaker of a handicapped old lady, hell I still looked good and as I went out I started once again gaining back my self confidence, women would flirt with me, I felt wanted even though I never did flirt back.

After all these realizations I suddenly got a call from my wife, saying she made a huge mistake, she was sobbing her eyes out and how she was an idiot taking the therapists words as fact and how much she loved me. For a moment I wanted to say yes, yes please come back...But I couldn't, I just blurted it out and said to her she had left me and I was done with this relationship, I told her I would get divorce papers and I told her I had wasted enough time as it was and this final action of hers was the nail in the coffin, after that I just dropped the phone, started crying for a bit before turning in and feeling liberated.

The issue now is, is that everyone in my family is telling me I am making a mistake, I should take her back, I owe it to her to try and make it work, marriage is not always fun etc. The thing is, I never had fun in this marriage, I can't remember the last time I had fun and wasn't miserable, we are both young and fit and we never even go out, hell the last time we had sex is over a year ago, all I am to her is a fucking servant as it seems and I rather live along then spend one more hour taking care of her. But on the other end, I doubt myself, am I really dumping someone that is depressed? I feel horrible about it, I feel like a failure...I just need advice.

EDIT: Wow, I stepped away from my phone for a while and return to a ton of comments, thank you all so much, I will try to read them all.

EDIT 2: While I have a hard time defending my wife right now, let me clarify something that is popping up in some comments. I know for a fact that she did not sleep around with anyone while we were separated.

Update: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/e33cna/update\_my28m\_wife27f\_left\_me\_for\_3\_months\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e33cna/update_my28m_wife27f_left_me_for_3_months_and/)

ANSWER: Also the only person who knows what is best for you IS YOU. Those other people were not in your relationship, they have no idea what it was like. Just do what is best for you. You’ve put yourself to the side for years.

QUESTION: My (27F) boyfriend (27M) asked me to “act more kawaii” in the bedroom. I’m asian and he’s white. I don’t want to shame his kink but I don’t want to be fetishized.

TLDR: I don’t want to be fetishized by my boyfriend but don’t want to shame him for being more sexually open with me.

We’ve been together for a little over a year now and it’s been going well! We met at college through a club and hit it off then reconnected a couple years later. He’s always been really kind to me and gives me compliments all the time and we generally have fun together.

We’ve been quarantining together and have been having a lot of sex, which I love, but it’s been getting a little weirder, I guess? He sends me a lot of hentai and says he wants to try things out that are depicted in it which is fine. But he’s also been buying me outfits (which I do appreciate) and they’re very much like anime themed? Japanese schoolgirl, cat-girl costume, etc. etc. I know he’s being more open sexually with me but it all feels kind of... gross? Like he wants me to do all of these things because I’m Asian? Anyway the other night he asked me to “act cuter” in the bedroom and to speak Japanese to him in bed. I was really offended by this because while I’m Asian I’m not Japanese. I’m Taiwanese, but born and raised here in America. I firmly told him no and the night went on alright but he was a little quiet afterwards like I’d scolded him.

I don’t think he means anything weird by it, but I want to tell him I’m not okay with the things he’s been doing but also I don’t want to shame him for being more open sexually with me. I just want to feel like he wants to be intimate with ME and not with Asian Girl #7, if that makes sense. I don’t know how to explain this to him though?

ANSWER: I was literally waiting for the part where you weren't Japanese.

Look. If he's pushing this on you and even using Japanese fucking words to describe how he wants you to act, it's too late. You're already the fetish and it's going to overrun most if not all things between you guys. I don't say this to be shitty and hyperbolic. I'm half chinese and one of my exes used to tell everyone I was Japanese because it was his thing. The caucasity.

I can only suggest, and pray for you that he'll understand, that you have a talk with him about what it means to be racially fetishized and how dehumanizing it is and how horrible it is for you to have to act Japanese for him in those stupid anime costumes, and maybe explain some history of how the Japanese treated the rest of Asia and why it's actually fucking insulting that he does that given the atrocities that Japan committed and straight up how weird it is that he can't separate Taiwan from Japan.

Like yeah you were born here but you're also 27. Don't let some weeaboo try to make you into someone you aren't. This isn't 'kink shaming', this is him being straight up racist.

QUESTION: I (34m) conducted a paternity test behind my wife’s back on our 12 year old son.

Typing this out in Mobile. Apologies for grammar or formatting

A little back story before I get to the meat. My wife and I met when I was 20. We had a drunk hookup the first night we met. We continued seeing each other after that night. A few weeks later she found out she was pregnant. We stayed together and I proposed a few months later. I had doubts about her pregnancy lining up with our timeline but I never brought it up or discussed it. Not to mention I was in the military and deployed a few months later. My proposal weighed a lot on her carrying my child. I grew up in a home without a dad and never wanted that.

Fast forward 12 years we are still married. Though it has been extremely volatile and rocky I’ve stayed together honestly because I could never part from my son. I can’t let him grow up with an absent father. So I’ve made it work. Our marriage is dead outside of our child.

I ran into an old friend who I knew around the time I met my wife. He asked if I was still with her and I said yes. He mentioned how “it was crazy I dated her and then you stole her from me!” I wasn’t sure what he meant and asked him to elaborate. He said “it’s no big deal but I was seeing her up until that weekend you met her.” I dropped it but inside my doubt and insecurities ran wild. I couldn’t get it out of head. I broke down and bought a home DNA test kit and used it on my son and I without telling my wife.

The results came back today. He is not my son. 0% chance I am his biological son. I’m destroyed. My whole world is upside down. I’m just on autopilot at the moment. I don’t know how to act or feel. I’m just a zombie right now.

One thing I know is no matter what he is my son. I’ve been by his side the moment he was born and will absolutely never abandon him. Absolutely nothing will change that.

What I haven’t decided is how if at all I bring it up to my wife. I feel like my whole marriage was a lie. I can’t help but wonder if she knew. How do I confront her. Regardless that I’m not in love with her I still love her. This will crush her. This will absolutely devastate her. I don’t know what to do. I plan on seeing a counselor/therapist ASAP. So many emotions and thoughts flooding my mind. Just need some help to bring me back down.

EDIT: I appreciate all the support and words of advice. Both good, bad and the assholes. I’m going to sit on this until I get my head right.

ANSWER: First of all, I can’t even imagine how blindsided you must feel. I’m sorry this has happened.

My parents (biological parents) got married because they found out they were pregnant with me. When I was about 1, they decided to end it. I’ve talked with my mom a lot about why this happened and what her thought process was and she always says something along the lines of: “I knew that I’d so much rather raise you in two happy households instead of one unhappy one.”

And that’s exactly what happened. I grew up with two separate, happy marriages as examples. I got to be loved by so many more people. I have good relationships with all my parents. I have no resentment.

I just wanted to say that good outcomes of divorce exist. Sometimes it really is what is best for the family unit as a whole. Divorce doesn’t always end badly. Sometimes it’s the most calm & clear path for everyone involved.

Good luck, I’m rooting for you.

QUESTION: My husband(m26) ignored our safe word while trying CNC (consensual non-consent) and I’m torn

My husband (m26) and I (f20) have been exploring more when it comes to sex. One of the things we’ve just recently come across is CNC. We both agreed to do and and came up with the safe word, as advised. 
While we were into it, he became extremely rough with me. I said our safe word because I wanted to stop but he ignored it, I said it again, he ignored it once more. I started trying to push he off and he just held me back down. He continued until he finished .

He’s been treating me like an asshole ever since. I told him what he did was wrong and he ignored our safe word. He told me that I’m overreacting and that he made it more fun and realistic. I told him he borderline raped me, and he said “ it’s not possible for a husband to rape his wife” He’s also treating as if I’ve done something wrong. I made dinner for us, he waited until I was finished and said that he’s eating out, after watching me spend 1 1/2 hour cooking dinner. I just don’t know what to do.

ANSWER: He did not borderline rape you. He raped you. He clearly has no respect for you and your boundaries

QUESTION: I (28m) accidentally punched a woman. She went around telling people that I intentionally hit her and also that I was abusive to my wife.

Last week, there was a small get together at my friend’s house; just us 9-10 of us close friends. Now he invited one of his friends, Susan (28f) and she brought along her brother (30m), who none of us knew. My wife (28f) was present there too.

Her brother, Dave, was being weird with my wife from the get-go. Half the time he was there he was staring at my wife inappropriately and trying to touch her whenever he found her alone. She even asked me to hold her hand the entire time because he was making her uncomfortable. I told her we could leave if she wanted to, but she said she won’t let a creep sabotage her evening. This was a bad decision on our part; should’ve left earlier.

I got a work call in the middle of the party, and my wife told me to take the call and assured me she would be fine with her friend, Lisa. When I came back after 5 minutes, I see Dave trying to talk to Lisa and my wife and both of them looked very uncomfortable. Apparently he’d been trying to convince them to get inside the pool naked. I confronted him, and well, things escalated. He said some colourful words to my wife and Lisa, implied that my wife was totally leading him on before I came back.

I physically shoved him away from my wife and Lisa. He retaliated and not proud of this but we got into a fist fight. It was all adrenaline and fists and punches. I raise my hand to punch him, gained enough momentum that’d have knocked his teeth out and all of a sudden,his sister, Susan comes in front of him trying to shield him. And my fist hit her in the face. I apologised, I profusely apologised and even offered to take her to the hospital. I’ve never raised my hands on a woman and I never will. This was a fuck up and I was very ashamed of myself.

Susan didn’t accept my offer and neither my apologies. Dave took her to the hospital. The next day, she put up a story on Instagram about how I hit her, with a photo of her injury and her face. The story they’re going with is that my wife and Lisa were totally hitting on Dave and when I found out, I hit Susan out of anger. Now I’ve been getting threatening messages on my social media accounts, someone even found my LinkedIn profile and messaged my company asking why they hired ‘woman abusers’. Lisa and my wife have tried to mitigate this disaster by posting the correct version of this story, but it looks like people have made up their minds that I’m an abusive asshole. Some have even messaged my wife asking her to divorce me or if I abuse her too or why is she supporting someone who hits women.

I contacted Susan through my lawyer and said that we’re gonna sue for defamation and slander, that let’s settle this in court and that other people present at the party are ready to testify against her. Dave and her are now begging us to forgive them as they’re very poor (they are, both have been unemployed since two-three years) and they’re even ready to post on SM that they lied.

My wife thinks that we should definitely sue them. Lisa thinks that a court case will really fuck them over and destroy their lives. I kinda agree with both of them. What should I do?

Edit : I replied to a comment saying this and since a lot of people think that I shouldn’t have gotten into a physical altercation with the guy,I’ll replay his exact words. ‘Your wife was begging for my cock before you rudely interrupted us.’ This was when I shoved him away and then he threw the first punch. It escalated from there. I know this isn’t a justification for the physical fight but well, it is what it is.

ANSWER: If you can, take screenshots of any communications you've had with them, especially if it's them admitting to the lie. Whether you go ahead with the court case or not people may still wonder afterwards if they only backed down because they were "bullied" into it because they couldn't afford a legal battle; any tangible proof from them could help to clear your name on SM and with your employer (current or future) better than good reviews from your friends will.

QUESTION: My (23f) boyfriend (29m) hates that I wear boxers to bed

We've been together 3 months.

My sleepwear consists entirely of tank tops and underwear. I have underwear for during the day and for dates, which is primarily small and lacey, and then I've got women's briefs and men's boxers (usually a cotton blend) for sleeping. They're really comfy and really big. I don't think they're ugly, they're just not very cute.

My boyfriend slept over last night and I went to get dressed for bed and as I pull out the briefs he goes "do you have to wear those?" so I pull out the boxers. He says that's worse and asks if I can wear some of my "nice" underwear to bed. I tell him that wearing lace all day and then overnight and again the following day is how you get yeast infections and he asks me why I had to mention yeast infections.

I put them on and go to get into bed and he asks me to take them off, not for sex, but just so I'm not wearing boxers to bed. I ask him what the big deal is and he says "forgive me for wanting to find you attractive". I don't know what to say to that but he rolls over, straight to sleep, no cuddling.

This morning I wake him, we kiss, I'm thinking it'll lead to sex, but he touches my boxers, stops, gets dressed and leaves.

This is starting to affect my self esteem just a bit. I'm only wearing them because they're comfortable and I don't want to buy all new stuff, but this is apparently a real turn off for him and it's causing problems. What do I do to fix this issue without completely caving?

TL;DR: Boyfriend hates me wearing boxers to bed, wants me to wear my regular underwear to bed, and says boxers are a turn off. I like wearing them and don't want to buy new sleepwear. Is there a compromise that doesn't involve me sleeping with my arse out?

UPDATE: texted and asked. He thinks it's "gay". As a bisexual woman I cannot see an alternative to breaking up right now.

Edit: He is not gay. Or bi. Or otherwise experiencing internalized homophobia. 99% of homophobes are straight. He is within that 99%. This is not glee.

ANSWER: "forgive me for wanting to find you attractive" lol yeah excuse you for wanting comfort and relaxation. if it's only 3 months in and he's this way about sleepwear I can't imagine him being the type to help you when you're sick, gassy etc and not always "hot".

THANK YOU for gold and the likes. :)

QUESTION: (update) on having a baby with my married boyfriend & not knowing he was married

EDIT: image removed because u/eganist said it was ok to ❤️

Also, I'm all set with everything baby needs! With things being as they are consider donating to a local diaper/formula bank. ❤️ Save your money for awards on this post too and put it toward that. Help babies and mamas who don't have the resources I do.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g2jdjz/i_23f_am_days_away_from_giving_birth_and_my_37m/

First things first: I had my healthy baby girl on Monday evening. We were discharged shortly after birth due to Covid so I have been just trying to adjust to everything. Her birth was a dream and I never want to do it again. Lol.

Second: I talked to his wife for over an hour yesterday. I guess he decided to tell her. She wasn't mad at me, thank God. She'd had her suspicions but was trying to trust her husband which I understand. She was so nice honestly and even though she isn't angry at me I still feel bad because she's such a nice lady. She wanted to make sure I was doing okay and that I didn't need anything which made me cry because postpartum hormones are whack. She's getting a divorce from him (good for her tbh). We are planning to meet up and talk shit about him once the virus is over.

I have a lawyer and will establish custody and child support legally asap. He hasn't bothered to contact me at all but I don't particularly care.

I didn't want to leave anyone hanging even though it's not a huge update. Thank you to everyone who checked in. It means a lot.

ANSWER: The wife sounds like an amazing and understanding human being. Hopefully you have been gifted with an amazing friend after this, if anything.

QUESTION: My(50F) husband (53M) just messaged me on Tinder

I accidentally discovered he had Tinder on his phone.  I catfished him with a fake profile and he messaged me.  We've been together 20 years and married for 15 years.  I don't even know how to approach this with him without crying or screaming.  How do I tell my husband I know he's active on Tinder and I don't think I trust him anymore.

Edit: Thank you for the comments, everyone.

ANSWER: Arrange a meeting otherwise he will lie and say it was just for fun. Let him know when you show up at the hotel!

QUESTION: Update: my [33m] wife [25f] constantly makes a conscious effort to humiliate me during my lessons over Zoom

About a week and a half ago, I made a post here about my wife consciously trying to sabotage my lessons over Zoom. It seemed that everything she did was just to embarrass me in front of my students. If you want more information about the situation, you can find the original post here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/illtan/my_33m_wife_25f_constantly_makes_a_conscious/

My first lesson after making that post, my wife went straight back to her old antics. I was in the lesson room as students gradually joined, talking to a student who was interested in luxury cars. At some point during the conversation, I said “yeah I think I’d have to go with the Lamborghini there.” I heard from behind the door in the basement where I was teaching “LaMBorGhiNi” in the sarcastic exaggerated tone of voice that kids will use to mock you. I realized she was being childish again, but figured she’d eventually tire herself out.

A few minutes after the lesson started, I used the word “circumference” to describe a word problem. I then heard “ciRCuMFeREnCe” from behind the door at the top of the stairs, followed by giggling. Since the timing was right, as I was about to have the students take a shot at a problem, I set them to the task, muted my mic/disabled my camera, and quietly crept up the stairs. I suddenly opened the door to find my wife with a cup over her ear pushed against the door so she could hear me.

I whisper-shouted at her for her behavior for about a minute. I asked if she was five years old and what the hell was wrong with her. She feigned fear and shock as if I had held her against the wall with my hands wrapped around her throat, which made me just sigh and go back downstairs to finish my lesson.

For the rest of the lesson she was quiet, but after it I went upstairs to bring up what she did. She started asking if I was going to yell at her again. I responded that I wouldn't, and I tried to get back on topic, but no matter what I said about her behavior, her response was the same. When I brought up her stomping in the room above before, “are you going to yell at me again?” When I brought up her sliding plastic files under the door during a lesson before, “oh, are you going to yell at me again?” When I brought up anything she has done during lessons, the answer was the same, over and over again.

There is absolutely no way to broach the topic with her now. I called her doctor and said that her behavior is erratic, and that she might have PPD. The doctor said that he could ask about it when she came in, but there is not much else he could do. The next day I tried to sit my wife down for a calm discussion about the possibility of her having PPD, to which she responded she had PTSD from my “abusive shouting.” Right. When I suggested therapy, together, she said “oh, to fix your anger management problems? Sounds good.”

I teach in my car in front of a Starbucks now. Outside of lesson time we haven't really had any issues, and now that I'm outside the house teaching, we are strained but stable. I know this is not a very satisfactory outcome, but I think she has deep underlying issues that are going to need professional intervention. When I said I would happily go to therapy with her to find a solution to our communication issues, she told me that I should go alone. I think that may actually be a good step because having a neutral party to listen to my worries and guide me towards better de-escalation tactics would be highly beneficial. I could also try to entice her to join gradually.

TL;DR: my wife has no desire to change. I’m going to start therapy alone and see if I can’t get her to join. Her doctor will bring up the possibility of PPD in her next appointment.

ANSWER: I saw the orginal post.  Yes, go to the therapy alone.  Your therapist might have some good strategies or be able to point your towards more resources all the while ensuring you don't go mad yourself dealing with this.  I'm sorry for you having to deal with this.

QUESTION: Overheard my [26M] fiancé [24F] tell her friend on the phone that she “settled for being with me,” and that marrying me was her “last resort.”

Update 2: Just did one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. Today after breakfast I told her we should “sit down and talk.” She was hesitant, but I said it was important. We went to the living room and she said to me “I already know what this is about.” My post apparently made it to the front page, so of course she saw it after scrolling down a bit under “popular.” Of course the water works started happening right away. I told her what she said had deeply hurt me, but obviously she already knew that since she read my post. Through her tears, she said “I was just joking, I wasn’t serious.” She then went on saying stuff like “I love you, I love you.” I told her I can’t be in a marriage where my S/O doesn’t love me the same way I love them. She tried to tell me that she loved me and that I meant something to her. But it was all bullshit. She said she “didn’t want to lose me.” I told her I don’t think this marriage was the right decision. And from there I basically told her it was over. I told her I knew how she really felt about me, and that it was fucked yo she basically played with my emotions. For all those wondering, we have no kids, and I pay fully for the apartment we live in, and I own almost everything we have other then her clothes. I even pay for her car. So after all of this she’ll have little to nothing left. Before our marriage, we agreed to sign a pre-nup, and at that moment, I’ve never been so happy with a decision I’ve made in my life. After that it was a few second of awkward silence, before she said to me “Fuck you.” She started screaming at me, telling me “you just can’t end things like that.” I told her I could do whatever I wanted, and that’s when she became very hostile. She screamed at me saying, “You’re the fucking worst relationship I’ve ever been in. You think I can’t find someone again?” “Do you think you’ll ever from someone as good as me? You’re a fucking idiot [my name].” She grabbed her bag and phone, and said “I’m leaving!” Before slamming the door behind her. At that moment I felt like I was on one of those dramatic sitcoms you’d find of TV. I sat down on the couch and cried, and I’m still crying as I type this up. It’s both happy and sad tears, and I knew it was only time before she cheated on me or left me. She never loved me, it was obvious. Our relationship only went one way, and I feel like a complete idiot for not seeing it earlier I live in California, and I’m gonna start the process to annul our marriage. Tomorrow, I’m gonna start throwing all of her belongings in to trash bags, cause that’s essentially where they belong. (I’m not throwing out her stuff. Just using the trash bags as a way to give her back the things she owns.) Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your kind words and your great advice. All of you gave me the courage to stand up for myself, and I know my life will certainly improve as a result.

Edit/Update: Thanks everyone for the kind words! Really has made me feel a lot better! Going to be talking to her soon. Also, I noticed a lot of people thinking this post is fake, I understand how it could be seen that way, but it isn’t. I’ve been engaged to her for over a year and a half, and just 3 months ago we got married. Not really used to calling her my “wife” yet. Also I used an old alt since she uses Reddit. Anyways thanks for the advice everyone, it amazes me how people on the Internet can care so much about a person they don’t even know. I’m going to talk to her today. I will be updating you all soon after.

Edit: Meant to put wife in the title but now I can’t change it.

Basically the title. I overheard my wife talking to one of her best friends on the phone while I was passing the bedroom. This friend is in a serious relationship. My wife then said to her, “Sweetie, remember it’s your choice. Don’t settle for just anyone. That’s the mistake I made. Who knows who else I could of had. [My name] was my very last resort, and now look where it made me end up.” Hearing that honestly broke my heart in two. Does she even love me? Why am I being treated as a second base?

Am I being dramatic and overreacting? I haven’t said anything about it since. I honestly don’t know what to do, but hearing her say has really made me upset.

ANSWER: Fucking brutal. I am so sorry to hear that. You should really talk to her about it. You should never be somebody's "last resort" if that's how she really feels maybe that relationship isn't working

QUESTION: Do I (14m) call the police on my mum's hit and run?

Mum was driving me to school this week. She was taking a turn and obviously wasn't looking because she took the turn wide and hit a kid from school who was riding to the bike racks. He was in the other lane that goes the other way. Our car went over him and I heard him yell out. I don't like "know" him but he's in a different year than me.

After that happened mum just kept driving. I told her we need to call the police or ambulance or something. Mum just kept saying that he swerved and hit her and that we don't call the police if we did nothing wrong. She told me to keep quiet and knows i'll do the right thing.

I saw a photo on insta of him in the hospital and he's all bruised and looks rough as guts. I've just been feeling really bad and it's like I can't eat and feel like throwing up. It's like mum did something really wrong and it feels really bad to not say anything. I wasn't even allowed to tell dad about it (but him and mum are divorced and I'm not allowed to tell him lots of things...). If I tell someone, mum will probably get arrested and then it'll be my fault.

I don't know and want to stop feeling so bad, do I tell on my mum or not?

ANSWER: I’m on team “tell your dad”.

This is too big for a 14 year old to deal with, and you need support around this that your mom is incapable of providing.

Your dad needs to know all of this, including how you feel and your mom is wrong to tell you not to seek his help.

QUESTION: My unborn child absorbed it’s twin and now my wife resents it.

At our 10 week scan we were told we were having twins. Having tried for 7+ years and this being our first real pregnancy, my wife was ecstatic. Cue a few weeks later our doctor is checking for heartbeats and he only finds 1. We go for another ultrasound and one of our twins had died and been absorbed by the other, which is why my wife had no glaring miscarriage symptoms. 
At first she was fine. Then she started joking that our baby would grow up to be a serial killer as “he already has 1 checked off”. Soon it was becoming clear that the idea our unborn fetus somehow murdered its twin intentionally was no longer a joke in my wife’s mind. I tried explaining the fetus had passed on its own, it hadn’t been absorbed to death. This didn’t work so I asked our doctor, her gynaecologist, her mother, her sister and her dad to all try explaining it too but it was no use. She has fully convinced herself that our unborn child is a murderer.

I really don’t know what to do. My mom tells me she’ll go “back to normal” when her pregnancy hormones drop but I am really concerned as I know the drop in hormones can actually make people even more unpredictable and I hate to say this about my wife, but dangerous. I don’t want to leave her. We’ve waited so long to be parents together and I know this isn’t my wife, she is just grieving. The multiple ultrasounds have put us badly in the negative after already being screwed over by covid so we can’t afford therapy for a little while.

Any advice? thanks

ANSWER: Approach this as the death of a child. A child she had never known, but had already loved.

My suspicion is that she is emotionally distancing herself from the remaining fetus in case this fetus dies unexpectedly too.

She needs therapy.  Look into social programs which might provide her with additional resources.

QUESTION: UPDATE my friend drugged me at a party and assaulted me

I had to use a new account because my last one was locked for some reason.

I read all of your comments and snuck out of my house to go to the hospital to have the rape kit done. It turns out that he did have sex with me that night and they found drugs in my system although I don’t remember the name of it.

I reported my ex friend to the police and based off the drugs in my system matching some that he had hidden in his room and all of the dna they collected from me at the hospital they were able to arrest him. My parents found out but haven’t apologized for blaming me.

Thanks for all of the helpful advice I received.

ANSWER: You did the most important thing you could: you went to take care of yourself. The traces of drugs in your system will be invaluable for your doctors to take care of you, and for any prosecution in the future. Give yourself a huge hug for advocating for yourself.

The other post has excellent resources for what you can expect in the future, though I want to second reaching out to two very important organizations with lengthy experience. One, see if there's a sexual assault resource center in your area. Most major cities have them, and they provide local assistance and resources, including contacts to lawyers, counselors, therapy, nurses, medical assistance, and more. If you end up having to go to court, they can put you in touch with compassionate legal advocates fully prepared to support you the whole way. I can't speak enough to the good work these centers do.

Stay strong and contact Rainn.org as they have outstanding resources available for people who were assaulted. Their outreach is international and they have a multitude of invaluable resources that you can use, including their 24/7 live chat, and their phone number at 800.656.HOPE.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] I want to read my daughter’s diary to find out why she left us. My wife says absolutely not

First and foremost, thank you all so so much for your condolences and for sharing your thoughts and experiences dealing with losing a loved one. Secondly, I’m sorry if this post isn’t necessarily the neatest,  I am still at a loss for words.

Basically, I’m a pathetic excuse of a father for not realizing that my son goes on Reddit (I don’t keep track of the social media apps he uses), so he saw my original post where many of y’all were urging me to read my daughter’s diary. My son did so behind our backs and we only came to find out when he lashed out, calling his sister selfish and all the names under the sun for doing what she did. My wife on the other hand is beyond pissed at my son for reading our daughter’s diary. She said that our daughter is going to be mad at our family when she “gets back,” only to find out that one of us read it. I’m guessing she hasn’t accepted the fact that she’s gone and will never return.

As for me and my wife, we haven’t read our daughter’s diary, only our son did. Based on my son’s reaction, I can assume that you guys were right, that her diary is filled with hatred, as if someone else wrote in it. I don’t know the contents of it but I know how and who my daughter was and her brother loved her who for who she was and now, he can’t stand it when his sister’s name is mentioned. That was exactly what I was afraid of that after reading her diary, our perspective of her would be completely different.

My son is temporarily speaking with a family member who’s a therapist and we’ll be switching him over to a different one hopefully by next week to avoid conflict of interests and as a family, we’re now in contact with a counselor. I want to talk to my wife about her getting into therapy too, as she still thinks our daughter is still here but she’s just away on a “trip,” my wife calls it. But beyond that, still nothing much has changed. My wife still cries every night and though my son very much upset with his sister, we still find him around his sister’s room. And for me? Nothing, still empty and probably always will be, which isn’t fair to my son and wife so I’ll probably seek a therapist for myself as well. Plus, I know many marriages don’t survive after the death of a child, so marriage counseling is something I want to bring up to my wife when I feel is appropriate.

What about the diary? It’s gone, hidden well within our home. Hell, I may even forget where it’s at years down the line but I do know I want to read it when I’m ready, whether that’s with my wife or not. I want to know her struggles, read her fun times (if she has any written), and what made her do it. I know reading it won’t give me closure, but it will give me an insight of what she was going through and let that be a lesson for me to be better for my son and to just always be there whether he’s feeling fine or not.

That’s about it. My heart still physically hurts from the loss of my daughter and for the rest of my family as they’re also in so much pain. Some of you guys might be expecting this update to be about the contents of the diary but I’m choosing not to read it for a long, long time. And if my wife wants to? I won’t stop her, but I do want to tell her that she may not recognize our own daughter as my son didn’t. Only time will heal our wounds and lots and lots of therapy and support. Thank you all so much for your thoughts and prayers. I can say for myself that it brought me a bit of comfort after such a massive loss.

Again, thank you all so much.

EDIT: Many apologies for the typos, my mind has been in shambles.

ANSWER: I keep a journal and I can tell you that if someone read it they would probably have a very incomplete picture of me. I typically only write out my most negative emotions because for me it’s a way to purge those thoughts and feelings. They are certainly not all that I am so if you ever do read it, try to remember you’re probably reading the very darkest thoughts she had and not the whole picture.

QUESTION: My (24M) girlfriend (26F) fully believes that she is a cat in a human's body.

[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h8wzqq/update_my_24m_girlfriend_26f_fully_believes_that/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Tl;dr: gf now thinks she is an otherkin, a cat in a human's body and refuses to see anything wrong with the situation. The echo chamber she is now has done nothing but enable her and I don't know what to do.

I know people are going to think I'm either trolling or baiting but please read before you comment + this post has nothing to do with gender or trans issues and I am in no way intending to be offensive or anything.

So Gf and I have been together for nearly 8 months, and she's always been a very quirky and nerdy person: does cosplays, very into anime and roleplaying, etc... Nothing too weird. We've been kinda distant lately with everything going on and me being an essential worker so haven't seen eachother and only talk for half an hour a day. Well, last tuesday we got to hang out at her place and she wore cat ears a and a belt with a tail the entire time. At first I thought it was either going to be a sex surprise or her testing  a new cosplay, but nope, she sat me down, asked me if I really do love her, then hit me with a very long monologue that essentially summed up to  "I'm a cat in a human body". Wish I was joking.

I thought I misunderstood and then believed that maybe it was a weird joke but she kept being serious about it, and doubling down. I left shortly after because I had a shift at work, and I still believed it was an oddly drawn out joke nothing more. She ended up texting me with resources to help me understand, which is when I realized that she really is serious. Apparently she believes she is an otherkin:  a person who holds the belief that they are not human. She says she was introduced to this by one of her friends months ago and has since joined discords and communities of others like her. Her friend believes he is a demon trapped in a human body, and she sent me a testimonial that was supposed to be touching but its basically just about a dude thinking he is naruto. I'm not joking. She explained her otherkin type as being a cat, and now she 100% thinks she is a cat. How did she know she was a cat you ask? According to her: sleeping a lot, liking the sun, hating water,  feeling more comfortable crawling on all fours, and claiming to understand what cats are saying and being able to talk to them through meowing. She has also apparently been distant with nearly everybody we know IRL as I got multiple messages asking me to let her know to be in touch with them.

My head has been spiraling this past week, I keep thinking its a joke but nope she is deathly serious about this and has handed in her two weeks resignation at her job because cats don't work. Again, I wish I was joking. I've been limiting my interactions with her ever since, because this is hurting my head a whole lot and I just can't cope. She has also surrounded herself with a large amount of yes men and women who support her 100% and are enabling this, some even encouraging her to make a patreon and make otherkin content that they would contribute to, which she brought up when I asked her about quitting her job. To make things worse, I can't discuss this with anyone in real life because I know how crazy it sounds and I know that leaving her is a valid option but I'm in love with this woman and now I don't recognize her and I know that there is something very very wrong and I can't reach out to her and she refuses to hear anything from me unless it is unconditional support. What the fuck do i do ?

EDIT: Just got off work and was very surprised with the amount of comments, I honestly just expected a bunch calling me crazy. I'm reading through them now and I want to say thank you to everybody who took the time out of their day to give me advice, I truly appreciate it. To address some things:

\- Her and I have been friends for 2+ years prior to dating, so that is why I am reluctant to just up and leave.

\- I've read a comment asking if she has a history of mental illness, and not to my knowledge? Aside from her being diagnosed with mild social anxiety in high school. I am going to try and reach out to her mom to get her to check up on her, and maybe even visit. They have a good relationship, so maybe that will help.

\- Yesterday was the first time I truly confronted what was going on, as I have been kind of shelving it and just praying and hoping it was some kind of drawn out joke. But now that I've had time to truly ponder it, I think it has been a long time coming. She's been buying a lot of cat memorabilia and a lot of her cosplays are cat related, and when I brought up the possibility of me getting a cat in the near future she made a joke about being too territorial for a cat, and now that I think about it...well, yeah.

\-I don't know who demon man really is, all I know is that he has been part of her virtual Dnd group since last year. Also so far no litterbox in the picture, sorry to disappoint/relieve some of you. When I asked her about her plans as a "cat" other than quitting her job, she had sent me her to do list which I didn't bother opening or reading until yesterday because I was too busy wishing all of this was a fever dream. The To do list includes purchasing a scratch post for her nails, switching to an carnivore diet, and dying her hair red because she is a ginger cat. Yup.

\-As much as it hurts, I have no intention to continue to be in a romantic relationship with her because she will absolutely not hear anything if it's not 100% support. I love her, but I love myself and I don't want to be dragged down to something like this especially when it feels like I'm talking to a brick wall. I will however try to remain in contact with her just to make sure she's not spiraling towards a mental break. I will visit her today to have a talk and officially break it off even though she's been refusing to see me unless I am completely on board, I will update if anything interesting happens. Then I will buy a couple of bottles of alcohol and down them in my flat, no judgement.

\-I've really enjoyed the cat puns, and apparently I need to google who Maureen is.

ANSWER: I'm really sorry for you.

I did some research on otherkin and I think that your GF has slipped into a culture that only exists on the internet.

I would ask her how she thinks she will support herself as a cat?

She quit her job. Now what? Not much work available if you have chosen to go to far out there.

If I were in your shoes, I would slowly distance myself from her. Let her sleep in the sun and lick her paws but don't start paying her bills.

If she does not wake up soon, I would continue to remove myself from her delusion. Eventually, you are out of the  picture.  I know that you care for her, but you should never be responsible for her. She has chosen to do this.

My own philosophy is that you should let people live their lives as they want ( as long as it's not harming anyone else) but in this case I don't think you need to be there and watch this.

Otherwise just tell her your a dog and don't get along with cats

QUESTION: [Update] My Fiance's ex sent me their sex tapes and I made the terrible mistake of watching it

Here is a link to the original: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i7f1k2/my_fiances_ex_sent_me_their_sex_tapes_and_i_made/?ref=share&ref_source=link

As for the update, after posting here and reading the advice and reflecting on my actions, I realized what I did was wrong and a violation of my fiance's privacy. I allowed my insecurities to dictate my actions. Even though my fiance is okay with me using his phone, my intent to snoop made what i did wrong.  So I decided to just come clean.

I sat him down the next day and told him that the ex sent me the videos as well, and also came clean about the snooping. He was pretty upset, but surprisingly he wasn't that upset with the snooping, he seemed more upset that his ex had somehow managed to cause drama once again in his life. He told me that he hadn't watched any of the videos because in a majority of them he was uncomfortable with recording them and only did it for her and was afraid if watching it made me look at him in a bad way. This made me feel even shittier for what i did and I apologized again and reassured him that they did not in anyway lessen my feelings or respect for him. I wanted him to have some time to process things and decide what to do about the ex and what I did, so I gave him some space.

That night, I decided to cook his favorite meal as a sort of apology dinner and discuss things. He seemed in a much better mood. He apologized to me for not telling me about the tapes right away and for being an idiot and not realizing that she would come after me when he had blocked her. He told me he appreciated me coming clean about the snooping and understood how I got carried away and that I could have just talked to him and he would have given me his phone and reassured me that he hadn't kept any of the videos.

I asked if he was going to press charges regarding revenge porn and he told me that he wanted nothing to do with her and that we should just move on and enjoy our engagement and forget the whole thing. I told him it was completely his choice and I support him and would delete the videos and block her right away.

Finally, I brought up the texts and he apologized to me for the rant. He told me that was the first time in a long time that he had actually thought about who was better and that he had never actively compared me with any of his exes before. He told me he should have just answered it with a simple "my fiancee is better", and tried to apologize again. I told him that he didn't have to sugarcoat anything and that it was his private conversation with a friend and I have no right to be mad when he wasn't really disrespectful about me or our sex life. I also told him that it was okay if she was better and I didn't have to be the best at everything.

He explained to me that after talking to Sarah he thought more about it and that he hadn't really expressed his thoughts well in the text but he would like to explain it better:

> You are the best I have had, I am not lying or sugarcoating anything. If someone asked me who is the most skilled or the most adventurous sexual partner that I have had, then yeah it would probably be her.

>But that doesn't really matter because if someone asked me what was the best sex I have ever had, my first thought would be the time when we had sex right after you asked me to marry you, and then it would be the night when you first told me you loved me and third would be the time when we had sex in the kitchen the day I moved in. For all her skill and experience, she couldn't even make the top 3, and we have the rest of our lives to make sure that she doesn't even come near the top 100. So no, I am not lying when I say you are the best I have had.

I am not going to lie, despite what I said about not needing to be the best, just hearing what he said (maybe i butchered the quote, he was so much more charming and eloquent) made me really happy, so I kissed him and asked him if he wanted to try and break into the top 3 again. Then, we had sex :) . I didn't really specifically try to be more aggressive but I tried to focus more on what he was feeling to reassure myself that he was enjoying it as much as I did. That naturally allowed me to be the one in the lead and it was great. I could tell that he really enjoyed it as well.

I know I have to work on my insecurities and potentially see a therapist, but for now I will try my best to just forget what I saw on those videos and enjoy being engaged to the most amazing man I know.

TL;DR: I fessed up, my fiance was very graceful and even tried to take some of the blame. We made up and will continue to enjoy the post engagement bliss.

PS: I appreciate the harsh comments that told me I was wrong to snoop. But those of you that sent me hateful pms telling me that I was no better than his ex and that I should leave him? Seriously, fuck off. I maybe an insecure nut sometimes, but I have never ever taken it out on him and would never hurt him like she did. And me wanting to be the best sex he has had is not some narcissistic ego trip. It was because to me he is the best sex I have ever had (and hopefully ever will) and I wanted to be the same for him. I don't think there is anything wrong with that.

ANSWER: Funny thing is, his ex trying to sabotage your sex life will lead to you two having even better sex!

Congrats, OP, this is such a beatiful update, the two of you seem to be a great couple!

QUESTION: UPDATE: My GF was raped and became pregnant. I broke with her after she decided to keep the baby.

Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/?utm_source=reddit-android

I'll post the update first, since there has been some change since I last posted. Then I'll respond to some general points made from the last thread, and the ton of PMs I received.

Yesterday, I received a call from my GF. She was crying, and she begged me to listen to her. I told her that I still care for her, and that I'll obviously listen to what she has to say.

She told me that a few days after I told her we were done, she called up her Mother to talk about this. Apparently, what happened before was that she was pretty much decided on aborting, but then when she spoke to her Mother, her mother told her that under no accounts should she abort, and that I was actually manipulating her to do so. Her Mother went on to say that if she aborted the child, she would no longer consider my gf as her daughter.

After I left her, my gf called her Mum up to talk about what went on. My GF said that she desperately wanted to abort the baby, and her Mother again said that if she does so, this is the last time they will ever speak again. My GF said she broke down on the phone, and her Mother kept asking her what she will do. The conversation then ended when my GF said she didn't know.

Then she started texting. After a few hours of thinking, my GF sent her mum a text saying she was going to abort. She was then blocked.

My GF then called me, and told me everything.

She will be having an abortion in 3 weeks.

I discussed this with my GF, and we both completely agreed that I had not manipulated her in any way, and that she appreciated that I put my foot down, because had I not, she would have had a baby who would remind her of the worst time of her life. (Her words, not mine)

She further went on to say that I am the best thing that has ever happened to her, and that she knew that even if she no longer had a Mum, if she had me, she could get through this. I broke down at this point.

I love her so much. In truth, I probably would have gone back to her and raised the baby with her, even though I knew I'd resent it. I made the original thread to get some backing rather than anything, to see if I had made the right decision.

I'm so relieved things had turned out the way they have.

Also, screw any Mother who places religion over their own child. Friggin lunatics.

Now to respond to some of your points from the last thread:

1: No. My GF did not cheat on me. I am almost certain about this. Not only because she had the conscience of a fragile angel, but also because we both know each others' schedules really well, and we often talk to friends who can corroborate timings. Moreover, her roommate took photos of my GF after she came home assaulted. It's not "rough sex" as some of you dicks put it.

2: I don't give a rat's arse if you think abortion is a sin or the killing of a baby. Come and raise the baby or give us money to raise the baby or hire us a live in maid to tend to my GFs every need while she pregnant if you're so sanctimonious. Talk the talk, then walk the walk you wanking tit-baboons.

3: My GF was absolutely clear she wanted to raise the baby (probably influenced by the Mum).

4: Thanks for all the people telling me I did the right thing. It was really difficult. I'm very glad it turned out the way it has though.

5: To the people who PM'd me telling me I'm a monstrous baby killer - I fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.

Thanks Reddit.

ANSWER: Pleaseeeeee ensure your girlfriend sees a professional to help process the trauma. Not just the trauma of the rape but also the trauma of her mother's controlling behavior and just the whole situation in general. And please consider seeing one yourself. Good luck.

LOL boy you savage. I like your style.

QUESTION: My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

I can't believe I'm about to type this but here we go.

I've been dating my GF for 7 months. She's amazing and we're super compatible in a lot of ways. She is an outspoken vegan, and she made it clear at the start of our relationship that it was important to her that any potential had similar cruelty-free values. Me, already being a pescatarian, had little difficulty transitioning to a fully plant based diet. My GF was proud of me for going cruelty free and everything seemed well. We became "the vegan couple" on our college campus.

Then there is my cat, Mittens... I've had her for three years and I adore her. She's such a sweet and cuddly cat. However, my GF was always a little apprehensive around her, and she blamed it on not growing up around cats. After a while we sort of made a tacit agreement to mostly hang out at her apartment instead of mine, so Mittens never really came up again in conversation.

Fast forward through all the quarantine stuff... My gf and I have spent a lot of time together during this pandemic and we've started talking about taking our relationship to the next level. We began seriously looking at either buying a new apartment together or having one of us move in with the other.

However, after a lot of talking and planning, my GF sat me down and dropped a bomb shell on me. She said that with this next phase of the relationship, she did not see a future with me unless I was willing to give away Mittens. She said that she believed owning a cat is unconscionable for vegans, because they hunt mice and eat meat, and because the very act of owning a pet is a violation of vegan principles.

I was stunned. I told her that I was absolutely not willing to give up Mittens, and she had no choice but to eat meat so I was reducing harm as much as possible by buying reputable brands of cat food. Plenty of vegans own cats and think along those same lines. My gf got mad and said "how much flesh does your cat eat? How many animals died to make all that food? Would you be okay with that being human flesh?"

I got mad and told my GF that I would have really appreciated her telling me about her cat opinions before we got serious. She went on and on about cats killing animals. I ended the conversation there. I was so angry that I left my gfs apartment. And I snuggled with Mittens when I got home! Although the mood soured a bit when my GF sent me a link to a Reddit thread advocating for the extinction of domestic cats. Sigh

I think it goes without saying that I am not going to get rid of my cat. However, it pains me to think that an otherwise wonderful relationship could be ending because of a difference in ideology. I don't even really understand where my GF is coming from because like I said, a lot of vegans own cats. Now granted, cat ownership can be a controversial topic in vegan circles and I probably would not have gotten a cat if I had been vegan at the time, but I have Mittens now, and she deserves to eat. (Yes, I've researched vegan cat food, but Mittens has some digestive issues and my vet strongly cautions against it.)

I've talked to some of my vegan and vegetarian friends and they all think my gf has lost her mind. Some have suggested that it's not about Mittens and my gf just wants an excuse to end it. They probably don't understand why I haven't broken up yet, but I care about my GF so much. I'd hate for this bizarre curve ball to be the end of a beautiful thing. I want to try and work something out.

Where do I even go from here? I will not compromise on Mittens and I don't think my GF will compromise either.

Edit: wow, this completely blew up while I was asleep. I am trying to read every comment but there are a lot. Also, please allow me to take this moment to reiterate that my GFs views are not representative of those held by the wider vegan community!!

QUESTION: My [33M] fiancée [27F] chose to save my deceased father's stuff over her deceased mother's in a fire. How can I ever repay her?

Two nights ago, my fiancée accidentally set fire to our kitchen and the fire extinguisher in our apartment was defective. The fire spread quickly and burned through most of the building before they were able to contain it. I wasn't home, so I wasn't there to help my girlfriend gather anything up. If I was, I would have forced her outside and told her to leave it all. It's just stuff.

She chose differently. First, she took out two dogs outside and handed them off to a neighbor on leashes. Then she went back in. At this point the kitchen was engulfed in flames and she couldn't make it into the living room, but she could get into the bedroom. She knew she wouldn't be able to make two trips and she had to act fast.

Both of us have lost parents. I lost my dad 3 years ago. He was a friend of her father's so she knew him (though not very well), but he died before I actually met her. I have most of my dad's stuff in a storage unit, but in our bedroom I have his ashes, two guns, and a couple of other very personal things from my time with him. She lost her mom as a teenager, and because her father is an asshole, she only has a few small things of hers, and her wedding dress.

Instead of choosing to save the few things that she has of her mom's, she gathered up my father's things, wrapped them in a sheet, and ran out of the room.

I don't even know how to begin to say thank you. I'm so completely devastated by her losing her mom's things like that, and I can't imagine what she was thinking or how much she must really love me to make that decision. I don't know how to repay her. Or where to begin. Can anybody think of a nice gesture I can make it up to her? She must be devastated. I can't imagine losing the last bit of my dad.

Tl;dr: my fiancée had an opportunity to save stuff from her dead mom when the apartment was burning, but chose to save mine instead. How do I repay her?

ANSWER: Clearly, in that moment, she chose to save what she loves most of all - your heart & happiness. 
I think she thought to herself to save what she had left (you), she has all her mom's memories wrapped up inside her. She didn't know what losing your dad's stuff would do to you, so she decided not to risk it and protect you.

God damn, that's powerful.

You better marry that girl. Just spend the rest of your life treating her right.

My side note: would be to get something engraved with her mother's name. My best friend's husband got her a ring with her mom's name engraved on the inside and their birthstones side by side in the band.

QUESTION: My(39m) wife(40f) slapped our daughter (16f) after she came out as gay. I need help dealing with my wife and my daughter.

I'm actually an immigrant from Mexico, so my English is average at best.

I must admit that I was really homophobic and racist growing up. That was how I was raised. But when I moved to America, I met my wife and she helped me a lot. She helped me adjust to this new country and changed my racist and homophobic opinions. I owe that to my wife.

Yesterday, my daughter told me that she wanted to talk to me. So we sat down to talk, and she told me that she wanted to bring her girlfriend over for her birthday. It took some time to sink in, but I understood. When I asked her if she was coming out to me, she told me that she was. She asked me if I was fine with it and I told her that I had no problem with her choice and she will always be the same daughter to me. I must admit that I felt proud because my daughter actually trusted me.

After that, I asked her if she wanted to go out for dinner. She told me that she wanted to eat lasagna. I'm a chef and my daughter loves my lasagna. So I started to get ready to prepare it.

At this point, my wife returned from her sister's house. Idk what went down but after a while, my wife started screaming at my daughter. And when I came to look, she slapped my daughter twice. My daughter was crying and I was really shocked. I asked what happened and my wife told me that my daughter came out and she did not agree with her. She told her that she can't be gay and started crying and yelling at her.

I asked my wife to leave, because I was really angry. After my wife left I told my daughter that what my wife did was incredibly wrong and I'll stand by her. My daughter did not talk much, she just went to her room.

Now, my wife refuses to talk to me. She told me that she will be back only if I agree to help my daughter become straight. Idk what to make out of this. I'm really notnthat educated along these lines and all this is very new to me. I love both of them very much and I'd like to help diffuse this situation. Can I get some advice here?

ANSWER: You did the right thing. Your wife did not. Support your daughter and make her comfortable with who she is. Your wife needs an attitude adjustment. Remind her of how she helped you see things differently from what you were raised to believe. It's your turn now to do the same for her.

QUESTION: Update: My (21M) girlfriend (21F) went on an anti Semitic rant after getting into an argument with someone. I’m Jewish...

OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bc0gp4/my_21m_girlfriend_21f_went_on_an_anti_semitic/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app

I figured there was an interest in an update so here it goes. This all happened a few days ago.

The day I made the post she actually came up to me and said that we should do something romantic for our anniversary soon. Well, that didn’t turn out well.

Before I told her about my background, I asked her why she holds these beliefs/attitudes towards Jews. She pretty much sounded like Hans Landa the whole time. At one point she even admitted that she got suspended from school as a kid for “teaming up” with a white supremacist and pulling a horrible “prank” on a Jewish student.

Afterwards I bluntly told her that I’m Jewish. She didn’t believe me at all and thought I was joking. I told her that I was dead serious and she just laughed and told me to shut up. This went on for a while and she even asked for proof.

When it finally hit her she looked like she died inside. Things went 0-100 very fast. She got physically aggressive and screamed at me, calling me a liar and a psychopath. She said that our relationship was never real because it was based on a lie and that she feels disgusted with herself. When she insulted me I reminded her that she really liked me despite my “dirtiness” which just pushed her over the edge. She cried hysterically and I left.

The next morning she knocked on my door and insisted that SHE dumped me and not the other way around.  She warned me not tell people that I dumped her since that would make her look bad. I didn’t say anything and closed the door. I heard her screaming and knocking violently, basically asking me how dare I close the door in her face and that “you people are all the same”. After a while she left and started writing me on Snapchat. I blocked her, then she called me from a friends phone and verbally attacked me. I’ve never seen her act so crazy.

Long story short, I blocked/deleted her on everywhere and she eventually stopped. I knew things wouldn’t go smooth, especially after our initial conversation, but I didn’t know it would be this bad. Some of her stuff is still at my place. Oh well

TL;DR Told her, broke up with her.

ANSWER: Watch your back dude. Crazy doesn’t just disappear quietly into the shadows. You need to keep yourself safe. She’s sick in the head.

QUESTION: My wife lied about having a miscarriage and instead had an abortion, I don’t know what to do know?

My wife and I have been married for 3 years and for the past year we have been trying for a child.

We both wanted to have children and after we got married we decided to first buy a house and get things in order financially before having children.
Last year we both mutually agreed that we were in the right place to try for a child, in fact it was my wife who put the idea forward.

A little over 8 months ago my wife found out she was 6 weeks pregnant with our first child. I was elated, I had always wanted to be a father and it seemed like something I never thought was possible was coming true. 
My wife and I began buying parenting books, planning a nursery, just doing all the stuff first-time parents do. I had never been happier at this moment.

Several weeks later, I had to fly out of the country for a work conference. I was gone for about 8 days. Whilst I was abroad, my wife called, she was crying and told me she had a miscarriage. She was 18 weeks pregnant at this point.
I flew back home immediately and told work that I had a family emergency. 
I was devastated with the news, but I never properly mourned as I felt I had to be emotionally strong for my wife who was a wreck.

This was a tough period for both of us, but I thought we had come out stronger as a couple. I knew I had to give my wife some time and space before we could approach the subject again, especially with this being, what I thought, her first miscarriage.

However, a week ago, a friend of my wifes called and told me she had something important to tell me. Apparently my wife had scheduled an abortion, whilst I was away at a conference. My wife’s reasoning being that she wasnt ready to be a parent.  My wife also said  didn’t want me to know about the abortion because I was so excited to be a parent and she didn’t want to hurt me.

At first I didn’t believe this to be true but after confronting my wife she told me that yes she had in fact aborted our child.

I’m in shock right now. I’m hurt, angry and upset. I just don’t understand why she didn’t just speak to me about it. Maybe we could have talked this through, but right now I’m so mad that she went behind my back and led me to believe she lost our child. I understand that my wife is the one carrying the child, and at the end has the right to make any decision she wants, but why lie about the whole situation.

I don’t know whether to carry on with the relationship or not. I love my wife but this is a huge betrayal to me, and I can’t even look at her right now. She’s currently crying and begging me to forgive her, I’ve just gone down to the spare bedroom and locked myself inside. Please someone just tell me what to do.

Edit: I did not expect this post to blow up like this. 
My emotions are all over the place and I’m a mess right now but once everything is sorted i will try and update you on the situation.
Thank you for you support

Edit 2: [update post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hk6smm/update_my_wife_lied_about_having_a_miscarriage/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

ANSWER: While I agree with others saying her body, her choice (which at the end of the day it totally is), the fact that she lied about having a miscarriage is horrible. She led you to believe your future child had passed instead of talking to you about how she was feeling.

A marriage is supposed to be a partnership and if she can't come to you about something that will affect you both, i'd say you have a lot to think about. The fact that she lied and acted as if she lost the baby when she had no intension of carring on with the pregnancy doesn't sit right with me. To think your wife could lie so well about something so major, for presumably an extended period of time would have me questioning what else she could or has lied about.

At the end of the day if she wasn't ready to have a baby it was the right thing to do, as devastating as it may be for you. But she shouldn't have kept you in the dark and lied to you. If I was in your shoes I'd sit her down and have a frank discussion about how this has made you feel, but also listen to her and find out how she feels. There may be more to this than just "not being ready to be a parent".

Therapy is an absolute must here. Both as a couple and individually. If you love her and want to work through this that is the first step, but it may be a long road.

I wish you luck, and I am so sorry for your loss.

QUESTION: My wife (32F) has been having an affair, and I’m broken.

My wife (32F) and I (30M) got married in September 2018 after being together for 3 years. Right before our honeymoon, we bought a house together in VA, and after we got back, pooled our remaining money and time to completely redo her old starter home in MD and sold that in early 2019.

We both work full time jobs in Virginia. I make pretty good money, she makes even better money. My wife, let’s call her Katie, decided to pursue an MBA and started last fall. She had an educational trust that her parents started for her, and therefore didn’t ask me for any financial assistance. However, because I saw how time consuming the MBA was on top of her already large professional workload, I took it upon myself to take care of everything related to our still relatively new home - including dealing with contractors, managing all our bills, maintaining the house, taking care of our dog, purchasing/assembling furniture, yard work, cooking, cleaning, laundry, and hosting/entertaining her family that insisted on coming over at least 2 weekends every month.

Lately, Katie had been unhappy with our relationship, complaining that I wasn’t spending enough quality time with her and not making her feel wanted. I tried to argue several times that between her work and studies, and my work and home responsibilities, that there simply wasn’t very much time to spend together in general (we would frequently not even get to eat dinner until 9:00 or 10:00 at night, and I would either need to bring her a meal to her home office, or we would quickly eat together, and she would return to schoolwork to study or percolate in group projects/session). She would argue back that the things I was doing around the house were simply my responsibility as a husband, and that while she “appreciated it,” it didn’t count towards me trying to maintain or build our relationship. We’d also been arguing a lot about other things, and combined with the lack of free time, would be intimate maybe once a month.

But after one particularly emotional (and drunken) conversation - about 3 or 4 weeks ago now - I vowed that despite what I already thought was prioritizing her needs, that I would go even further. I began to take off work (I, unlike her, still had to go in during Covid), or go in late/leave early, stopped seeing friends, skipped workouts, and would even wait until she was occupied with something else to even take a shower, all so I could spend as much available time as possible with her between her obligations. As a result, things seemed to be slightly improving between us.

And now we arrive at last Wednesday. As per usual, I was making dinner for us. We have a tablet in the kitchen that I primarily use for recipes. As I was finishing up, the tablet began pinging nonstop, and I checked out what was happening. As it turns out, the tablet is linked to her google credentials, and I first saw an ongoing hangouts conversation between Katie and a friend, discussing what to do about “someone’s wife” who had come to our house that day while I was at work. Scrolling through the conversation history, I found more about Katie’s lack of feelings for me, and the longing and dreaming to instead be with some guy, who we’ll call Luke.

Physically shaking at this point, I decided to venture away from Hangouts and open her Gmail, where I found several emails, going as far back as March, between her and Luke, calling each other “babe,” “sweetheart,” and “my love.”

Unsure about what to do next, I first took screenshots of everything I could find, then stepped outside to call the only person with law experience that I knew, an executive at my company who I’d become friends with. He advised that I immediately confront her, but first call someone to come over to the house to act as a witness, in case things became physical, or if she might later try to claim they did. So I had a friend over in about 20 minutes, I confronted Katie, and she confessed to the relationship and admitted that they had been intimate several times over the past 4 months, both at hotels and in our home.

Now completely distraught, I tried to maintain my composure, and asked her to leave. She stayed at a hotel for two nights, then despite my protest, came home on Friday, stating this was her house too. She insisted on talking when she returned, and not having a witness this time, I decided to record the entire conversation on my phone. She tried to reiterate that she had been unhappy, but despite that, had been reaching out to her friends and mother about suggestions and resources she could use to help our relationship (even though I had suggested counseling in the past, but she refused). She tried to tell me that she made a mistake, that she had already broken it off with Luke a week ago, that I was the only person she wanted to spend her life with, and the only reason she hadn’t told me about it was because her friends had advised her not to. She also said that if we truly love each other, that divorce was a mistake, and that we should be able to get through anything. I replied that love is worthless without trust, and then said that if she insists on staying here, to please stay in the guest room. Obviously free usage of her home office and the guest bathroom, but to please stay out of our bedroom/bathroom unless telling me first.

So now I’m here. Sitting in my house alone with just my dog. Her and her aunt/uncle/cousins are currently at our neighbors house for a bbq (they don’t know about what she did). I can’t bear to go over there because I don’t want to talk to or even look at Katie, much less pretend in front of a bunch of people that nothing happened. 90% of me wants to get a divorce, but despite her feelings, I was very happy with the life we were building. We had even been talking about being pregnant by this time next year. But no matter what I decide to do, I know I don’t want to make that decision without getting more information about what I can do, what might end up happening if we proceed, and I definitely want to talk to a few VA lawyers to protect myself. We only have one joint account with less than $20k in it, and the only asset we share is our house.

So that’s it. I’m sorry for writing so much. If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading. And I would really appreciate any and all insight, suggestions, or advice. I just feel completely destroyed, empty, and alone. Please help me.

Edit: I am absolutely stunned and overwhelmed by the level of support you all have shown me. I truly can’t believe that all of would take the time to offer your advice, kindness, and wisdom to an absolute stranger. I am doing my best to read every one of your replies, and from the bottom of my somewhat shattered heart, thank you. This has been an unbelievable light in the darkest time of my life.

ANSWER: Divorce, no kids. 10k avg with lawyers if either of you fight. 500 bucks disillusion. Both with 1/2 assets.   During my divorce to an actual Katie, who was banging a dude at her work my therapist said "someday she'll just be someone you used to know." 6 years later I can't even picture anything about her.  No kids makes it so much easier.

QUESTION: (UPDATE) I want to ask my (M34) business partner (F31) to be with me romantically. How do I go about changing the context of our relationship?

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjn6u0/i_want_to_ask_my_m34_business_partner_f31_to_be/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Short update because I’m supposed to be working. And I don’t expect this to get attention because my original post didn’t but I don’t know who else to tell.

The day after I posted originally, I told her I’m in love with her, and asked her on a “real date”. It went well. Really well, so easily and just good. And she slept next to me again that night.. I got to kiss her in public! She said it felt like our little family was right, and it really does, it feels like everything just sort of snapped into focus.

I am going to take everyone’s advice and not just spring a marriage proposal on her out of nowhere, but I want to marry this girl and have more babies with her. Because everything just makes sense now.

And yes, she said she loves me too!!!!!!

EDIT- because people keep asking, we’ve done paternity testing and this is absolutely my baby.

ANSWER: Congrats dude. Keep it up. It's only the beginning. I hope it gets better and better for the both of you.

QUESTION: Caught my girlfriend cheating and I CANNOT cope please help

So long story short I found texts on my(18M) gf(19) phone tonight texting her friend things like “he pounded my shit” “I got some of the best dick last night” and “omg it was so good, I couldn’t walk last night”

I’m disgusted.  It was her ex, whom I’ve always felt inferior too like she just hadn’t gotten over him even after over a year.

I’m distraught.  I don’t even have anyone else in my life rn.  My two best friends cut me off over something stupid a few weeks ago, i just moved into Uni and i have only really “clicked” with one guy friend.  My family and I don’t even get along nor communicate much.  I lost my confidant, my support system, and my best friend all in one night.

She’s REALLY sorry.  I saw her crying when she didn’t know I could see her and she was hitting the steering wheel over and over again.  I feel bad but like the lying and deception isn’t new.  I had to do it.  I told her we’re over, but she’s welcome to try to win me back or whatever idc.

But FUCK this sucks.  I have mental health issues and so my coping skills are practically nil and I just don’t know how to cope with this.  I can’t eat.  I can’t sleep and I have class in the morning.  I keep picturing the texts and visualizing him “pounding” her and I’m just disgusted.  I’m just obsessing over it and it’s 4 am in the fucking morning.

Part of me just wants to let it slide if she does show effort at getting me back.  I know in a while I’ll be ok but I just don’t know how to get from part a to part b.

Please help

EDIT:  Wow.  I don’t even know what to say.  Guys thank you so much for the overwhelming support.  I get a new notification telling me to be strong literally every three seconds.

I finally fell asleep at 7 am and there were like 40 comments on this.  I woke up and there are over 800 beautiful people telling me to be strong.  Thank you so much.  Reddit is such a beautiful place.  In the strangest way, I feel really capable of surmounting this today as opposed to yesterday.  You guys definitely played a part in that.

This is the kind of stuff that makes me remember not everyone sucks lmao.  Keep up being great in life guys :)

Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

EDIT2:  Jesus guys!  You’re all a blessing!  I just finished class and I’ve been getting notifications every three seconds!  Going to do my best to get back to everyone.

I am doing much, much better.  I’m feeling freed rather than sorry for myself now.  Thank you all.

By far the most frequent advice was to hit the gym.  I’m going to dinner rn but I’m hitting the iron directly after!

On top of this awesome wave of support from all of you, I’ve had a few good things happen today that are just making this so much better:

-  my job app for a 20$ an hour job teaching SAT Prep was praised for “outstanding qualifications”

-  I got invited to participate in drug research here at my school

- and my fucking package arrived that I’ve been waiting on for a week!

-also one of my friends who cut me off reached out to me

I’m doing well, thank you all, you’re all a gift, much love from my corner of the internet, you’re all worth a platinum in my eyes!

Cheers!

EDIT3:  I can’t believe I forgot to say, my EXGF!

I did it guys :)

Thanks for pushing me to stay strong on my boundary, y’all are the best

ANSWER: She‘s not sorry she cheated, she‘s sorry she got caught.

If she were sorry she cheated the messages to her friend would be „I fucked up and don‘t know what to do. I am so so sorry. I don‘t know what happened“ and not „I got fucked by my ex and it was great“

She showed no remorse until she got caught.

Please don‘t let her walk all over you just because you are afraid of being alone! You are young you will find someone.

Please use the mental health services available to you and I know it‘s old advice but go find some sort of group activity or sport you enjoy at your college. You will meet people with similar interests and new friendships will develop naturally.

QUESTION: Step brother [16M] came to my [16F] room at night and cut my hair with scissors. I moved out and parents want me back with him still there.

Step brother of 6 months. My mom married his dad.

So a few weeks ago in a morning I noticed my stuff in my room had moved. I told my brother (big bio brother, 23) and he didn’t take me seriously but taught me how to record my room at nights with my phone. I’ve been recording myself every night and nothing happened, so I was ready to believe that nothing had happened that night.

This weekend however, step brother came into my room at about 3:15am. He came to me with scissors, cut a small piece of my hair and left my room. It was so weird and shocking. It was a very small amount, something I likely wouldn’t have noticed. I sent the video to my siblings (brother and bio sister, 19). They told me to pack a bag immediately and picked me up and took me with them. They sent the video to parents.

Parents questioned step brother and he says he doesn’t remember doing it at all and said he was likely sleep walking and asked to see a doctor. I don’t believe him and neither do my siblings.

Parents want to solve this problem by taking both of us to family therapy. They want me to come home and discuss this (all four of us). They say I’m not in any real danger, as he didn’t hurt me or do anything inappropriate or sexual. My siblings strongly disagree and say what he did was very inappropriate and they’re not going to let me go back there as long as step brother still lives there. Parents say they will install a lock on my door so that I can lock myself in at nights.

Step father is upset at my siblings and claims they’ve turned this into a much larger issue than it is, he says they could have just parented the problem away by punishing and it’s not a big deal.

Honestly I keep hearing everyone with strong opinions about this and I don’t know who’s right or wrong. What should I do? Do I go back? Do I just never go back? My best friend says I should just go to the police and press charges against step brother.

tldr: Step brother snuck into my room at night and cut a small piece of my hair with scissors. I’m now staying with siblings and parents want me back, siblings want me to stay and I don’t know what to do.

ANSWER: Listen. To. Your. Siblings.

Your Mom wants you to just grin and bare it so she can have a happy little home with her new husband, both of them are in denial over how serious this situation is. Your step brother for sure needs therapy, but you do NOT need to be in the house when that happens. Stay away.

Big no. HUGE no.

QUESTION: Wife (38F) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. It's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks I am going to abandon her and "our twins"

This is all over the place. I really need help.

My wife and I (M42) have been married for 2 years together for 15.

All this time we had either not decided to have kids or had problems getting pregnant. After some medical testing we found out that it was near impossible to get pregnant due to some medical issues with her.

We were thinking of adopting when one day she came home and told me she was expecting. Ofcourse I was super happy .

A week later we had an appointment at the gyno and she had some blood drawn. The test came back negative and ofcourse I was devastated but she wasn't. She claimed that she was pregnant and that the doctor was wrong. We took some more store-bought ones and they all came back negative. My wife is in complete denial. Now she claims we are having twins. She is buying them clothes and decorations and is pressuring me to start with the nursery.

I am at a loss and don't know what to do. My inaction is making her believe that I want to leave them and that I am going to doom my wife into the life of a single mom.

What the f is even happening. I love her but I don't know what to do.

Edit : forgott to add. I have tried talking her into therapy but she accuses me of gaslighting her

little update/edit: thank you guys you really helped me out. Yesterday was a bad day and you helped me get clarity. I've had a chat with our doctor who will now be handling this with us. I would like to thank most of you with useful advice and hopefully I will be able to update good news someday. But a fuck you to those that said I should divorce her because she is "crazy" and an extra fuck you to the guy that used this post to push his anti abortion agenda.

ANSWER: Oh dude. She's going through something very, very serious.

You need to contact a therapist. Like turn off Reddit right now and contact one. She's having delusional thoughts. Her preoccupation with pregnancy and her sadness have overcome her. This is way beyond Reddit's pay grade.

Good luck.

QUESTION: My bfs mom found my HIV medication and now his whole family knows my status.

Editing for TW: rape, abuse

Edit: the mom was told that I’m undetectable and what that means, but she’s too overwhelmed with fear to really listen and comprehend.

For the last two months, my(28f) boyfriend (28m) have been staying with his mom during quarantine. I have my own home with roommates and so does he but she insisted we stay with her temporarily to more easily adhere to social distancing.

I am HIV positive, and my boyfriend is aware. My boyfriend is HIV negative. I’m undetectable, which means there is so little amount of virus in my body that I cannot transmit the virus to anyone else. I cannot infect another person, even through unprotected sex. If you aren’t aware of how this happens, people with HIV can take antiretrovirals to basically fight the virus and protect your white blood cells from being attacked so the virus is unable to replicate. A lot has changed over the decades.

A little background: I have been HIV positive since I was 15 years old. I have a lot of trauma associated with my status. The person who gave it to me was an adult who was extremely abusive. This person beat and raped me regularly and held my HIV status over my head as a way to control me and keep me in the relationship. For years, I felt unlovable and dirty. It took A LOT of work and therapy to overcome my own personal shame towards my status. I don’t tell anybody about my status unless they have to know – like they’re medical professionals or if I’m sleeping with someone. My family knows, but none of my friends do. Not even my closest ones. I was so afraid of the stigma of my status that it changed the trajectory of my entire life. I was suicidal for years and stayed in lots of bad relationships because I was worried nobody better would love me. I’m doing better now. I’m in a healthy, happy relationship with my boyfriend. I’m back in school, working on my career. I’m stable and independent. I’m turning my life around I’m doing a good job at it.

Well, my boyfriend’s mom found my medication. I had a pill bottle in my purse in the closet. She claims she found a pill on the floor and saw a bag sticking out of my purse and thought she would put it there. The medication was in the bag and that’s how she found it.

If I’m honest, I don’t buy her story. My medication is extremely expensive and I’ve always had dogs so I’ve always paid close attention to making sure I don’t drop any pills or leave them around. After a decade of taking medication every day, I know to pay close attention to how I get the pills out of my bottle. I never just pour them out into my hand. Even if I did actually drop a pill, I would think the normal reaction would be to set it aside on a counter or bring it directly to one of us, not go into my purse. Either way, she went through my purse and it feels like a huge invasion of privacy. I’m not sure what she was even doing in the closet to begin with. I really think she was just snooping.

Anyways, instead of coming to me or my boyfriend, she told his sister. And then his sister told her husband and their other sister. Now the whole family knows my HIV status. The mom apparently reacted with things like, “How could she do this to herself?” and “Was she not raised properly?” She’s always been judgmental towards me, but this is victim blaming at its finest. She was worried that I gave it to her son but he took a test in front of them and he is negative. His sisters are apparently not judging me for it, but his mom definitely thinks lesser of me.

I’m so angry that I’m being judged for something that I didn’t do to myself, especially since I’ve handled it responsibly. I’m angry that she went through my stuff. I’m angry that they spread my private medical information through the whole family. There is so much trauma associated with my status and I feel like I like the control of this information has been taken from me.

His mom is divorced and I understand that she was scared for her son and didn’t have someone to talk to about it and that’s why she spoke with the sister, but she should have gone to my boyfriend directly. His mom was a nurse so she should know better than to spread people’s private medical information around. His sister also had no reason to tell the other sister. This my private medical information. My medical history and our sex life is none of their business.

As soon as I learned what she did, I packed my things and left without saying a word to her. I love my boyfriend and according to him, he stood up for me when talking to his mom and sister, but I don’t know what to do from here. His family is EXTREMELY close. They all talk every day and spend a lot of time together.  I don’t want to see them, but I’m going to have to at some point. And I don’t want to feel like I’m the “girlfriend with HIV” forever.

I feel sick to my stomach and I’ve been crying every day. What do I do? What should I expect from my bf?

Side note: I have a virtual therapy appointment next week, so if you’re going to suggest therapy, I’m way ahead of you.

UPDATE: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/guqonf/update_my_bfs_mom_found_my_hiv_medication_and_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

ANSWER: I’m glad you have therapy lined up!

If you are comfortable disclosing the nature of how you became HIV positive, this is the way I’d probably do it.

I would have a sit down with BF and his mother. And I would say:

“You found my medication, figured out what it was used for, and shared my status without my consent. I became HIV positive at 15 after being repeatedly raped and abused by an adult. Because of the medication you found - whether in my purse, or on the ground - I am not able to infect anyone. My HIV status was not yours to discover, but after you did, it was not yours to share, and I am hurt that you shared it with others instead of returning the medication to me and talking to me about it. This was a massive breach of trust.”

And go from there.

Your boyfriend should be supporting you 100%, no questions asked. His mother did nothing right.

Edit 1: I wrote this hastily before a call at work - I did not expect this response! I will say: this kind of conversation may very likely not go well. But it gives your bf’s mother one chance to do the right thing. If she doesn’t immediately back down and apologize and make moves to rectify, a new game plan will need to be arranged between OP and OP’s boyfriend. Bf specifically needs to be OP’s support and protector here. His family has really, really hurt OP, and his next moves set a precedent for how his family should treat her.

Edit 2: emphasis on if you are comfortable discussing.... I’m not implying OP has to discuss her trauma if she isn’t comfortable doing so.

QUESTION: Today my (19f) boyfriend (20m) said he was in the mood to kill me.....wtf???!?

EDIT TO UPDATE: I just wanted you all to know that last night while he was sleeping, I took my dog Daisy and left my boyfriend in the middle of the night. I am at a safe location, staying with Family, and have been in contact with the police trying to get an intervention order so I can me and my dog safe from him. Thank you all so very much for your support and concern. You have all saved my life!! I tried to make an update post but it kept getting removed! Thank you again

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about a year now and for the most part he’s been absolutely wonderful and I love him so much.

We have a pretty intense sex life and I’m usually really chill with that!!  
However recently he’s been taking it a lil too far, like I love choking and spanking in the bedroom, but he’s started doing it in public. Like today we took our dog to the park and I said or did something he didn’t like and he spanked me!! I was shocked!

Later on in the day we were doing the deed and he started to choke me, again which I usually like. It got to a point where I properly couldn’t breath so I used our signal to stop and he just looked down at me said I’m not gonna stop because I’m in the mood to kill you. He must have seen the fear in my eyes or something and he immediately let go and like cradled me and said sorry. I thought it was just him being in the moment so I let it go.

But it happened a second time, he was just like staring at me and was whispering sweet things to me and then it took a turn to, you’re mine forever, never gonna let you go, I’ll kill you if you leave. I recoiled cause it made me uncomfortable and he like ticked me and told me it was just a joke.

Like I love this man but like wtf.... how do I bring this up with him?? Tbh I’m tempted to leave.... 
We both don’t have dark senses of humour so I don’t know where this came from.

How do I address this?? What should I say?

ANSWER: Man.... you cannot play around with shit like that. Wouldn’t you rather get away and be able to see your grandkids one day? Or risk the chance this guy will not stop choking you? Unless you think you are stronger than him.... please, OP, look out for yourself. This is scary and not normal.

QUESTION: My (36f) husband (40m) suddenly changed for the better two years ago, but no one shares my concerns that about how odd it is that he dramatically became a different person overnight because all his changes were positive

When I married my husband, I knew that he was an overweight, lazy video game nerd, and I loved him anyway for his warm heart and kind personality.

He detested exercise, stayed a low rank at his career because he put in minimum effort, and we bonded more over activities like watching movies together at home rather than going out.

He went on this camping trip with his friends two years ago, and did shrooms (he had never done drugs before, and had he consulted me I would've told him that was a terrible idea), and when he came home, it was like something had lit a fire under his butt. He completely changed interests - he never played video games again and took up running, reading books even though I'd never seen him read before except for school, and several other completely random hobbies. He became a vegetarian even though, before, he'd been a meat and potatoes guy. He worked harder at his job, then did an accelerated grad school program and ended up making tons more money.

I barely recognize him. We still have a good marriage, and I still love him, and he has motivated me to be better in the last two years, but....I can't help but wonder if those drugs knocked a screw loose. Could this be dangerous? I'm deeply concerned. I know that people change, but about all that's left of him is his warm heart. No one shares my concerns because all his changes have been positive, but I feel like he's so different maybe we need marriage counseling so I can adapt, at least...

&#x200B;

Edit:

Wow, this blew up. Thank you all, I'm still trying to read all your responses - I will read them all. I think some additional context is required: this personality change has required more than adapting to my husband becoming a new person. Our lives are very different, now. Before, we saw our friends once a week and mostly hung out around the house. Now, we are extremely social, and to put our exercise habits in perspective, we got a high energy border collie and she gets the amount of daily exercise the vet recommended. I've been caught up in a whirlwind of change I didn't expect, and it's just a lot to process, but don't get me wrong - I am proud of my husband.

I posted here to get outside perspective, and have been given lots of advice to research psychedelics. I am in the process of finding sources of information that I consider unbiased, and am looking into it. I stand by that anyone would be concerned if their husband came home from a camping trip with a different personality and completely changed their lifestyle, but I'm calming down about it.

I think I might have enough perspective from posting here to address this with my husband, now. We've talked about it, before, but I've been reluctant to voice my concerns because he's doing so well and I felt it would come off as criticism. It's possible I stewed on this for so long it became a bigger issue to me than it actually was. I think I'm going to suggest that I pursue individual therapy for a while, since hundreds of people have pointed out that the problem is with me and not him or our relationship.

ANSWER: I was an overweight, nerdy guy who detested exercise. I married and had three kids. One day I realized I had it all, a great marriage, great kids and I wanted to be around as long as possible to enjoy it. I started to exercise, eat better, which changed my attitudes about things. I still enjoy the occasional video game, but also as much or more a hiking with the family. Being in better shape allows you to do more.

QUESTION: My (32F) husband (36M) became a robot and I don’t know how to help him.

The title sounds insane but here I go.

We’ve been married for 6 years and have 2 kids I’m pregnant with a third.

My husband works from 9-5, comes home, does his chores, plays with our 2 kids, talks to me for a little bit, and then goes to sleep. But he doesn’t seem to enjoy doing any of it. Like this whole thing is one big chore.

He used to be this goofy guy who smiled and told jokes all the time, but I haven’t seen the man smile in months.

It’s not like he’s neglecting his duties as a husband and father, but he acts like it’s just that, duties. Like hanging with the kids and me is a second job.

I’m grateful for all he’s doing, and he makes all of our lives sooo much easier, but it’s like he’s constantly on the clock and I think he might be depressed.

I tried asking him if he was doing ok and he tells me he’s doing “fantastic”, but I know he’s not. That’s the line he uses at work when customers try to make small talk and ask how he’s doing.

He doesn’t take anytime for himself. He doesn’t take any breaks, he stopped playing games and stopped watching tv. He just does what I feel he thinks needs to be done and I don’t know how to help him out.

Our sex life has become one sided. We do it frequently but only because I initiate frequently. Even if he doesn’t seem in the mood he’ll do it. Like it’s his responsibility to “make me happy.” It feels like he isn’t there in the moment, like his mind is wandering the whole time we’re intimate and that, to me, feels worse than getting rejected.

I don’t know what’s going on, and I don’t know how to help because he won’t let me in. To anybody else he seems fine, but I know something is wrong and I don’t know how to fix this.

I miss my husband, the guy who complained, and told jokes. Not this robotic shell that looks like him.

Edit: Alright, wow! I didn’t expect this to blow up. I want to thank you all for your advice; I really appreciate it. It’s clear to me now that my husband is overworked and “burnt out.”

He comes home from work in a couple hours and I’m going to sit him down and talk to him.  I’m going to tell him how I feel, and I hope that together we can find a solution that turns him back into the man he once was.

I’m sorry if wasn’t able to respond to everyone, but I want you all to know I read every comment and response.

I’ll post an update soon about how it goes.

Byee!!

Edit: [update ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hmzvgt/update_my_32f_husband_36m_became_a_robot_and_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

ANSWER: Your husband sounds burnt out. He sounds completely exhausted with nothing but more exhaustion to look forward to. He's probably tired of the redundancy and depressed. He probably needs a long vacation from responsibilities and a new career.

Edit: I forgot to mention that your husband is probably telling you that everything is fine because he doesn't want you to feel guilty or leave you with the responsibilities of everything on your own.

Also, thank-you for the awards, kind strangers.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My [29f] boyfriend [25m] admitted that he forced himself on a woman several years ago.

Hello again everybody. It has now almost been two weeks since my boyfriend admitted he committed one of the most despicable acts possible against another human being. TW: rape, sexual assault, and sexual violence. If these topics hurt you in any way, please stop reading now.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ikhr8n/my_29f_boyfriend_25m_admitted_that_he_forced/

The whole situation still feels surreal. I have gone from being angry at him to being angry at myself. I have written long texts to him and then deleted them completely. I have gone through stages of denial where I thought that Jason, being such a good guy, may not have actually done anything wrong? Maybe a woman gaslighted him into feeling that he had committed a crime when she consented at the time?

Then I realized that everyone who commented on my last post hit the nail squarely on the head. He didn't go to the police to turn himself in for what he did. If he truly felt remorse, that is what he would have done. His charm and natural "understanding" of women's problems were complete ruses; many people with sociopathic tendencies are great with people. Most of all, he gets to cry and move on with his life. He gets to love another woman again. His victim? I can't even fathom what she's going through.

I finally called him two nights ago. He wanted to talk about how we could mend our relationship, but after two weeks of not hearing his voice and being scared of how I may run back to him, it hit me like a truck: I don't love him anymore. I told him that I wanted him to vacate his apartment for three hours while I gathered my belongings. He said he would do so. I ended the call by telling him that if he felt any remorse, he would go to the police and accept all charges for what he did, not contest them in court, and take his punishment. He started talking about how that wouldn't bring justice to his victim. Then he said that he loved me. Twisted fuck.

I showed up the next morning at the decided time with my sister, he was nowhere to be seen. I'm confident he won't contact me again.

Thank you all so much for helping me through this. I'm going to find a therapist as soon as possible.

TL;DR: my rapist boyfriend won't turn himself in, and I broke up with him. I safely gathered my belongings and now I'm living with my sister.

Edit: I apologize for editing the post, but after receiving a couple of private messages asking me to drop his personal information, I must make one thing clear: I will not, under any circumstances, post any identifying information about him. It is not only against sitewide rules, but if I were reckless enough to do that, he could sue me. Again, I repeat: nobody is getting his information. He is a monster. He probably deserves worse. But it will not be coming from me.

ANSWER: Thank you, but I don't want to act like this was a hard decision to make. My mind was made up and other than short periods of self-denial I knew it was over. He's a monster through and through.

QUESTION: My mother (43) wants me (18f) to donate eggs so she can have kids with her fiance.

Small Update: I let my sister know some of the things that are going on and we have started collecting evidence. There's a lot of small things that CPS might care to know about, like mood swings and extreme punishments.

There's a lot to this and good God it's a mess. I go off to college in August. I turned 18 at the end of May.

When I was about 14, my mother asked me if I would be willing to help her have a baby one day. I said yes without understanding what it all entailed. She is still holding me to this even though I have since changed my mind.

My mom has been threatening to kick me out over my refusal. She is pressuring me to sign a contract that would bind me to one cycle sometime before I turn 30 and she has even discussed me carrying a baby for her once I'm done with school. I feel very nervous about this and I'm trying to stall/hold out until I am no longer under her roof. I can't afford to move out (Eta: until August). I'm not sure if I could eventually get out of this contract if I were to sign it, but I don't want to risk it. Her fiance is totally cool with this. I don't know what to do.

I'm trying to make plans to maybe stay with a friend, but I'm hoping to find a way out of this with my personal items. I know my mom will hold things hostage so to speak.

Sorry if this isn't the right sub.

Edit: I am very relieved to know that the contract would be under duress and so wouldn't be upheld. :)

ANSWER: If you are leaving and your mom holds your property or valuables, or government issued IDs hostage, you can call the police.

QUESTION: I [29M] Do Almost Nothing Around the House and My Wife [25F] is Upset?

I’m the sole earner for our household, my wife stays home. We don’t have children. Due primarily to a string of horrible jobs that led to some pretty bad anxiety issues for her, we agreed last year that she could stop working and pursue whatever hobbies, activities etc. that she wanted while I provided for us financially.

As part of this, she agreed to take care of basically everything related to the home - cooking, cleaning, laundry, shopping and so on. I still handle a couple items, really just the garbage and the lawn. Beyond that it’s all her, and she does a great job. Coming home to a clean house and a fresh meal from a wife who’s happier than I’ve seen her in years is wonderful. She’s also able to keep herself looking even hotter than usual which is definitely fun for us both lol

Anyway that’s the arrangement we have currently, and I think it’s more than fair (as does she) - our house isn’t big at all so we’re talking maybe 2-3 hours a day max to stay on top of everything. Might be temporary as she recharges and develops new skills/interests, or it could be permanent. I’m fine with either one, it’s up to her.

She had some friends over the other evening, I was playing games in my office. I came out to grab a drink and overheard her friends commenting on our situation. They were saying it wasn’t fair that my wife had to do everything, I should be pitching in more, what is this the 1950s, shit like that.

Ok whatever, I disagree but they can talk. Doesn’t affect me. I come out again later to get something and these “guests” actually start straight up scolding me. Same nonsense as before, I’m lazy, I need to do this and that blah blah. My wife clearly didn’t agree or intend for this to happen but was too embarrassed to say anything.

They end their rant with one of them saying “You both make messes, why should she be the only one cleaning them up?”

I probably should have just said it was none of their business and been done with it, but I was pissed and wanted to show how dumb that question was. So I responded:

“We both need money, why should I be the only one making it?”

They didn’t say much after that so I went back into my office, they left a short time later. I finish up in there and find my wife still in the living room, crying. I go to comfort her, thinking it was just out of embarrassment from what happened. But she said that what I said hurt her a lot. It sounded like I didn’t think she did enough and wanted her to go back to work.

I tried to explain that it was just a rhetorical question to make a point but she’s still upset. How can I reassure her that I’m happy with our arrangement and appreciate everything she does?

ANSWER: There are two issues here, and you are combining them.  Your wife is not upset because you don't do anything around the house as your title says, she is upset because your comment wasn't directed at the "friends" attacking you but instead it focused on her. You said yourself she isn't working because of "pretty bad anxiety issues", even if she is happier now and doesn't want to work that doesn't mean she doesn't feel bad for not contributing financially.  You should have chosen your words better and you need to apologize for that, period. It doesn't matter if it was a rhetorical question, it would be like if I knew you had something you were embarrassed about in your life and I ask a group of people a rhetorical question specifically about that thing while you are right there.

People are saying she should have stood up for you, but I understand not wanting to being confrontation on oneself when it seems like the mob is in agreement.  You could have said something more along the lines of "This is what we have agreed on as husband and wife, if there needs to be a discussion about it then it will take place between us alone." They are assholes for the way they treated you, but you are in the wrong for the choice of wording given the situation that led to your wife being a stay at home spouse in the first place.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My (28F) boyfriend (28m) of 8 years cheated on me with his best friend's fiance and is now begging me for a second chance. I still love him but I dont know what to do.

Link to the original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/hqdk5w/my\_28f\_boyfriend\_28m\_of\_8\_years\_cheated\_on\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqdk5w/my_28f_boyfriend_28m_of_8_years_cheated_on_me/)

First of all, I'd like to say thank you for those who gave me really solid advice in my last post. A lot has happened in the last few days. Sorry I havent been replying to any of you, I just didnt think I was in the right headspace to actually hold a meaningful conversation. Rest assured I did read all of your replies. Even the really mean ones.

So where do I begin? We'll I think some of you would be delighted to know that he left me for not being supportive. Sucks to be me I guess. I guess you guys were right, I am a sucky girlfriend. He's now off to be with his brand new supportive GF.

Nah, just kidding but some of you wouldve wanted that to happen, right?

So heres what really happened...

After reading some of your comments, I started to see things from a different perspective. I never really thought of it as anything other than cheating, and it didnt help that when he came home to me that morning he claimed to have cheated on me and I guess my mind just started going to a dark place where logic goes out of the window. Its definitely not an excuse but I really wasnt in the right mindset after he said he cheated. I guess it was after the realization that this man would never willingly hurt me is when all the anger and pain of being cheated on was washed away.

I couldnt really bring myself to talk to him at first. He was on the couch blankly staring at whatever was on tv. He looked... empty. I sat beside him and told him I had no intentions of breaking up. Well, he came to life almost instantly and before I knew it, his arms were wrapped around me. He was shaking and I could tell he was crying. I was too. Remember when I said I felt my world was crumbling around me? Well for the first time in what seemed like forever, I could feel it starting to fall back into place. I didnt realize how much a simple embrace can be so calming. Everything was starting to feel right again.

Then we talked. He apologized again for cheating and when I told him I didnt think he cheated, he had a puzzled look on his face. I asked him if he gave consent and he said no. I tried to explain I guess he still doesnt realize that he was actually taken advantage of. He said the first thing that came to mind after what happened was that he cheated and was so afraid of losing me.

This man, after being raped, first thought of how much he betrayed me instead of how he was betrayed himself. I was floored. He said his first response had to be to win me back, which is why he's been going the extra mile the last few days taking care of me from a distance.

When it was my turn to speak, I told him how sorry I was for not being supportive. I jumped to conclusions without actually thinking about it clearly, which was pretty out of character for me.

A few more exchanges after that and the conversation shifted to Max and HM. I told him that I never wanted him anywhere near Max or her again and he agreed. I've always thought he was a bad influence but I never thought he'd take it this far so I never stopped him from seeing his (ex) best friend. He showed me his phone which didnt have a lock anymore. He said he blocked both of them on everything but wanted to keep the open phone policy. He said its so I can be sure he isnt back in touch with Max.

I urged him to file a police report but he was against it. He said that even if he was raped, he couldnt bring himself to do it. I didnt really know about it at first but his family and Max's family had a very long history of friendship. Their moms were college best friends and their dads work together. Not only were the two of them close, even their families were close. I thought they were just neighbors but it was more than that. I didnt know cause every time I visit his family, the topic was never brought up and I havent really met any of Max's family except for his little sister who came by to play with BF's little brother. He said he didnt want to ruin decades of friendship and would be content with just going NC with Max.

He's getting tested later today and I hope that bitch didnt give my man anything. I'm also pretty confident my BF didnt get HM pregnant cause Max absolutely hates children so Id imagine HM would be on BC given how many dudes she sleeps with.

BF and I came to the conclusion that Max most likely set the whole thing up to break us apart so he can have his best friend back. They used to be partners in crime after all, when it came to parties and picking up women. I would like to point out that I did not force him to change. He himself chose to do so but I know he did it for me, which just makes me fall in love with him even more. When we first met he was still the playboy party animal he was but he told me after hanging out with me for a few weeks that he didnt really feel like sleeping around anymore. I didnt really believe him at first, obviously. I've also noticed that a few people were bashing me for making him wait 1 year for sex. I'm sorry, I just have different views. I believe that sex is for people who love each other, so I wasnt willing to sleep with anyone I wasnt deeply in love with and didnt love me back. I dont judge people who sleep around. My BF has a high body count but I dont really hold it against him but back then, I just wanted to be sure I wasnt just a girl he bangs or a "conquest" but someone who he actually loves and sees a future with. Considering his past, I was very skeptical for a while and I had my walls up the entire time but he slowly tore them apart and I'm glad he did. That reluctant yes when he first asked me out was and still is one of the best decisions Ive ever made.

Max's plan had the opposite effect. Its rough now but I can see this experience making our relationship even stronger. I love him more than ever believe it or not and Im sure he feels the same way. The last few days have taught us both how shitty our lives would be without the other. I guess it made us value each other more? Not that either of us took the other for granted.

And yes, we are both getting therapy. Both individually and as a couple. To be honest, Im still shaken over the whole thing. Even when we cuddle, I can still imagine HM having her way with him and I cant help but cry about it. If Im still shaken up by the whole thing, I can only imagine how much worse it is for him but I'll be there for him every step of the way.

I know he didnt cheat.

I know he wont break my heart.

I know that he loves me.

I know that I love him.

Its hard right now but knowing those facts makes me confident we can see this through. One redditor pointed out that we were soulmates and I like to think that we are. I cant see myself being with anyone but him.

Thanks again for all your advice and for making me see things differently. I'll try to reply and answer questions when necessary and when I can.

ANSWER: I'm glad it worked out this way, thank you for supporting him in the end. I'm a male survivor myself, this gives me hope that we can truly start to be taken seriously soon.

Edit: You guys have been crazy kind, thank you so much. It means a lot :)

QUESTION: [UPDATE] The hiring manager [30sF] where I [30sF] am interviewing is someone I fired last year.The hiring manager [30sF] where I [30sF] am interviewing is someone I fired last year.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/g24fza/the\_hiring\_manager\_30sf\_where\_i\_30sf\_am/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g24fza/the_hiring_manager_30sf_where_i_30sf_am/)

I got a lot of good feedback and you guys are right; I did let my temper get the best of me in front of her on multiple occasions and that makes me a bad boss.

I went to her office unsure of what to expect. The door was locked when I got there, so I stood outside waiting. She came up behind me and said my name. She asked me if I was ready to interview and I just said yes.

We sat down in her office and she pulled out her phone and started recording. She asked me if I minded being taped and I said no.

She asked me basic interview questions, and then she asked me if there was anything that I knew I had to work on. I told her that my temper was an issue in the past, but that I have had a sudden wake-up call about my temper and that I was actively working on it. I apologized for leaving her hanging with training and that I was glad to see she was in a better position.

She told me that one of the things she had learned was forgiveness. She had left the company she was at and rehired to because they had wronged her during the merger. When she was offered the position back, it was with an apology, a raise, and now she is in a better position than when she left. She said sometimes an apology can start you down the path towards something better.

She told me that she is willing to hire me for a good wage because she knew I was good at a lot of things at my previous job. She said if I lost my temper during the trial period, it would be the end, but she was hopeful that it wouldn't happen. She asked me if I could start Friday.

She started training me today, and I definitely realized I was the problem and why she didn't succeed where I was. She is absolutely wonderful at the job with great client interactions. She should've been able to easily pick up the work I was throwing at her if she had been properly trained. I'm glad that she gave the company a second chance because she deserves everything they have given her. I hope to learn a lot from her and show her that she didn't waste her time on me.

I've also signed up for therapy to manage my anger online.

TL;DR: I ate my humble pie and went to the interview. She is giving me a second chance and I hope to be a good employee. I'm starting anger management soon.

ANSWER: Now this is wholesome. I hope you do actually go to anger management classes OP. Best of luck to you.

QUESTION: I (31/m) am in a submissive relationship with my girlfriend (28/f) and I just realized she doesn't actually love me

My girlfriend (of 1 1/2 years) and I follow an "FLR" which means female led relationship. It's basically a lifestyle fetish thing. Without being too specific I basically have dedicated my life to making her happy in a seemingly selfless way (it's not really selfless I guess because I enjoy it myself, but that's all I get from it). She controls all the finances, we only do stuff if she wants to do it, we never do what I want, sex is only for her, I do all the chores, etc. The whole relationship is basically about double standards that benefit her and that don't benefit me, to put it simply. But that's just how our relationship is. I've struggled with it at times but I enjoy it overall.

I have a sciatica issue with my back. It's normally not a big deal but over the weekend I seriously screwed it up. It was totally agonizing and I had to go to the hospital. My girlfriend was completely unsupportive and didn't care about me at all. She told me to power through the pain but I was like rolling around in pain almost. It was clearly impossible. I called her by her first name by accident and she yelled at me for being disrespectful. I had to drive myself to the hospital because she wouldn't let me use the phone. She was just completely annoyed about the whole thing. I think she told me that she hopes I catch the virus but I wasn't sure. I was out of it as I was leaving the house. They gave me some muscle relaxers in the hospital and I'm doing better now, but I'm trying not to exert myself too much until the disk completely goes back into place.

Also, while she does sometimes treat me badly as part of the "role", she didn't seem to be doing that here. I mean she knew it was serious, and I think she just revealed exactly how she felt. I always thought that even though we had this relationship, that she did actually care about me. But because of the way our relationship was, it didn't come out much. She loved me in her own way, I thought. But these last days, I realized that she actually just views me as a literal servant. She doesn't care about me as a person, only as submissive partner. Even calling it a partnership doesn't make sense.

Maybe this is the wrong place to post this but I wanted to get a vanilla perspective with people that have normal, healthy relationships. Am I overthinking this? Do you think I might be able to make the relationship work long-term? And if you have dabbled in d/s stuff I'd be curious to hear if any of you have had similar experiences. Thanks.

ANSWER: Regardless of your type of relationship, your partner should always care and love you.  
This is the baseline. It doesn't matter how you manifest or arrange it, if there is no love and caring, then it's abuse even in vanilla relationships.

You need to leave and find someone who cares for you.

QUESTION: My antivax mom started crying after I said I didn't want to associate with anti-vax protesters and threatened not to help me pay for college if I got a flu shot.

So, to preface, I (17F) am an incoming freshman in college. I'm going to a UC (won't say which for obvious reasons), but I got into the school's semi-competitive engineering program and it was one of my top choices for college. I absolutely love the school. Unfortunately, the UC system just instituted a new rule that all students need to get a flu shot before they can attend. My mom (50F) has been incredibly upset about this for the past two days.

She called me up about an hour ago to talk about how I wanted to "deal" with the problem of having to get a flu shot.

She was asking me to reconsider going to another college halfway across the country because they don't require flu shots. The school is not nearly as good in terms of engineering, it's a long way away and it's expensive as hell for out of state students. I have zero desire to go there. I told her this wasn't the hill I wanted to die on, I don't think getting a flu shot is really that big of a deal and I certainly don't want it to be the reason I end up not going my top choice college.

She got kinda angry with me and basically implied that she wouldn't pay for me to attend college if I got the shot, I would be completely on my own.

Then she said, "Why don't you march your protester self (I organized a BLM march in our city back in June, so she's referencing that) down to city hall. I'm sure you can find people who will protest with you."

And I responded, "I'm not sure I want to associate with those people," which I know was super mean and sounds awful to me in hindsight. She started crying and hung up on me after I said that.

My mom and I seem to be at odds about everything right now. She was upset with me for organizing the BLM march, she doesn't like most of my political views, and she's even threatened to burn a book I was reading by Richard Dawkins about evolution because "he advocated for cannibalism" (???) and she seems to vaguely think evolution is a lie, despite not be religious so far as I can tell.  I also had to get a series of vaccinations in ninth grade to attend my high school, which my dad took me to get and which my mom is still extremely upset about almost four years later. I feel like this whole disaster is going to be the final straw though.

I just really need some advice on how to deal with this before she comes home from work and gets super mad and starts yelling at me.

Edit: Okay, I just want to add because people keep suggesting this, I can't exactly go behind her back here and get the shot on my own. Like, physically yes I can walk to Walgreens and get it. But being allowed to go to college = got the flu shot. She will know, and therein lies the problem. Also, I know my mom sounds kinda bad on paper (or "on Reddit") but she really is a loving and caring person who is attempting to look out for me in her own way, so please stop with the name-calling. I came here asking for help, not asking you to shit on my mom. It's just not helpful or productive. Thanks.

Edit 2: Just want to let everyone know that I am reading every single one of your comments. I want to answer everyone's questions, but that might take a while as I'm still working out how to deal with this situation with my dad. Thanks to the people who have been helpful, supportive, and encouraging with their advice. I'll update soon.

ANSWER: It will be a rude awakening for her once she realizes most colleges REQUIRE you to have a meningitis shot!

QUESTION: Boyfriend keeps trying to “upgrade” or “improve” me by calling me chubby

I’ve F(23) been dating my boyfriend M(27) for a year. I am 5”4’ and 125lbs. He pursued me. Slowly he keeps making more and more negative comments about my appearance.

He made me a workout and eating plan and constantly asks if I follow it. He basically wants me to go vegan. Honestly I’m not into the vegan lifestyle and I don’t eat horrible. When we order in yesterday I got baked ziti. He looked at me and said how could I be ordering this when we both agreed I need to lose weight.

Everytime I try to dump him over this, he tells me I don’t understand where he is coming from. He told me I’m average and he wants me to stand out. That he noticed I have low self esteem and he is trying to make me confident and be happy with myself. Everyday he asks me if I did my work outs.

He will send me photos of other girls and say if I follow what he says I will look like that. He REALLY pursued me and now I feel like he’s killing my self esteem. Why pursue someone so hard if you aren’t that attracted to them? He told me if I lose fifteen pounds I’ll be perfect.

He sends me pictures of women who have post pregnancy bodies or not good bodies at all and he tells me that they are like me, that they are chubby and not curvy. Or he will send me pictures of girls I don’t consider pretty and say if I listen to him I will look like that, I just need to lose weight. I tell him I think I’m thinner than those girls and he tells me that he has better eyes.

Honestly at this point I don’t want to break up because I feel no one will find me attractive. I feel like I want his approval. I’ve been wearing baggy clothes because I’m so ashamed of my body. I use to like my body but now I’m ashamed.

Why is he dating me if I’m so unattractive? How do I gain my self esteem back? Why pursue me?

Edit: I would like to thank everyone for the overwhelming response. I can’t get back to everyone, but I appreciate each and every message. Honestly I didn’t realize my situation was that bad, I am going to assume he had me under control. This really was reassuring and I’m so happy I found this community and made this thread. I broke up with him over text message and explained to him how you talk and treat me is not how you talk to anyone let alone your girlfriend who you are suppose to love. That I hope he changes for the next girl he dates because he’s a miserable person and no one deserves his abuse. I blocked his number, I’m sure he might try to show up at my house, but I just felt the need to end it as soon as possible. I think I’m going to take some time for myself since my self esteem is still in the gutter, but thank you all 💕

ANSWER: > I’m nervous no one else will want me

AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY HE DOES IT!!!!

It's a psychological manipulation, ~~called "negging".~~

It is a series of negative comments designed to make you feel you can't risk losing  him.

QUESTION: My boyfriend [22M] spiked my [21F] drink the other night.

I’m full aware that I might be overreacting a little, but some outside opinions would help ease my mind either way.

So my boyfriend \[22M\] and I \[21F\] have been together for about 2 years now and currently share an apartment in our college town. I don’t drink. I don’t have a reason or anything, just never acquired a taste for alcohol. I’ll take a sip of my boyfriend or a friend’s drink just to try it every now and again, but I usually don’t like it. I go to bars with friends and hang out with them all the time, and I’ll usually just have a soda or a water and offer to drive if need be.

My boyfriend was a little stressed the other day since he had to work during Black Friday, so he was tired when he came home. We were watching something on Netflix when he gets up and says he’s going to make himself a drink. I offered to do it for him, but he just said “no no, don’t worry about it, I’ll bring you a water.” So he comes back with his drink and a flavored water for me, and when I sipped it, something tasted off about it. I only took a few more sips of it before I just put in on the coffee table and ignored it.

He asked me why I wasn’t drinking it, which was kind of a strange question to me. I told him it tasted a little off and maybe I bought a bad case or something. He immediately seems to get frustrated and tells me to just drink it so it doesn’t go to waste. Push came to shove, and turns out he put vodka in my water. When I asked him why he would do that without telling me, he said that it was a fantasy of his to have drunken sex with me, and it was “getting ridiculous” that I wouldn’t get drunk so we could do that. He has never communicated this to me before. I had no idea. I dumped my drink out into the sink, and then he was angry at me for wasting alcohol. Now, I’m scared. He put something in my drink without my knowledge, and that scared me. I’m not sure what to do now.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm realizing now that I am, in fact, under reacting. You guys are all right, I can't seem to stop thinking about this a few days after the fact, so that must mean something. I'm currently packing a bag before I head off to class in about an hour. I called a friend of mine and she is gonna meet me on campus after my class and I'm gonna stay with her until I can figure out where I'm staying for the remainder of the semester. Thank you all for knocking some proper insight into me. I seriously appreciate it.

EDIT AGAIN: Got out of class, currently with a trusted friend and heading over to her place. I tried calling my "boyfriend" with no answer, I'll handle that later. But, I'm feeling pretty apathetic about the whole situation right now. Though I'll admit that my friend got a good laugh out of me by saying "you look like you need a fucking drink."

LAST EDIT: It's the next day, and I'm logging in to find over 800 more comments and over 20 DMs. First of all, all the DMs have been super kind and I appreciate every single one of them. Seriously, thank you. Second of all, the comments here started to get a little controversial as to whether it was smart of me to leave or not. I mean, what's done is done, so it doesn't really matter now. Some people might disagree, but to me, a 2-year relationship is not very long, so I was no longer concerned about "destroying a 2-year relationship."

My friend and I went back to that apartment later last night because I decided I did want to talk to my (now ex-) boyfriend in person instead of over the phone. I know some people might not agree with me doing this, but again, what's done is done. I expressed why I left, I expressed that he lost my trust (and I did not accuse him of rape). My friend had no influence on this conversation, she remained silent the whole time. This is when he finally apologized. He followed it up by saying "if you'd just have a drink like a normal adult-" but he immediately took it back and apologized again. My name is not on the lease for the apartment, so I took the rest of my things, let him keep anything that was in the kitchen, and my friend and I left. There was no yelling, no harsh arguments, nothing. Just a clean cut-off. I'll go back home to my parents this weekend to explain everything and then I'll figure out where to live for the remainder of the school year. Thank you guys for giving me advice, and while I didn't respond to all of you, know that I do appreciate every opinion that was given here. As far as the status of whether this act will be reported or not, I have chosen not to share with the internet.

ANSWER: You are not overreacting at all. He lied to your face, spiked your drink, urged you to drink it and threw a fit when you chucked it away. The whole thing is extremely immoral. He clearly demonstrated that he has no respect for your bodily integrity.

Chances are his disrespect for your personhood would extend to other occasions as well. If I were you, I wouldn't stay to find out if he would go through with raping me or not.

QUESTION: My wife wants to punish our daughter for touching herself

I(30m) have a daughter(6f) and a wife(28f)

Last night my wife walked into our daughters room and caught her with her hands down her pants. My wife is very religious and thinks that masterbaition is a sin. She scolded our daughter and asked me what a good punishment would be for her. I told her that she shouldn’t be punished and needs to go and apologize to her for scolding her.

This started an argument between us where she accused me of allowing sinful behavior and said that our daughter needs to be spanked. I took my daughter with me to stay at my brothers house because I don’t want my wife to punish her for something completely natural.

She text bombed me all night and I’m having second thoughts on our marriage. What should I do

Edit:we never spoke about this during our discussion on how we would raise her

ANSWER: The child is 6. She doesn't even know what's she doing. Many children her age and younger touch themselves as a way of exploring their body, its not sexual for them. If you punish her for it she's going to have very warped views on sex when she is older and it will damage her in relationships, leading her to feel disgusting when she engages in sexual behavior. You really need to talk to your wife about it. Would any kind of couple therapy help? I don't know, your wife is obviously very into her beliefs it will be a hard thing to change. If you do divorce who will look after your daughter? She will be able to punish her for these things if your not in the picture as much

QUESTION: My gf was raped and became pregnant. I broke up with her because she wanted to keep the baby

Really, really shit situation.

2 months ago, my GF was raped. It was done in a park. She didn't want to report it and went into a full breakdown, wouldn't speak to police, go to hospital etc. I couldn't force her, so I just stayed with her.

She was, obviously, in a really shit state since, and I've been with her, by her side, listening to her, helping her. We went to therapy, and she knows I'm there for her. She has a history of depression, and I've been really worried.

Last week, we found out she was pregnant. I was abroad for 2 months before the rape on work, and can back early to care for her. So the baby definitely isn't mine. She is 100% sure it's the rapist's.

So we had a discussion. She is a devout Catholic. We initially decided on a abortion, but after she speak to her Mother, she has decided to keep the baby, saying that isn't the baby's fault.

I flat out told her that I would not help raise a baby of a guy who raped her. She cried and begged me not to leave. I told she is the one making the choice - either she keeps the baby and I leave, or she aborts the baby and I stay. I would not let this go.

She didn't want either of those things to happen, so I told her we were done...

I feel shit. Was i wrong?

ANSWER: 1. It sucks that she was raped.
2. It’s perfectly fair that she chose to keep the child.  Abortion is a boundary issue for Catholics.
3. It’s perfectly fair that you don’t want to raise a rapists child.  That’s a boundary issue for you.

Sometimes people are incompatible.  You two obviously were.  You shouldn’t feel guilty for respecting your own boundaries.

Pro-tip: don’t date people with radically different religious, moral, or political beliefs.

There are a lot of fish in the sea.  You two both made tough decisions that respected each of your boundaries.  You weren’t wrong.

QUESTION: I (17m) am basically grounded until my 18th birthday in May because I was caught with condoms. I don’t talk to my parents anymore and they are hurt.

Hi.

I (17m) and my girl (18f) have been dating since last November and started having sex in June. I always keep my condoms under my bed because nobody just goes snooping under my bed. Mid July my dog was under my bed and he took my condom box and ran out with it. I stopped him in the hallway and took them back but my mom had already seen it. She snatched it out of my hand & started yelling for my dad. He came, she held the box up and pointed at me, and they both looked so disappointed and I felt very ashamed. They ended up breaking me and my girlfriend up and stalk my every move to make sure we aren’t together. Although we’re not “together” anymore, I find ways around their blocks when I can. My parents have decided that COVID is a great opportunity to do some family bonding. They bought board games, made every Saturday movie night, and want everyone to take turns talking about their day. I often start studying so I am too busy to have to join. However sometimes they will force me to join. I just sit there silently or I don’t engage at all. I don’t mean to hurt their feelings- there just isn’t anything I want to say to them. My dad got angry a couple of days ago because of my silence with them. He screamed about how I haven’t had a real conversation with them in basically two months. I let him scream and I still stayed silent. Again, I just don’t have anything to say to them.. At all. However, my dad’s yelling did make me feel like a terrible kid for not speaking to them. I guess I should start talking to them, but I just don’t want to. I know that family is important and you should never hold grudges towards your family, but my feelings feel so set in stone that I don’t think I can bring myself to have a true conversation with them. Is there anyway I can just get over myself and speak to my parents?

ANSWER: 8 months...for rubbers?? Holy shit! People get less prison time for personal amounts of blow.

I DEEPLY hope it's just something they said in anger. Damn! I'm sorry op. Maybe they will back down a d bit in time.

QUESTION: My (28/f) dog growled at my niece (3/f) after she spent an entire evening harassing him. Now my brother (31/m) wants me to put the dog down.

Hi everyone. I have fostered a multitude of dogs in my life, and dealt with a lot of behavioral problems--dog aggression, cat aggression, food aggression, separation anxiety, super high prey drives...I've seen it all, and I've certainly encountered my fair share of dogs who weren't safe around small children. So I feel extremely confident in saying my current 5 year-old lab mix is safe for kids. He's basically a gigantic teddy bear, and loves everyone.

However, it's always been my personal philosophy that dogs (and any other animal, really) should never be left alone with young kids, even if it's the sweetest, most mild-mannered dog in the world. The kids don't understand when they're pushing the dog past its limits, and the dog cannot reasonably be expected to put up with being harassed long after it's signaled that it would like to be left alone.

My niece has never been good with my dog. She pulls his tail, climbs on/lays on him, hits him, pulls his ears, gets in his face and yells at him, and never gives him a second to himself unless she's forced to. He is basically a saint with her, but every dog has its limits. I stay as on-top of this behavior as I can, forcing her to leave him alone when it starts to seem like too much, and locking him away in a bedroom if she won't. My brother and SIL (30/f) really just don't get it, though. I've tried to talk to them about this behavior a bunch of times, and they know it's wrong, but they think it's wrong in the same way that her refusing to share or not picking up her toys is wrong. They don't understand that it's dangerous, and that if she was left alone long enough, my dog might lose it and attack her. This has been going on for over a year, I've tried to have this conversation with my brother over and over, but he always acts like I'm criticizing his parenting. Which is not the case; I don't think my niece is especially bratty or out of control for a kid that age, it's just that this behavior is dangerous to both her and my dog, and it needs constant intervention. The same way that a small kid playing with the stove isn't especially bratty, it's just especially dangerous, and needs to be curbed ASAP. I even tried having a dog trainer friend explain this to him, and he still didn't get it.

I've tried to come up with excuses for why we can never meet at my house for our family hangouts, but I couldn't think of one the other day, and my brother and niece came over. I was cooking dinner and not paying enough attention to make sure my dog was okay (which was absolutely my fault, and I accept responsibility). I asked my brother a few times to keep her away from my dog, but he kept saying she was fine. I did move my niece away from him a few times, but I wasn't vigilant enough, and my dog ended up getting to the end of his rope and growling at my niece.

I immediately grabbed my dog and brought him into my bedroom. I did not punish him at all; frankly, I'm glad that he signaled loud and clear that he was uncomfortable. I would never want to discourage him from doing that, because then next time, he'd skip the growling and go straight to attacking. I came out of the room, ready to talk to my brother about how this is what I've been talking about. But he was furious, yelled that my dog is a menace who should be put down, and left.

I completely understood his reaction. That's his daughter, and he was afraid for her, and nothing else mattered to him. But he hasn't calmed down at all since this happened, and won't talk to me except to say my dog needs to be put down and he won't be speaking to me until it's done. He's also tried to involve our parents, who said they will absolutely not be getting involved (they know my niece's behavior with my dog has been a problem in the past). I have not heard from my SIL at all, which makes me think she might agree with me. Knowing her personality type, I don't really think she'd sit out a fight like this if she thought my dog was dangerous.

The way I see it, this is solely my fault and my brother's fault. I shouldn't have allowed my niece to harass my dog; I knew what could happen, and I was more concerned about how upset my brother got when I tried to bring it up, than I was about my niece's safety. I should've just said my niece wasn't allowed around my dog until she got a bit older, and dealt with whatever fallout there was within my family. Similarly, my brother should've kept a better eye on his kid, and not been so defensive when I tried to explain the problem. My dog, on the other hand, put up with being harassed for over a year, and when he was finally pushed to his limits, signaled very loudly (and harmlessly) that he needed to be removed from the situation. He is not dangerous, and I will not put him down.

My brother is now saying that the entire family has sided with a dog over his child, which is not the case. It's just that there are lots of other solutions to this problem. I am perfectly happy to crate my dog when they come over, or leave him in another room, or just never have them over again and hang out somewhere else. There's no reason for my niece to ever see my dog again, and I'd be happy to talk over a solution with him. It's just that he won't talk to me at all, and I don't know what to do. Should I give him more time to cool off? Should I go over to his house and try to talk? I don't want to ruin this relationship, we are very close, but I'm just not putting my dog down over this.

tl;dr After a year of warnings and my brother refusing to do anything about it, my dog got fed up and growled at my niece. Now he wants my dog put down, and won't talk to me until I do it.

ANSWER: Your brother is being an ass, and I'm sorry. I'd let him pout it out. You going to him to talk it over is only giving him what he wants: attention. It's not his daughter's fault or the dog's fault: it's his and his wife's fault for not teaching their daughter how to play with your dog and when to leave your dog alone.    If they want to be this ridiculous and ruin your relationship with them over it, that's on them.

QUESTION: My (F30) husband (M33) has been cheating on me with my best friend (F31) and asked me tonight if I want to be in a “throuple”.

Edit: You beautiful people of reddit. I’m overcome (and honestly overwhelmed) with the outpouring of comments and support and awards and DMs. I just got home from work and am crying but this is a good cry. It’s been a really awful year and yesterday was brutal but logging on to this has just been the most special thing. I promise to read all your comments and DMs but it’s going to take some time haha. People who spent their coins on awards — that’s very sweet of you and I’m surprised that you’d do that on a throwaway but I want you to know that it honestly touched my heart that strangers can be this caring about a nobody. I don’t feel alone like I did last night when I posted. THANK YOU. I still have no idea the best way to leave this situation but I’m definitely not signing up for a throuple which I made crystal clear to my husband at 4am. Also, my manager pulled me aside today and asked me if everything is okay because I obviously didn’t sleep and look super gross I think from the throwing up and not eating. I just told him what happened because I couldn’t think of a lie on the spot. He took me to his office and searched our legal Bar and legal help and divorce mediation and looked me dead in the eyes and said if I tell anyone at work he’ll deny it so then I broke down sobbing in his office which was really not my finest moment. So it turns out he has a soul and gave me Monday off in his words to “get yourself to a lawyer but keep it quiet from your husband”. So on Monday my husband will think I’m at work but I’ll be seeing what my next steps should be from a legal perspective. Speaking of my husband, I asked him to give me some space for the next few days and he’s on the couch. My best friend texted me a few times today but I’ve just left her on read. This was a long edit! I’m going to eat something and sleep now. Thank you for caring reddit.

Okay, let me start out by saying fuck 2020. My husband lost his job in April, and has been home while I have been working extra shifts (making $12/hr) to keep us from going broke. Yes, I’ve been out of the house more than at home. Yes, I haven’t been super active in bed because I am really exhausted all the time from working 70 hours a week STANDING ON MY FEET all 70 hours. I thought he’d appreciate that I am working so we have things like food and a place to live. Instead he and my best friend have been fucking while I’ve been at work. She lost her job too. They’ve always gotten along with each other and I’ve never felt jealous or threatened that they have hung out together just the 2 of them over the years. One very drunk night in 2009 she and I did make out but it was a one time thing and I didn’t enjoy it. I thought I could trust them and that they were just friends. Obviously, I’m an idiot.

Enough backstory. I came home tonight and found them snuggling on the couch watching tv. Like in a spooning position, but it was very obvious it was intimate. They didn’t panic, but she sat up. Then he sat up. At this point I felt my stomach turn into a rock and I felt dizzy. No word of a lie, my body went into some kind of shock? I just walked to the bathroom and closed the door and sat on the toilet. I just started crying after I have no idea how long. I threw up. I heard them whisper talking but couldn’t make out what they were saying, but then they knocked on the bathroom door and asked if I was ok, and I told them “obviously fucking not.” They didn’t backpedal or deny anything. They didn’t admit to fucking then, but my best friend said we should all probably talk about what’s going on.

I stayed in the bathroom. We talked through the door. That’s when my husband said “ok, yes, we didn’t want you to find out like this, but we have been in a relationship since July.” He said some more things but I honestly can’t remeber them because my ears were kind of ringing? And I kept thing about him saying relationship. This wasn’t a fling or a one night stand. I could maybe forgive that but a real relationship? Isn’t marriage supposed to me mean just and I are in a relationship? So he says whatever and then my best friend says “so what do you think?” I missed everything he said obviously so I told her that and she said “so you missed the part about all three of us living together?” After me asking what? my husband clarified that she would stay on the couch but they’d keep each other company during the day and I could be with her too if I wanted (she knows I don’t want this because we would have made out more than that one time in 2009 right?) I know she needs to move out of her place because no job=no rent payment. I had told her in the past she could always crash at my place, but I never meant like this. How could she not know that? Is my best friend an idiot? Am I an idiot?

I need advice. Yes, tell me that I’m the idiot I am for trusting them and having bad judgement and not doing my “wifely duties”. I own all those things. I just need help figuring out my next steps. I don’t want to be in a throuple and I don’t even want to look at either of them. It’s 3:30am and I can’t sleep and don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve been used. I don’t know even if I leave if I’d still have to pay for my husband’s expenses because he’s not working? Which would mean I’m paying for them to have a relationship, which idiot me has been doing since July and I really hate my life right now.

TL:DR All work and no play makes THROWRA_justfml a fucked over wife and friend.

ANSWER: Sincerely from the bottom of my being

How stupid can he be, cheating on the sole person who you’re ENTIRE lifestyle is dependant on?
Let them rot, it’s a blessing in disguise that you found out their true characters.

QUESTION: My (31M) dad (77M) just tested for positive for coronavirus and it's likely he'll die. What should I talk to him about for the next week?

My dad is 77 and has a compromised immune system (he's been on prednisone, an immunosuppressant, for a rarer form of vasculitis, which has affected his lungs.) It's quite likely he will die. We've had a rocky relationship in the past (typical Asian dad not getting along with/opening up to his Asian-American son) and I'm worried that he'll die before I really got a chance to ever get to know him. What are good things I could try to talk to him about this week while I have time?

ANSWER: I " interviwed" my father in law about 2 weeks before the cancer took him.   I asked him his favorite stories about his kids, his favorite various things,  his hopes for his 3 kids...    I wrote down what he said for my husband and his 2 sisters.    I completely forgot about that until I read this post.   I need to dig out that notebook.
OP-  i'm so sorry your family is going through this.   I hope you're able to find peace with your father.  God speed.

QUESTION: My (25F) husband (26M) broke our dogs leg, I'm worried for the child I'm currently carrying.

Hello all, throw away for obvious reasons.

So, I'm a big pet lover. We have several dogs, reptiles, frogs and small animals.

I work in the pet care industry and have recently lost my job due to the shutdown.

That being the case, I've been home a lot more often, and I noticed the animals aren't attached the him like me. I thought nothing of it, as I care for them mainly and had most of them before we got together.

Our pets have their own room, and yesterday I went to let out dogs out and our 5lb Chihuahua mix was limping and putting no weight on his leg. My husband jokingly said a few minutes before I checked on him, "I got Rufus to stop scratching the door."

I thought nothing of it until my poor dog was unable to move.

I took him to the vet and they did x-rays and let me know Rufus's hip was broken. They said being so small it could be because he jumped off the furniture and hurt himself, as he's rather old as well.

My husband later admitted that he lost his temper, picked Rufus up the the scruff, and beat him.

He feels incredibly guilty and wants nothing to do with any of the pets now.

I found out yesterday I'm pregnant, and I'm worried he may loose his temper with a newborn much worse then Rufus's constant scratching.

What do I do? I love this man and we've been married half a decade now.

ANSWER: Troubling that he would beat a small animal and then make a joke about it. Have you talked to him about your worries over his temper?

QUESTION: My husband tampered with his condom and forced me to keep the baby

I(24f) have a husband(30m) and a new born child.

My husband admitted to wanting a child knowing I didn’t so he poked holes in his condoms hoping to get me pregnant. When I found out I was he claimed that it must be meant to be since we took all of the precautions we could. I wanted to abort but he got mad and told me that I’m not killing his child.

When he told me what He did I started crying that he put me through so much pain during the pregnancy and risked my life(almost bled out) instead of finding someone who wants kids. I’m not sure what to do, I need advice

ANSWER: This is a form of sexual assault and domestic violence called reproductive coercion. Google it. There are tons of resources.

Get evidence. Find out what the laws in your country/state are around it and if you are able to, press charges. Even if you can't press charges get a divorce.

Edited: I deleted some words I accidentally left in. Proofreading is your friend.

QUESTION: My (29/F) husband (30/M) helped cover up his friend’s affair and can’t understand why I’m angry at him.

For context: My husband and I have been together for 7 years. He has a best friend ‘Liam’ (30) who is married to ‘Eleanor’ (31) and they’ve been together longer than us. I’ve been friends with Eleanor almost as long as I’ve known my husband, I met her through my husband/Liam.

A month ago, my friend called me in tears to tell me she found out her husband was having an affair. She confronted him and he swore he would end things and focus on their marriage.

Two days ago, her and Liam called my husband to ask him to confirm Liam was going to spend the evening with him, my husband said he was. I know he was lying because we had plans that evening so I confronted him about it. He got defensive and said he was only helping his friend out and it wasn’t a big deal because he only needed time alone and that Eleanor was too controlling. We got in an argument and eventually I asked him if he knew Liam had had an affair. He denied it but he’s a bad liar, so I knew he was BSing. I asked him how long he’s been covering for him, but he refused to answer any of my questions. When I told him I was going to let Eleanor know Liam wasn’t going to be with my husband he got really upset and told me I shouldn’t do that. We kept arguing over it and I eventually told him we should cancel our plans and he could really go hang out with Liam since helping him was so important to him.

I ended up moving into the guest room and haven’t really spoken to my husband much since. He keeps telling me he doesn’t understand why I’m so angry since it’s not like he was the one having the affair, but I really can’t look at him the same way.

How do I explain to him why I’m so upset with him? Am I overreacting?

TL;DR – my husband helped his friend cover up his affair, knowing I was friends with his wife. He now doesn’t see why I think it's a big deal.

ANSWER: I would explain it to him like he is in Eleanors shoes. Ask him how he would feel if he found out you where having an affair and Eleanor lied to him about being with you.

QUESTION: When should I tell my brother and his Fiancé that I'm pregnant?

My brother is gay and together with his fiancé for now 7 years.In November 2019 he and his fiancé were looking into adoption or surrogacy.I offered to be their surrogate with his fiancé's sperm, that way the child would be as close as possible to being their biological child.

Now in 2020 after 2 failed IVF cycles I have just learned that the embryo took and I am pregnant.Their wedding is next week.Should I tell them that the IVF worked and their child is on the way right now before their wedding, or should I wait until after?

Edit: Ok I will tell them in a few hours that way they are at both at home.

ANSWER: Congratulations to everyone! I’d say sooner the better, it’s a happy moment to be shared and I’m sure they’d want to be there throughout the pregnancy. Not sure if you wanted to go for a surprise kind of thing.

QUESTION: Update: I (32 F) work overnights. My father-in-law (60s M) keeps bad mouthing me and telling everyone I'm lazy. I'm afraid people are starting to buy it.

Hey all!

Original:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/fdzm9q/i\_32\_f\_work\_overnights\_my\_fatherinlaw\_60s\_m\_keeps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fdzm9q/i_32_f_work_overnights_my_fatherinlaw_60s_m_keeps/)

I dealt with my family members at a family gathering over the weekend. I saw my sister (one of my family member who had been texting me) and reminded her that I am asleep at 3 or 4 pm when she texts. If she texts me first thing in the morning, like when she leaves for work at 7, maybe I can do whatever favor she needs before I go to sleep. I told her that I wouldn't be adjusting my schedule to do her favors. She seemed to understand.

Over the weekend, my husband and I sat down with my father-in-law one last time to try to get him to understand that I am a medical professional, I work nights, and that my nights are as hard as working a day shift, often times harder.

I brought up my MIL, and reminded him how she called 911 at 2 am when she had her first heart attack. I told him the person on the other end of that phone had a real job, the EMTs who came to take her to the hospital had real jobs, and the ER Nurses and Doctors that treated her had real jobs. I told him that yes, I could take a day shift, but I would be unhappy in the end because I'm just not wired to be awake during the day (today is an exception because I'm on vacation and had a dentist appointment.)

Well, those who guessed that this was way more about my job were right. After the discussion, he point blank told me that my chosen hours weren't conductive to having children. When I reminded him that when his son and I got married 10 years ago, we both agreed that we weren't having children, he had some choice words.

My husband kicked him out of our house, and my family will stop inviting him to family gatherings.

It's not the outcome I wanted, but hopefully he'll come around.

TL;DR: It was about children, not about my job. We are currently no contact.

Edit: To be clear: He did not live with us, but near us. My husband kicked him out of our house that evening.

ANSWER: >heart attack

genius

>My husband kicked him out of our house, and my family will stop inviting him to family gatherings.

good work

QUESTION: UPDATE 2: I [31M] found out my fiance cheated during her [30F] bachelorette party, planning on leaving

I am making this as I feel I owe it to all of you. The amount of PM's and responses have been incredible. Many of the decisions i have taken has come from people who supported me on reddit. Both the negative and positive comments have helped me and I would like to thank all of you for taking the time to write me and support me.

Yesterday I was having my phone spammed by many family members from her side, and friends. The only person I responsed to was the sister with part of the conversation where she and the sister talks about it all. I didnt include anything in the response except an image the conversation, and the sister went pretty much silent after that (until later).

During the day i contact the co-owner of my business and let him know the full story, he told me to take as much time as I need and even adviced me to head off to a vacation (this guy is a childhood friend of mine, i dont trust anyone as much as him). My plans have changed a bit, I am still staying at this hotel for another few days and then perhaps moving on to the friend I was supposed to go to. I called him up and let him know I want to head off somewhere, perhaps a trip to somewhere nice, another country or something, its all still not yet 100% decided, but I know i will be leaving for somewhere. He said he would be up for joining me if it could be during the upcoming weeks since he is still on holiday from his work. We will see how that turns out...

Later in the day I responded to my wife, the calls kept coming in less frequently since I sent that message to her sister... i had this gut feeling she was going to come with an excuse of some sort.
I picked up the phone and first thing i hear is a "torn up voice" if u can say that in english. I could hear she had been crying all day and was in a messed up state. She kept begging me to come back, that there is an explanation to everything and that she loves me. She I have misunderstood the entire situation... I could hear the sister and someone else in the background (dont know who the other person was, maybe her friend?). Anyway I told her to explain it to me right then and there. She said because I only seen a small part of the conversation its all been misunderstood, that I should come back home, that she loves me and that i have taken a rational decision to leave without a real reason. During the entire conversation i was just giving really short, empty answers in a cold way like "yea, ok, what, explain it to me"...
After she told me its all a misunderstanding I told her to call me back in 10 minutes, and to check messenger.
After I hungup, i sent her the entire conversation log, with a ton of screenshots (not all of them, but most of the important ones). It didnt take 2 minutes for her to call back, crying hysterically saying sorry for everything, saying she wants to die rather than to lose me. She said she was "forced" by her friends and sister to have fun one last time, that she needed to let all the energy out before stepping into a marriage for life. I was just quiet during most of it. The more I didnt talk and just said "ok" the more she was crying.

She started telling me I can fuck other women if I want to get back at her, or that she will tell everyone about what she did so i can take her back, that she will do anything it takes for me to come back and that this was a mistake of her life and that she hates her sister and friends for this...
I told her fucking other woman was not something I needed, because the moment i met her and started loving her, she was the only woman i needed, i didnt need to meet or sleep with someone to know the best thing of my life was waiting at home. 
The sister was telling her stuff in the background but I couldnt hear, i dont know what the sister was telling her or if she was getting angry at her or something.

She kept begging me and begging me, and i just told her, if she comes clean to her parents and family i will think about it. After that she started saying something but I just hung up.

For like half an hour my phone goes silent without much response, and her father calls me up and apologizes for everything, he and his wife know what happened now, and he is so sorry for all of this. He told me he understands how i feel and that he didnt raise his daughter to do this, he said he understand if i dont want to see her again but that I always will be welcome to him and that I am a good guy. His wife basically then takes/steals the phone from him and tells me she did a mistake and she regrets it and it will never happen again and that we can move forward from this. She tells me her daughter has never been this destroyed before. I politely tell her I appreciate her opinion and then say i have to go and goodbye.

My ex-fiance calls me back and beggs me again saying she told her parents and also sent a text message to her friends (our mutual friends) about what had happened. She then keeps crying asking me when i will come back to speak with her, and say we can even go to counselling and that she will pay for everything.
She kept apologizing and apoliogizing on the phone and I didnt say much.

After some time I just told her not to cry, that she shouldnt be apologizing because single women (like herself) are allowed to do these things and i hope she finds mr right. She starts crying even harder and her sister takes the phone and say sorry and tells me everything can be fixed and that I said I would take her back now that she told everyone what she did. I told the sister I only said I think about it, and now that I have I realised i dodged a bullet and wish her and her sister the best. She then tells me her sister is turning suicidal from all of this and that this is going to lead into a depression that can take her life. 
The only thing I said after she told me that was "its a good thing you are close to her so you can make sure she doesnt kill herself then, maybe take her to a doctor or soemthing". After this I just hung up.

My phone has been blowing up with messages from mutual friends, her and her sister saying sorry and basically begging me to come back. I dont plan on responding. I honestly feel ALOT better right now, like I can move on. I will be going for vacation this upcoming week i think. If someting more happens I will update this post.

Maybe I will update in a month or couple of weeks, i dont know.
Once again big thanks to all of you who supported me here on reddit and gave me so much support.

I dont know when I feel okay to start dating/meeting women again but we will see. Once again thanks to you all and sorry for alot of wrong writings, I am not a native english so hope you can read without issues.

Thanks!

EDIT 1: Thank you to whoever gave me reddit gold I appreciate the support ALOT. I however will not be using this account for anything else except this post or maybe a couple of updates in the future, is it possible to refund it to whoever gave it to me somehow?

I would also like to add my best friend (co-owner of my company) hired someone to take care of the company for us, and also booked a month long vacation for the both of us. I am lucky to have such a good person in my life, and i hope you all are able to find a friend like this (i would do the same for him). Hes been a friend since we were kids and if i lost all other people i know he would be there for me, so big thanks to him!

Also I dont know what more to update at this point, alot of things have happened so if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will reply as they popup in the comments (i didnt know what other things you were wondering about me or the situation). Aslong as it doesnt give away my full identity I dont mind answering them.

I also think about making an update post in a while, when would you want it (i have had many questions about making future updates). In a month? when i am back from vacation?

Once again thanks for all the support

EDIT 2: My friend went over to get the ring from her but she refused to give it to him and told me she would not give it to anyone and that I have to pick it up by myself. I dont know why she is still acting like this. I am thinking of just letting the ring go and be able to have a clear mind.

QUESTION: [Update] From the loser whose girlfriend's rich parents treated me like shit on Christmas

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9pkm2/i_29m_just_spent_another_awkward_holiday_with_my/)

tl;dr for my original question:  My girlfriend's ~~rich~~ asshole parents think I'm a loser. Even though we're an otherwise great couple, I'm thinking about breaking up because I don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and I can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.

I posted a few days ago on a throwaway account thinking it probably wouldn't go anywhere but hoping a few more experienced internet strangers might give me some insight. It got some attention and there was some solid advice (thanks u/iamseriouslyaperson!) and a lot of perspective on the whole situation and I was like, "okay, that was enlightening," and went on with my day. Gf was working that night so there wasn't much to do with all that info at the time, and I fell asleep while attempting to formulate my side of the Big Talk.

Little did I know that post blew up overnight and made the front page and gf saw it. I didn't give any names/locations, but there was enough specific information that she had no trouble figuring out it was me. So Thursday, while at work and still unaware of all this, I got a dreaded "WE NEED TO TALK" text. Yep, all caps. And I was like "welp, I'm dead."

She was feeling hurt and angry when she sent that text but she said she had time to read through some of the comments and think about things and she wasn't as upset when she came to my apartment later (she brought food). Still, she said I had no right to tell the whole internet about our relationship problems, and I agreed/apologized. She knows I'm writing this update and she's going to read it before I post, the reason for that being she admitted the internet actually made some good points regarding our relationship problems.

We talked for a long time Thursday night. She said she knows her parents treat people like shit and that they control her and her siblings with money. It's partially a cultural thing, according to her. Gf was born and raised in the U.S. but her parents grew up rich in a different country and moved here a long time ago. She said they had a hard time assimilating with upper-class Americans and flaunt their wealth because they're socially insecure. Gf also implied that kind behavior was a lot more acceptable in their home country in the 1980s and they never changed. She grew up seeing them act that way and, at least when she was younger, thought it was normal.

On top of that, gf's mom was/is emotionally and physically abusive. She said her mom used to slap her for "talking back" and once cut up all of gf's clothes and bedding after an argument over her going out with some high school friends. Gf said she's still afraid of her mom and has a hard time standing up to her. She also got very little affection from her parents growing up. It seems like that was all replaced with material things. So, to her, being cut off from her family financially is the same as being cut off emotionally.

All that being said, gf doesn't expect me to visit her parents again. She was very apologetic about how they treated me and also about not calling them out. She was really hurt that I said I thought I was "wasting my time" in the earlier post and I said I was sorry, and I am. I was still raging a little when I wrote that. I asked her about maybe letting her parents cut her off financially and living on her own. It wouldn't mean she has to go no contact but their relationship would be based on something other than money.

We've been talking about moving in together for a while now and she actually suggested she move out of her townhouse (that her family pays for) and into my apartment. I'm totally fine this. We've been together for almost 3 years and I think we would have moved in together a while ago if her parents weren't so against it. She's really nervous about being on her own financially but she's willing to try it. We spent hours yesterday going through her finances and coming up with a budget. It's going to be a big change in how she lives and thinks about things. I'm managing my expectations as far as spending is concerned. No one can change their habits overnight.

We're not combining our finances or putting her name on the lease. The plan for now is to split the cost of rent and utilities and she asked me to put her on an allowance for spending her own money. She also gave me the credit cards her parents pay for and told me to hide them. It's weird to me to have this much control over another person's finances. We're going to give it until my lease is up in March (my apartment is a little small for both of us and all our stuff) and then, assuming all this works out, we'll look for a place to officially live together. She isn't going to tell her parents right away but she promised she will before March.

tl:dr: Thanks, Reddit, for telling me to grow some balls and talk to my gf about her family situation. I did and I think things are going to get better.

EDIT

To everyone who's wondering, her parents are from Mexico.

Gf has a job and her own income. She is the co-owner of a business and makes a decent living on her own, just not nearly enough to fund the kind of lifestyle she's used to.

Also, before you say "she shouldn't have been mad that he posted about their relationship on Reddit," please for one second put yourself in that situation. You're casually browsing the front page and find a post about your personal life that was obviously written by your boyfriend and makes you sound like a complete piece of shit. In that same post, your boyfriend says he's thinking about breaking up with you. That's now just out there for the whole world to read. You can't say that wouldn't be alarming. She said "it felt like a slap in the face," which made me feel pretty shitty for posting it at all. All things considered, I think she was pretty reasonable about it. Ultimately, she was cool about me posting the update, and actually wanted to make sure I thanked Reddit for the perspective. No, she is not "demanding" to "approve" this update. She's just involved now, as she should be since she's half of this relationship.

ANSWER: Dude that's wonderful to hear. This is a really good eye opener for her. She should bring everything she can of hers little by little to a safe location so her parents cant just decide that all her stuff actually belongs to them somehow.

QUESTION: UPDATE My girlfriend's friends gave me a bath when I was drunk. I'm disgusted and embarrassed.

So about a week ago I posted my original which got deleted so I put it down there. And then there's an update for those who were wondering.

ORIGINAL

So I (20M) went out partying with a few buddies and we all came back wasted. I live with my girlfriend and I came home extremely drunk. My friends put me to bed and left. My girlfriend (19F) had two or three friends over.

I ended up throwing up on myself and my girlfriend came to check up on me and saw some puke on me. So she and her friends lugged me to the bathroom, took all my clothes off, and gave me a bath. Like a scrubbing everything with a sponge bath, butt naked. I was semi-conscious at the time and half-aware of what was happening but barely able to move. I mumbled “Stop” and “No” a few times but I don’t think they really heard. Even drunk me was humiliated to be naked in front of all my girlfriend’s face.

So they washed me then put me to bed with a blanket over me, without putting clothes on me. I woke up hungover the next day and could see I was naked under the covers. I immediately put clothes on and my girlfriend and her friends had slept over (they were doing a movie night thing) and they were already up. They all started giggling and I felt super self-conscious. One of them complimented me and said I was handsome.

I told them I was totally not okay with what they did. Their expressions immediately changed and they all started yelling they just helped me and I had no leg to stand on. I reiterated they were not allowed to wash me without my consent especially if I was able to talk and I was going to be talking to someone about it. They freaked out but I pushed past them and left. I haven’t gone back yet but I’ve been getting tons of texts begging me not to do anything. They keep saying when you’re drunk friends are supposed to help you out and clean you up. So now I’m asking: should I? Should I do something about this? What do I do? Am I wrong to feel exposed?

EDIT: To answer common questions:

1. I was not flailing or thrashing or continuing to puke, I was totally immobile. Everything was foggy and I told them no, but I wasn’t really moving.
2. I do not regularly get this drunk and thanks to all the people for saying it’s my fault. I’m in college, some days we go out and go a little overboard. We’ve all had those days where we threw up, it happens.
3. My girlfriend could have easily bathed me herself. There’s people arguing that switching the genders isn’t the same because one guy could bathe a drunk girl. So could she, I wasn’t fighting or anything. I’ve bathed her once or twice and I make her girlfriends leave too because I respect her privacy.
4. It is NOT the same as doctors doing it, doctors are trained medical professionals and my girlfriend's friends are not my loved ones, we’re not friends they’re her friends. We barely talk.
5. I have my own room, I puked in my room we don’t share it.
6. I am 5'11 and 138 lbs, for those wondering. My girlfriend is 5'7 and 124.

UPDATE

Hi again everyone, I'm the "little crybaby bitch" who's girlfriend and her friends gave me a group bath. Sound weird yet?  To clarify, I was fine with them helping me go to the tub, but my GF knew I was uncomfortable with her friends being there and trust me she did not need their help. I've cleaned her up before and she's cleaned me up once before and she did it on her own. These are HER friends, not mine, we don't have a relationship. They touched me all over while I was vulnerable and without clothes. That's disgusting and they 100% knew what they were doing wrong.

We've all gotten drunk before, we're in college, it happens. Not often, but every now and then and we help each other out. But my GIRLFRIEND had permission to help me out, not her friends. Just like how she gives ME permission to help her out, not her friends. They all stayed there. They knew they should have left. I told them to stop.

Anyway, the point isn't that, it's the update. I was staying at my friend's house and he was on my side, thankfully. My GF stopped by to talk when he was out and showed up at the door. When I saw her through the peephole the first thing I did was start a video on my phone in my pocket. She started explaining to me they were helping me out and I needed their help. I cut her off and asked her how she'd feel if my friends and I bathed her. She got quiet and said it wasn't the same thing, girls are more vulnerable than boys and it was her and her friends' natural "maternal" instinct to take care of me. I asked her real talk why didn't she tell her friends to leave? She didn't say anything for a while and then after some grilling she finally replied she did but they asked to stay because they "didn't think she could handle it herself". I asked why she didn't say no because she knew she could (she's done it once before), and she said they wanted to stay so she let them. They said "just in case" and insisted, so what's the harm. I asked why, and she shrugged. She started crying.

I asked her why they didn't leave me in my boxers. She said they were dirty. I said no, she could have easily poured water with the handheld showerhead and they would have cleaned. I puked on my shirt. I asked her again but she stayed firm on them being dirty and she definitely had to remove them. She sort of shut off then but I told her I wouldn't be able to forgive her if she didn't tell me exactly what happened and why. I hugged her and said I had to know or else we were done.  She was hesitant but I swore up and down I wouldn't take it to the police, I just wanted to know. She finally agreed and I asked if they heard me tell them to stop and she said she had heard me say something and shake my head but she didn't know what I said.

I went back to our place after the conversation and after she went to sleep I took out her phone. Yes, okay, I'm a snoop, I'm wrong, but I had to know. We know each other's passwords so I opened it and went to her texts. I texted them from her, asking if they knew what I had mumbled. One claimed not to have heard anything, the other two admitted they'd heard me mumble "Stop" but I was "drunk and needed their help." I screenshotted the texts (there were some texts directly after the event where one commented "well, that was fun". Maybe sarcastic, maybe not, nevertheless I don't like it).

I left afterward, back to my friend's place and texted my GF I wasn't quite ready to continue our relationship but we'd see how it went.

The reason I'm posting this is because I want some advice. I have evidence of what they did, screenshots of texts and a voice recording. The question I'm asking now is should I take it to the RA or the sexual assault department. I know now they chose to stay in there after my GF asked them to leave and my GF let them stay in there. I know they physically bathed me when I was immobile and didn't need more than one person. But is this reason enough to go to authorities? I haven't told our mutuals about the incident because that may lead to ostracization and I don't know where I want to go with this. I'm not ready to let it go, but should I report it? Our college has a firm policy on things like this, it's not a little thing. They investigate all claims, whatever they are, carefully.

Better ask judgment-free internet strangers than actual people in my life. Let me have it, guys.

ANSWER: [F25]Honestly if you feel uncomfortable report it and seek help... if was you and your friends washed her everyone would be in outrage. Everyone seems to think if it happens to a guy they should be happy or in your case proud you got washed by your girl and her friends. I mean in different circumstance that could of been a good time but not immobile and in the condition you were. I hope you end up finding closure. sending you good vibes

QUESTION: My (24F) husband (38M) keeps sexualising my childhood trauma even tho I’ve asked him not to. I’ve tried everything. Nothing is working. Thinking of divorce.

NSFW

Please don’t waste your time on the age gap. It’s something I’ve dealt with for our whole relationship and I don’t want to get lectured about it.

I’ve been with my husband for 6 years, married for 2. I know he’s older but he looks very youthful for his age and he’s super fit and active so honestly the age was never an issue, ever.

Between the ages of 10 and 15 I was sexually abused by my step dad and when I first started getting serious with my now husband, I told
Him everything. All the details, all the ways it screwed me up and all the horrible after math and fall out from various family members. In short, it was all bad, in every which way you can imagine.

Within the last 4 months, every time my husband and I make love, it starts out normal but at some point he always starts asking questions about the times I was abused. He gets real graphic and bc were in the moment, I always answer his questions.

I’m not a prude by any means and I even have my own kinks which he always enjoys. But lately it seems his only kink is hearing me talk about the most traumatic time in my life. The questions he asks are so gross and so personal and he’s never asked these before. The concerning part is he seems to get excited about the details as I answer his question bc he always finishes super fast once he starts asking these questions.

I’ve sat him down SEVERAL TIMES and told him how it makes me feel less than, how it hurts me, how it makes me feel like trash. How it brings me back to a horrible time. And I’ve told him to stop. He always apologizes about it and says he won’t do it anymore. But then we start making love and whether it’s 10 minutes, 20 minutes or one of our longer sessions, he always ends up bringing it up near the end of our session a few minutes before he finishes.

I write this in my bed alone as I’ve asked him to sleep on the couch tonight bc he just did it again after I repeatedly tell him not to.

I don’t know what my next move is. I’m tempted to leave but I don’t work and would have to take him to court to get some type of support so I can live and I know that stuff takes time. I still love him and he’s a great husband in every other sense but this whole thing is turning me off and slowly but surely making me fall out of love with him. If he really loved me why would he continually hurt me like this? Also, is it possible he is perverted like, liking that stuff? How is this new I’ve known him for years and he’s never mentioned this as being a turn on. Any advice would be appreciated, I have no family and friends here as I’m new to the city we live in and my family lives in a different country.

Thank you.

EDIT: I was not expecting to get so many messages. Literally thousands. Thank you to everyone who is sending support. It’s impossible to message all of you so I just want you to know I’ve read hundreds of your comments and the support made me cry. Thank you x a million. I will post an update soon. My husband is currently staying in a hotel so I have some time to think
About my options.

ANSWER: ah, shiiiit, this isn't good.

okay OP, I'm coming at you from a survivor's perspective here, looking at the facts:

1) you were abused as a kid
2) you hooked up with someone the moment you were legally an adult
3) this someone is kind until you're uncomfortable
4) this someone is demanding you get into your trauma
5) this someone has not suggested any kind of therapy or counselling in order to help you adjust to that you didn't get a healthy childhood
6) this someone is -getting off- on it
7) your reasonable boundaries are being repeatedly ignored
8) you've just been moved to a different city with no friends
9) your family is in a different country

...you've been groomed. and if you're not being sexually or emotionally abused already - and remember there are many kinds of abuse, not just sexual assault, not just domestic violence - the chances are extremely high here that they're going to, and that they're going to get worse. It's called escalation and it is a classic abuse strategy.

There's a trope in here that people will always tell you to break up, get couples therapy, etc. Honestly, OP, reading this I am scared for you, because I could have written this 10-15 years ago with the same mindset. The age gap doesn't matter. He's nice except for this. And this. And if I don't do what he wants. I was maneuvered into being alone, and then when I didn't have anyone else, it escalated, and my abuse was used against me like this.

Doesn't matter where. Doesn't matter leaving this city. Or this country. It does matter to do it as soon as possible.

Run.

Run.

Run.

eta: thank you so much for the awards, and the kindness towards OP - please give any funds towards domestic abuse services in your area. Stay safe! Stay strong!

QUESTION: UPDATE: My girlfriend [21F] of 18 months asked my [22M] preference about her pubic hair and now finds me "revolting"

Original post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hf2uy8/my_girlfriend_21f_of_18_months_asked_my_22m/

So an update to my previous post.

She ignored my messages/calls for 3 days, at which point she text me asking if i was free for her to come over for a "movie night". i told her sure, but we need to talk about what happened before anything else. She replied with "about what?".

i figured it was best to wait until i actually saw her in person before trying to discuss the issue, which i did. when she arrived, we sat down and i started by saying that i was upset by our last conversation and I'd like to discuss what happened, at which point she said "it doesn't need to be discussed, can we leave it". i said "Not really no, I'd like to get to the bottom of what actually happened and also discuss your reaction of storming out and not talking to me for 3 days and then acting like nothing has happened."

she basically refused to discuss it, so i told her that if we can't at least discuss what happened then i want to break up and that she needed to get her stuff that she has in my apartment and leave.

she lost her shit. bawling and screaming so much that my neighbour came and knocked on the door to check if everything was okay. He's a chill dude so asked if he could stay whilst she got her stuff together as she seemed to calm down once he was present.

she basically sulked around slamming cupboards whilst she got her stuff and then left.

so yeah, no real answers and im still confused as fuck as to what happened. i text her mom to keep an eye on her as im kinda thinking she's losing it. ive never seen her like this and it worries me. she's been blowing up my phone about how she loves me and cant imagine life without me but honestly this whole thing has soured me and I'm struggling to see any way that we will continue this relationship.

thanks to everyone who replied before.

TL;DR: My girlfriend baited me into a question about pubic hair, implied I was a pedo, ignored me for 3 days and then tried to act like nothing had happened and so I broke up with her. Fun.

ANSWER: Read the original and hoped for an update. I bet she asked around and all her friends told her she was bat-shit crazy. She was embarrassed, so refused to talk about it. Either way, good on you for drawing a line in the sand. It needed to be discussed before you moved on. Crazy that even after your ultimatum she wouldn’t talk about it.

Edit: My comment really blew up and I don’t have time to reply/discuss with everyone. For those saying the GF might have overreacted due to some undisclosed trauma. That’s a possibility, but to me it seems more likely she was just fixated on the correlation between pedos and the preference of hairlessness and massively overreacted. Even if her actions were fueled by trauma, that doesn’t excuse her bad behavior; being accusatory, ghosting for 3 days, gaslighting/pretending nothing happened and having a tantrum when confronted. In my opinion, even if she now disclosed her reaction was due to some traumatic experience, it would change nothing. Assuming something traumatic even occurred, any understanding/compassion the GF was entitled to as OP’s partner went out the window when she chose to be a 🐝. For those saying OP was wrong to give his GF an ultimatum. Ultimatums are usually bad, but in some instances (and I agree with OP in this case) can be necessary/prudent. What the GF did had to be addressed. It was a watershed moment in their relationship. OP’s GF chose wrong and OP did what he thought was best. Kudos to OP for sticking to his guns.

QUESTION: My [25m] girlfriend [23f] went to the protests and now wants to see my diabetic [55m] [52f] parents, I said no and she and now her family thinks I am punishing her and trying to control her beliefs.

My girlfriend and I have been dating since June of 2018. We are pretty close and her family is on good terms with mine. We do have our fights like every other couple, I find my girlfriend to be pretty ‘reactive’ and it has been a problem before in our relationship but we can generally sort things out.

Also, I want to add too, that I don’t live with my parents I normally have my own space but I moved in because of the lockdown and I didn’t want my parents out shopping. My parents are in decent shape, but we have a family history of diabetes my dad has Diabetes (Type 1) and my mom is prediabetic.

My girlfriend has been understanding in fact she took this lockdown super seriously and was frustrated that people weren’t taking it seriously enough.

She started to go to the protests in our city, she asked me to go, I told her no that it would be irresponsible since I am with my parents. She was upset but understood.

We were going to have a pizza night at my house, and my mom invited my girlfriend’s family not knowing that my girlfriend was out at the protests. Once I heard, I told my mom’s and told my girlfriend, that until she self quarantines for two weeks I don’t feel comfortable with her and her family at my house.

My girlfriend was livid, and not only that her parents who are also hot heads just start getting angry. They start talking about how proud they are of their daughter for standing up to injustice, now I am punishing them by kicking them out of their house. That my mom didn’t care, that only I did, that I am driving a wedge between them. That I am trying to control their daughter’s beliefs. And her mom really just started yelling at me. Is this the type of son in law I am going to be?

This thing has been ridiculous, my mom didn’t know when she invited them. I didn’t say they couldn’t ever come, but please wait you might be infected. My girlfriend’s family is acting as if because she wore a mask she is 100% immune. I don’t know normally when I have disagreements with my girlfriend, it is just me and her. But here it seems that both she and her mom mainly (dad is somewhat cool) are just hyping each other up. I think her dad is the most understanding but he is the quietest one in the family.

I don’t know what to do here? I know for a fact I am not going to risk my parent’s wellbeing to appease my girlfriend and her family. But what can I do to get my girlfriend’s parents to understand? Like they should know better? Her mom is a Physician’s Assistant so how is she just turning a blind eye to this? Do I just try to let things cool off?

Tl;Dr- my mom invited my girlfriend to our house for pizza night not knowing that my girlfriend has been out at the protests. After I found out, I immediately canceled it. My girlfriend and her family have taken this as a huge personal offense.

ANSWER: This is just like the early days of the pandemic in the US: You'll only know if you overreacted afterwards. If you underreact, by the time you find out it will be too late.

If quarantines are fine for other people, but not for her, you likely can't get her to change her mind. You know what's important to you, and you are protecting it.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My (28f) dog attacked my stalker after he broke into my house. Now my SIL (32f) says my dog is "too dangerous" to be around my niece (4f). Feel like I'm going crazy.

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/hpf5l4/my\_28f\_dog\_attacked\_my\_stalker\_after\_he\_broke/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hpf5l4/my_28f_dog_attacked_my_stalker_after_he_broke/)

I definitely didn’t expect my last post to blow up the way it did. Thank you so much to everyone who commented. I appreciated that I got advice from all over the spectrum, from people who completely agreed with me to people who completely agreed with my SIL, and people who thought both of us had a point. It helped me see that the problem is more complicated than I thought, which helped me understand that my SIL wasn’t just being a dick. It also helped me decide what things were and weren’t fair to be angry about.

I also appreciated seeing a few people comment making fun of me for needing my dog with me, and the majority of people yelling at them and saying I was acting pretty reasonably for someone who endured a violent attack. I don’t want to be seen as someone delicate, and I’m glad that most people don’t see me that way. Reading everyone's comments, I had this moment where I was like, "Yeah! They're right! I did almost get drug out of my house and murdered just a few weeks ago. Who the hell are these people to say how I should act???" That felt really good and I really really appreciated it.

Anyway, the conclusion I came to in all of this is that while my SIL is well within her rights to protect her daughter, she went about it in a way that disrespected me, both as a friend and as a victim of a very recent violent attack. Both my parents and her parents live locally and babysit all the time; she and my brother could’ve easily dropped my niece off with them and came to visit. It probably would’ve been awhile before I even noticed my niece wasn’t coming around, at which point I would’ve been in a better place and more understanding that she was uncomfortable with her daughter around Thor. Regardless of what some people said about how my SIL and brother don’t owe me anything and all their allegiance goes to their daughter, I simply do not feel that way. We were extremely close before this happened; I was always there for them, and would literally drop plans to babysit my niece if my brother and SIL needed a night to themselves. The very least they could’ve done for me, after I was almost kidnapped and murdered, is try to find some compromise. We went from seeing each other 3 times a week to pretty much not seeing each other at all. Even if they weren’t okay with me crating the dog, they could’ve easily dropped their daughter off with Grandma and Grandpa for a few hours so I wouldn’t feel completely isolated. I also have a yard, so they could’ve come over with her and we all could’ve hung out outside, while Thor stayed inside. I’ve been upset about this for awhile, but wasn’t sure if I was right to be upset until so many people echoed that sentiment. So I appreciate it.

I invited my brother and SIL over (I promised it would only be an hour or two and insisted they leave my niece with my parents), and tried to lay all this out without being confrontational or acting like a dick. To my surprise, my brother and SIL had no real understanding that I’ve been having a difficult time. They thought I was basically fine and everything in my life was more or less back to normal now that my stalker is in jail. I didn’t get into it in my previous post, but during the year that I was stalked, I worked really hard to not show many outward signs of fear. I even made jokes about having a stalker. I knew people wouldn’t want to hang out with someone who was constantly going on and on about some bad thing that was going on in their life, and I didn’t want to be “that person” who was perpetually in crisis. And more than that, I just didn’t want to always be thinking and talking about having a stalker. I wanted to not think about it as much as possible. So I guess I might’ve come off as unaffected by the whole thing.

I’m not sure if I totally buy that they didn’t know I was going through something traumatic and that it was taking a huge toll on my mental state. I mean, I got a gun and paid for tactical training. I bought a home security system. I got active in self defense classes and strength training, things that I previously had no interest in. Even if I wasn’t walking around telling everyone how scared I was, I think anyone would’ve been able to tell. Plus, who just brushes off having their house broken into in the middle of the night? It seems crazy and they don’t seem so emotionally unintelligent that they’d think that. But both my brother and SIL did apologize for being insensitive, and when I pressed my SIL on why crating the dog isn’t good enough, she eventually relented and said that it would be fine. It probably helped that the entire time they were over, Thor was asleep and loudly snoring in his crate.

The paranoid part of me is convinced they just don’t want to deal with me in a fragile state, made up an excuse about my dog, and are now just going to come up with some other excuse about why they can’t see me. I invited them over for dinner in a few days and they’re coming, so I guess I’ll just have to see from there. I can’t stress enough that these used to be my best friends, and I’m heartbroken to have not had their support. I’ve been trying to rely on my friends more now, and thankfully they've all been really supportive. I’m really lucky that this happened during the pandemic, because nobody is getting frustrated with me that I’ve basically refused to leave the house for a month—they’re all perfectly happy to pick up takeout and come over to watch TV for the 5th night in a row.

In other news, yesterday I left my dog at home and drove around my block alone. I was shaking the whole time but I did it! I keep trying to remind myself that I spent a whole year fighting back even though I was utterly terrified; I can’t just lay down and die now that I’m so close to getting my life back.

tl;dr Things are better with my SIL and brother but I don’t know if they’ll stay that way. I’m relying on friends for support instead. I’m disappointed but also doing better.

ANSWER: This also NOT some normal daily life. This is some seriously traumatic stuff that happened. This will take time for you to  deal with. Take the time and keep giving yourself,  your dog and your family the attention you all need.

Best of luck ..... and Thor is and awesome doggo....GOOD BOY!

QUESTION: FINAL UPDATE : I (26M) found out my fiance (27F) possibly gave a stripper a handjob at her bachelorette party

\\3rd and most likely last update. Original update here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/e35vj6/i\_26m\_found\_out\_my\_fiance\_27f\_possibly\_gave\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e35vj6/i_26m_found_out_my_fiance_27f_possibly_gave_a/)

I deleted the original post, but put a recap in the original update.

It's been 10 days since I received the call that ended this relationship. I'm almost back to normal, although I can't quite shake a bit of malaise. Thankfully I had a few days worth of PTO to burn while I worked past this crap. I already scheduled my 2 weeks vacation this year for the wedding, but since it's canceled I'll just spend it with the family and have a very extended Christmas with them.

Outside of a few texts from Jane to my mother when things first blew up and her mother calling the next day after I talked to Janes stepfather, I haven't heard a peep from their clan since. Janes mom tried to act as a mediator between us, but I shut that shit down and told her it's not possible. She can be a bit pushy, but thankfully she realized it wasn't wise to push this time. I finally got to talk to the bridesmaid who's husband called me. She didn't offer any more details and I didn't care to ask for any more by the time I talked to her. She just called me when she felt comfortable enough to wish me well and tell me she was sorry for what happened. She's a very nice lady and I feel bad for her because she works with quite a few of those women, and I don't envy how they are going to treat her at work. I asked her and thankfully none of them have any managerial authority over her, but it still sucks to ostracized.

As far as any of the other women, I haven't heard a thing, and my cousin has done a vanishing act. My mom took care of cancelling all the wedding invitations as she was the one who helped send them all out. I asked her to just tell everyone that Jane and I had a change of heart about getting married and decided to put things off for the time being. Frankly I'm fucking embarrassed about what happened and don't really want to be known among family and friends and people in town as that guy who's ex-fiance jacked off and possibly screwed a stripper right before their wedding. I'm sure it will eventually get around, but if I let it fade like this it will be more of a crazy rumor than confirmed fact for most people.  I really just want to walk away with as little drama as possible and move on with  my life.

I've asked my mother to text Janes mom to get the engagement ring back. Hopefully she won't give me any trouble as they were expensive and buddy of mine is willing to buy the ring set for exactly what I paid for them for his wedding in a few months. I told him he'd better not tell his girlfriend where he got them just in case she's worried my ex was wearing the ring when she was handling stripper guys joystick. I lost thousands in deposits for the venue, DJ, florist, catering, security, plane tickets, honeymoon suite, etc etc etc... I'm hoping I can recoup a little money by selling the rings.

Anyway, I've decided to stay away from LTR's for an indefinite amount of time. This experience has made me very gun shy about "love" and relationships and all that mess. People have sent me all kinds of of encouraging messages claiming I'll eventually find "the one". I'm doing my best not to be overly pessimistic, but when looking at the divorce rates and all the crazy conflicts between men and women these days, I'm starting to think the chances for anyone to do that are getting lower with each passing year. And I'm not the kind of guy who gets over stuff like this by running out and dating some other woman to sport hump right afterwards.

So I think I'll just stay single for now, and focus on my passions and work. Anyway, thanks to everyone who gave encouragement. If anyone else goes through something heartbreaking like this, I highly recommend you you stay with family and or close friends you have a good relationship with. I can't overstate how much this helped, especially if you are a guy. Men don't really maintain a circle of support for stuff like this, like many women do, and you can find yourself isolated and descending further into a bad place without positive reinforcement around you. I was able to lay on my childhood bed, in my childhood room, in my childhood home surrounded by good memories, having my mom come in and bring me tea and food and say sweet encouraging things about how much she loved me and how proud she was of me. I was able to shit talk with my dad and brothers to distract myself. It helped a lot.

Best of luck everyone. Thanks.

ANSWER: In the long run you did the right thing. You’re not alone either, if you ever get bored search “male stripper AMA” or  “male stripper, bachelorette party” in these relationship subs, there are other stories similar to to yours. Mixing strippers and weddings is the worst idea, I don’t know why it’s even a thing.

QUESTION: My girlfriend (24F) has a choice between me (25M) or her family and I don't know how to tell her

This is a throwaway, as you can tell from the username.

Hello everyone, hope you guys are staying safe from coronavirus.

I met my girlfriend when I was in my senior year in college, she was a junior back then. We have been dating for 3 years now. I'm Asian and she's white. To say I don't deserve her would be an understatement. She's the most beautiful and the smartest girl I know and she comes from a pretty wealthy family. I'm not particularly handsome or attractive, not extremely smart (just because we both went to an Ivy League college doesn't mean shit, it just means I have slightly above average IQ but I decided to work harder than most other high schoolers), and our family is not very rich either. We aren't poor, my parents were able to help me pay for college and I only had to take a few thousand in student loans, but we are certainly not as wealthy as her family. I really love her and I try to be the best boyfriend I can be.

Unfortunately, her entire family is racist except for her and her brother (who is one of my best friends). Every time we go to one of her family gatherings, there are racist comments tossed around. It's against everyone who isn't white, including Asians but also African Americans, Mexicans, etc. I am the only one there who is not white. I don't know if they are trying to insult me intentionally with comments like "Oh those yellow (n-word)s stealing our jobs" but it not only annoys me on a personal level but also just like in general, they're being such racist assholes. But I try to be as nice as possible because I don't want to let this ruin our relationship. But her family members still all dislike me.

So yesterday her dad texted me. I knew that my girlfriend's parents know my number but it's still strange because her dad doesn't like me at all and we have never really had a 1 on 1 conversation. But anyway, he sent me a few texts saying "This relationship has gone far enough" and to sum things up he said that if I didn't break up with my girlfriend he would disown her and her entire family would cut her off. And then he said if I really loved her I would know that her family was more important to her and stuff like that. I have no idea why he decided to say this now and not like 3 years ago when we first started dating.

I haven't talked with my girlfriend yet because I don't really know how to tell her about this. I know she loves her family and I don't want to hurt her relationship with them. But I also don't want to hurt her by just breaking up with her without telling her why.

I really need some advice here my fellow Redditors, how do I tell her about this situation? Even if we do end up breaking up, I want to do what makes her happy in the long run.

TL;DR My girlfriend's family is racist and they don't like me. Her dad told me that either I would break up with her or he would disown her and her entire family would cut her off. I don't know how to tell her about this.

UPDATE

So first of all I want to apologize for not updating until today. Yesterday I checked the first \~30 or so comments and they all said show her the text. I have a job as a tech lead and we had like 4 meetings in a row yesterday. Couldn't really zone out to check Reddit. And afterwards I was pretty tired so my lazy ass decided not to update until today. I never expected it to blow up so much. Today I woke up and I saw like >2k comments and 22.9k upvotes and I was pretty blown away so sorry for not responding to anything.

I texted my girlfriend yesterday and sent her a screenshot of what her dad sent me. She said she needed some time to think and I just told her I love her and I'd respect her decision either way. So I guess all that's left to do is wait.

So now I guess I will respond to the general categories of comments/questions:

>Show her the texts.

Done.

>You're taking away from her right to decide as a grown adult woman. You're being sexist/misogynist. You need more communication and trust in a relationship.

That was kind of eye opening for me. Her dad's texts were all completely directed at me, like YOU need to make this decision. It's YOUR fault. All of the YOUs kind of stuck me into the mindset where it really was my decision only. I don't know, I guess I was just being dumb as usual. Lesson learned though, thanks.

>Why didn't she stand up for you at her family gatherings? Why did she take you in the first place?

Well I've never really thought about this stuff before but as far as I can remember they only say that shit when she's not in the room. They have a pretty big house so she sometimes goes to talk with her other relatives in other rooms, and that's when it starts. I didn't think it would be good if I just followed her like a little puppy everywhere she went so I generally tend to stay in the same room.

Also my friend almost never shows up to those gatherings for some reason. Maybe it's connected to this, maybe it's not.

I've never really brought it up to her and straight up said that their racism pisses me off a little. I don't know, maybe I should have? I just didn't want her to think I'm a huge crybaby about it. It didn't really feel targeted towards me, because they were just being racist to every race in general, and I just happen to be included in one of them.

>Delete the text and don't tell her anything.

I don't think that's a good idea... maybe they're not lying.

>Reverse Crazy Rich Asians on them.

I have heard of that movie but have never watched it. Is it any good? Never been a big movie guy, I always just play PC games. The only time I watch movies is with my girlfriend.

>This post is fake.

Listen, man. I don't have that much spare time to make up a fictional narrative and publish it on Reddit. What do I gain from making up a post like this? Karma? Awards? This is a throwaway account, not my main Reddit account. If I really wanted to Karma-farm, don't you think I would want to do it on my main? And I'm not really a huge fan of fantasy internet points anyway... I mean I don't know what else you want me to say.

For people who say they've never heard "Yellow N\gger" before, it's probably because you're not Asian. I bet you've never heard "Pancake Face" before either...

>Please update.

I didn't feel like this update warranted a new post but I will make a new post when my girlfriend makes up her mind if you guys want.

Thanks to all of you for your replies!

ANSWER: Just show her the text. If y'all have been together for 3 years, you should be able to go, "Hey babe, you need to see what your dad sent me." Then just talk it through and see what she says/thinks.

QUESTION: Update: My (38/F) ex-fiance ghosted me (39/M) before our wedding. It's been 16 years and now she wants to talk it over again. Should we reopen closed wounds?

[previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fz8bw7/my_38f_exfiance_ghosted_me_39m_before_our_wedding/)

Well, that was something. I got closure at least.

We met at a cafe and sat and talked outside. The first thing I noticed was how badly scarred her arms were and how much pain was in her face. Long story short  she  wanted to break up long before the wedding, she was too weak and cowardly to speak up for herself. She had a complete nervous breakdown over everything. She had been tired of being forced into doing things she never wanted to do and never having the guts to stand up for herself. She was mad at her family pressuring her to get married and pump out kids, she was mad at them forcing her into a degree that she didn't want, she was mad herself for not being able to speak up. Nothing she did was justified which we agreed on.

When I first proposed to her I did it in a public area. I had put her on the spot and she wanted to say no but, she couldn't bare to see me hurt. She was right. I made all the choices for her. I was a very different person back then and she was very "meek" as in she just went with the flow and had no backbone. I drowned her voice out often and often never gave her the chance to grow to be a person. Back then I was often focused only on myself.

Well, everything came to a climax and she had a complete mental breakdown. She ran way from her problems at the beheast of her best Friend and only person in the world she ever trusted. As she said it's the only thing she knows how to do: run. She never had the spine to speak up.

Her life just spiraled downwards. She did a few years homeless after her bestfriends husband kicked her to the curb. The rest of that time was spent in Prison, which she didn't specify what she did.  She was released about a year ago and has been turning her life around. She has a job, she's reconnected with her parents and she's finally reconnecting with me. She never stopped trying to get in touch with me.

As for our future. We have none. We both agreed to end things and  go our separate ways. We both are changed, two different people.  We have nothing in common and don't live near each other. She doesn't justify what she did nor does she want to be forgiven. She thinks its repulsive and is ashamed of her actions. I wanted to be angry but, i couldn't. I just forgave her. With that we shook hands said our goodbyes and that will likely be the last time we ever see one another.

It's bittersweet. I got the closure I wanted. We both did. It feels like a burden was released. I know now we never had a future together and  never will. But, on the other I'm sad because it's over. All these years maybe hoping something would happen were for naught. But, in the end this is an ending and I finally have closure. Not many get to say that.

Do I believe her story? Yes, I do and even if she's full of shit at this point does it even matter? I've always known her to be very weak willed, meek. She often just does what everyone tells her to do and often runs when things get too difficult. She avoids her problems because was too weak to stand up  to them.  I mean it makes sense why her family would not talk to me about her. They were the typical tiger parents that disowned their problem child.

---
tl;dr
Alls well that ends well.  Our relation has finally come to an end and we can move on.

ANSWER: Although a lot of time has been lost for either of them. It seems odd that no one noticed the situation of her problems earlier on. It is explained in the post but it still sounds weird.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My girlfriend tried to push me off a cliff as a "joke"

Original thread: https://reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iuv798/my_girlfriend_tried_to_push_me_off_a_cliff_as_a/

I've been thinking a lot and I decided that I'm ending my relationship with her.

This isn't easy for me. It's hard because I've been with her for almost two years, but it's even harder because now I feel a ton of guilt myself as I remembered things that I ignored, and how I was only worried about her after I became the victim. I mentioned that point in the other thread, but I feel even worse about it now.

I know I was stubborn in the last thread but I listened to everyone's advice very carefully. You all helped so much. When people brought up the sadism aspect, it sort of clicked. I don't know if it was stupidity or selfishness, but I didn't think of her that way until this week. I just ignored everything she did. I thought about some memories using this new perspective.

I remember early this year her dad got her a job at the front desk at this apartment complex. It's hard to explain this place because it was sort of a luxury place and most apartments aren't like this, but I was there once or twice to pick her up and I remember what the building looked like. There were a lot of older people living there and right near the entrance of the building there was an elevator which only went up. Then there was the main elevator which was kind of far down a long hallway. She had to call that first elevator down after the person was approved to go into the building. One time me and her were smoking and just chilling talking about stuff. She was laughing to me about how she would sometimes disable the up elevator and pretend it was out of order, and then she'd watch these older/handicapped people walk down this long hallway to get to the main elevator.

She got fired pretty quickly anyway because she activated the fire alarm when there was no fire. When they asked her what happened she pretended that the computer was glitching and she couldn't stop it, but they believed she did it on purpose so they fired her. I'm sure some people could have been injured during the chaos. I guess the alarm must have disabled the elevators so everyone had to grab their stuff and run down the stairs as quickly as possible. I can imagine all these elderly people going down so many flights of stairs. I don't think anyone was injured but they did fire her and maybe they're still investigating. I don't know if it could help, but I'm gonna call that place and tell them what she told me and how she admitted to pulling the alarm on purpose. That will help my conscience out a lot.

Like I said, I feel terrible about ignoring this stuff. You might think I'm an idiot or a terrible person myself. I don't know what to say but when I really thought about this stuff, I decided I couldn't be with her. I know people will criticize me and that's fine. This is an update but also a confession tbh because I have to get that off my chest. And there's a bunch of other stories too that she told me or that I saw myself. I enjoyed her craziness tbh even though I was always on edge but I thought of it as her being fun and spontaneous instead of sadistic. I guess I'm pretty weird myself.

I responded to her texts this morning because she was starting to get angry and was sending a lot more texts. I told her I was really sick and thought she shouldn't be near me, but that we might be able to hang out again in a week or two. I said I wasn't mad at her anymore and I just didn't respond because I was sick. I just told her that to get her off my back and to give myself time to prepare for the break up because I don't know how she's gonna react and I want to be safe. For example she has keys to my house and I'm living with other people including kids so I want to change the locks and make sure we're not tied together in any other ways before I do an official breakup. Do you think that's a smart idea? I could use any advice on the best way to do a breakup in this situation because I'm kind of worried. Once again, thanks so much for all your advice last time and have a good day.

ANSWER: I think that this girl is ACTUALLY crazy and you should do what you can to protect yourself.
She sounds like a narcissist or sociopath

QUESTION: I [26M] upset a woman [20sF] and my friends are acting like I'm in the wrong.

Hey guys.

I went out clubbing last night with my friends. There were seven of us, three guys including me and four girls. My girlfriend Hannah was meant to come too but she was feeling ill. I offered to stay in with her but she insisted I go out and have a good time.

At the club my friends got talking to a group of women who apparently work in finance. They were here for some kind of conference and were checking out the local places in their spare time.

One of them, Lauren, started trying to chat to me and ask for my number. She was pretty but I was not interested as I have a girlfriend. I told her this but she then started asking for pics of Hannah. I showed her and she said that I ''could do better than that''. I was very annoyed and told her to leave me alone.

Later me and my friends were dancing, and Lauren and her group came up to us and she started trying to dance with me. I gave her the brushoff once again and moved away from her and she gave me a dirty look. A while later she came back and by that point was very drunk. She smirked at me and threw her drink in my face. I was absolutely fuming and in response I poured my beer on her head. She started crying and ran to the bouncer who got us all kicked out.

Everyone then proceeded to have a go at me. I understand they were annoyed that we were kicked out, but everyone was acting like I was wrong to pour my drink on her. They all saw her splash her drink in my face, but everyone was saying it was nasty to do that to a girl.

The ladies in our group were talking about how upset they'd be if someone ruined their dress/hair/makeup by doing that, but when I pointed out she did the same to me everyone said that it isn't the same.

Nobody said goodbye to me last night and I made my own way home. I told Hannah what happened and she agrees that I didn't do anything wrong. I tried explaining myself again over the groupchat but everybody ignored me.

How do I sort this out in a mature way?

TL;DR: My friends are acting like I was in the wrong for pouring my drink on someone who threw hers in my face.

ANSWER: Your friends are stupid. They were only saying that to justify their anger towards you, since you were “the reason” their night of fun ended. If you want to handle this maturely, show them this reddit post so they can see what this situation looks like from a third person’s perspective. Then, maybe if they’re not complete idiots, they’ll change their stance.

QUESTION: My wife thought I used my sexual assault as an excuse to cheat. Abuser convicted guilty, my wife wants me back

This is such a long story that takes place over a series of months. I'll try to get all the details without going on for too long. So basically I (30M) got raped at a party about 8 months ago. I got drunk and an acquaintance of mine took advantage of me. I hardly remember it but I woke up the next morning naked with a vivid memory of what had happened. I remember putting up a fight, but not much else. I also have a very very vague memory of her holding a phone the entire time, but that's about it (will be important later). I immediately went home and told my wife.

She was extremely sympathetic and let me cry on her shoulder. I was a sobbing mess. At the time I did not want to press charges because I didn't know how it would go if I, a male) accused a woman of raping me.

Anyway, I ended up telling my friends because they questioned why I stopped showing up to gatherings. The girls response was basically that it was consensual and I was lying to keep my wife from getting mad at me. Half of my friends believe her and the other half are on my side. It was a mess. In the end, I decided to just distance myself from them all.

One of my supportive friends contacted me letting me know that she had gotten pregnant, but ended up aborting. This was a whirlwind of emotions for me but in the end I decided that it was for the best. My wife took this in a different way.

She says that she wasn't aware that my abuser made me finish and that I wouldn't have cum if I genuinely wasn't enjoying it. We argued for days and she kept telling me I was sick for faking a rape allegation just so I could cheat on her. We've separated but are not yet divorced. I've been staying with my brother.

Well, at this point, I decided that I needed to go to the police to clear my name. I hired a lawyer and when he heard my recount of the events that I remember, he was absolutely convinced that she had recorded the encounter. I don't know why, all I mentioned was that she was holding a phone, but I guess it makes sense.

Anyway, her phone and laptop were searched but there was nothing. It took months, but finally we were able to retrieve the video via the cloud. I guess you can't really ever fully delete something. The video clearly depicted me in a vulnerable state and incoherently trying to get her off of me. It was sick.

Anyway, with this evidence plus witness accounts courts sentenced her to 2.5 years in prison. When this happened, I guess my wife realized that I actually had gotten raped and has been pleading to get back into my life. She says she made a mistake and just assumed and she's so sorry, but I don't know if I can ever forgive her.

Should I continue with divorce or try to work things out with her?

ANSWER: Idk about taking her back or not but good for you going to court and winning....sorry you had to go through it.

QUESTION: Update: my girlfriend is acting obsessed with this random family she just met

This is an update from my last post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a22u6h/my_girlfriend_is_acting_obsessed_with_this_random/

As a quick summary: I thought something weird was going on with my girlfriend "Maggie" who became quickly and extremely close to her new co-worker "Joe" and his wife "Kate." After just a couple weeks, she was trusting Joe with everything work related, babysitting their children for free and buying them gifts, having the kids call her auntie, putting this family above her other friends, inviting the family to Maggie's family Thanksgiving, and referring to them as her chosen family. I thought that either this whole thing was some kind of cover for an affair or Maggie had attachment issues.

I figured out what was going on and I feel like a huge idiot. I went to see Maggie to ask for an explanation and figured if I didn't like what I heard I'd break up with her, because either she was cheating or had an emotional issue I couldn't handle.

I had the opportunity when I saw the gifts Maggie had gotten for Joe and Kate's kids. It seemed so strange for someone who doesn't really like kids that much to go so overboard for kids she just met.

I asked Maggie why she gave the kids such special treatment even though she doesn't really like kids that much. Maggie explained that she felt differently about these kids because she had been around to watch them grow and was close to Joe and Kate, so the kids are more like family to her, which means she treats them differently than other kids and they're the exception to the rule. Maggie said she'd probably tone it down eventually, but since they were so young she wanted to get them something really nice for Christmas.

I wasn't really sure what to say next because it seemed so irrational, but then Maggie said that she used to exchange Christmas gifts with Joe and Kate too, but that they had all decided it was too much trouble and unnecessary so these days she usually bakes them something or gets them a nice bottle of wine.

I realized I was missing something important. If Maggie had other Christmases with Joe's family, she couldn't have just met them like I thought. I had thought that Maggie might have emotional issues that made her attach herself to people she barely knew, but I didn't think Maggie was actually crazy enough to imagine that she knew them before. I didn't want to ask, so I acted normally until I left.

When I got home, I went through Maggie's Facebook. She wasn't lying and she's not crazy. I found a ton of photos with Joe and Kate going back a decade. From what I can figure out, they all went to college together, Joe and Maggie were Big Brother and Little Sister in a coed frat/sorority, and Maggie and Kate were roommates. I also found pictures of Maggie as a bridesmaid in Joe and Kate wedding and pictures of Maggie holding their newborn children so they are obviously close friends who have known each other for a long time. All of Maggie's behavior makes perfect sense now that I know all this.

I think this whole thing is my fault. I have ADHD and I don't handle it well. I've had issues when people are talking to me for awhile, where I start zoning them out. I've been called out for this before. I think it's pretty likely that Maggie did tell me about Joe and Kate and I just wasn't listening. Maggie hasn't actually done anything wrong or creepy so I think it's more likely that I wasn't listening when Maggie explained instead of this being a trick.

This was a pretty big wakeup call for me. I've been ignoring my problem because I didn't want to face facts that it was serious but I know I need to do something before I make anymore mistakes. I'm going to start off by looking for a therapist.

ANSWER: I'm glad you're getting some help. Sorry you had to go through this confusion. I must admit, this is an entertaining twist in the story.

QUESTION: My stepsister is telling my whole family my boyfriend got her pregnant to make herself feel better.

Sorry weird title. So I met my 25F boyfriend “Tim” 26M 3.5 years ago. We hit it off he was great and sweet and we get along perfectly. Until I introduced him to my family. My mother had gotten remarried a few months earlier, I like my stepdad and we get along fine, my stepsister “Sarah”  who is 26F and were friendly but not besties by any means. She is kind of an intense party girl and being in our 20s we only saw each other at family events.

So I introduced Tim to my family at which point we learn that Sarah used to date Tim when they were 20. It was only a few months and Tim said they broke up because she made out with another guy at a nightclub while drunk. Sarah got upset and started saying I had to break up with him because it was weird. She called Tim her “sloppy seconds” and tried to get our parents to force us to break up. I said no. It had been years since they’d been together and I didn’t even know Sarah when she was dating Tim.

I got pretty upset because my family jumped on the bandwagon of saying we should break up. For the past few years at any family gathering Sarah would mention how they used to date and act like I stole her boyfriend and has been selling that narrative to my family and friends. It became obvious that she was jealous. But I liked Tim so we just ignored it and kept dating.

So now a few year later Tim and I live together and we’ve been talking about marriage and stuff and I recently had a conversation with my mom about how I thought Tim was going to propose because he’s not exactly subtle and we’ve talked about this for a while. At which point Sarah who just moved back in with out parents walked in. She started asking a bunch of invasive questions about our relationship and being weird.

Sarah is four months pregnant, the father she said was some deadbeat guy she’d hooked up with who wants nothing to do with her, but she wants to keep the baby. I’d been making an effort taking her to appointments and offering to help babysit and trying to be excited for her. Until a week ago when my stepdad sent me a long text saying how I can’t marry Tim because he is the real father of Sarahs baby. I was immediately very upset and confronted Tim who was completely shocked and said Sarah was lying. He said there’s no way and he didn’t cheat on me and he would gladly have a paternity test to prove that. Unsure I asked Sarah for more details about when they slept together which she says happened a few times. She was shaky and went back and forth on details. The dates and times don’t match up with what I can remember of what Tim and I have been doing.

She also said she came to our house to see him but since Covid I’ve been working from home. So I cant imagine that they managed that. I’m pretty sure now that she’s lying to get us to break up because she’s still jealous. But now my family are involved and have been sending me hateful messages saying I need to break up with Tim and let him be with Sarah. She’s telling everyone he’s in love with her and I’m keeping him from her. She has no proof and he strictly denied everything.

I texted her asking for proof of any of this happening and she sent me some fake photoshopped screenshots- that I can tell are fake. Where she’s put Tims name over a friends number and pretended he was messaging her. I checked and the friend all but admitted it to me and tried to laugh it off. She badly photoshopped the timestamps.

I actually don’t know what to do now. I believe Tim and we are still together but this has kind of thrown a wedge in everything. Sarah has poisoned my relationship with our parents and my family. I feel sick to my stomach and Sarah is now saying she won’t give me a paternity test.

For now I’ve cut everyone off except Tim but I don’t know what to do now.

ANSWER: You can have Tim file a paternity action in court based on the accusations. Then a court order would force Sarah into admitting that she is lying.

Edit: Thanks for the awards and everything, but I should add that OP definitely needs to talk to an attorney first.

QUESTION: Update : I got pregnant at 16, my parents disowned me and tried taking custody of my daughter. After 10 years my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and both want to reconnect with me and get to know their grandchild. I need help on how to handle this.

Hey it's me. I wanted to update you on what happened.
Edit :apparently I have to make this clear. This is just an update post I have taken my decision. My parents will not meet my daughter until she is older and wants to.

After some thought I decided to first meet my parents alone. I wanted to make a decision based on their remorse and development as human beings.

And they sadly didn't really change. When I agreed to meet I also told them it would be without my kid. Idk why but they thought they were going to meet her. They had bought presents and all. They were very disappointed to say it lightly when I showed up without her. They made no deal to hide it. But we talked. They fail to take any real responsibility for their actions. Every "apology" began with "we are sorry if you". When confronted about the CPS calls they say they were doing what was best for daughter. I got really mad but tried not to snap. They brought up every mistake I did as a young mother and that they just thought I was far too young and irresponsible to have a kid. That daughter only turned up good because of luck.

After they said that I laid down money for my meal stood up and said. "well nothing has changed. You are still the heartless persons that threw me out years ago and made my life hell for 5 years. You will never meet her. She is happy and she has loving grandparents"

They started to freak out saying that I couldn't withhold their grandchild from them. I just said that you lay in the bed you make.

I left and haven't talked to them since. Mails or letters from them are thrown out on the spot. I will eventually explain to my daughter what happened to me and my parents and will give her the chance to meet them when she is older but for now I don't want to deal with their bs.

Edit :Guys thank for your concerns but I am non US. Grand-parent rights are not a thing where I come from

Edit2: I think some of you are confused. I am not asking about advice of wethee or not I should give in to my parents request. That's what my last post was about. It's not unwillingness to reflect it's a set decision.

Also yes my daughter is in therapy due to her being traumatised by all that lovely cps visit that we're caused by my parents. So I Infact k ow my child is happy and healthy mentally as well as physically

ANSWER: The dying relative gambit is an extremely popular way to try and force contact. I had an Aunt who was dying for ten years, people kept saying I had to get in touch before the end.

I didn't.

She's still alive.

&#x200B;

I am very sorry you made this brave attempt to give them another chance, and they spat on it. Your heart was more open than mine is.

These people hurt you worse than anyone else in the world could, and they don't regret a god damn thing.

Fuck 'em.

I am impressed that you were defensive enough to protect your child through all this, they clearly expected things to go down differently.

---------------Actual Update---------------

After the post I decided it would be best to end things through a phone call. I mentioned ghosting, but it's probably best he knows how and why he fucked up. I waited until Saturday to reach out to him, told him "we need to talk." I'm paraphrasing here, but this is basically what the convo went like:

Dan: This is about the dinner, isn't it?

Me: Yeah it is.

Dan: and?

Me: I don't think I've ever felt so unwelcome in a group before. It felt like a shitty interview, all they did was test my knowledge. No one tried to get to know 
me, and when actual conversation was going on I was ignored or interrupted if I tried to talk.

Dan: I don't feel it like it was anything like that.

Me: Ok, so how often do you guys sit around just asking questions like "quick - what is the sql query if you want to delete two rows from two different tables!?!"

Dan: I don't know

Me: No really, do you quiz your friends randomly like that at work or out and about?

Dan: No not really

Me: And why not? why don't you just ask lightning round quizzes like that? B/c it's not what normal people do?

Dan: I don't know. They were just having fun and joking around.

Me: It wasn't fun for me. I have male and female friends in all sorts of professions, I've never cornered any of them to test their knowledge. I trust they know 
what they're doing. I ask them about work, what they're doing, you know normal questions.

Dan: ok

Me: I'm not going to print out a CPA exam and quiz my accountant friend, don't you think that would be a little fucked up?

Dan: I don't know, maybe?

We talked a little more about that night, and I gave him more specific examples of what he and his friends did and he never really had any good answered. It was a lot of "i don't know" and single word answers. I told him I created a reddit post and I would send it to him. He was a little pissed off that I did that, felt like I had no right to so. At the end of the conversation he asked if we were done. I told him yeah, that I can't see a future with him, that I saw a different side of him that night and I don't want to be someone's prize poodle on display for the world to see. He didn't really say anything after that and just hung up the phone. I sent him the url for my first post.

He texted me throughout the weekend, but I didn't respond. He read the post that I sent him and wasn't happy with it, and said he couldn't believe so many people were on my side and were hating on him. He sent a few more angry texts after that like he couldn't believe we were breaking up over something so stupid. He did send a few rounds of "I'm sorrys" and "let's try to work through this" but when I didn't respond he just went back to angry texting me.

Also, I did find his friend who buried his head in his phone that night and sent him the reddit link and asked if that sounded like what happened. Dan's friend said he knew what his friends were doing were wrong, and felt bad for me. He apologized for not stepping in, and assumed that Dan would eventually speak up for me on my behalf. He also apologized for joining them in the beginning, and wished me luck in my career.

tl:dr: I tried explaining how that night was weird, uncomfortable and fucked up. He didn't see my point of view, didn't learn any lessons from it. I broke it off, he has been sending me angry texts, I haven't responded.

EDIT: I know my first post was gilded and some of my comments too, instead of giving money to reddit or giving me gold I can't use on this account, please donate to this organization, winter is approaching and there are a lot of kids that don't have coats. https://www.operationwarm.org/get-involved/give-3/

ANSWER: You made the right decision, 100%. After your first post, I definitely thought Dan (and his friends) was a POS, but his reaction and surprise that people are on YOUR side is just the icing on the shit cake. Best of luck to you. You are strong and deserve so much more!

QUESTION: UPDATE: Boyfriend(29M) admitted that I am the oldest girlfriend(21F) he's ever had and now I want to break up with him

I could not post an update on the original post because it got removed after reaching a cap.

It has been a difficult time to be honest, my world has been turned upside down and I have been reeling from everything that happened. I cannot link to the previous post, but basically my 29 year old boyfriend nonchalantly admitted to dating a 15 y.o(when he was 27) and a 17 y.o(when he was 28) before he got with me.

I had been staying over at his place for the week and when I woke up from what i could only describe as a depression nap he was already in his home office working. I took the opportunity to pack my things and brace myself for what I was about to do. A part of me was still very much in denial of him being a predator and so I opted to fix breakfast so that I could get him to talk about it more and find out the true extent of these relationships.

I brought up his ex whilst we were eating, and he was more than inclined to talk about her. She went to the same high school as his sister (20F), and  that is how he met her. My now ex boyfriend makes a 6-figure salary and he drives a really flashy car, which he says was the reason she approached him, "to check it out". He continued to insist that she threw herself at him, and used him for his money when they finally got together. I asked him about the girls parents, and he said he met them and that they clearly didn't like him, but "as long as their daughter was happy, they were alright with it" that particular line did me in, but he harped on about how the dad never let him near his other kids and how much convincing it took for her parents to finally be alright with her sleeping over at his place.

He says that they broke up because she found someone wealthier and she dumped him. He apparently met the The second girl(17F) he dated online. I asked for specifics and he said she lied about her age on Tinder because she was turning 18 soon anyways (she apparently specified this in her bio) and they just "clicked" but he was only looking for a rebound - so they didn't "really date" they just "fucked" (his exact words). That apparently lasted a month until she dumped him as well.

When I asked him if he prefers girls in that age range he said "for sex yes, but obviously I want a more mature woman to grow old with" and he looked at me as if that statement was supposed to somehow reassure me, or make me feel better. I couldn't act passive anymore after that and I told him I do not think I am the woman he is going to grow old with. An argument ensued and he told me i was a "horrible fuck anyways" and "How dare you accuse me of such a horrible thing, you're sick" when I told him his proclivity for young girls was not normal and it might do him some good to get help for it. I grabbed my bags and drove back to my apartment.

Hindsight truly is 20/20 because so many red flags are glaring me in the face. I am petit (5'4, 120lbs) and he always liked how small I was, he constantly commented on it (I am not saying this is wrong, people have preferences but looking at the entire series of events, this is a bit eerie). There were a few times where he told me I remind him of his ex and even though it made me feel uneasy, i just dismissed it as him having a 'type', I also didn't know at the time that she was a teenager. He has been insistent on me moving in with him and quitting my job because he makes enough money for both of us to live comfortably and he made it sound so romantic - I was genuinely considering it (I think he might have been trying to isolate me, he already didnt like most of my friends). He was also very emotionally manipulative, all the times he has ever guilt tripped me or used the things I told him in confidence against me, all came rushing into my mind. I am starting to see how far from perfect our relationship was, and I am sick to my stomach thinking about it all.

We are in Washington and I do not know how I can possibly stop him from doing this to someone else because I have no evidence and I am afraid my claims will be dismissed if i report him. I am also concerned about how this will affect the victims in this case, is it really alright for me to report something on their behalf? I would like some advice on this, the guilt will eat me up if I do nothing.

tl;dr - I dumped my boyfriend because he didn't see anything wrong with him dating teenagers, but now I do not know how to stop him from victimizing even more young girls.

ANSWER: The guy is a fucking pedo. People will argue with me that a teenager does not count, but this guy is dicked in the head. He dated and had sexual relationships with a 15 year old girl and has the stones to blame her for being a gold digger. Then used a 17 year old. And now refers to YOU, at 21, as the mature aged woman to grow old with. DUdE. I had issues with your age gap, yet he thinks you are old in his eyes... this is the guy who will always fuck 18 year olds, til he gets too old and ugly, because no woman his age would ever put up with his shit.

This is the biggest bullet you’ll ever dodge. Learn from it.

QUESTION: I’m a Korean female (24) in an interracial relationship with a white male (29) and struggling with identity issues

I’ve met my soulmate. He’s amazing, I’m crazy in love.. But the closer we get to marriage and children, the more resentful I become. I’m  sad and resentful, at no one and everyone, and I’m struggling with how to come to terms with it.

He’s white, I’m Korean. We’ve talked about race on multiple occasions. He’s even brought it up by asking what it was like to live in the US as an Asian female. He listened to my experience and asked a lot of questions. He’s the first non-minority I’ve ever dated who has made me feel heard and understood. He also has a million other wonderful traits, I love him very much and I’m so excited to have found the person I want to share my life with.

However, the more serious we get, the more frequently I experience episodes of anxiety about identity. I’m a Korean female adopted into a white family. My parents are white, my siblings are white, my extended family is white, my adorable little nieces and nephews are white, and I am almost always the only Asian person in whatever room I am in. I struggled with identity issues as a child (I learned how to use makeup to make me look ‘more white’, I stuffed my bra, hated my hips, begged my mom to let me dye my hair and buy contacts, etc…). With age and a lot of therapy I finally feel comfortable with who I am... and now I’m in a relationship with a 6ft tall ginger. He’s beautiful and I love him, but he looks nothing like me… and I fear that neither will our children. Maybe I’m wrong, but after using Google Images, I’m imaging slightly ‘exotic’ looking white children. I’m sure they’ll be absolutely adorable and I’ll love them to pieces, but they won’t look Asian.

When I thought about my life, I always imagined having children and I always imagined them being Asian. The idea of finally living in a home where there are people who look like me has brought me comfort for so long… and now I’m realizing that it may never become a reality. My partner and I do plan to adopt. We want to experience pregnancy by having one biological child and then adopt the rest. Adoption is very important to me, but we’re interested in adopting children who would otherwise grow up without a family- which means foster children and not the private adoption of Asian infants. The likelihood of us coming upon an Asian foster child who is available for adoption is quite small.

I’ve spent my whole life being ‘the other’ and now even the child who grows in my womb won’t look like me. It feels like a death in the family. It feels like I’m grieving this life that will never be and it’s bringing up a lot of pain I thought I had moved past. I don’t know how to feel.  I am incredibly sad about the idea of not having an Asian child, but at the same time I feel like his/her life would be better if he/she didn’t have to grow up as ‘the other’ in a predominantly white country.

I love my family, I have no regrets about being adopted. They’re incredible and have surrounded me with so much love and support. I love my boyfriend, and I want to spend the rest of my life with him… but I have so much anger and hurt inside of me that I’m always the friggin Asian girl. I hate being the only Asian in the room. I hate being the only Asian in my family. I hate it. I hate that I stand out in whatever group I’m in, and now I’m realizing that there will probably be a family portrait hanging above our fireplace of my white husband, our white children, and me.

I just reread this before posting, and it has a lot of anger. I just want to be clear that I have moments of anger and pain, but most of the time I’m happy and excited to start my life with him… it’s just rubbing old wounds that feel really raw. I feel stupid and petty putting it in writing, but the pain is real and I want to be able to move past it. Has anyone been in a similar experience? I would love any insight.

TLDR; Asian girl in a serious relationship with a white male and grieving that her children probably won’t look like her.

Edit: This got a lot bigger than I anticipated. I have noticed a lot of comments expressing concern that I would resent a white child or that I only want children to produce a lookalike, and I can understand those concerns- but it's not how I feel at all. I do want to add that  Relationship\_Advice is filled with posts from people who are expressing their deepest and darkest/most private fears. This is a deep, dark, and shameful fear of mine. Everyone has thoughts they are ashamed of and want to resolve. I would never get pregnant just to produce a lookalike, and I will love any child I have (biological/adopted/white/asain/blue/purple/green) with all of my heart. That doesn't change the fact that it can be really difficult to be the only person in 99% of the rooms you're in who looks like you. It's very common struggle among transracial adoptees and minorities in general. This isn't something I struggle with 24/7, it isn't one of my defining character traits, but it is a private pain I have. I was hoping to find other people who have experienced the same thing, and talking to them has been incredibly helpful. Thank you so much :) I really appreciate all of the insight and advice I've received. I'm going to get back into counseling to address these new and confusing Identity issues that have starting popping up.

ANSWER: I think one way to solve this feeling of “otherness” is to meet and hang out with other Korean people. if you were to explore your heritage more it might help you feel less alienated and more confident. A lot of first and second generation immigrants have this fear of losing themselves to white or American culture and I think talking to them might give you some answers to your problems. Also, if you become more confident in yourself and what makes being Korean special you may not be so scared about losing Korean physical features in your children especially if you have other Korean people around that you and them can see yourselves in.

QUESTION: I (26f) am an escort and I am falling in love with one of my clients (39M)

If you are going to pass judgment on my profession please dont, if you are going to tell me I am being exploited please don't I am not here for that.

&#x200B;

I took on this client about a year ago. I was immediately struck with how handsome he was. As I got to know him he showed himself to be a kind, sweet, charismatic, utterly brilliant person. He is always gentle I never had to enforce any boundaries with him. Over the last year I have come to look forward to visits with him above any of my other clients. If there's a scheduling conflict I will give him the priority, lately I have been more intimate with him then my other clients, cuddles, kissing, hugs, and other things I dont do with my other clients. I love my overnights with him. We have long deep talks about everything we have a lot of shared interests and we just get along really well. I feel very safe with him.

&#x200B;

I am falling in love with him. Its never happened to me before. I have always kept emotion separate from my work but I cant help it with him. I will spend time with him I dont bill him for, I spend extra time with him and just love to be with him. I've been spending time with him casually, going on... dates I guess for lack of better word that I'm not billing for either and the lines are starting to become very blurry.  I dont know what to do. I think I want to move the relationship from professional to personal, truth is it's already becoming personal to me, but I cant imagine he would be ok with my work if I was his gf. I am afraid of being rejected by him and ruining our work relationship, I think I would give this up to be with him but that presents a whole new set of problems for me in finding a new career.

&#x200B;

I dont know what to do. Do I go for it? Risk rejection and ruining our professional relationship? Do I give up my career for him if he says yes? I dont think I could continue this if I was with him personally. Do I just keep silent and continue our relationship as is? Or do I drop him as a client altogether? I was never looking for a guy to "save me" but I cant help what I'm feeling for him.

&#x200B;

\Edit\I know why hes single. His wife died in an accident 3 years ago.

Edit2 I cant believe how many responses this post has gotten. I am going for it. I'll tell him this week. Now to figure out how. Lots had asked if I have a back up I do.

Edit 3 I'm about to leave for lunch with him. I'm not going to bring it up yet but I do intend to ask him if he ever sees himself getting married again. Thanks for all the support. I didn't expect to see this much support.

Edit 4 Lunch was nice. We had a good time. I did ask him if he felt like he could ever be married again. he said 3 years ago the answer would be a hard no but now he wasn't so sure. Then he asked me if I ever saw myself getting married and I had a similar answer, I told him I asked him if he wanted to come to dinner at my place tonight, not work, personal. He said he's like that. I'm going for it.

Final Update

Well I truly didn't expect this post to get the reception it did. I didn't think this many people would care and become so invested in my story. I really didn't expect all the support I got. I was flooded with Comments, Pms and chat requests. Some were about what I expected. Accusations of gold digger, and "cant turn a hoe into a housewife" type comments thats really the response I expected. What I didn't expect were the thousands of comments and messages of support. You were all right in that I did know what I really wanted. I did know what my heart was telling me but seeing thousands of people tell me to go for it was the push I needed to not waste anymore time. Shoot your shot right?

&#x200B;

I'd like to address a few things before I get into the update

&#x200B;

A few people mentioned the story about his wife might be fake and he's secretly married. I was pretty sure he wasn't married I did out-calls to his home and my married clients NEVER take me to their home always a hotel. But I was regularly in his home, I saw the pictures of her around the house I know she was real.

&#x200B;

How can I trust a guy who uses escorts? Well this is a silly thing to judge him on considering what I do. I cant imagine judging a man for using my service. I was his first too and unless hes a good actor I know the awkwardness of a first timer and he was definitely awkward when we first met. I never asked him if he started seeing other escorts because frankly its none of my business.

&#x200B;

I should wait for him to approach me. Unfortunately this probably wouldn't work. As the lines became blurred I did tell him about a few clients who became overly possessive, obsessive and jealous I had to drop. I am sure he thought the same would happen to him if he tried to tell me he wanted a personal relationship. I had to be the one to make this move

&#x200B;

Do I want to do this forever/Do I really want to give it up? Different variations on this theme of leaving the biz. Some in favor some against. Bottom line is I don't think I see myself doing this into my 30's. It used to be fun and exciting but lately it hasnt been. it just feels like work now and the only meets I look forward to anymore are the ones with him. I also don't feel good about the idea of being committed to him but still seeing clients. I heard from a lot of other sex workers and clients who were able to make that arrangement work but I just cant. Even if he would be ok with it I just cant. Another add on to this is a friend of mine who has never been crazy about what I do. Shes given me a standing offer to go to work with her company on the sales team.

&#x200B;

A lot of people suggested we try going out as friends and doing things outside our "working" relationship. I imagine my comments answering this one were buried in the flood of comments so I'll put it here. We have been. For some time now. We meet for lunches, dinners, we go to the movies and make little trips to sites around where we live. We also text throughout the week.

&#x200B;

Ok on to the Update. I think I left off yesterday that we had met for lunch. This was sort of a normal thing for us lately and we had a nice chat. I posed to him the question of if he ever saw himself falling in love and marrying again. He said after his wife died he didn't think it would be possible but now he thinks he might be able to with the right person. Then he followed up with a question about if I would ever think about leaving the biz and getting married. And I sorta answered the same, with the right person, followed by a pointed stare. He had to go back to work by this point and I invited him to my home for dinner. this was a first. He has never been to my home. I dont bring clients back there only friends. I hoped that sent a strong signal to him.

&#x200B;

I went back home and started getting ready, I had to go shopping for some things and get the place ready to have a guest over. I called my friend up she knows about this guy and has been on the same page as Reddit pushing me to make a move and settle down into something more "normal" I told her about the reddit post and said I was making the jump. I also let her know I wanted to take her up on her offer. I called up my upcoming appointments and canceled. I said something had come up and I wouldn't be available. I'm out. I'm done regardless of what happened with him If I cant get my head in the game anymore and I'm getting too personal, plus now I am realizing I want to be in a relationship and I cant separate sex from my feelings like I thought, its time to call it. This isn't what I want anymore. This choice was for me not him. Even if things didn't work out with him I realized I really did want to be in a committed relationship with someone. One thing that people mentioned was the idea that he could turn violent when I told him. I honestly didn't believe he would but I asked my friend to call and check on me just in case. She knows the drill we have safe and emergency words set up and we have a plan for if she gets no response from me at all.

&#x200B;

I got my shopping done and got dinner going, set the place up nice and romantic, and got myself dolled up nice and sexy and got ready to have him over. He came by at around 7. He had flowers for me and a bottle of wine. I invited him. He said he wasn't sure if he should bring payment or not and just did. I told him that wasn't necessary he wasn't here as a client. I dont bring clients to my home. I was really hoping he was getting the hint. Dinner was going nicely we had our usual rapport but I could tell he was a little perplexed about what this was all about. So I put on my big girl panties gathered my courage, and "Shoot my shot" as you all put it. I told him I was dropping him as a client. He looked surprised and hurt, he wanted to know why? What did he do wrong? Did something happen. I assured him it want about him. I was leaving the biz and dropped all my clients. I told him about the job I took and he wished me good luck, he said I was attractive and charming and he was sure I would do well in sales. He said he was going to miss me. I took a big deep breath and said. "You dont have to miss me if you dont want to" And then I spilled it. He was the only client I brought home to tell in person. I laid it all out all the things I mentioned in the post. How I felt about him and how I didnt want to be his escort anymore. I wanted to be his girlfriend. I said I understand he paid me to leave and not stick around and now I was asking to stick around and I would understand if he didnt want to continue on. He said who told you that? That he paid me to keep coming back not to leave. He said he felt it too but he wasn't sure if it was appropriate to ask me that. He was still hurt over his wife And that he wasnt even sure if he was ready but that some of the best things in his life he started when he wasn't sure if he was ready. He asked me if I was ok with being with someone who was still hurting over his ex. I told him I could work with it and that I wasn't trying to replace her. We kissed. I led him into my bedroom and we made love.

&#x200B;

We spent some time after in each others arms talking about what comes next. He offered to help me make the transition but I told him I wanted to try and do this on my own and not rely on him. I appreciated his offer and if I needed the help I would ask but I need to do try on my own at first. He respected that. I told him that things would change now. As his GF I would have expectations of him I never had as an escort. He was ok with that. I told him I never asked or cared if he saw other women before but now I wanted monogamy I would give it and I wanted it in return so if he was seeing other escorts that would have to end and I reminded him I dropped my clients. He said that wasn't a problem. I was the only one. He spent the night with me and left this morning.

&#x200B;

Where is this going to lead us next? I have no idea. Maybe I am making a huge mistake, maybe this was fate, maybe this was God working in mysterious ways maybe we're just two lost and lonely souls tossed around by the stormy seas of life that managed to find each other and cling to each other. Fate, fairy tale or fluke we are going to see where this leads us next, and we're doing it together. I'm excited, elated and terrified all at once. My whole life has drastically changed in just a day. I didn't intend to move this fast but once this train started rolling it seemed like there was no stopping it.

&#x200B;

To everyone who said I was a worthless whore who could never be loved, fuck you too, to everyone who expressed concern thank you, maybe this is a mistake but I have to find out, To everyone who encouraged me to go for it thank you, you were right, without the thousands of responses to go for it I would have languished in that limbo for a lot longer.

&#x200B;

As a final thought I want to say that this isn't normal. If you see sex workers please dont see think this is the norm and that the women you see may also fall in love with you. While I'm sure it happens and Ive heard from others who were in similar positions to mine its really not the norm. If you're considering Sex Work because you think you can find prince charming know this outcome is very unusual. Oh and I hated Pretty Woman btw. I never thought it would be me one day.

&#x200B;

You can pm nice comments to me if you have something supportive to say. If you just want to spite bile save it.

ANSWER: Without speaking to whether you “should” give up your career, I DO think you should tel him! You’ll never know if you don’t try, and it might be worth the risk.

Please update us!

QUESTION: I (44M) want to read my daughter’s (17F) diary to find out why she left us. My wife (43F) says we should absolutely not

EDIT: After another restless night, I was very surprised to wake up to this. Thank you so much for your condolences and for sharing your thoughts and experiences. I wish I could respond to all of you but I am mentally exhausted. Again, thank you all so much.

My (44M) daughter (17F) committed suicide two months ago. It was honestly a big shock as she’s never shown any signs that she wanted to take her life. My wife and I blame ourselves and wishes that we could’ve done more. She was in therapy for something unrelated, she was very afraid and would panic at the sight of blood, so we thought that her feelings in general would be addressed during her sessions. We were always very supportive of her, asking her about her days or if she’s having any troubles about anything when she’s noticeably looking down.

We only started cleaning out her room a week ago. I was going through her closet and tucked at the very back was a small backpack with her diary in it. I really wanted to read it because my daughter didn’t leave anything behind, not a note saying why she did it or anything, so I was hoping that maybe something in her diary would shine light as to why she did what she did. I brought the idea up to my wife and she said absolutely not, though she’s not with us anymore, she still deserves the utmost respect. My son (14M) also wants to know why her sister left but doesn’t think that reading her diary is the way to go about it.

I don’t know, I feel like we need closure. My family and her friends need closure. My wife cries herself to sleep every night, repeating that she wishes we could’ve done something different, and I comfort her. My son obviously misses his sister as they were so close. He misses her so much that sometimes we’d find him asleep by the door of his sister’s room in the middle of the night. My daughter didn’t have any social media presence but had a good amount of friends and none of them know why she did it either. This diary is our last shot of giving everyone she knew the answer why. I know diaries are very intimate and the last thing I want to do is disrespect my daughter.

If I don’t end up reading her diary, how will I find closure? How will my family move past this? Everyday is filled with tears and many thoughts of “why?” Was it my wife and I’s fault? We don’t know, which is why I want to know. If it was us, I don’t want to have us make the same mistakes with our only child left. I don’t know exactly what I’m asking for but anything would be appreciated.

ANSWER: Hey OP my dad passed away when I was 11 and when I turned 25 my aunt gave me some journals he wrote and gave me the option to read them or not or whatever. I agonized over it for a long time but eventually I did read them. The situation isn't exactly the same but I can tell you this: it was incredibly difficult and incredibly painful. Most people tend to journal more about negative things than the positive, and some of the things there made me struggle a lot. I don't think I regret the choice to read them but I would highly recommend waiting a while before trying to know what's in there. It's entirely possible that it will not give you closure, and you can never unknow the things you read so you need to be sure you're ready for it.  
 I like the idea of asking her therapist to read them, or even a different therapist who didn't even know her, It seems like much less of an invasion of privacy to have someone else read her personal thoughts and feelings. I think the most important thing though is that you and your wife come to an understanding about this, because it is not worth it to read them if it will seriously hurt your wife.

QUESTION: My (25F) grandparents walked in on me getting spanked by my boyfriend (28M)

I was raised by my grandparents, and gave them a key to my place for emergencies. Well, my grandma gets really worried if you don't reply to her texts in an hour.

This specific day was the first day I saw my boyfriend in weeks, because he had to go abroad for work and we wanted a bit of alone time. We put our phones on silent so we wouldn't be disturbed. Apparently my grandma wanted me to pick something up for her, and got worried when I didn't pick up the phone or respond to her messages for a few hours.

She decided to come over to my apartment with my grandpa since she was worried, and used the emergency key. When they walked in I was splayed over my boyfriend's lap and we were both buck naked.

Since we are the only people that live in the apartment, we do whatever we want wherever we want. This time, on the couch. Which meant that my boyfriend's hand hovering over my bare ass was the first thing my grandparents saw when they walked in.

I've never seen two people back out of an apartment so quickly in my life. My grandma still giggles nervously when she talks to me and my grandpa won't make eye contact with me when we FaceTime.

How do I make this less awkward? A talk about my sexual preferences is not one that I want to have with the people that raised me.

ANSWER: >How do I make this less awkward?

You don't. You let them learn a lesson about boundaries.

They'll get over it in time, but you've done nothing wrong here so don't act as though you have.

QUESTION: My wife (36F) won't stop forcing me to drink her coffee... I don't want to hurt her feelings but I can't go on like this.

My wife (36F) lost her job recently, while I (48M) am currently working from my home office. Because I don't often get a chance to take breaks, she is kind enough to bring me a coffee once in a while. Nothing fancy, just regular filter coffee.

This used to only happen once every few hours, so in an average day I'd drink maybe... 2-3 cups of coffee. That was fine.

The problem has come in recent weeks. When I sit down at my desk (usually 8.00-8.30) there is a steaming cup of coffee waiting for me. Great. I drink it. But almost as soon as I've finished, my wife will come in and leave me with a fresh cup of coffee.

Every 15-20 minutes, she will come into the room and bring me more coffee. I like coffee enough in the mornings, but I do not need to chug gallons of it throughout the day. The mugs that she brings me are not small either.

There are some issues I don't know how to explain or address. If I let the coffee go cold, she will make upset faces and often refuse to speak to me (sometimes for hours/even a full day) until I ask her for more coffee. I will admit that sometimes I deliberately don't drink my morning coffee on purpose just so I can get a few hours of peace.

We've talked about this repeatedly and almost daily at this point. Every time she comes in with a coffee, I'll tell her that I've had enough and I don't want any more. She will often just silently put the coffee down next to me and the process will repeat again.

I've asked for other drinks (water, coke sometimes) and she will sometimes bring these instead, but as soon as I've finished she will bring me another coffee.

Now I'm getting regular headaches, nausea, and sometimes I'll be able to feel my own heartbeat. I don't think for a second that all this coffee is good for me.

TL;DR: my wife brings me coffee constantly and expects me to drink it, how do I approach this?

ANSWER: Somehow through all of this, you have never asked her, "Why do you keep bringing me all this coffee?"

Edit: Stop telling me the post says they've talked about it. I don't know what it says about society that so many people apparently think "I want you to stop doing this" is the same as asking her why she is doing this.

QUESTION: Girlfriend’s little brother used my collection of ‘64 Kennedy Half Dollars to buy drugs

My girlfriends little brother is 19 and not going to college or doing anything except smoking weed and playing video games. He lives with us (we are both late 20’s and have FT jobs).

I have been stacking 1964 Kennedy half dollars for ten years now. For those that don’t know, they have a face value of $0.50 but they are made of 90% silver and so they are actually currently worth about $6 each.

I had 200, which means that his dumbass only got $100 worth of drugs yet essentially stole $1200 from me.

I insist that my girlfriend pays me back the $1200 because that is the current value in silver like I mentioned. Whereas she is arguing that she only owes me $100 because that’s what her brother thought he was stealing. And according to her “he only got $100 of weed so that’s fair”. Okay so then what about my $1100 on top of that? What then?

She also called my silver stack “useless and paranoid and stupid”. I collect them partially for a store of value Incase of inflation or deflation, but I also just enjoy looking at them and the hobby of it.

I guess I’m looking for opinions on if she should pay the full $1200 that they’re worth for the value of silver. It also seems like she is trying to make me out to be a conspiracy theorist who is hoarding silver for the end times. Which is sorta true lol but what would that change anyways?

ANSWER: Instead of asking for 1200 bucks just ask her 100 in the same '64 Kennedy Half Dollars. Then it's up to her how to get those as cheap as possible and prove her point.

QUESTION: [Update] My(26M) gf(24F) told me she is pregnant but I am sterile

Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ita3mx/my26m\_gf24f\_told\_me\_she\_is\_pregnant\_but\_i\_am/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ita3mx/my26m_gf24f_told_me_she_is_pregnant_but_i_am/)

Update:

I wanna thank you all for taking your time and reaching out and giving advice.

The last few days, I feel like a burden was lifted off me, especially from my parents who always expect many things from me. The first day after the confrontation was a shit show. My parents forced relatives to reach out to me asking me to see reason (lmao), I declined. They stopped after 2 days after a harsh message from me requesting no contact.

I also took appointments for family planning (vasectomy) which is next month. Some people asked if I would ever tell my family about this, but I will not. My body, my business. I will of course tell potential future dates that I am childfree and also had a vasectomy beforehand.

Some people asked where I am from. I am from India.

ANSWER: This is so abusive, manipulative, and devastating. I'm happy for you that you did the smart thing and were able to stick up for yourself to your family - especially in a culture that makes that so hard.

It's time to start living your live, no contact with toxic family

QUESTION: My(23F) boyfriend(25F) left me on the side of the road and I deserved it.

My amazing, beautiful boyfriend had decided to treat me to dinner since we'd both had long weeks. He was making me laugh and we were talking and having a really good time. After we were done we left, and we were about half way home when I asked him if we could stop and get some dessert. He said something like "Haha, didn't we just eat?" and keeps driving. My stupid, selfish self pushes it and says "C'mon, please? I want something sweet.", he replies that we have ice cream at home and continues driving. After that I kept on pushing it and pushing it and pushing it, and while he's being way more patient with me than I deserve, he's firm and says no. I give up, but then i see a fast food restaurant up the road and jokingly pull the wheel to go into the parking lot. Apparently I pulled harder than I thought because we actually ended up swerving, and hit another car lightly. To make things worse, he just bought this car. The driver motions for us to pull into the parking lot, and when we do he and my boyfriend get out, and the driver starts cussing him out and saying horrible things to him, even though there wasn't any damage to both the cars (the bumper has the littlest little dent on it, and the other car had no damage). They didn't even exchange any information. While he's being yelled at, I don't get out of the car and let him be punished for something I did. When he gets back in and starts driving, he's gripping the steering wheel so hard that the veins on his arms are popping out. His entire face is red and he hasn't said anything to me. To try and break the tension a little, I say "Well, that could've gone a lot worse." As soon as I say that, he stomps on the breaks and just tells me to get out of his sight, in the angriest voice imaginable. I've never felt afraid of him, but in that moment I did. He looked like he was struggling not to hurt me. I got out and he sped off. It was starting to get dark and I was in a stretch of woods. It took almost an hour for me to walk home, but when I got there him and all his stuff was gone.

I feel so horrible. I cant even apologize to him because he hasn't been responding to my calls and texts. We've had fights before about my childish quirks when they go a little bit too far, and now I don't have a boyfriend anymore because of it. I've been getting texts like "Wtf" and "What the hell is wrong with you" from our friends so I think he's told them what happened.

It seems like everybody's mad at me. Is there any way to fix this? How can I apologize to them when all our friends are siding with him?

ANSWER: You could have killed someone. You are fortunate you didn't. You need to step back and analyze yourself. This isn't "childish" behavior. What makes you think grabbing a steering wheel is ok? You're a gown ass adult. You don't appologise. You offer to pay to fix the damages and grow the hell up.

QUESTION: My (26F) husband’s (28M) friend (29F) sent him a text saying “look at your other phone ;)”… he doesn’t have another phone.

Basically, what the title says.

Yesterday my husband fell asleep on the couch with his phone on his chest. As he turned over the phone dropped. I went to pick it up to make sure he hadn’t accidentally cracked the screen and the phone lit up with a text from his friend Amber which read “look at your other phone ;)”, there was also a second text which said “goodnight xxx”. I put the phone back down on the ground because I didn’t want him to know I had seen it.

When he woke up, he was looking frantically for his phone and when I told him it fell, he looked relieved as soon as he picked it up. He started smiling when he replied to his messages. When we went to bed, I sat up all night waiting to see if he would take out this mysterious second phone, but he just went to sleep straight away and never woke up again in the night.

Is there a reasonable explanation for this? Did she accidentally text the wrong person? Do I confront my husband? Snoop? What the hell is going on?

TL;DR – Husband’s friend sent a suspicious text, now I’m questioning if he has a second phone.

UPDATE: So I looked everywhere for a second phone (house and car) and I couldn't find anything anywhere. My husband was in the shower so I checked his phone to make sure I saw the message correctly and it was gone. I'm really confused.

ANSWER: Personally I wouldn't say anything just yet. That would give him the opportunity to delete and get rid of evidence.  He clearly seems to think you are either dumb or too naive to suspect anything.  Use that to your advantage.  
When I finally caught my ex cheating..his old phone was still signed into his email.  I made copies of everything I could. Printed everything out. So when I started getting the bullshit answers.  I just gave him a Manila envelop with all the evidence I had gathered. 
Good luck.  Hopefully this isn't as bad as it sounds.

QUESTION: I (32 F) work overnights. My father-in-law (60s M) keeps bad mouthing me and telling everyone I'm lazy. I'm afraid people are starting to buy it.

I work overnights in a very demanding medical field. My sleep schedule has always been nocturnal, so this feels more natural to me than working days and brings my stress down.  My husband is gone 5 days out of the week as a truck driver, and my days off are the same days he's home thanks to my seniority, and we are both night owls during this period.

My mother-in-law recently passed away, so my father-in-law sold everything and moved to where we were and has been included in my family events. At Christmas, my brother pulled me aside to let me know that my father-in-law is telling anyone who will listen that I am lazy because I 'sleep all day.'

I work 12-24 hour shifts at my job during the days I am working. The only reason I get my days off to align with my husband is the seniority I have, and even then I often have to work when he's home.

I've now noticed that, along with him calling me, I am starting to miss calls around 2 or 3 pm from family members who know I am home and are asking me to do things for them during the day. I am usually asleep by noon and have to be up for work around 8 or 9 pm. I've sat these people down to explain that I am an overnight emergency worker and that I need my sleep.

My husband sat my father-in-law down and explained to him what I do, how I need my sleep, and that he's being a jerk. My father-in-law maintains that a real job doesn't have overnights. I don't want to have to cut contact with him because we are the only family he has left. My husband stands behind me and says if I want to cut him out even just to let him have a time out, he's game.

I also don't know how to address my whole family about this. My Mom combats it as much as possible, but his way of thinking is starting to permeate them, too.

TL;DR: I am emergency medical personnel that works 3rd shift. My father in law thinks I'm lazy and is starting to infect some of my family with that idea. How do I combat this?

Edit: Thank you for all the comments. I wasn't expecting this to blow up. I posted it and went to sleep, thinking I'd have a few good replies. I'm on PTO for the next few days, so I will be taking some of this advice and talking to the problematic folks.

ANSWER: Start ringing fil in at 2/3in the morning and asking him why he isnt up yet, tell him hes lazy for sleeping when your at work, when he tells you you're being ridiculous respond accordingly

QUESTION: UPDATE to 'Should I (27/M) tell my friend (25/M) that I didn’t realize we were dating?'

[Here's the original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ivh400/should_i_27m_tell_my_friend_25m_that_i_didnt/)

So we had our dinner/movie night yesterday and I was very nervous. Mostly because I was scared that how new it was to me was going to be a deal-breaker. But Erik came over and I think he instantly realised I was acting weird. He didn’t say anything while he was helping me cook but then when we sat down to eat he almost immediately asked what was up. So I basically said something like  “I really like you and I wanna see where this goes, but I want you to know it’s very new to me and I’m not sure you’re cool with that”. And he asked what exactly was new to me and I said I’d only dated girls before. Which then lead to a conversation where I couldn’t avoid telling him that I didn’t realize we were dating until that lunch. He actually got really quiet for a few seconds after that and I was scared he was upset but then he just laughed.

Basically, he thought I’d been flirting with him for quite some time (looking back I probably was, just not intentionally) and all of his friends had been saying like “he seems so into you, it’s really obvious, he’s probably just too shy to make the first move”. He even mentioned some other stuff we or I had done that I gotta admit definitely doesn't sound platonic when he retells it, so I can see why they thought that and ultimately they were right I guess. And during that lunch he’d apparently thought I was reaching to grab his hand so he reached out too, otherwise he probably wouldn’t have done it because he said he's never been good at making the first move physically. He said when he asked me to dinner that was a huge deal and his friends had tried to hype him up for a while and that's probably why I didn't realize that he was asking me out since he was super nervous.

Anyway, we ended up talking a lot after dinner. He didn’t come out publicly (aside from a few close friends) until a year or so ago either, so he definitely understood that I don’t have a lot of experience. He hasn’t had a lot of relationships in general (at least not any proper and public ones) since he hadn’t come out and it’s a pretty conservative area so there aren’t a lot of guys who’re out of the closet here. He actually admitted that he’d even been nervous to talk to me that first time we met since I looked kind of lumberjack-y (his words not mine, though the day we met I think I hadn’t shaved in a while so I don’t doubt it) and he also knows rumors travel fast here, especially when someone doesn’t really fit in, so I guess he was worried that I’d fit the small town conservative type or have heard all the gossip. The whole 'it's a date' thing for example would never happen between two guys who are just friends here. I’ve definitely noticed the culture and it’s something we talked about too since being out here isn’t always easy, so we might try to keep it lowkey at first and mostly tell his friends and some of mine.

I could probably ramble on about him and what we talked about for a long time, but to keep it short it was a really nice talk and we want to take it slow but we also realize we’ve basically been half-dating since May, so it felt weird not to make it official. So I guess I’ve got a boyfriend now, thanks guys :)

TL;DR The talk went great, we discussed all the misunderstandings and he had no issues with me never having dated a guy before, especially since he hasn't been out for long. So we're officially together now!

EDIT: I really didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did, but I truly appreciate all the kind words and I'm really happy you found some joy in this story that just started with me being oblivious and confused. I might actually have to show this to Erik because all the support is making me really emotional over here!

EDIT 2: I’m kind of shocked at the number of comments on here, I thought there were a lot just when I went to bed a few hours ago. It’s overwhelming in a lot of different ways to say the least. I only started using Reddit for renovation advice and that usually gets me a few helpful comments, so I guess that’s what I thought would happen here too. Thank you for all of your love though. I’ll try to respond to a few questions later when I’m not feeling as overwhelmed, but I’m sorry that I can’t answer you all.

EDIT 3: Okay, last update before I logout. I’m very overwhelmed in a lot of different ways and I think it’s best for my anxiety to exit this now. I know it sounds silly since I posted on here asking for comments but I’m just not good at getting attention and I didn’t expect more than a handful of helpful comments since that’s what I usually get on my main account when I ask about renovations. I guess I should’ve prepared for the small chance that a lot of people saw this but after my original post got about 10 or so comments I didn’t think much of it when posting the update.

I looked through some of the comments and messages though and I wanted to answer some of the main questions at least:

- I’m not American and no, English isn’t my first language. The only reason I added that to my main post is because sometimes on my main account there would be phrases or names of tools I just don’t understand or know the word for. I see now maybe that wasn’t needed here and I’m sorry if it confused any of you. I studied English for many years but school English is very different from internet and every day English. I know my grammar pretty well and basic vocabulary, but I couldn’t do my job in English.

- Some people asked where I lived and how it could be so conservative. It's just a small town culture that I can't quite explain. Everyone knows everyone, false rumours spread easily, there are some people who're known to cause trouble who grew up here and think they own the place. On top of that just the general attitude towards everything is very old-fashioned. It's not hard to avoid, but still worrying.

- I don’t use this subreddit. People have mentioned like 5 different posts that are apparently very similar, but based on how many people in the comments have also been in this situation maybe it’s pretty common. I genuinely don’t know what you want me to say to that except I haven’t read them and I can’t seem find them either. I can only speak for myself and you can choose to believe me or not, that’s up to you. I got the advice I needed and that's all that matters to me at least.

- I know this might sound very love-story or movie like, but in reality it’s just me realizing I like someone and wanting to start a relationship with him. My life isn’t very exciting and I prefer it that way, which is why I’m very happy I made this a throwaway account so I can go back to my regular stuff haha!

And while this is making me quite anxious, I don’t regret posting it. Reading other people’s stories has been very emotional and I wish I could handle going through all of them, but I don’t think that would be good for me right now. Just know I appreciate all the advice and love. I didn’t want to bring this up because it seemed irrelevant, but after my last breakup I was probably at my absolute lowest point and I never expected that I would get to a place where I’m feeling this hopeful, at least not this fast. So again, thank you so much and maybe I’ll update this in the future if something happens, but right now I’m happy to leave it at this!

ANSWER: This is super adorable. If you guys end up together for the long haul, this will make a great "how we started dating" story.

How did you two start dating? "By accident."

QUESTION: I (17m) just found out that my sister (35) is actually my mother.

Update: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/hoi00p/update\_i\_17m\_just\_found\_out\_that\_my\_sister\_35\_is/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hoi00p/update_i_17m_just_found_out_that_my_sister_35_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

Sorry if this is super long...

My sister wasn't around much when I was growing up because she was in college then medical school. She'd visit on holidays and the weekends if she wasn't busy. Whenever she'd visit she would spend a lot of time with me and she'd take me places, buy me things and give me advice when I needed it. I always felt like I could tell her anything and she wouldn't judge me for it. She never really got along with our parents and I never knew what it was about but they would argue often and there was always a lot of tension around them. My parents were very loving and we get along so no issues there.

When she started dating her now  husband she spent less time with me and she would come over less often. 5 years ago she got married to the guy.  I don't like him at all. He's like an overgrown frat guy and he's always teasing me or saying dumb shit, he can never read the room. I've spoken to my sister about it but she says that it's just his way of bonding with people and that he means well and is a nice guy. He's been a pain in the ass for 5 years and just when I was going to give him a chance he fucked it up.

My sister and her husband came over for dinner two nights ago and were going to sleep over because they live 2 hours away. He took that as an opportunity to drink as much as he wanted. He's already insufferable when sober so drunk him is even worse. My sister and I were catching up because it's been a while and I was telling her how I would like to go into the medical field like her. Jackass husband then comes in saying that it's great that I want to follow in my mom's footsteps. My mom has never worked in the medical field so I was confused and thought he was just being dumb but my sister's face went so pale and my parents were very quiet. I just looked at my sister and could tell that it wasn't just a dumb comment. I locked myself in my room and didn't come out until the next day. There was a lot of yelling and I just learned something huge so I didn' want to deal with it.

When I finally decided to leave the room I saw that my sister was sitting right outside the door and that jerk was gone. I asked her wtf was going on and told her not to lie to me or I'll never speak to her again. She told me that she got pregnant in her senior year of high school and the guy cut all contact with her. She wanted to keep me and our parents were fully supportive of her. She found out that she got into her dream school but she would have to either give up the school or give me up. She couldn't choose so she decided to keep both. She spoke to our parents about it and the plan was to have them take care of me while she's in school and when can she will take me back. I was supposed to grow up knowing that she is my mom but because she was so busy and stressed out she didn't think that she could handle motherhood. Our parents noticed that she was pulling away so they adopted me and raised me as theirs. She said that she was young and dumb at the time so she agreed with the adoption.  She said that she thought of dropping out and taking me back so many times but thought I was better off without her as a mom.

As the years went by she saw less reason to tell me since I was doing good and was being well taken care of. She started crying and telling me that she regrets her decision and wants to be my mom even though I'm almost an adult she wants us to start over as mother and son. I told her I'd think about it and then she left. I went to speak to my parents. They told me that they did everything for me because they love me and I'm not obligated to leave now that I know. They said that things don't have to change if I don't want them to. It seemed more like they didn't want things to change.

I feel like my whole life is a lie. I know that I was well taken care of and I don't want to seem ungrateful but I was lied to my whole life. I don't see myself calling my sister "mom" and living life as if everything is ok. My parents are the ones who raised me so how could I just leave them like that. On the other hand if I don't decide to go with my sister she might feel like I'm rejecting her or that I hate her and after 17 years she might really give up on me. I'm so torn and feel betrayed. I can't believe that I found out from that asshole. That makes me even more mad.  I feel like I have to pick a side I don't know how to do that. I kinda just wanna run away and forget about all of this. Everyone is kinda leaving it up to me and I don't even know what I want for breakfast on a good day.

How do I approach this without everyone getting hurt?

ANSWER: You don’t have to pick a side. I’m fairly sure your sister will understand that you can’t “start over”, you’re about to be an adult. She watched you grow up, be it from the sidelines, so she didn’t completely miss anything. And of course your parents don’t want things to change, they raised you as their own so they see you as such! If you are okay with the way things are, your birth mother being your sister and your grandparents being your parents, then tell them just that.

This is going to take time to adjust to and your relationship with your sister is going to be a little different simply bc you now know who she really is to you, but that doesn’t mean that time won’t get you back to where you were or to where you want to be with her.

Take some time, as much as you need, and think about what you want to change if you want anything to change at all. Nobody says you have to know right now and nobody in their right mind would expect you to. They all love you, but do what you think is best for you. Everyone made their decisions, now it’s time for you to take your time making yours.

QUESTION: Update: My (23F) fiance (24M) has gotten way too overweight and I'm now having second thoughts about marriage.

https://reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hbs6nu/my_23f_fiance_24m_has_gotten_way_too_overweight/

Well, here goes... not a great update.

I took a number of suggestions on what to bring up to him and how to have the conversation about my concerns. He did the usual thing of trying to brush it off. I persisted, much more than I have before. Eventually I got my wish, he finally told the truth. Not easily, mind, this was a several hours long ordeal. He did NOT want to come clean about anything.

He has a weight gain fetish. Not me or someone else gaining weight, which I already knew was a thing, but HIM gaining weight. He's been doing all of this on purpose, for years. He said the beginning was unintentional, just eating too much junk at college. Then he realized he liked it. He also realized if he let himself balloon too much I might bail. He didn't want to lose me. So he had enough self control to keep it at a moderate level, until I accepted his proposal last year. That was apparently the green light he needed to throw restraint to the wind and start pursuing this fetish full speed ahead.

I never had a single inkling of suspicion the entire time. I guess I can't blame myself for that because dramatic weight gain is usually for the reasons I assumed... depression or stress or bad habits or just getting comfortable and not caring. You never hear of sexual motivations. I still feel like a complete and utter fool. Like I got played, hard. This was NOT what I thought I was marrying into.

When, if ever, was he going to tell me? He claims he "would have when it was the right time". What does that mean? Next week? Doubt it. Years in the future when we maybe have kids? More likely.

Oh and the reluctance to do anything requiring getting off the internet that I mentioned? That's because he's posting in forums and discord fetish communities talking about it. All these people share weight gain tips and compare "progress pictures" of their bellies and write pornographic roleplay stories. I'm truly disgusted. I've obliviously been sat right next to him countless times while he gets off in his own little world.

He has even discussed with random strangers how to keep me in the dark. Apparently the most common suggestion was "play dumb and make it into a running joke", so there's my explanation for why he constantly dismissed anything I said. Unbelievable.

This has been going on right under my nose for years. I really cannot fathom how I could be so clueless. And that the person I thought I knew had the gall, to not only intentionally make himself obese, but to hide his motivations from me, seek out advice on how to do that, and lie to me over and over when I attempted to talk about my worry.

I expressed how I felt seriously betrayed, like our relationship had been built on a false pretense without my knowledge. He did apologize sincerely. He said he would "try" to lose weight. I asked why is he only saying that now? Why did he refuse to discuss let alone change anything all the other times I asked what was up? Leaving me to be confused and worried instead. He didn't have an answer. He just begged me to give him one chance and promised he'd stop and get healthier.

My problem is, I just don't know if I can believe that. And even if he follows through I don't know if I can get over being lied to. For years.

I was so dumbfounded that I asked him to leave today (the conversation was last night) so I could collect my thoughts. He'll be back tomorrow night.

100% sure I want to call off the engagement. 80% sure I want to just bite the bullet and end the relationship. Fuck this. I absolutely love this man. Why did he have to do this.

TL;DR: He has a fetish about gaining weight that he kept secret since college. Has been putting himself at risk deliberately. I'm in shock and will be calling off the wedding. TBD whether I give him a chance to prove he can change and be trustworthy, but I don't feel like it's likely.

ANSWER: Damm, not only did he actively deceive you about this, he tried to trap you in a marriage so you'd have a harder time leaving when he decided to pursue it. That's pretty unforgivable. There are better people out there who won't play with you like this.

QUESTION: My (27/F) cousin (27/F) confessed that she was in love with my husband (29/F). She’s currently living with us and I have no idea how to act.

opps I made a typo in the title sorry! I meant husband (29/M)\\

Literally what the title says.

My cousin has been living with us for the past four months along with her toddler so she can save up to get her own place. Yesterday, whilst my husband was out, she asked me if we could talk. I thought she was going to ask me if she could stay a little while longer (the original plan was for 6 months) but instead she gave me a long speech about how she was in love with my husband, how she tried to make the feelings go away but they keep getting stronger and how she thinks he might be her soulmate. She kept apologizing but said that when she sees him with her son, she knows her family is complete and he could offer her and her son the stability they need. I was honestly so shocked I just  said “Uh, I need time to process this”. I’ve been avoiding her since, my husband has been holed up in his office working so he hasn’t noticed anything weird yet. I think I’m still reeling from the shock.

I can’t even ask her to move out because her family disowned her when she had a baby out of wedlock. I haven’t told anyone in real life yet either because I know they’re all just going to tell me to kick her out but I can’t make my nephew homeless during a pandemic.

What do I do?

TL;DR – my cousin, who is staying with us for another two months, thinks my husband is her soulmate. I have no idea how to act around her now. Help.

Edit: I wrote it in the comments already but just to add she claims she's had these feelings for at least 4 years and they've just grown so strong recently that she couldn't keep it in anymore. Also, her son is 18 months!

UPDATE: I spoke to my husband. He was shocked and a little uncomfortable. He apologised and said he didn't mean to give her the wrong impression. Neither of us are quite sure what we're going to do yet since he also doesn't want to leave my nephew homeless. We're discussing it. I wasn't going to update until we'd solved the issue but literally every comment is telling me to tell him so just to let you guys know I have!!

ANSWER: She’s not in love with your husband, she’s just a single mom depending on family to get by just wants your life. Time to talk to your husband and move her out.

QUESTION: My (20F) sister's (28F) behaviour towards my boyfriend (21M) is horrendous.

This is going to be long. I'm warning you. I'm angry. I'm frustrated and I'm shaking. I need to write it down and hear some advice.

My sis is just so creepy towards my bf. I can't take it anymore. She was really spoiled by my parents when she was young because she was their first child. She always WANTS everything and when we were little, she always used to steal my toys/books/clothes etc. I was never allowed to touch any of her things but she constantly stole my stuff and was always rude to me. My mom for some reason has always preferred her over me and thus, most of the time, I was told to let it go.

Due to this, I have lots of resentment towards her and I don't really like her. I'm honestly sick of her behaviour, and I just want some peace and quiet in my house.

My mom called me two weeks ago, pleading to let my sis stay with me because she doesn't have a job right now and she can't stay alone during quarantine. Both my parents are high risk. My mom has heart problems and my dad is asthmatic. So I thought I should let her stay with me and my bf instead of letting her go to my parents in case she infects them. There's been a few cases where she is so I didn't want to risk it.

Now I'm honestly starting to regret it. Her behaviour is creepy and strange and downright disgusting. First of all, she doesn't respect me at all. She's constantly ignoring me while having long talks with my boyfriend. She doesn't leave my boyfriend alone!

She flirts with him and constantly tries to touch him by using cheap tricks. When we watch movies, she pushes me away and tries to snuggle with my boyfriend. She slaps his butt when he walks by and loudly tells him how he has a "perky little butt" She also runs her fingers through his hair everyday saying "Whoaaa your hair is so soft" or some shit like that. WHAT THE FUCK.

These are all just excuses to touch him. She just needs a chance. Another thing she does is ask him if he has abs so she can touch his torso. Or say "did you see this thing I lost, maybe it's in your pocket let me see" and proceed to pat his thighs.

One time she wanted help with hooking her bra and she just fucking walks out in her underwear. She came to our room and my boyfriend was in the bathroom. The logical thing to do is just fucking ask ME I'm her sister! But what does she do? She just waits for my boyfriend and asks him instead even though I'm sitting right there!

I think I looked VERY upset because my boyfriend just told her no and she went back to her room. She didn't try that again.

This is not even all. My boyfriend and I can't even talk to each other without her interrupting us. She barges into our room with no warning. A few days ago, we were trying to have sex and I don't know how the fuck she realized it and starting banging on the door claiming to have a headache.

I opened the door and asked her what was wrong. I told her I had pills for it but she just said she doesn't trust me and she wanted to talk to my boyfriend instead. After disturbing us, she was suddenly completely fine and her headache disappeared miraculously. She just came into our bedroom and started talking to my boyfriend. We were literally half naked and there was no way she didn't know!

This is driving me crazy. What does she want? Why is she like this? It's not like I didn't talk to her. I was so angry she interrupted us because she has been doing this since she came here. I was feeling horny and angry. I just told her to get out and that we needed some alone time. I don't want to go into details but we had a small argument and she started crying.

The thing is she never accepts it! She's completely blind to what she's doing. She denies doing it and sheds tears which ends up making me feel bad instead.

My boyfriend is so uncomfortable by all of this. He just looks exhausted all the time. He's trying his best to be nice but she's all over him all the time. He's usually very introverted/shy/quiet. He's not very confrontational and I know this is bothering him. When I talked to him about it, he just commented that it was a bad idea to invite her to stay here. He also said not to invite her ever again.

I want to know why she is like this. How can I make her see what she's doing? I'm done dealing with her. I don't want to see her ever again, but she's my parents' favourite child and no matter how hard I try, I can never escape her. Whenever I try to cut contacts with her, my mom calls me and begs me to forgive her. My mom doesn't want to see her daughters fighting with each other and she always says how she wants us to be together forever.

But I can't do this. How am I supposed to deal with this? Can someone please tell me. My mom is always taking my sister's side in everything and it's always me who has to be "understanding" and "smart" and "older" when I'M THE YOUNGER ONE HERE!

Please tell me I'm not overreacting. How do I make my mom and sister realize that I'm sick of dealing with this?

TL;DR : my sis tries to flirt with bf and keeps touching him all over the place. she doesn't accept that what she's doing is wrong and i'm sick of her behaviour. how do I deal with this?

ANSWER: She is 28 and has no place to go, and is acting this bad with you?  Absolutely kick her out.  I wouldn’t give her any more ‘chances’.  Take care of yourself and your boyfriend.  Good on you for being independent of your unsupportive parents.

QUESTION: My (26F) fiancé (27M) left me for his “one that got away” four years ago. They’ve divorced and he wants to get back together.

My fiancé broke our engagement off when his high school girlfriend moved to our city. They quickly got engaged, married and had a baby before it had even been a year. I was so blindsided and hurt, I don’t think I ever really got over my ex which is why I’m making this post to get some outside insight.

My ex reached out a few days ago to “catch up”. He claimed he regretted breaking up with me two months after he did but because his ex-wife was pregnant at the time, he felt he owed it to his son to try and make it work. He said their relationship quickly fell apart when he realized his ex wasn’t looking for a life partner but someone to financially support her. He said the financial issues is what finally led to their divorce. They’ve been divorced for 6 months and have two children together. According to him, his ex regularly tries to get back together with him, but he doesn’t want her.

He ended up asking me if I was willing to give him a second chance.

In some ways, my ex has become my “one who got away” and I probably would’ve jumped at the chance to get back with him a few months ago. However, I’ve recently been talking to this guy and whilst we aren’t official or anything, we did go on a date two weeks ago which went really well. I feel like it could progress into something good and I don’t know if my ex is worth losing it over.

I’d appreciate any advice on what to do in this situation.

TL;DR – My ex left me for his “one that got away”. Four years and two kids later, they’re now divorced. My ex claims he regretted leaving me two months after he did but felt like he had to stay for the sake of his unborn child. He now wants a second chance, but I’ve met someone knew who seems like a great person. I don’t know what to do.

ANSWER: He's the same guy who dumped you cold after asking you to marry him, except with more baggage and some other woman's baby.  HARD PASS.

QUESTION: UPDATE- My girlfriend (24 f) doesn't believe that I (22m) was taken advantage of.

OP- https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i236km/my_girlfriend_24_f_doesnt_believe_that_i_22m_was/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Thank you guys for the responses.

I tried talking to her again and she apologized but I could tell that she wasn't really sorry. She only did it because she "had to" if that makes sense. I asked her how she would respond if we had a son and god forbid something happened to him. She didn't even respond. It reminded me of the way my parents responded when I told them. Crickets. I was 13 when I told them. In fact they still keep contact with the woman, a family friend who was like an aunt to me.

I broke up with her and explained to her why. She was pissed. Called me every name in the book and said that it's fine because she didn't even like me that much anyway. I don't know how much of that is true or if she's saying it out of anger but I don't care. Any doubt I felt about breaking up vanished with her response. I was fully willing to work on our relationship and give it another shot but I guess I cared more about her than she did about me.

I'm gonna stay with my sister for now. I think I need to be single. For some reason I've always been quick to jump into relationships and they all fail. My now ex gf and I had some other issues that we've tried working through but I can't work through this. I'm just gonna focus on myself moving forward. I've heard everything she's said before from both men and women but having it directed at me from someone I care about really hurt. It's not something I could let go.I've dealt with a lot of confusion and guilt surrounding what happened that made me question myself. I didn't like what was happening to me but my body would react. This really messed me up.

I'm gonna work through my issues before I even think of another relationship.

ANSWER: Or I would show up to every single family event shes at and refer to her only as "pedophile".

"Hi Pedophile".  "Oh mom, you went to get your nails done with the pedophile?" "Will the pedophile be joining us for dinner?"

Eventually either she'll break and stop coming or his parents will and ban OP from attending.

QUESTION: I (28M) with fiance (27F) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous Ex was the best lover she ever had

It was quite by accident that I heard this.  We had a group of our friends over and as the night went on we all kind of busted out into little groups.  Some of us were in one room playing Texas Holdem and a couple of others were watching a Lord of the Ring marathon.  I thought she was watching the movies but she and one of her close friends were actually sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and talking.  Our group had run out of soda so I got up to go to the kitchen to get drinks and  a couple of snacks.  As I'm rounding the corner I hear my fiance talking and before I completely come in the room I hear her clearly say "Jason is great but he will never be the lover that Bill was" she then followed it up with "Its not really fair to Jason though, Bill was just really gifted down there".

At first I thought about just walking back into the card game and pretending like we didn't have any extra soda or food but I decided to kind of make a noise and go in.  Her friend caught eye of me rounding the corner and I could see her make a face to my fiance letting her know I was there.  Of course she has no idea I heard her and she just stops talking to her and asks me how I'm doing and if I'm having fun.  I was tempted to say something like "I'm having as much fun as someone who is not gifted down there can" but I didn't.  I just said yes and proceeded to get my stuff and go back and finish the night.  I just acted like nothing was wrong the rest of the night and went to bed.

Needless to say it fucked me up.  I mean fucked me up bad.  I've never been jealous or what you would call insecure about myself until that moment.  I couldn't sleep that night and I went through a myriad of emotions while laying there.  At first I was angry.  Then I was humiliated.  Then I was depressed.  Then I was angry again.

Look I realize that the male ego seems stupid to women and even guys who are totally self assured.  I would have agreed with most of this prior to that night but once it has been damaged it is a bitch.

I tried to hide any form of emotion about it or ever let her know but as the days went on I just kept getting worse and worse.  I was avoiding her at all costs and while she was suspicious she didn't really say anything.  That is until she attempted to be intimate with me a few days later and I flat out rejected her.  It wasn't by a conscious decision on my part  by the way.  I had made the decision on my own to just try and get over it and move on.  But in the moment instead of being sexually aroused I felt deeply inadequate and ashamed.  Nothing was happening no matter how much either of us tried.

She asked me what was wrong and I just told her I must have been stressed from work but she would not believe that or let it go.

So much to my humiliation there I laid, naked in bed, unable to get an erection.  I came clean and told her what I heard.

Well this did not go over well at all.  At first she tried to tell me I did not hear her correctly.  But I just repeated to her verbatim what she had told her friend.  Well once she couldn't deny it she then tried to apologize and to her credit she tried to listen to my feelings on the matter.  Which once again I am sure was more of a big turn off for her because I was a wreck emotionally.

She tried to tell me how much of a better person I was and how I satisfied her and she wanted nobody else.  But all I could hear was Charlie Browns teacher noise.

It's been almost a month and I have zero desire to be with her sexually.  None.  She is now getting frustrated about this as well but no matter what I have tried I just can not get past this.  It's not like she said we were both good lovers or anything like that.  She clearly said he was far superior and my guess is that being gifted down there means he was significantly larger than me as well.  Well I know I can do all kinds of things with my hands, tongue and whatever else.  But no matter what I do I can't grow in size.  Obviously she refuses to talk about that with me saying that no matter what she say's it will only make things worse because even if she say's something positive about me I won't believe her.  She's most likely right.

Some back story here.  He dumped her.  It was not a mutual breakup, he flat out dumped her and broke her heart.  I know this because early on in our relationship she told me this.  She said she wasn't ready to be serious about anybody because her previous ex left her and emotionally broke her.  So this is not a case of me even being able to say "well she's with me because she wants to be".  If he hadn't dumped her she would never have left him.  Now I have no idea if after all of these years she would leave me for him if he would come back but I don't think she would.

I just don't know what to do here.  I can feel myself checking out of the relationship.  I know this is petty as shit but hearing the person you love tell someone else they prefer to have sex with someone else is just devastating to me.  Her telling me all of my other good qualities has only made it worse because she is saying things that I think appeal to her and maybe other women but being told I am a good provider and will make a great husband makes me feel like shit.  Like what would happen if I lost my good paying job or better yet what if I were to get injured and couldn't make anything more than state assistance, would she be there to support and help me?  Basically what I feel like right now is a really good friend who she just allowed to have sex with.  I know in my head that this is not correct but in my heart that is what I feel.

I'm sorry for the length here and I don't even know what I am asking here.  I am totally lost and if this continues I just think I am going to break our engagement.

tl;dr:  heard fiance tell her friend that previous ex was superior in the sack (presumable due to size among other things), relationship has gone to hell since and I need advice.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  Holy God.  I made this post last night and answered a couple of questions and then went to bed and got up today and went Christmas shopping hoping to make me forget my troubles and didn't even log in until just now.  I have not even started to read the (at this point) 7.7 thousand comments on this post.  I don't know what anyone has said yet but thank you all for commenting either way.  I am now going to begin the massive undertaking of looking at the comments.  Also thank you for the Gold and Silver kind internet strangers.

EDIT 2:  Dear God.  I read all the way down to the bottom of the page thinking I had gotten through most of everything and then at the bottom it said load the 5.5K more posts.  I'm stopping for the night (well morning actually).   I was going to respond to people individually but there is just no way.  I haven't even started reading the direct messages to me yet nor have I opened any of the 20 chat screens.  There are issues I want out there because there are a couple of things that are being said that are not accurate.

1.  She was to use the Barney Gumble phrase using "sweet sweet drunk talk".  In other words her and her friend were drunk while talking.  Nope, neither of us drink.  We don't even have it in the house.
2. That I am upset she told her friend.  Well this is an odd thing, before I posted this honestly I wasn't that upset about this part.  I was then and am still far more upset that this is how she feels.  However now reading a lot of the post I have become somewhat aggravated that she did share this with her friend.  I would never say anything about her to anyone that would put her in a lesser light.
3. That I am an insecure man child who should just man up and learn to do better.  Well I'm certain the first part is true, being insecure and all.  But the last part is just out of my control.  No matter what I do I will only ever be 7" long.  We have talked about this btw, when she was trying to build me up.  She said that I was already great with everything but the one thing I can't control. (Okay, so I gave myself about a half inch to feel better)
4. No I'm not going to do anything rash.  It's already been a month so its not like this happened last week.  But yes I have to decide what I am going to do here before long.  It's not fair to either of us is I am just coasting through this and no longer committed.
5. She is sorry that I heard it.  She said she is sorry she said it but at the end of the day she would not be sorry if I didn't catch her saying it.  It is what it is.  But yes I do believe she is regretting it because she has basically been a mess since I first told her.  Me not wanting to be with her is bothering her a lot according to her.  I don't know how much of that I believe but right now I guess I don't know why she would lie.  It really has wrecked hell on our Christmas spirit this year I know that.

EDIT 3:  Engineer for those who keep asking what I do for a living.  She is a paralegal.  
EDIT 4:  People have been asking about the relationship with the ex and how I know she was heartbroken.  We met about 9 months after they separated.  I know that ultimately he wanted to be with someone else, although she has claimed he never cheated.  He just ended things so he could be with another woman.  She approached me at a local workshop and we started dating .  On our 4th date when things started to get physical she broke down crying about the ex.  It was certainly weird to hold someone while they cried about someone else but I did it.  We sporadically dated for a couple more months in which time I never tried to cross any boundaries physically because it was obvious she wasn't over him so while we just went out of dates I tried to keep myself of the mind that we were just friends because I didn't want to commit either.  After close to two months she drags me from my car to her apartment and begins to tell me how much she has appreciated my patience with her and how she felt stupid about dragging me along for so long.  Obviously that was our first night together.  Within 3 months of that she is telling me that she loves me.  So yes, she was still hung up on her ex for fact when we got together.  I had thought/hoped she was over him before this happened.

EDIT 5:  Okay I posted it below in the mass of other posts but I have also started a new post and hopefully the mods let it stay open.  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a55jy1/posting_general_response_here_i_28m_with_fiance/?

ANSWER: As a man married once to the same woman for 20 years, what your gf said is disrespectful as fuck. Our marriage survives on only a handful of steadfast rules. One big one is, "To the outside world, be each other's biggest defender." I.E. If you have criticisms of your SO, save them for private times and share them only with each other or the occasional VERY close friend/family member. And they need to be constructive. All other time, defend your SO's honor, pride, and well-being to EVERYONE...right or wrong.

Your GF straight-up broke that rule. BIG TIME! Not only did she not defend you, she was the one putting you on the chopping block. Then she tried to play it off and keep it secret from you, like a goddam gossiping teenager shit-talking about you behind your back. Triple whammie.

Now you are stuck unable to un-hear what she said. Will you ever be able to trust her again? I doubt it. In the end, my advice is: ask yourself if there is anything she could humanly say and/or do to repair that violation of trust. If the answer's 'no' or even 'probably not,' move on.

Edit: After the fact, I realize this is a fiance. "Move on" is not a simple option. To that I say, "tell her how that comment made you feel." Hopefully, she'll recognize the gravity of her comment and see how demoralizing it was and try to make amends, if possible.

Edit: grammar

QUESTION: UPDATE: Just found out my (23M) best friend (23M) has been secretly dating my ex (24F) for months

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i32pxe/just_found_out_my_23m_best_friend_23m_has_been/)

I kind of debated if I’d post an update on this or not. It’s been a few weeks and some stuff has happened, but as the post blew up I got a good number of really shitty comments that informed me I was a worthless piece of shit, that I should beat up my ex girlfriend, or alternately that I was probably already some kind of horrible abuser who hated her and wanted to control her body.

I also got a ton of love, support, PMs offering connections on housing, and more, but being I was already in a dark and desperate place, those other comments really twisted the knife. I had to spend some time away not just fixing my shit but also avoiding that stuff, because it was really not making me want to move forward. For anyone who’s reading this while in the middle of a situation, wondering if you should post your story, my advice is: don’t. Wait till you have some distance, or it’s just going to make things worse.

One thing I want to clarify here, since a few people swung for the fences based on what I posted: I don’t hate Cassie. I don’t think she shouldn’t move on. I don’t blame her for dating someone else after I broke up with her. I do have a lot of anger still thinking about this. All that anger is at Ryan. That’s it. Ryan is the one who lied to me and went behind my back, not Cassie. My post pretty clearly stated that I think Cassie is an awesome human being. Still think so. Period. We just wanted different things.

So, actual updates.

Shortly after I posted, Ryan texted me to say that he’d planned to give me a month to find somewhere else to live, but since I “couldn’t be happy for them” he wanted me out by Friday. Looking back on it, I kinda think this was his plan all along. Cassie’s parents own the apartment I lived in with her, so we paid bills on it but no rent. Ryan’s apartment was expensive and his parents still paid some of his bills there, so I suspect he was looking for an excuse to break his lease and get in on that free rent instead.

But I have a place to live now. Reddit helped me out after all, in a weird way. A couple days after I posted, this guy TJ hit me up on FB (hey TJ) with the link to my post asking if it was me. TJ and I weren’t close friends before all this, but he recognized some of the details.

Skipping some back and forth, it turns out Ryan lied to all our mutual friends about the situation. Apparently he hooked up with Cassie the first time about a week after we split up. He asked some of our friends what to do and they all told him to make sure I was cool first thing. He then told them he had talked to me and that I was happy for him. So, when I started freaking out a couple months later, my friends all thought I was “going crazy out of nowhere” over something I’d known about for months.

Once they found out what really happened, I got a lot of apology texts. Some of them I’ve accepted. Some are still on read. A couple of guys offered me crash space or help moving, and I wound up staying with TJ, but only till I could find somewhere else.

My days of living in places without my name on a lease are over. Learned my lesson there. I found a roommate looking for a place through Craigslist and we signed the lease last week. Moving from TJ’s happens this weekend.

Ryan is blocked out of my life. I probably forgot some of my stuff at either his place or Cassie’s, but it’s whatever. I can get new stuff. I can get new friends. More than anything else this situation made me realize the importance of having stable, independent housing and not counting on anyone else to do the right thing by me. I have to have my own back in life, not rely on others.

That’s about all I’ve got. It’s nothing dramatic, I guess. No one was hit by a car, got pregnant, or turned out to be cheating. But I’ve never been so glad to have a roof over my head and a bed to come back to. I’m going to keep going from here, keep working on life, and I’m sure as hell going to be taking a break on the dating front. That’s all there is to do.

ANSWER: Props to TJ for being a such a bro. Also, good luck with your future endeavours and I hope you make some amazing friends in the future.

QUESTION: My bf says I need to lose weight even though I already lost 30lbs

I(22f) live with my bf(26) who calls me fat even though I weighed 130lbs before I started dieting and exercising.

Even at 100lbs he still insists that I’m not losing enough and that he isn’t as attracted to me as he used to be. I’m trying my best to lose weight but I think losing any more is a bad idea as I’m very skinny now. It’s upsetting when he claims that I’m overweight all of the time even though I completely cut out junk food from my diet and jog for at least an hour a day.

I don’t think losing anymore is safe for me, how should I expect this to my bf

Edit:I’m 5ft

Edit2:I asked out of curiosity how much he wanted me to weigh and he to,d me around 70-80lbs

ANSWER: I try not to say this often but you should probably get out of that relationship. That's incredibly toxic and manipulative. It's also physically dangerous for you. You need someone to build you up and love you not someone who will make you feel unattractive if you're not a skeleton. Fuck him.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] I (30F) found out my husband (32M) hired my friend (26F) to strip at his bachelor party

TL;DR last post I found out my husband had actually hired strippers for his bachelor party, not only that but he had gone out of his way to hire Rebecca (a close friend) and they hid this for four years.

Is it too soon to update?

I confronted them both, separately, they both gave two very different stories

Rebecca says that my husband got drunk, groped her and when she refused he pushed her and started to yell at her, apparently my husband and his friends believe I shouldn’t be friends with her because she “lead them on”

My husband says that they didn’t sleep together but Rebecca tried to initiate and performed oral while he was black out drunk.

I’m staying with my parents because I don’t know who to believe here or if I should I should even believe either of them, all I’ve done is argue with my husband since the confession.

I’m left more confused than ever and honestly, I just want to say f the both of them, but if my husbands story is true then he’s totally innocent, but what if Rebecca is telling the truth? What if neither of them are.

I’m sick of them both, I haven’t stopped crying since arriving at my mothers to be honest and I don’t think I can.

Why would he hide this for 4 years? Why would she?! If they both believe they’re fully innocent/victims here?

My husband is a mean drunk, but he’s always so soft spoken and I don’t know if he can do those things Rebecca claimed, but I  don’t know how he reacts around his friends, but I’ve known him longer than Rebecca too? But I’m all for believing women, I feel like by agreeing with my husband I’m denying Rebeccas story/side.

ANSWER: > but if my husbands story is true then he’s totally innocent

I’d think hiring a stripper you know personally for your bachelor party makes him far from innocent no matter what events transpired.

Plus who hires their own strippers? Thats the best mans job.

QUESTION: UPDATE I’ve been putting off introducing my [28M] girlfriend [26F] to my parents [60sM/F] because they’ll be weird about her weight

[OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dh673p/my_28m_parents_60s_mf_are_about_to_meet_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Thank you to the many commenters who offered good advice. Including to call in advance and  let my parents know how it was going to go down if they wanted a role in this new part of my life.

Went like this. Paraphrasing of course.

Me: Hey Mom and Dad, You know I mentioned a girlfriend a few times. We’re moving in together so I’m thinking I’ll bring her out.

Mom: Oh that’s nice. First week of December maybe?

Me: Sure. Look there’s one thing though. She’s not thin. If you make a comment or so much as look at her weird, we’re done, we’re going home. I love her. And she would never intentionally make you uncomfortable, so I expect you to show her the same respect.

Mom: But you have so many prospects and a good job why would you—

Me: No. This is exactly what I’m talking about.

Mom: Fine. I’m just happy I finally get to meet her.

Dad: Insulting weight related comment

Me: What the fuck dad?

Mom: Oh babe give it a rest, it can’t be that bad.

Me: No if there’s any chance of that sort of commentary, I’ll just not come. I have zero tolerance for this. You’re going to treat her with the respect she deserves or you won’t get the chance to screw it up.

Dad: Insulting joke

Me: Ok, bye. If you wonder why [brother] is buying a tux for a wedding you’ve heard nothing about in a year, maybe two, think back to this conversation.

Mom: No, wait, I’ll make sure his act is together by the time you’re out here.

Dad: Insulting comment

Me: I’m hanging up.

So it looks like I’m going to fly my mom out here, not sure when. Probably not soon. My girlfriend saw how much stress this was causing me and I started a more in-depth conversation about it and she basically said “It would be nice if I could meet your parents and we could get along but it sounds like that won’t be possible and it definitely isn’t worth putting you through this.”

So thanks for the comments and help. For now it’s a non issue it turns out.

tl;dr: My dad couldn’t even hold it together through a phone call so my mom will meet my girlfriend some other time, my dad is affectively disinvited in the event we get married, and we’re just going to let this go for now.

ANSWER: Thanks a lot. I’m just as, and in many ways even more, lucky. If I’ve got to make some sucky sacrifices to keep that going, so be it. Everything in life is a trade off I guess. Appreciate the kind words.

QUESTION: My wife cheating on our 10 year anniversary

Tl;Dr yesterday was our 10 year anniversary. Brought flowers to wifes office. Found some guy nuzzling her neck and her giggling.

Yup. Tl;Dr  says it all. My (35m) wife (35f) and I were married ten years ago yesterday. She has been working on a big project for the last few months. The last 4 weeks or so she has been putting in extra time, staying late going in early, to finish up by deadline. This is a career maker for her.

I work construction. With the rain we have had we have crazy hours trying to make up time that we missed. So I work 12 hrs on the days its nice, sometimes a little longer. If its raining when I get up I dont go in. Somedays we get sent home when it starts, too dangerous. I usually hit the gym for an hour or two. Thursday we started at 6am ,midmorning starts to rain hard. We go home. I go to the gym as usual. I cut the workout short and head downtown to see wife Mehgan, to give her flowers and make plans for dinner that night if possible. We really havent seen much of each other this week. I went to bed about 9pm she wasnt home, called earlier me she is working late. Not unusual for past month.

I stopped and got some flowers and went into her building about 12:30. Nichole was at the receptionist desk. I told her I got here later than I wanted could she put the flowers on Mehgans desk. She said "I dont think they went to lunch yet why not drop them off yourself?" She buzzed the door to get back to the offices. The place was deserted. I went to her office, the door was closed . I always walk in unless the receptionist tells me she is in a meeting. I walk in some guy is standing behind her nuzzling her neck, she is reaching back over his head. She is giggling only as she can. Saying"we got to get this done".  I am gut punched. I slammed the flowers down said "Happy Anniversary" and walked out. I didnt hear what she said just went past Nichole said goodbye and left. Made it to elevators and out the building then my phone started ringing.

I balled my eyes out all the way home. Went into garage pulled my camping gear out of the rafters and took off. I drove about 2 hours to a State Park. I had no idea what to do . I just had to run. I hiked a trail we  have been on in the past about a 3 hour hike. I dont drink much so I had no booze, I just sat there thinking. Looking back I am glad I was in a rush, normally I bring a 45cal. With me camping, we have black bears, which generally scare off, but get aggressive if hungary or cubs around. The way I was feeling I might have ate the barrel that night. My phone was blowing up fom Mehgan so I had turned it off. I left the park to get reception turned it on to see my good friend called. I called him back. He said Meghan called him to check on me, make sure I didnt do anything stupid. We talked a bit, told him I got to think this thru, would catch up on Friday.

So while I am thinking about this, I go over our marriage from the beginning to see what I missed. We come from completely opposite backgrounds. My Grandfather raised me with my mom. He taught me about life. He had a little saying about everyhing. He told me marriage would be the hardest job ZI ever had, you had to work on it everyday. God I miss him. We did not have much,heard mom and grandpa having many discussions about bills. They worked hard and my brother and I did not miss out on anything we knew of.

Mehgan was born into money. Not overly rich but very comfortable. Went to a great college, always great clothes, new car etc. And she is beautiful 11/10 beautiful. I would joke with her if she coughed about the silver spoon getting stuck in her throat.  We met hit off started dating. I was dumbfounded how such a woman would ever be with me. We dated quite awhile before she told me about her parents and life style. Our friends called us the model couple, because they thought we were so good looking we had to be models. Families were not as kind, afraid of the differences economically would come into play. Her dad and I started to get along but her my mom took some convincing.

She graduates gets her first job, we plan on getting married. We work out between us that we would expose each other to our lives that we live. I took her white water rafting, she took me to the symphony, we went ziplining, we went to an art opening etc. We agreed we had to experience the others interests. She was really enthused about the more physical things we did. I kinda like the symphony and such. I own two tuxes now.

I look back and do not see any red flags. Her first two jobs she quit because the men all tried to get in her pants. She was paraded out in front for photo ops. Invited to conferences when other newbies were not. At dinner at a conference a partner tried to get her drunk, then tried to force himself into her room that night. She quit, the next job the same thing, quit again . This 3rd job has women as some of the partners and none of that bs is in her workplace. She seems very happy. We seemed very happy.

So now, Friday, I am home. I called her. Asked where she was, back at work. I being in a smartass mood said that the marriage is taking second place to her job. She responded since I would not talk what was she to do? Fair enough. She will be home in an hour. So I wait. I want to save our marriage. If I am lacking in providing then I want to fix it. I want to ask why of course but I can not accept  a IDK answer. How do I phrase this? What else should I be asking? I know I will get all emotional and forget everything so over the next few days we will be going over and over this.  What she did is wrong but please no degrading comments, she is still my wife. Thank you in advance.

ANSWER: Holy crap. I can not imagine walking in on something like that while your mood is sky high because of the anniversary. My friend you are on the right path. Do not accept "I dont know." You are not at fault. Ask what SHE is going to do to fix this. If she wants to fix it. I feel for you. Please update.

QUESTION: Engagement ring/breakup fund

[update] Thank you all!! I appreciate the traction this silly post gained. Your responses have more that assured me that I’ve got something here. I got back from my parent’s 25th anniversary party my sisters and I put on today and the post blew up. I hope to some day be half as close with someone as my parents!

I did my best to get through all the comments and reply/upvote where appropriate. Have an amazing day everyone!

Whenever I start a new relationship I start putting away 50 dollars a month in a savings account. I’m a big romantic so I intend on using this money, in the event this girl is “the one”, towards an engagement ring far down the road. Subsequently, if the relationship turns goes bad and ends in a breakup, I cash out the savings and splurge on myself as part of my healing and moving on phase. Is this idea brilliant or am I putting too much attention on these extremes?

ANSWER: Stealing this. If my boyfriend proposes, I’ll pay for the honeymoon. If not, looks like I got my wanderlust heartbreak recovery funds.

QUESTION: I [M 32] ruined Christmas and I have no regrets.

Is anyone else’s family this dysfunctional? Every year there is an argument in my family and after 32 years I was the one who blew up for the first time.

Long story short, i’m half-Korean/half-white. My mom is Korean. My dad side is white. So we only have my Dad’s side here in the US. For years, I watched my some of my dad’s side speak down to my mom. They never invite her to things. Me and my brother have always been treated like outsiders by some family members. To be frank, I don’t care how i’m treated. Every year, we always bite our tongues and survive the holidays because it’s only 2-3 times a year. We repeat the process and don’t expect much from these family members. My mom even buys gifts every year for these family members, she gets nothing in return and never complains. My white Grandma is 80 and she’s the only thing anchoring us to some of these family members.

Three times today I watched a family member (Aunt) raise her voice to my mom, speak to her as if she doesn’t speak english and shut her down over simple questions like “where should I sit?”. I watched my mom quietly recoil and I couldn’t stand to see it again. This aunt does it the most and I finally blew up. I yelled so loud everyone stopped what they were doing. I told them enough is enough, to start treating my mom with respect and as an equal in this house. To stop speaking to my mom (who’s lived in the US for 35 years) like she doesn’t speak english and stop shutting her down over simple questions. I watched it happen year after year and will not allow it to happen anymore.

My Aunt stomped away and was so upset she left. As she was leaving I walked up to my aunt to hand her my mom’s yearly gift to her. I said  “for 30 years I watched my mom give you a gift every year. I watched her speak to you as an equal with respect. I’ve never seen you treat her with the same”.  She didn’t say anything but before she left, she apologized to my mom.

Before I left, I apologized to everyone and explained why I was upset. Everyone was shocked how mad I got. I felt like everyone understood why I was mad.  Prior to this (around thanksgiving) I spoke to some family members about how I was hurt they never included my mom on family things or even texts about family emergencies. Which they have been trying to do more.

After blowing up, it made things awkward. People trickled out early too. Now my grandma is talking about not doing Christmas anymore due to the constant family drama. I feel bad, but i’ve never felt so proud to stand up for my mom. Does anyone have any advice on this? Handling rude family?  Should I do something else?

[Edit 12/26/2018: typos, wordiness and update below]

Mom’s reaction: On the car ride home my mom expressed some words about my aunt which she never does about anyone. She’s always taken the high road it’s a very Korean Christian mom approach. My mom’s method of being a pacifist is very much an older Immigrant/Korean/boomer approach too. It’s taught me a valuable skill in life. I don’t regret picking my battles and that’s why i’m so appreciative of being Korean/white. After we left, she gave me a very long mom hug. She didn’t say anything and asked me if I wanted my favorite Korean dish.

Where is my dad: He was in the other room. Yes, my dad could have done more over the last 35 years. He’s gotten in arguments with everyone my whole life including this aunt. We’d be fighting every year with someone new if we didn’t pick our battles. We would have stopped going years ago but mom wants to go out of respect for my grandma. My dad is the only one who isn’t petty about dumb shit. Defending my mom is everyone’s responsibility not just my dad. Including my grandma, aunts, other family and me. As soon as I got loud my dad came into the room and stood guard (I can’t describe it). There wasn’t much for him to say or do because he didn’t hear it. I was quick to unload and my aunt immediately walked away because she was embarrassed. My white side has a “keep grandma” happy approach which is dumb. For years my dad would be on the verge of saying things and my mom would demand that he didn’t.

Me: Reflecting on this as a whole. I can’t believe the response. It shows you everyone has screwed up family in some way. After Thanksgiving I started to speak to family one on one which has had good response. I have no relationship with this aunt. I should have pulled her aside even as the nephew who’s 30 years younger. A small part of me regrets it and will be glad to sit down with her still. If she’s not willing to try or work it out (like the other people responded), “Fck her”.  Please don’t use my experience as a reason to blow up on anyone. I should have tried to speak and I did what I felt was right, I don’t regret it.. Grandma’s 80th Bday is in two months.  I can’t wait for that to be awkward. Someone made the comment that people cant be educated until you give them a chance to be aware of their actions, which is fair. Regardless people will now think twice to be rude to my mom. Cheers and have a Happy New Years!

TLDR: After 32 years I finally blew up on a rude family member who disrespects my Korean mom and feeling liberated for standing up for something I’ve been feeling for years. How do people handle their dysfunctional family when your last grandparent is alive. Should I do something for blowing up?

ANSWER: Haha thanks! I called my brother who’s 13 hours ahead in Korea and he laughed at me said “i’m proud of you” and said “someone had to do it”  too

QUESTION: I found out that my bf posted a video online of him fingering me while I’m asleep

I(21f) and my bf(26m) live together and I bought him a video camera for his birthday since he wanted to start a YouTube channel.

I take sleeping meds to fall asleep so I’m kind of hard to wake up. Last night I woke up to find my bf with his fingers inside me while holding the camera. I ask him why he’s doing this and he tells me not worry about it. The meds were still in effect so I wasn’t really aware how wrong this was at the time.

This morning I noticed that he left the computer on and I realized that one of the windows was for a porn site. I remember what happened last night and get worried that he posted the video. Sure enough he did and several people have already seen it.

I’m so humiliated right now I don’t know what to do

Edit:quit asking me to link the video

QUESTION: Update: My (f22) best friend (f21) is moving in with me, but has now gotten pregnant and wants us to raise the baby together

Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hptbzd/one_of_my_f22_best_friends_f21_is_supposed_to/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

So this was not a big post at all, but one or two people asked for an update if there were any and so here I am again.

For a quick recap: I am possibly going to rent the entire 4 bedroom apartment I currently sublet a room in sometime around September/October and two of my best friends are moving in. My friend Layla has gotten pregnant and were planning to move in with me and have the three of us taking care of the baby, as physically and financially.

I took the advice someone gave to talk to my other future roommate Indy about it, and we both agreed that it was not something we wanted to do at all, and we decided to confront her about it together so she could understand it wasn't going to happen.

We got together at my place on Tuesday and had some tea. We just sat down and said that basically we were very worried about her and the scenario that she had in her head about us raising the baby together is just completely irresponsible and we don't want that at all. We decided to not lay out the whole thing about her mental health, job situation and all that because we didn't want it to feel like an attack on her but more just us setting some boundaries. 
She got really emotional and told us that she knew it was ridiculous but she was scared and in shock and really didn't know how to react or think straight. Apparently it wasn't even her idea to begin with but some of her other friends we don't know very well who came up with it and sorta pressured her to feel a certain way because they were extremely excited for her. 
She just said that she has been crying every day since she found out and she's so scared for the future and really just want everything to go back to normal. At that point we just said that we totally understand and we of course will be there for her no matter what she decides to do, but we really also felt that it would be a lot for her to be a mom under these circumstances.

So yeah. She decided getting an abortion would be the best thing for her. She said her initial reaction was to terminate the pregnancy but she had a lot if guilt associated with that as she has been brought up in a very conservative family
I'd rather not hear anything about the morals of that decision, as I don't think that would really be helpful to the conversation. We told her that we would be with her every step of the way if she needed it, and so we both went with her to the doctors on Thursday to confirm she was pregnant and to find out the options. Since she is only 6 weeks pregnant she could get some pills to take over a 48 hour period and that would make the embryo detach. She got the first one at the hospital on Friday where we were there with her too, and then they both stayed over at my place the whole weekend for the rest of it since her parents still doesn't know and she didn't want to tell them. 
My roommate is conveniently on holiday with some of her friends for the rest of the week so we had the whole place to ourselves and nothing to explain to anyone. 
She took the other pill yesterday and everything seems to be going smoothly, she just has a heavy period basically, which coincidentally ligned up with both Indys and mine (TMI sorry) so we have all been laying in my bed with heating pads and Netflix being a little miserable together, but things are going well and the pain have not been too much for just regular painkillers. 
There has been some crying, lots of hugs and long talks and walks in the forrest and I feel like things are going to be okay. They're both staying here until my roommate gets back so she can get through this in a comfy environment without having to pretend nothing is wrong.

So yeah, it seems like the plan of moving in together is back on as originally planned, and everything will be okay. Layla was offered some counseling at the hospital about getting through an abortion and the feelings about it which she is starting some time next week.

Thank you so so much for the people who gave me advice when I needed it. This outcome is better than I could have imagined and I wouldn't have thought of doing it this way if it wasn't for you guys so thank you ❤❤

Edit:

This got a lot more attention than I thought it would, given that my original post had 7 upvotes and 9 comments, so a bit of an overwhelming read this morning, but thank you to everyone for commenting, I've read them all and I'm very moved by the overwhelming positivity! It feels really nice to know that you guys think we made the right call in going about it this way, and it means a lot to me that you think we are good friends ❤

I figured I'd just respond to some of the main comments/questions that I've received a lot so its all just here at the top.

So first off about getting an STI test; she already had that as part of the initial examination and she was all clear thank God!

Second about getting birth control, then she was apparently using condoms, which I didn't know when I made the original post, so correction there. Birth control pills are not an option as they don't react well with the particular type of medication she is already on.

About her other friends, the ones who came up with the idea of us raising the baby together; a lot of people commented on how shitty friends they are, and I agree which is why they aren't my friends. Layla still likes them but she wants some distance. They have all grown up in the same church environment so I think she excuses their behavior because of that. They don't see abortion as an option so I think they were just trying to comfort her and look for a solution, though out of touch with reality. A lot of people suggested to tell them she had a miscarriage but we decided that telling them it was just a false pregnancy would be better because knowing them I would be worried that they might throw a memorial party or something of the sort for her and I just don't think that would be helpful at all. We've written a draft for the group text she has with them but I think she will wait a bit to send it out. Indy and I are just staying silent on the matter, I don't feel like it is my story to tell or not tell and I wouldn't be comfortable lying about it, so as far as we are concerned, she just had a false positive pregnancy test and that's all we know.

Someone brought up about health insurance and if it would be possible that her parents could find out that way, but we live in a country with a free health care system so that was thankfully not a concern.

And lastly; some people brought up that she shouldn't move in because she sounds unreliable and irresponsible. I will definitely agree that she was out of touch with reality for a while there but seeing how difficult of a time this has been for her I really don't blame her at all. I would probably have done something equally crazy if I was in that position. I have probably also made her sound a bit worse than she is because I was pretty annoyed with her when I wrote the first post. She is normally a very responsible and reliable and I trust her completely with moving in as I wouldn't have asked her in the first place if I didn't think she could find a job and pay rent, just I did not think she would be able to do that with a child too.

On just a final note; I didn't really want to have the morals of the decision to terminate the pregnancy discussed but I guess that's inevitable. I'm surprised by the number of people being supportive and finding comfort in the way we went about it and talking about their own experiences. That makes me happy to see. 
To the people who disagree then I'm not going to have that discussion. It's not my choice to make or to decide between right and wrong and if you want to judge me or my friends for making the choices we thought to be right then you can just go ahead and do that.

To everyone wishing us the best I wish you the best right back and I'll make sure to give her hugs from all of you ❤

ANSWER: That's absolutely beautiful. This is the type of friendship you will look back decades from now and smile together.

QUESTION: My (47M) son's (24M) wife (23F) says he raped her. He has a different story.

The two of them have been together for 4 years and have been married for 1 with three kids (3F & 3F & 3M).

In the very early hours of this morning, I hear someone calling me name from the gate. Get up, look outside and see my daughter in law standing outside with a bag and a pram holding my grandchildren. I obviously let her in and ask what's wrong. She didn't want to talk so I gave her space and took the kids to sleep in my room. I woke up at around 6 and she was still up. She couldn't get a hold of her parents so she finally decided to tell me what was going on. She says she was feeling sick and didn't want to have sex with my son but he pushed her and ended up just raping her against her protests. She thinking of opening a case which I support. I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

Shortly afterwards I check my phone I notice I got a call from my son last night and again this morning so I called him. He was also crying and I could barely hear him but eventually he calmed down and told me he almost hit her. He says all day yesterday she was giggling and chatting on her phone with a guy she says is a friend. They argued and then left it. At night curiosity got to him and he went throught he phone and found out that she was sending nudes to some guy. He got angry, grabbed her and shook her to wake her up and got into an argument again. He threw her phone on the floor and almost hit her. She then packed up and left with the kids.

I haven't told him that she's with me because I don't know what to do. I don't want to be involved but I already am. My daughter doesn't believe her at all and says I should kick her out. I don't know. Either way he was wrong. What now?

1st Update:

I asked her about the infidelity and she says it's all nonsense. She's now at the hospital to see what she can do and then she's going to the police station.

I've told my son that they are here and that she's opening a case. I'm not good at reading people but he did seem surprised at her story and so was she at his story. I've warned him about an upcoming trial and suggested he calls a lawyer which he says he will.

2nd Update: they're both going with their stories and are both very firm in it and are gathering evidence on both sides. I have asked my DIL if I could take her to a friend or to her family and she understood. I'm still keeping the kids with me (on her request).

And as much as I'd love to update more specifically on what's happening, I can't but I do appreciate all the comments and have/will read them all

ANSWER: Your son has been accused of rape. He needs to speak to an attorney and if possible get proof of the pics/texts. 
Either he is a monster or she is.

QUESTION: Update: My fiancé told me he is “tired of hiding” who he is from me and now I’m not sure I want to get married

Link to previous post: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ijrrc6/my_fianc%C3%A9_told_me_he_is_tired_of_hiding_who_he_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Firstly, thank you everyone for your input, the “run” comment was pretty brutal but effective. I broke off the engagement three days ago via phone call. I haven’t figured out how I will return the ring but thinking by insured mail.

The call itself wasn’t horrible because I think he was in shock but a couple of highlights from the call:

- “I might have lied, fine. But you are a liar too, you lied about loving me.”

- “Not trying to guilt you but you’ve destroyed me.”

- “I have nothing now and have no idea what I’m going to do with myself.”

- “Are you seeing someone else?”

- “You’re making a huge mistake. Al I wanted was to be a good husband to you.” (2x)

These comments were hard to hear because my worst fear is that I preemptively cut off a relationship with a man who is going through active change and who loves me dearly. But at the end of the day, I realized I don’t trust that he will change genuinely and I have no idea how to measure that progress since he has proved to hide parts of himself around me.

He hasn’t tried to contact me since I broke things off and I’m grateful for that. I think it would make everything so much worse. I am grieving such an immense loss which is hard to communicate because others see it as a win by leaving an unhealthy relationship.

Again, thanks everyone for the advice.

ANSWER: All of those comments he made to you are all centered around him trying to guilt you but none of them ask about your well being and how he could've done better.  I know it's hard but you've made the right decision, I'm proud of you OP!

QUESTION: I (26f) confessed to my best friend (26m) and was rejected, a week later he says he was wrong and has actually loved me all along, what do I do?

Update at the end!! (I originally posted this under a throwaway account, but that account didn’t start with ThrowRA as per subreddit rules)

I finally built up the courage to confess to my best friend that I had feelings for him for the past two years.  He was really nice about it and let me down gently but in no uncertain terms.  It was a hard pill to swallow, but I accepted this and I told him I’d need some time to just get back to the right head space.  I took a week to separate myself from him and let myself recover and rebuild my self esteem, but I made sure to tell him there’s no hard feelings, I just need the space.  
Fast forward to today, I ran into him and decided to talk to him and apologize for putting him in an uncomfortable position but that I accept his feelings and I’m ready to keep continue our relationship as friends.  Except... he tells me that he took that week to think too, and he thinks he’s actually loved me for a long time but that he was too dense to recognize his own feelings until now.  
I feel like I should be elated, but for some reason my heart just really hurts.  I feel confused and unsure of what to believe.  For all the time I’ve known him, he’s never been the type to play with someone else’s feelings and has never given me any reason to think he’s lying to me now about how he feels towards me, but I don’t understand how someone can just go from having no romantic feelings towards someone to saying they’ve loved them all along in such a short time.  I feel like I’ve been asked to tear out a piece of my heart, sew it shut, and now suddenly open that same wound to put everything back the way it was!  
Should I just accept his feelings now?  Should I be wary of this?  I feel like this should be such an easy decision and yet, I just feel so confused!

UPDATE: Thank you all for all of your advice and kind comments! We met in person to talk things through and I asked him what changed.  He told me that the truth was that he’d never really felt romantically interested in anyone else before, so he genuinely didn’t really know how to distinguish a best friend from something more.  I know he’s never had a relationship before, he’s never expressed a romantic interest in anyone else, and never seemed to express a sexual attraction to someone else, so this seems to line up from what I know of him.

I asked him then how he knew for sure that he liked me as more than a friend.  He said he’d never felt this way towards anyone else: never felt nervous butterflies just wanting to see them, never felt a strange jealousy when another guy was trying to hit on them, and never felt his heart race when he accidentally brushed hands with them.

I told him that I wanted to make sure he wasn’t confusing any guilt he may feel for turning me down for love.  He said that if he wanted to pity me he would have just said yes the first time.

He apologized again for confusing and hurting me and said that if I still needed time he’d be willing to wait, take things slow, and keep talking more until I could figure my feelings out.  I told him I didn’t need more time to know how I felt, because I never really stopped loving him even if I had pushed those feelings down as far as I could.  I told him that I wanted to take things slow, but I wanted to do so as more than just friends.

We talked for a while, he even told me how he actually had come to the park planning to confess and ask me out, but when he heard me apologize to him and say that I was ready to just be friends he realized it might be better to take things slow.

Of course, at the end of all this I just sort of happy/relief cried like a dork and he just pulled me close and hugged me (though he had some happy tears himself)! We’re planning to order some food from one of our favorite restaurants and have a picnic date at the same park next week!

ANSWER: Would you prefer that he accepted you when you first asked but a week later he realised it was a mistake...or he took a week to think about it and decide you are really what he wants?

Strongest relationships are those built on friendships and not just lust.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I[19M] recently found out that my older sister[34F] is actually my biological mother.

Link to original:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/bw8dsa/i19m\_recently\_found\_out\_that\_my\_older\_sister34f/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bw8dsa/i19m_recently_found_out_that_my_older_sister34f/)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ok so I first of all want to thank everyone for your honest replies, it really helped me to get my feelings straight and get ready to confront her.

&#x200B;

So after a week of avoiding I came to her house with a picnic basket by surprise so ill have a chance to speak with her. She was happy to see me and I told her to sit down because we need to talk.

I started things with saying that I know that she has a secret that she's been hiding from me for years. Her face turned red and she started crying like hell. She knew what I was talking about. I told her the story about the DNA test, about Jennet and basically what I told you guys in the last post.

Well after she calmed down a bit she told me the truth. She told me how she got drunk at a party and slept with one of the jerks who does nothing but weed every day. He didn't really care about a future kid and was like "yeah whatever". Apparently she found out that 10 years ago he was stabbed in prison after sitting for drug dealing, assult and armed robbery.

She told me how her mother used to convince her father to talk me out of the idea of keeping the baby. they would constantly fight with her. When the baby was born they told her on the spot that she brought shame upon the family and they will not help raising the baby in any way, meaning she will have to work meanwhile to have money for her baby and sometimes for herself. After a couple of months of loaning from her friends and juggling between working and taking care of me she had a huge fight with her parents and told them that if they are not helping financially and barely in any sort of way, she and me are better off without them. As they sent her to her room she escaped in the middle of the night, hitchhiked to a neighboring country and by morning she was there already. She tried to take care of me for a few days, she found an old abandoned house that used to have homeless people coming around every now and then, and she took me to the mall when I started crying. She started crying too. The couple that adopted us immediately came to our aid and asked if \_we\_ lost our mother. Rose jumped on the opportunity and came up with a story and an alias. Police figured out we are not in the system for multiple reasons. We were raised in foster care for a year and a half until the couple that helped us decided to make the effort and adopt us so we won't be separated. It took them a few months and a couple of lawyers but they managed to adopt us both.

Rose knew all along that her parents are looking for her(They came to their senses after a day or so). She reached out to them and told them in a letter that she is fine and is taking care of herself and me, she is not homeless and found a nice couple to help her with the baby. She made it clear for them that she is never coming back and they should stop looking, and a month after that they stopped.

A few years later her father went on a quest to find her(she was after 18) secretly. After so much time searching he found her and apologized and after a while she forgave him and kept secretly in touch with him. He met me a few times and I knew him as one of Rose's old friends from the park. He helped us a few times and apparently they would meet up once every two months secretly. Ironically I'm glad I got to know him before he passed, even if I didn't know who he really is.

&#x200B;

BTW, the adoptive family never found out about the whole thing.

&#x200B;

So after hearing this I told her we missed a lot by not knowing she is my mother and I told her I understand she did the right thing. I pulled out an "It's a boy!" sign from the picnic basket and some snacks for a late baby shower and we hugged for an hour or so, had a lot of fun, watched a movie and I headed off to my parents(ADOPTIVE) house to have dinner with them.

&#x200B;

I'm glad she is my mother. I feel for the first time in years - complete. I don't care she lied because she did it for the greater good and I honestly can't imagine my life right now if she didn't. Thanks Reddit for helping me getting my feelings straight and helping me out mentally to coop with everything that happened!

ANSWER: I'm so glad to hear that everything turned out well!

&#x200B;

By the way, this could be a sick movie script ya know.

QUESTION: [Update] Overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvz1jc/overheard_my_girlfriend_say_she_would_leave_me/)

So I read all the comments on my last post and even after breaking up with my girlfriend, I was doubting if I made the right decesion. I wasn't going to update because I didn't see a reason to do it, but after the the last couple days I came to a final conclusion.I want to clarify that I broke up with my girlfriend because of how easy it was for her to disrespect me behind my back, not because of the actual height difference.

After I broke up with her she continued to apologize to me. She would send me letters and call me a lot. In one of the texts I actually responded to, she asked if we could meet up and talk. Without going into to much detail, she wanted a second chance and overall sounded very remorseful. I was about to agree, but something she said made me realize I would be making a mistake if I did. She said, "I'll remember to respect from now on." That sentence made me realize that I made the right choice by breaking up. Since when do you have to be reminded to have the bare minimum of respect for your partner?

Either way I'm glad I didn't give her a second chance. I don't know if any of you care at this point, but there's the update.

On a sidenote, the other day I was hanging out with one of my female friends who happens to be taller and I guess she saw us and started texting me that "she doesn't need me," started saying that my friend was a pig and that I moved on to fast. Blocked her and had a laugh I know for a fact I made the right choice.

ANSWER: > She said, "I'll remember to respect you from now on."

Nice catch. The sentence I mean, not the girl. Good for you for moving on.

QUESTION: [Update] My ex girlfriend committed suicide.. I am a firefighter and had to find her body

Its been a bit over 6 months since I posted that story and I want to give you a quick update on my life. Im on mobile so I apologize if it makes it harder to read.

TL;DR My ex girlfriend got into an abusive relationship with a drug addict. She was dealing with depression for a while and killed herself. I am a firefighter in NJ, but go to school in NH. I received the call and conducted research to find her. I drove back down to help with the search. We found her body in the woods and she wrote me a suicide note.

Where i left off was me upset about the situation and upset with the world, and most importantly, upset with myself. I was in a dark place for a while after that. I drank and shunned out everyone but my friends who were helping me. For a good amount of time I distanced myself from any girl who I met.

The funeral wasnt long after and Jim didnt even show up. Im not sure if he was invited, but it just shows the type of guy he is.

I didnt feel comfortable with dating anyone, let alone even hooking up with them. It felt wrong and i was scared i would get close to someone and lose them again. The depression i felt was destructive.

My chief reached out to me not long after because I never told him how I knew her. He asked me to see a therapist and that he can set up a visit at the firehouse. I was in NH so i told him ill see my college counseling center and send him confirmation.

I lied, i sent him a fake email and he believed me. I had this notion that i dont need help because i help people.

After 3 months i was still depressed but i started to talk to girls again. I met this really nice girl named Sarah. We talked  and even hooked up a couple times. After a month and a half she asked if we could start dating. I told her i couldnt. I told her my story and said i dont feel comfortable being close with anyone. She took it well and still wanted to talk, but i couldnt anymore. I felt as if she crossed a line in my mind and we couldnt go back. I didnt want to be close with anyone like that again.

Fast forward another month my friend Kelsey asked if i wanted to go to her sorority formal with one of her friends. I accepted and thats when i met Kristen. Kristen was perfect, she was really sweet and a great date. We ended up talking for a while and this time i decided it was time to be proactive. I opened up to her about what happened to me and i told her i want to take it very slow. She completely understood, instead of scaring her off she helped me more than anyone has ever had.

She convinced me that avoiding therapy is a bad move, and that there is no shame in seeking counseling. So i made an appointment and went. The therapist told me about a suicide prevention org on campus that i should join and tell my story. I joined them and they had suicide prevention events where people tell their stories  to help others.

I did my first story and Kristen and a bunch of my friends went to support me. It was one of the most touching moments of my life standing up on that stage and seeing all those people. I continued doing these events and Kristen went to every single one.

After 6 months i told her im ready to start dating, but to understand that i may be distant at first because im not use to this. She understood. Weve been together for 8 months and shes amazing. Shes nicest and most supportive person ive ever met.

Every time im in NJ i go to Lydias house and support her mom. On Christmas i got a crew to come to her house and deliver presents to her moms boyfriends autistic son and her nephews.

The way i was able to get relief for my pain was helping others. And if it wasnt for Kristen i wouldnt have the guidance to do it.

ANSWER: I am happy for you. You have gone through a lot but luckily you were able to come on the other side. This is very sad but beautiful story. I wish you all the best!

QUESTION: I (21F) found a hidden camera in my house. I suspect my SIL (26F) put it there to watch me while I babysit my nephew (1M). What do I do?

I babysit my 1 year old nephew from 7am-8pm Mon-Fri for free because a) I love my brother and nephew and b) I'm already a SAHM for my 5mo daughter and adding another kid isn't a big deal for me, I have everything he needs already at home and I love kids.

The spare room in my apt has been transformed into a playroom with floor mats, exersaucers, toys, a nap cot, etc and that is where my daughter and nephew spend most of their time playing and napping. There is also a tv in there, and today semi hidden behind the tv I found a weird circular object with a lens in it. After some googling I found that it was a small hidden wifi enabled camera that live streams to an app. I flipped my shit, called my fiance and asked him if it was his. He vehemently denied it and suggested I called the police and explain to them that I need a bug check. The only other person with regular access to my home and the playroom in particular would be my SIL; she drops nephew off in the morning and picks him up after work, and Bro and our parents only come on the weekends. I suspect the camera was placed recently which rules them out. Another reason I suspect SIL is because I had put my nephew in a long sleeved foot pajama this morning because my apartment can get chilly, and 5 mins later she texted me "it's going to warm up later so please don't dress (nephew) too warmly, thanks!" It could be a coincidence, but now that I found the camera I'm not so sure.

If it's her, she knows I know since I'm assuming she saw me find it. What do I do? Do I confront her and ask if its hers? I couldn't even begin to imagine why she would think to put hidden cameras in my house; I have treated my nephew like my own from the start and love him wholeheartedly. I would never think to hurt him or neglect him, my family actually compliment me quite often on what good care I take of my daughter and how happy she always is, and of course I treat my nephew the same.

ANSWER: "Someone has secretly been recording my apartment. You should find someone else to watch your son, since I won't feel safe with him here until the cops get to the bottom of this."

QUESTION: My (43M) son's (17) therapist told him it would be better to just die

Advice would be very much appreciated, but I understand if you might think that this is too much for the sub. I am simply a religious Reddit user, so I thought I might get some help.

My son has been diagnosed with Manic Depression when he was 15. He's tried to end his life three times - one time he cut his veins, the other two he overdosed on pills. He is violent towards his younger sister, mother and sometimes even me. I have heard a lot of people tell me over the years that I would be better off just letting him do his business, and I am sick and tired of it. I love my son - he is not perfect by all means, none of us are, but I would never be relieved by him dying.

His last suicide attempt was in September, and ever since we have removed his door and set alarms at night, to check on him once every half an hour. We keep medication, knifes, belts, basically any sharp thing you could think of under lock and key. He is not allowed to drive or go anywhere by himself. We are all terrified of losing him.

Ever since September, he refused to go to his past therapist, so we had to set him up with a new one. This woman is well-known in our city and has gotten nothing but stellar reviews - people praise her left and right. It was hard to get an appointment, and my wife was ecstatic when she said she could maybe squeeze him in sometimes. He has been seeing her for two months, and although the appointments didn't seem to lift his mood much, he somehow looked lighter and more at peace after each and every one. I would drive him to each one, wait for him there and drive him back home. I would ask how it went and the best answer I got was "twas fine". Until yesterday.

I asked him how it was, not expecting anything out of him, because he seemed more closed off than usual. The answer I got was "She told me I would be better off just dying". I thought it was a cruel joke on his part, but he seemed sincere. I asked him to elaborate and he just said "Don't act like you don't want it". I got him out of the car, barged in on her next appointment and went off on her. How could you even suggest something like that? I am paying you to help him understand how precious his life is, how much everyone around him treasures him, and you just tell him he would be better off dying? He wouldn't. He would be dead. She asked my son to wait for us to discuss it in the hallway and then proceeded to tell me that no amount of "pills or chit-chats will help him". That his brain is wired differently from ours and that I don't have the knowledge she has. I just left.

I have anulled all appointments and tried to discuss it with him, but I don't know if he even listens. My wife is at her wits' end and did nothing but cry ever since I related all this to her. I don't know if, in the last 2 months, she's drilled this idea into his brain. I don't know how to make it right. I feel like everybody is conspiring against us at this point, almost like no one wants him to get better. I know this may be too big for you, because I feel it weighting heavily on all of us too.

EDIT: It has been 12 hours since posting this. I have gotten maybe the best and worst advice ever. I have been called names, but most of all you degraded my son by calling him a sociopathic murderer which... okay, armchair psychologists, you sure know best. I will discuss with my wife the possibility of inpatient and will contact my son's last therapist to ask her if we can arrange something. I will write an update when there is something to update you on. To all those offering genuine advice and criticism, as long as it's constructive, thank you so much, I will take your words to heart. I will stop responding to comments here or try to fight useless battles around. I might check the private messages from time to time, but that is it. Thank you once again!

ANSWER: If he has to be watched 24/7 and is actively physically harming you guys, he needs to be in long term hospital care. They'll be able to work with him intensively to get his meds right. Bipolar is a tricky disorder. May I ask what he's currently taking?

QUESTION: My (21M) Dad (54M) constantly makes jokes about my rape

To keep my background short, I was in a relationship many years ago for two years. It was toxic, it was "Fuck me or I'll cheat on you" it was "You aren't a real man if you don't do things with me. This was in the 8th-10th grade. Horrible awful shit. I have forgiven her since, I talked to her years later about it. She was being raped by her stepdad during our relationship and that violence and awful shit basically got transfered onto her and then onto me.

I finally had the guts to tell my parents about what happened to me about a year ago and to explain how that went I'll give a quote from my dad "I don't understand how you didn't like it". He doesn't believe a man can be raped unless by another man. But that shit really fucked me up for a long time, even to this day it still fucks me up. I can't get hard sometimes because I get such anxiety about it. One time I talked to my parents about it when I was like 20 and to this day if I ever go out with a girl, my dad will say "Could you get it up this time?" And laugh away. Just to give an example. I just don't know what to do, I feel like shit about it way to often to be healthy.

ANSWER: I’m so sorry you’ve had to go through that. That is awful. I’m a survivor too, and I’m had similar insensitive comments and it hurts so bad. If you want to try and have a relationship with your Dad, I suggest you talk to him and tell him how much it hurts you and if he continues to speak to you that way, then you can’t have anything to do with him. However, you would be completely justified if you cut him off completely. Please find someone to talk to about what you’ve been through. You’re strong and things will get better. You’re not alone! ❤️

QUESTION: This morning I (27M) found out my gf (27F) cheated on me, where to go from here?

So our valentine's day plan was to get dinner and spend the night together but I asked my boss if I could come in late as I had some stuff I had to do. However I went to her place this morning to drop off a bouquet of flowers and another gift as a surprise. She gave me a key to her apartment and when I went in there was another guy eating breakfast while she was sitting half naked in a robe drinking tea.

As soon as I walked in she saw me and burst into tears. The guy looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. I freaked out at first and the guy left. She kept asking what are you doing here, I thought you had to work and saying she was sorry. I tried asking her questions and she wouldn't answer. Eventually she admitted she met him at a bar a couple weeks earlier, they chatted and wound up fooling around in her car and had slept together three times since then.

I took the flowers and the gift and left. I'm sitting at work right now because if I went home my mind would be on her and thinking about whatever they were doing constantly.

We've been together 3 years and were planning on moving in together later this year. I was looking up rings. She said it's because I was her first properly serious relationship and she has no idea why she did something so stupid and selfish. She thought I wouldn't find out and planned to end it eventually as it was just a brief fling. I asked if there were any others but she said no. Idk what to believe at this point.

The kicker is that my birthday was yesterday. We had lunch and got a hotel room together. We had dinner at my place with my folks and I dropped her off at her place around 9.30 as she said she had some stuff to finish doing before valentine's day. I trusted her for fucks sake.

How and why the fuck do people do things like this to others? What am I supposed to do from here?

TL;DR spent valentines day morning learning my girlfriend is a cheater and the details of that cheating, sitting at work staring at my screen

edit at roughly 1:30PM. : I broke up with her, I told her I'll be by later to get my shit and to have it ready. I'll be taking her stuff over and giving her back her key.

ANSWER: You have to look on the positive, you have avoided marrying this woman.  Ignore her BS about breaking up in the future with this guy.

QUESTION: [Serious] My (35M) girlfriend (24F) wants me to act like a horse when we have sex, and I’m not into it at all.

So, tiny bit of backstory, my girlfriend of 6 months loves horses, has all her life. An additional, seemingly relevant point is, during sex, she sometimes says stuff like ‘f me with that horse cock’. I’ve never thought much of it, I thought that was just a way of her saying it’s big. But she’s started to take it further and it’s turned into a bit of a fetish that I’m not entirely comfortable with. A few days ago, she told me she wanted to roleplay, and at first I was pretty on board, but then she said as horses. I laughed, thinking it was a joke and she took it the wrong way, and said she was tired and then went to sleep. I said fuck it and, trying to make her feel better, said I’d do it the following day. Honestly it was okay but very, very weird, she got so into it and said it was the best she ever had, and next time wanted to buy costumes, and maybe do it on some hay. I told her no, and I didn’t want to do it again and she’s back to being mad at me. Am I being a dick here? I don’t know what to do. Sorry if wrong sub, just wanted a second opinion

ANSWER: You will get a rash if you do it on hay. I lived on a farm. I have done my fair share of teenage rolling in the hay back in the day, and it will not end well for your skin. Plus, some hay has freaking thorns in it! I would seriously talk to her about you not being into it. I used to wonder why people thought girls that like horses are weird, now I know why. . .

Edit to add: apparently my other comment is lost in a sea of other comments. I AM NOT A WEIRD PERSON THAT DOES  SICK THINGS WITH HORSES.

QUESTION: My girlfriend (24 f) doesn't believe that I (22m) was taken advantage of.

UPDATE- https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i3izig/update_my_girlfriend_24_f_doesnt_believe_that_i/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

My girlfriend and I were hanging out. I was playing a game and she was scrolling on her phone. We often just like to enjoy each other's company. I guess she was reading something because she just stated how it's so sad that every woman knows someone or has been someone who was sexually harassed and/or assaulted. I agreed and told her that it's horrible how many women do not feel safe in situations where they should. She then said that men are so lucky they don't deal with it. I didn't know if she was being serious at first but she kept ranting. I told her that what men go through in life definitely doesn't compare to what women go through but sexual assault is something that happens to men too. She then responded with "all men think about is sex".

I took that as an opportunity to open up to her and tell her about how I was taken advantage of from the ages of 7-18 by a woman who I was supposed to trust. As a kid she used to touch me or make me touch her and call it "our little secret". As I got older she got more "aggressive" with the sexual acts. It only stopped because she moved away. She kinda looked at me with a "yeah right" face and said that all boys dream of being with an older woman. She only agreed that it was messed up that I was so young when it started. She then said that I seemed to be ok so it's not that bad. Women who go through it have so much mental and emotional damage and that women aren't as scary as men. I honestly didn't even know what to say.

I'm not ok I guess I'm just good at hiding it.I use smoking as a coping mechanism and it's been an issue in our relationship. How do I navigate our relationship going forward? I'm not sure where this was coming from. Maybe she went through something too? Idk...

ANSWER: >all boys dream of being with someone older

I’m sorry, you told your girlfriend that you had been sexually abused starting at age seven and that was seriously her response? Which she then continued to go on and trivialize it even more?

Your girlfriend is a garbage person.

QUESTION: I(21) found out my whole family was going on a vacation when I was told to look after the family pet.

My siblings have yet to move out of from our childhood home and I've been of to uni.

I am so empty and it feels so godamn horrible. I've been trying to act like I didn't care but when they were driving to the airport I couldn't stop crying. My mother was so hurt and they kept saying they loved me. Last time we went to a family vacation was when I was around 13. I cried so much I had cramps in my abdomen.

I wrote them a message trying to make them understand what I was feeling and that it hurt me alot. I got back that I was ruining the vacation and to just accept it. They said they thought I wanted to be "free". I know it might have been an asshole move to mention this at the first day of their vacation, but the pictures they sent being all happy made all my emotions I've tried to hide come through. I've never felt this left out and I feel like I'm not a family member. I'm trapped in this house taking care of an animal when they are out being a family on Holliday.
I feel heartbroken.

My plan right now is to leave the pet with a relative and go back to Uni and dive into school to forget.

How can I forgive them? Has this happened to anyone else?

Edit:

I would have paid for myself. This is not about getting a free vacation, this about them going away on a family vacation without inviting me. They brought with them my 19 year old brother who even complained that he'd rather play games at home. They are all there. The whole family. They brought my brother so that it would be a family trip. I would not have batted an eye if only my sister went.

I am really grateful for everyone who commented and gave me a nuanced perspective. I've come to the conclusion that my emotions are valid and that I need to communicate this to my family peacefully.

I'm also really sorry that so many other people have gone through similar situations and I send all the hugs in the world to you! The feeling of being left out is so so fucking awful.

Edit 30 juli:

I just wanted to say that I've been thinking and given the number of people who commented that "being an adult means that you are not invited to family trips" I believe this is where the miscommunication might have happened. My mother probably did not consider to ask me because she had the opinion that adult children have their own families and that I wouldn't be hurt if they didn't ask me.

For anyone who reads this and have children please do not do this. Going of to college does not mean that we suddenly don't need you. Being away from family is hard and I missed mine alot. Being invited to a family vacation is an excellent opportunity to spend much needed time together. Please include everyone, you don't lose a family when you gain another.

ANSWER: They thought I had other stuff to do. They also said they really thought I would be so happy being all alone in the house with my significant other. I don't understand why they thought that because we live together at uni.

When I found out about it they had already booked the tickets and hotel so i had no chance of even rearranging my summer planing (not that I had anything planned those dates anyway). We have a relative that want to care for the pet and could have all these dates.

QUESTION: My (36F) husband (41M) has some disturbing requests for after he's passed away.

This one is really bizarre, and I'm sorry ahead of time. My husband of 12 years has had some medical problems recently. The topic about end of life plans came up, and I asked if he wanted to be buried. He didn't want that. Nor did he want to be cremated.

My husband wants me to have his skull taken from his body and cleaned. Then he wants that skull put on the mantelpiece in the living room. The rest of his body he wants sent to one of those places that makes the gems out of bodies and made into two blue diamonds. He then wants those gems to be put in the eye socket of the skull to look like eyes. Then he can "watch the family home" and "be passed down through the generations".

My husband has always had a morbid/culturally insensitive sense of humour. As such, when he'd mentioned it before he was sick, I thought he was joking. Turns out, he is not joking. He even asked me to do it too so our skulls and matching eye gems can stay above the fireplace together. I adamantly refused.

I tried talking to him, but he's firm that this is what he wants. I told him that it made me uncomfortable, but he said it was also for our kids to have (who are not currently old enough to weigh in on this discussion). I asked if this was his way of trying to "live on" with the family even after death, and he said, "not really, no". I asked where he wanted the extra cremated remains from the gem company spread, and he told me that he didn't want any remains, and to just have the biggest gems possible made and have the company dispose of the rest.

I argued that he had no idea if his children would want the literal skull of their father. Further, which child would take the skull after I died? And in two or three generations, how would he feel if/when his descendants just sold this bizarre human skull at a garage sale because it means nothing to them? And finally, how was he going to feel about the fact that I, in my grief and trying to process the loss of him, would likely never take that skull out of the box, much less have to live with him "staring" at me every time I sat on the couch?

He essentially wasn't worried or didn't care about any of it. And regarding not taking it out of the box, it's the only time he seemed upset. He told me that was what he wanted, and I'd be ignoring his final wishes. I told him that he didn't have to live with those final wishes for years to come, but it didn't matter.

Part of me wants to get over my feelings, but I can't. I want to cry thinking of someone hacking apart my husband and handing me his bones, and I feel anxiety over the thought of putting that skull with his blue "eyes" in my home until I die. I'm fine if he wants a burial. I'm fine with cremation. Viking funeral, that weird thing where they turn you into tree food, whatever. I'm even fine with the gems on their own. But this whole skull thing is really bothering me. He won't budge, and he isn't joking.

At this point I'm thinking I would just do a simple cremation after he passes and spread his ashes on our property, but that seems sneaky and dishonest. But there is absolutely no way that I can comfortably live with what he's asking if he passes away before me. What do I do, Reddit?

TL;DR My husband wants his final resting place to be on our fireplace mantle in the form of his literal skull. This is to be complimented by two gems in the empty eye sockets made from his corpse. I'm deeply disturbed by this. Help?

Edit: I did not expect this to get the attention it has, and I am grateful for so many of the responses. At the end of the day, I want my husband to feel listened to, respected, and loved. This process has cemented to me that I definitely will not be putting his skull on my mantle until I die, but there were many compromises and ideas suggested that I'm going to think about. When it feels right, I'll suggest some of them to him. For now I'm going to sign off, give my husband a big hug, and think about this for a few days.

Edit 2: He knows this post exists now. We've had a good conversation. We've laughed a fair amount over the sheer ridiculousness of this hitting the front page and the comments it brought, and we both are confident we can reach a compromise that makes us both comfortable. We're not going to talk about it all today. We're just gonna get pizza, cuddle, and tell each other dumb jokes for the rest of the day. Goodnight Reddit. I'll update this at some point in the future.

ANSWER: I think he's really underestimating the amount of carbon needed to create a gemstone.

He's not getting two eye-sized stones out of himself unless he's 9'4" and made of bison meat.

QUESTION: My son managed to read our will and it's destroying our family

I'm going to preface this by saying I love all three of my sons equally. They are 29, 24 and 22. It is my unequivocal truth.

It's just that that my ex wife's involvement with my oldest son has really introduced a lot of toxicity and complications in our life.

After years of emotional and financial abuse, my wife and I have made a very conscious decision to completely cut my ex-wife out of our lives once my son turned 18. We let him have his relationship with his mother without any interference from us or any negative words.

I disagree with a lot of how their relationship is but I have kept my mouth shut to keep the peace.

After losing literally everything after my divorce, I have built a new business with my wife and it's doing very well. All three of our sons work in the business.

A week ago, all the kids were over for lunch. I was stupid and left our recently drafted will on my office desk. My oldest son managed to see it.

Our company and our home was willed to my two younger sons. My oldest was given a trust that pays out some money every five years.

I feel like I have to explain myself over why the will was laid out as it was. My ex-wife still has a lot of influence over my son and at the suggestion of our lawyer, we created the will this way so she couldn't interfere in the company and home.

If she were to pass away before us, the will would be immediately rewritten to divide the company/home equally.

The plan was to explain this to our son gently and not for him to see it without any context.

My son was understandably upset but his behavior that day exceeded all levels of decency. He stormed downstairs, threw things around and used disgusting language against my wife and I. Our sons nearly got into a fist fight.

I am devastated. I have already apologized and forwarded him emails to my lawyer telling him I want the will to be changed to split everything equally. But the damage is done.

He's now spreading horrible lies about us and his brothers to everyone in my family, even to the point of accusing us of being racists (he is half indian, half white). His brothers and my wife and I are so hurt hearing this. It couldn't be any further than the truth. It's the same thing my ex wife liked to accuse us of over the years.

He has refused to come in to work since the past week and I've been scrambling to do a lot of his work.

I don't know how to fix this. He won't take my calls.

My ex wife has used this situation to make absolutely insane posts on Facebook that I am considering legal action over. But I know that will just add gasoline to the fire with regards to my son.

I'm not sure how to salvage this. And I am really afraid that some of the things he has said won't easily be forgotten. My younger sons have already been questioned on social media by their cousins about the racism accusations. It's a very uncomfortable thing to approach. My wife is also not over the names she was called by him, even though she says she is.

TL;DR My oldest son saw our will and is understandably upset. But now he is accusing us of racism and refusing to hear my side even after I have tried to fix it.

ANSWER: Go see a family therapist. These rotten roots are so deep in all of you there's no quick solution to this. See what a professional has to say. If your sons don't go with you, go alone.

I'm sorry to say that what you have done is a forever effect, no matter the reasons, and so was his reaction. Good luck.

Edit: Thank you for the Reddit Silver. I promise to wipe my screen wherever it lands the next time I click on this post to keep it nice and polished.

QUESTION: Me (M34) and fiancee (F27), I am in the process of calling a halt to our wedding as she has asked for an "open" relationship.

Alright folks where to start, this one is tough to type and the paws are shaking as I'm doing it. As it says in the title, me and my fiancee (ex?) are 34 and 27 respectively, have been together for nearly four years overall and are a year engaged. I'll be totally honest here, just before we got engaged she had an emotional affair with a bloke that she worked with (I only found  out because one of her friend's BF contacted me and said that he overheard the friendgroup discussing it). I confronted her at the time, and after a good bit of arguing and hassle, we came to an agreement to let it go. I'll be totally honest in saying that I'm still slightly in the process of getting over that particular incident, and it discoloured my view of her. I manned up, moved on and proposed (which I had planned on doing anyway). This is just to give an overall context here and indeed to let it be known that there has been issues in the past.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to recent time. We are due married in November (travelling abroad for it with family), and back around october she started acting a bit odd. Distant, not herself, away with the fairies. Even stopped having sex, which was very strange. I put it down to stress around organising the wedding, and the fact that we had moved flat. Forward to Christmas time, and now things are coming to a head. I confronted her straight up, and she set out that she was sorry, has just been stressed. I was very considerate, and tried to help her through it.

&#x200B;

However, it basically continued on ebbing and flowing throughout the next two months, up to yesterday. I arrived in from  work last night, and she says that she wants to talk. The vibe was bad guys, I could tell. We sat down and she set out that she had been reading, and that she wasn't having second thoughts about the marriage, but the 'nature' of our relationship. At this rate I was getting a bit agitated, and demanded that she come out with what the bloody hell she meant. Basically, a few of her friends had back in October (the times matched up) conveyed to her the idea of an "open relationship"...........basically they stay with their blokes and have one night stands on nights out if they fancy. I'll be honest, the idea made me ill. I said this to her, and she asked to be heard out. Pulled out some online blog post by a blogger who had a husband and live-in boyfriend........I got half way through and told her enough of this nonsense. I wouldn't consider myself old-fashioned, but a wife or fiancee bonking other men will never be in fashion, not in my world anyway. We got into a fight, and in the end she was begging me to give it a chance and that nothing is set in stone. I basically said that I needed some headspace, and that I'd spend the weekend at my mates. It was quick after that, and I left without a fuss. I'm typing this on my mates laptop, and am in a bad mental way atm. I am seriously considering calling the whole thing off, both relationship and wedding. I suppose if anyone has been in a similar place I could do with some advice

&#x200B;

TLDR; Me (34m) and fiancee (27f), she asked for open relationship and I am fuming.

ANSWER: This is a dealbreaker. You don't want an open relationship and she does. There is no in between. Don't marrt her. If she wants multiple relationships she'll seek then extramaritally anyway. Don't allow yourself that level of hurt when you can see it coming.

QUESTION: UPDATE My [42M] daughter [14F] won't get an abortion

Yesterday I posted [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ds59s0/my\_42m\_daughter\_14f\_wont\_get\_an\_abortion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds59s0/my_42m_daughter_14f_wont_get_an_abortion/) but it got removed because I didn't have "ThrowRA". I've added it and messaged the mods to confirm it's me. Because the original was deleted, you can read it here:

ORIGINAL

I \[42M\] am a single father to my daughter \[14F\]. My wife passed away with excessive bleeding after childbirth, so it's just me and her. She's a fantastic young lady, always on honor roll, really good at basketball, and a social butterfly. She doesn't see too much of me because I work 9-7, but I'm home for dinner and she's started getting really good at cooking something little for both of us.

Around Tuesday, I noticed there was something off about her. She was a whole lot quieter than she usually is and there was no chatter during dinner. Right after dinner she went up to her room, even though typically we sit and watch TV together. I figured it was just moody teenage hormones. Except it doesn't stop. Friday I finally take her hands and ask her what was wrong. She looked at me and just burst into tears. She cried more, so I held her until she was ready, and that's when she whispered, "I'm pregnant."

I was shocked. Utterly and completely shocked. I kept on hugging her, but my mind had gone blank. I took her upstairs, tucked her into bed. I didn't think asking her about what she planned to do when she was so vulnerable was a good idea, I'd wait until she calmed down a little. Saturday she came down for breakfast and I sat her down and asked her her plans. She said under no circumstances will she abort the baby, it's her baby and she plans to keep it full-term. I then asked about adoption, and she said she didn't want to, that she could care for it. I calmly explained that we were no way financially able to care for a baby, and who would take care of it during the day? I go to work, she goes to school, and my parents, although were a big help in taking care of my daughter when she was younger, are too old to watch a baby. She suggested she start online school, which I refused, saying I don't want her to ruin her life.

The thing is, I don't even want to consider adoption. I can't imagine her going through pregnancy, then labor, especially with what happened to her mother. I don't know if high-risk pregnancies are genetic but if she has one, what if I lose her?I told her this, and she asked me if I had no love for my grandchild. But I don't. I don't care at all about the clump of cells in her uterus, I care about her. The girl I raised. I told her today that she had to abort her child. She cried, screamed, begged, telling me to reconsider, telling me that she'd run away. There's no way I'm letting her give birth, she could tear her body apart. And for school, I don't want her to face the stigma and hurt of teen pregnancy.

At this point, I see only one way out of this, and that's telling her if she doesn't abort it, I'm kicking her out. It hurts me so much to do this but if she doesn't do one, I'm afraid her life will truly be over. I won't actually, but I'm hoping it'll push her in the right direction. I'm pretty much manipulating her, but how do I get out of this?

Where do I go from here?

TL;DR: My daughter's pregnant, we can't afford a baby, she doesn't want to give it up or abort it

UPDATE

So today she didn't go to school and we went to the local clinic to her checked out. It's been confirmed: she's definitely pregnant, about 13 weeks along. Everything's fine so far, but she's automatically high-risk because she's a teenager. They said she could develop anemia, low blood iron, or blood pressure problems, and on top of that the baby could also be born with disabilities.

After the doctor's I took her out for ice cream and then asked her who the father was. I told her I had to know, she had to tell me. She refused, saying she'd raise the baby on her own, without his help. We went home and she went to the bathroom and accidentally left her phone open, so I took it and looked through her messages. According to the ones between her and her friends and her and the guy, he's 15 years old and a friend of a friend. She hadn't told him yet.   
I wrote down his number and then messaged him on my phone, telling him I was \[daughter's name\] dad, and I needed him to give me his mother's number because of a big problem. I expected something of a fight but the kid messaged it back to me, so I called his mom and I told him my daughter was pregnant, and her son was the father. She asked if I was sure, and I said based off the texts, it didn't seem like she'd had sex with anybody else, but she'd be free to get a paternity test. I said it'd be best if we got together at a coffee shop or something to talk, but she said there'd be no need of that. She said her son would be waiving his parental rights and they were not interested in a co-parenting situation. I asked about child support, and she said her husband would pay it, but her son would not be involved. She asked for me to not tell her about any details of the pregnancy and they don't want to be at any appointments. She hung up before I could say anything else.

Now I don't know where I stand. I can't afford a lawyer, and I don't think I can make him get involved either way. I don't entirely trust them to be accommodating in terms of child support considering how short his mother was. Is there a way they could get out of paying it? I don't know enough about their family but if they have money and we don't, what's happening there?

My daughter is no closer in getting an abortion or considering adoption, but I'm going to stop peppering her with it now. My sister and her are talking right now at the suggestion of another redditor, and I hope a female influence will work better on her than I am. She's sending a little bit of money, and I think I may be able to set up a therapy appointment for her to talk out her options in a professional way, something my sister and I can do.

EDIT: Thank you everyone so much for commenting. I expected maybe a dozen comments and I’ve got hundreds of PM’s. Thank you all so much for your help. I’m not sure what the rules of updating are, but if it’s possible I’ll update as soon as I can.

ANSWER: Jeebus I understand her not wanting an abortion but no fucking way can you afford to keep this child, talk to her about an open adoption.  She’s 14 so she has no clue what she’s in for and she has no idea what “bills” mean when it comes to children.

She can not even work to support this child.  She has not experienced 72 hours of not being able to sleep because oh yeah, a newborn!  She doesn’t understand that at 14, she is incredibly ill equipped emotionally to take care of a child.  All those stories about teenagers going out and abandoning their baby to party or getting frustrated and shaking their babies and causing them harm?  Yeah, that’s what happens when you have no coping skills for dealing with a screaming, crying, shitting creature for months on end while you are getting 2 or 3 hours of sleep a night at best.

If she cares about this baby, try talking to her about adoption.  Talk to her about the fact that her child can be placed in a loving home with the means to support the baby instead of with a 14 year old mom and a dad who doesn’t want to even acknowledge it.

I’m not trying to be mean but your daughter is romanticizing this whole situation, which might be a result of not having her mother in her life.  She may be imagining being a perfect mother, giving it a perfect childhood, etc. etc., the one she couldn’t have because her mother was dead.

Find a kid friendly way to put it but explain to her the reality of life for a kid with a 14 year old mom and no support from the father, explain to her that this child is a result of her poor decision to have unprotected sex and not the result of a relationship with love and planning, explain to her how selfish it is of her to keep the child when she has put ZERO effort into planning or preparing for it and that if SHE really loved this child, she would give him it up for adoption.

I don’t think she should be forced into an abortion if she doesn’t want to, I do think that is her right.  And I don’t think you and your parents should be forced into an early grave trying to provide for a child with a baby at 14 when you are already a single dad working long hours.

Sit her down and do a breakdown of the monthly cost of child and ask her how at 14 and while attending online school, how she is going to make enough to provide a decent life for this child?

QUESTION: I (24 F) just found out my husband (34 M) is paying for an apartment that I know nothing about.

We have owned our house for the four years we've been married. He's had this apartment for two years. I only found out about it because the landlord couldn't reach him on his cell and called the landline

He refuses to talk to me about it and says since he makes the money he doesn't need my input on all decisions.

I'm tempted to call that landlord and get the address and see where this place is and get let in to see it.

I'm afraid of what I'll find honestly. Advice would be greatly appreciated.

ANSWER: >He gets impatient with me sometimes since I'm not the most smart.

Oh no. No no no no no no, fuck that. Do not blame yourself for him being an asshole. Quit that shit right now and I mean RIGHT now. He's not as smart as he thinks he is, putting y'alls landline phone number on his secret apartment. You're plenty smart. Use those smarts to lawyer up and take him for as much as possible. Fuck this guy with a Hefty bag full of dicks. Reading this has me biting mad!

QUESTION: UPDATE: Would I (38f) be an idiot if I got back together with my ex husband (37m) who cheated on me 10 years ago?

Link to the previous post:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ioneid/would_i_38f_be_an_idiot_if_i_got_back_together/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Its been a few days now since I've posted and reddit has given me some solid advice especially the kind redditors who messaged me directly. I'm very grateful for this cause it helped me calm down and not give in to my impulses.

The morning after I posted, I texted Mike saying that I needed time and space to think about everything. He then replied with "I've waited 10 years, I can wait a bit longer". My heart melted.

When the kids woke up, our son was looking for his dad. He's at the age now where he pretty much idolized his dad. I get why though, Mike is an amazing dad. Our daughter gave me the stink eye all morning.

After lunch, when our son was in his room playing video games, my daughter confronted me about Mike. She basically said how she knew there was something going on (guess we're not that sneaky) and that she didn't want our fighting to affect their lives. She thought we were fighting.

Now, the divorce affected her but not as badly as expected. We made sure to get her counseling immediately after and made extra sure her life was as normal as possible. I'm not gonna delude myself and think she wasn't hurt by it but I'm pretty confident in saying we dealt with it pretty well. Or as well as we could.

I then had the conversation about how we weren't fighting but quite the opposite... We were thinking about getting back together. She thought about it for a while and said she was happy for us and hoped it was forever this time.

The next day I dropped my kids off at my parents house so I could talk to Mike at his place. We had a long talk about how we felt about each other, what we plan to do about it going forward, and as many of you suggested what he planned to do next time we hit a rough patch especially since we plan on having a 3rd kid. He told me that the night he cheated still haunted him 10 years later. He told me how it wasnt worth it one bit and how it was the biggest mistake of his life. He said that if ever we hit a rough patch again, we would talk about it like adults. He even suggested we do couples counseling every now and then even when times are good. I liked this idea. There are some details about our conversation that I want to keep private but long story short we got back together. We are going to take it slow and in every step we take, we both agreed that our children would take priority over everything. He's not going to move in yet but he would spend a few nights a week at home with us.

Later that night, we sat the kids down and broke the news. Daughter didn't say much cause she already knew but our son was over the moon. Since we divorced when he was a baby, the concept of both his parents being together was quite new to him. They obviously asked questions and we answered them. We're also planning on doing family counseling to help make the transition easier for everybody.

Overall, I'm really happy right now. Mike made a mistake 10 years ago but I don't hold it against him and have completely forgiven him for it. I know he loves me now and won't cheat on me anymore. I'm back together now with the love of my life and father of my kids and I couldn't be happier.

As I type this out, Mike is in the next room playing video games with our son. I'm not entirely sure what the future will look like but I'm happy he's back.

Thank you reddit for the advice. It really helped with our talk and how we proceed going forward. I think I'll stay online for an hour or so to reply till the kids are asleep and he comes to bed then it's my turn to have fun.

Peace 😁

ANSWER: Wishing you the best. Also admire the grown-up way you and your ex (your ex-ex?) are handling this situation.

QUESTION: I (29 F) am letting my baby be adopted so I can give him a better more stable life with two parents. After he is born I will be going to a mental health facility to try to get myself better. Do up think it would be appropriate for me to write him a letter to explain this?

I am bipolar and dont feel that I can care for a child, especially by myself. I dont want to live with my parents forever.

I've gone to this place before. The people who work there are rough and not nice but after a year there when I was 17 I did okay up until now.

I think he deserves two parents who want him and can care for him.

I have been so depressed since the babys father and I have broken up that I spend days in bed. I know I could not raise a child in my present state of mind.

I want to have my tubes tied after this.

My greatest wish for the baby is for him to have two loving parents and a happy, healthy home.

My greatest wish for me is to someday be normal.

ANSWER: As someone who was adopted, and has had a great life (most likely much better than I would have had, but who knows), I would love to have a letter simply saying why. Maybe some health issues that I could possibly get?

But I'm so proud of you for realizing that you're not in a good spot where you can raise a child, and therefore putting him up for adoption. I imagine that's a very tough decision to make.

QUESTION: My (f 25) husband (m 28) said something disgusting to me

I can’t stop thinking of it. I’ve been in the bath for a long time because I’ve been dreading going to bed with him.

A few hours ago I was lying in bed feeding our baby. My husband was begging me to come do something with him. I tried to tell him just to wait a few moments.  He kept glaring at me and telling me to hurry up.

I just gave birth a couple months ago, and my husband has been so jealous of his own son.

I could see he was starting to lose his patience and I told him “Honey I have to take care of him before you, you know that”. And what he said back was really stunning. He looked me right in the eyes and said “if you love him so much, why don’t you suck his dick instead of mine”. I couldn’t say anything, I didn’t know what to say. And then he stormed out of our bedroom.

I don’t even know what to make of this. What should I do? It just bothers me so deeply, it’s going to be hard for me to forgive. I really don’t have many other complaints about my husband, most days things are great with him but that just made sick to my stomach. Am I just being sensitive? Maybe I’m just emotional, but I feel like crying.

ANSWER: I don't mean to hijack the top comment, but this post is incredibly concerning to me.

Women whose partners are controlling and abusive are much less likely to breastfeed their babies, and if they do breastfeed, they often stop breastfeeding by 4 weeks postpartum. This is because the abusive partner is jealous of the attention the baby is receiving and wants to control their partner's body and anyone else's access to it, including a baby. They view breastfeeding as sexual and the baby as a competitor.

Yes, I know that is horrible. It sickens me too.

More information about abuse and breastfeeding can be found here: https://rewire.news/article/2016/04/08/breastfeeding-side-trauma/

Pregnancy and the postpartum period are also incredibly vulnerable periods for women and are time periods in which abuse often escalates, due to this jealousy, a perceived loss of control felt by the abusive partner, and the woman being more dependent and isolated.

You can read more about pregnancy and the postpartum period and abuse here.

Struggling with having a child is normal. Being so jealous of an infant that you make a coercive, predatory barb out of anger that your wife is feeding that infant, is not normal.

OP, I'm worried about this relationship, and I'm worried that your husband may engage in sexually coercive behaviors with you, push your boundaries, and mistreat your child.

QUESTION: My (23f) marriage is based on a lie. My entire family including my husband (31m) is implicit in it. I want out. I have no idea how to.

Edit: I can only be on for short periods of time at a time so I will try to come back later but I wanted to thank everyone who has commented and messaged. Ebbie I will reply to your message as soon as possible. I will try to keep updating and replying as I can.

Edit 2   10:27 mst: I have to get off for now. I will try to come back and update when I can. Again thank you all so much.

I will try to keep this short. My family & my husband's family are members of a fundamentalist Christian denomination, of the type that views women's roles as exclusively to be a 'helpmeet' to their husband and to raise children. I don't think people realize how dark that world is really, but I won't get too much into it. Lets just say that unless you've been super brainwashed or actually somehow believe it, it's not a good place for women, or kids, or really anybody.

I was homeschooled for my whole life and rarely had any interaction with anyone outside of the circle until I was 18. I wasn't allowed to talk to people who weren't from my church unless it was for the purpose of trying to convert them.

From an early age I knew I was different and by puberty I was crushing on girls and having sexual thoughts and feelings about them. After reading my diary when I was 14 my parents sent me to conversion therapy, which was an awful experience and obviously didn't work.

Between the ages of 15 and 18 I attempted suicide 11 times. After being released from the hospital the last time, my parents essentially farmed me out to family friends to help with their children and to attempt to find someone to court me.

When I was there I had unmonitored internet access for the first time and joined an lgbt group locally under a pseudonym and started going out to meet people when I could since the supervision was more relaxed than it was with my parents. At one of these meetups I met a girl who I fell completely in love with and started dating her in secret. This was in April of 2017.

Fast forward to when we had been dating around 8 months. It was around this time of year and we went out to a Christmas light festival in a neighboring town. Usually people from our denomination don't go to that kind of thing because it's not god honoring but friends of the people I was staying with saw me there with her and told them. By the time I got home that night my parents were there waiting for me.

Two months later, after being forced back home and having everything taken away, I was introduced to my now husband, and by may of this year we were married.

I don't love him. He doesn't love me. He 100% buys into everything that the religion teaches but had a failed courtship and then did mission work. He's literally told me that the only reason we are married is because he feels like Jesus's mission for him in life is to "heal" me.

It's been 8 months of absolute hell. Everything I do is approved by him, I only have friends who are the wives of his friends or are from church. I don't have a job. I literally keep a box that I told him was a hope chest and put enough baby things in that he doesn't know I have a tablet and books that I'm not supposed to have.

I know that this isn't really the typical kind of thing that gets posted in this board, but I'm desperate. I've been talking to my girlfriend again since I got the tablet. I've been trying to mend things with her. I know that I need to get out of this situation but I have no idea how to. I'm afraid I'm going to get dragged back into this hole again and I can't. I am hoping that this board might have people on it, even just one or two, that can help me to leave safely and permanently. It's hard because if I do go I have to basically build my life over again from scratch and I don't have any family or anyone who would help or support me in any way.

ANSWER: I just wanted to give you some support from a distance. I escaped a cult and arranged marriage when I was in my teens, and really really feel for you.

An internet stranger once told me these words - the words that gave me the courage to get out of there myself and go into the unknown world. He said, "It is always worth the upheaval of the world for even a chance at a better life."

And it really, really is.

You've received some great suggestions here. And I know I'm an internet stranger myself, but if you need specific tips, or a willing ear, or an untracable phone card, I will gladly offer my help.

Edited: I'm adding the below because of the PMs I've received for more information about my history. I sent a direct message to the OP, and am sharing parts of it here for anyone else these words can help:

First.. I just wanted to send you a hug. I was 9 when my mother married the cult leader, and 11 when I wasn't allowed outside any more. By 12 they were pushing marriage and had banned outside contact and books and radio. I managed to buy myself two more years somehow, but was married at 14 to a man twice my age. I was not the docile girl he'd been promised - I fought back and got returned. That wasn't a good thing, and by 15, I knew I really really had to get out. And that was when the internet was young, and the year the cult foolishly got the internet, not really realizing that meant we could contact the world.

I escaped at 16, not to a strangers or by going to the side of the freeway and taking my chances with a trucker, which I'd given serious consideration to. But I was lucky, and found a family member unrelated to the cult to take me in. I was also under age, so that was tremendously helpful.

You need to have, and take with you, your birth certificate, social security card and ID, if you have them. If you don't, it's OK. You'll be able to get them, though at considerable trouble. If you can get them, take them. If you have them, wonderful!

The other replies are right about women's shelters. In my case, the cult was very inter woven with local law enforcement, and my mother actually volunteered at the local shelter, which I suspect was to ensure that we had no where to go. So when I ran, I ran far away. Over 100 miles the first day, and ever further after that.

You are probably nervous about the thought of a shelter. It's scary. And you are probably nervous about all the things you don't know about what the regular world as a young adult is like, and how you'll support yourself. First... The world is amazing. It's terrifying and amazing at the same time. And you are strong and you are going to be OK. You'll be OK in a shelter too. Just go as far as you can, and hopefully over at least one state line. Or you come to someone specific, like your girlfriend or someone like me. I know it's insanity to say that as an internet stranger. But when I needed to run, I didn't think I had anywhere to go. For years. I would have left at 12 if I knew I had somewhere safe to go. That was the age I realized that no one else was coming to rescue me - I was going to have to rescue myself.

So I'm telling you now, if you need a place to go, you can come to me. \[Private details omitted\]

I helped my state start a confidentiality program too, which all but 12 states now have. You can Google, but if you don't have long, the short version is that you will have the support of the state's attorney generals office, get a participant card and a legal mailing address through the state, and mail will forward to you wherever you are really living. All your public records will be blacked out, even to most law enforcement. Search Address Confidentiality Program by the state name you think you can get to.

The first day I got out, when I was safe and very far away, I went and sat outside on the grass by myself. In public. I hadn't been outside unsupervised in over 3 years. And not with my hair uncovered either, or my face. It was... Amazing. The wind in my hair. The sun on my arms. And it was terrifying too. I spent the time trying to stop the urge to duck whenever any one walked anywhere nearby.

I started college 3 days later, which was a feat of paperwork on my end, and because the internet was very young and I had my birth certificate and SSN with me, which I'd stolen from the cult office in the middle of the night the week before.

You are probably worried about money, of course. Some states have cash payments to folks in temporary emergency situations. You would qualify, but not enough for lodging. Just enough for toilet paper and tooth paste. You'd also qualify for state health care and food, at least for a few months. But you can go straight into college, too, if you time it right, with grants.

Do you have access to a phone? If you have access to a cell phone that's a smart phone, use Google voice to make free and untracable calls, and delete the app every time, and don't be signed in to that account anywhere. You can do this from your tablet too. If you have access to a landline, let me know and I will send you what you need to make calls anywhere in the USA for free. The calling card number will show up in monthly call logs, if you are being monitored, but not the actual places you call. If you have access to neither, but could keep and hide a tracfone, let me know and I'll send you one preloaded with a lot minutes. You need a phone to talk to shelters or to text with them, but not to email.

A shelter will help you initiate formal divorce proceedings too, and safely from a distance. I was lucky - my marriage was religious vs legal, so when he divorced me, there was no paperwork. And I hadn't yet gotten pregnant, despite his forced attempts. I was lucky not because I was particularly strong and fought him, but because he was SO astonished that I would fight him at all, he just froze in astonishment while I got out of the room.

To give you some extra hope.. It's been over half my life now since I escaped. I've been with my spouse almost that entire time, and unrelated, but I also have another partner now too, and my life is full of warmth and love. I went straight into college and got my masters in my early twenties. I've moved a great many times, because the cult kept looking for me. And I got armed and learned to defend myself. The cult hasn't come for me in over 9 years now. But now I have children and I am aware that the cult would find it the perfect revenge to take my children. Do we live in fear? No. I never have. We are simply prepared. And I am confident in my ability to protect myself and my family. You will be too.

I told myself then, at 14 and 15 and 16, that when I grew up, I was going to be the woman who was coming to get the girls being held against their will in cults. Because no one was coming for me.

And I have. And I will be that person for you, if you want or need that help.

\[Personal information omitted.\]

\---

If you are reading this and in a position similar to the OP, please reach out to a shelter, either near you or far away, and to the other resources mentioned here. It warms my heart to see how many more options there are now then when I was breaking free. It's worth every moment of uncertainty. It's worth the upheavel of the world.

QUESTION: Update to: I found out that my [27M] GF [23F] of 9 months is part of "mean girls" type clique - I broke up with her

[Original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/go03bd/i_found_out_that_my_27m_gf_23f_of_9_months_is/)

This all actually happened a few days after my original post, but things have been pretty hectic since then, but I wanted to write a quick update since I got some useful advice in the first thread. The best advice was to insist on seeing the chat one last time to see if she had written anything about me. She initially said no, because it also has private information about her friends, etc, etc. But I basically said if she doesn't let me see the texts it's over and she reluctantly agreed, but told me to keep in mind that this was a year ago and how much we grew as a couple since then blablabla.

I scrolled to the period when we started dating and yea sure enough there I was in the texts. It actually made me feel really weird reading other people talking about me. Right around the time we first slept together someone asked her if I was better than some guy (apparently a former FWB of hers). Without missing a beat she fires back no, that it was kinda disappointing because I was nervous and had some performance anxiety and then actually went into detail about what we did. She knew I was feeling anxious since I hadn't been with anyone in a while after a bad breakup and she was supporting in person, so it felt extra shitty that behind my back she was complaining about me. A friend of hers even mocked me and she said nothing.

Katie saw the look on my face and tried to tell me again that we grew so much and things became really good when we got comfortable with each other and connected. She even showed me a text where she said that to her friends. But honestly at that point I was already done. I asked her to move out and after a bit of drama and nasty words, she moved her stuff to her mother's place.

As others said, I have no doubt they are not talking shit about me together, but honestly I could not care less what those pieces of shit are chattering about, I just never want to see any of them ever again.

ANSWER: “No, silly, that would be infringing on my friends’ privacy!” 
proceeds to describe every aspect of super intimate encounter with bf without his consent

Oh, right. Privacy.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.

&#x200B;

[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avwpo0/i_28_think_my_girlfriend_26_has_been_using_my_gym/)

I've had a lot of time to think about what happened yesterday. I've also read through a lot of the comments. Thank you to everyone who gave me advice on what to do. There's been A LOT of development and a few requests to follow up, so here it goes. It's whatever at this point.

We had been texting off and on all evening. As promised, I agreed not to bring it up in person. When I got home after work her car was in the driveway and her sister's car was there as well. I was a little nervous not knowing what I might be walking into, but overall I just wanted to get whatever was going to happen over with. When I walked in it was clear so did she. Her sister was helping her pack up her things. I didn't know what to say, but I never expected this. I honestly thought everything was going to be okay when I got home. Her sister just looked at me and didn't say anything.

I walked by her sister and went into the bedroom where my girlfriend was. She didn't say anything either. She didn't even look at me. If she was going to leave I at least wanted us to have a discussion about it. Everything I had read in the comments about buying a bidet and OCD lead me to believe there might be more to all of this than I had considered. I started to talk and she just threw down the hangars of clothes and screamed at me. "YOU PUT THIS ONLINE? I TOLD YOU TO NOT TALK ABOUT IT!" Her sister ran into the room and told me to just leave until they were gone. She then accused me of cheating. WHAT? This whole thing has been crazy and I feel like I had dealt with a lot up to this point but man that was it. I snapped.

I told her sister I had never cheated. Not once. I would never cheat on her. Enough was enough, so I told her sister the reason she was there was because earlier I had found out my girlfriend had been going to the bathroom and wiping herself with my socks. Everything went silent. Like, no one said a word. Out of nowhere they both start crying. Her sister stared yelling at me and told me I shouldn't be talking about things I don't understand. When I asked her what in the world she was talking about she just kept on yelling at me and shouted back that it was normal and that I need to mind my own business.

1. Her sister knows about it. (She did not know I posted on Reddit about it)
2. Her sister thinks it's normal.
3. I need to mind my own business? They're MY SOCKS!

I stood there all kinds of messed up so I just left. I went to a buddy's house and stayed the night. I also called off work today. I went home and all her stuff is gone. I didn't text her back. I think I'm done.

To clarify a few things: She insisted on doing laundry to keep my suspicion of her not having many socks at rest. She told me last night through text she always throws away the socks and never washed them. She reaffirmed it's not a fetish. She won't try a bidet because she doesn't want poop water splashing on her. I can't keep up with the comments. I'm pooped. (I'm trying to find humor in this because I'm really upset :(

So yeah.

Edit: (a sentence) Her sister did not previously know I posted about it on Reddit. I'm sure they both do now.

ANSWER: I'm not shocked that her sister knows about it. I figured the whole family does. Sister is in protection mode. Deep down she realizes that her own family member is unwell. She's in denial. It might be best just to "wash your hands" of this entire relationship. It's a shame that you've invested a lot of time and you really like her, but if this is how things are going to be, you're better off finding someone else.

QUESTION: My (f 20) mother (f 37) tells me if I don’t be her surrogate she’ll cut me out of her life forever.

My mother and her new husband want to have a baby. She’s still young so she still is fertile however both of her past pregnancies were complicated and very dangerous. So her doctor told her to absolutely not get pregnant as it will just be even more risky now that she’s older. She told me all of this this morning, and then she asked me to be her surrogate. She said all I have do is carry her egg and have it fertilized by her husband. I told her I can’t do that. For one, I’m trying to get my nursing degree and I don’t want anything to slow me down. And I already have a two year old with my boyfriend, and remembering what it was like to be pregnant there’s no way I want to go through it again so soon. I’m also worried because a lot of the bonding mothers do with their babies is while it’s still in the womb. I don’t want to feel attached maternally to a baby that won’t be mine. I gave her my reasons and she just rolled her eyes and told me “it would be a small sacrifice for you to do this for me”. She told me all she wants is another baby and that I shouldn’t deprive her of it when I can help her so easily. I tried to reason with her but she literally told me “if you don’t do this to me then I don’t want a relationship with you anymore”. I asked her if she was serious and she told me “yes” and left. I don’t know what to do. My mom is very stubborn and very vindictive so she probably means it at least for now. I’m not sure how I should handle this. I think she’s acting crazy.

ANSWER: Sounds like she'd do you a favor if she cut you out forever. Being a surrogate is not a "small sacrifice" by any means. It's unfortunate that her chances of a healthy pregnancy are slim to none, but trying to guilt trip you is just cruel.

You have every right to put your foot down and keep it down. Go no contact if need be.

If this kind of behavior is a common occurrence for her, I'd suggest looking into support from some of the narcissistic abuse subreddits or the Raised by Narcissists sub.

QUESTION: My gf of 3 years returned the engagement ring because she didn’t like where I proposed.

I decided to propose to my gf of three years on our third anniversary. I flew her to Vietnam and after a couple of weeks travelling we ended up in Cambodia. She had wanted to see Angkor wat and some other temples that were on her bucket list. After a long day of hiking in the heat through ruins we retired back to our hotel and when we were alone together I proposed and she said yes. We kissed and I had planned to take her to the waterfall the next day to celebrate. It’s really beautiful. She took a shower and I laid in bed thinking what an amazing day I just had and how I would get to spend the rest of my life with the women I loved. When she came out of the shower however she was in tears. She handed me back the ring saying she couldn’t accept it because she didn’t want her memory of my proposal to be in a hotel room.

I played it cool and said I understood but truthfully it hurt. It seems to me that I had offered her something of value. A lifelong commitment and partner. I took her halfway around the world and helped her cross off something she had wanted to do most of her adult life. I felt that if she valued me it wouldn’t matter that the proposal wasn’t exactly what she wanted. It was me and our future together she was saying yes to and not my delivery. If she had found a million dollars in a dumpster she wouldn’t throw it back because of where it came from. So she can’t possibly value me or what I have to offer as an individual if she’s willing to reject it because she didn’t like the place I asked.

I’m preparing to end things when we get back. She wants me to propose again and better and then she’ll say yes, but I’m done. Am I wrong? Should I do it over? What do you think.

Any advice is appreciated.

--Update to the story.
Hi and thanks for all the comments and help.

I ended up following the advice of one of the commenters. The conversation with my girlfriend went something like this:
Me: No that was my proposal. You rejected it. It's never going to happen again.
GF: So we aren't getting married? You aren't going to propose... ever?
Me: No never. I'm glad you were the one I proposed to and I'm happy that I found the courage to take that step and make such a huge commitment. But no. It was a one-time thing. If you want to marry me, you'll have to propose.

I decided to see how things went and planned to give her till my birthday (July) to make her proposal or I would end it and move on. She did while we were hiking a trail back home. I accepted.

That's it for now. Am I making a huge mistake? Maybe. I'll get a prenup of course and protect my assets. If it ends it won't cost me more than a few hundred. Hopefully, I get many happy years from this. If not, I'll update the post.

Also, thanks for all the comments and support. Weird how much that meant. I also genuinely appreciated the people that objected to me ending things. It's the internet so I expect to hear nothing but "Dump her". Getting another more reasonable side to things was helpful.

Regards,
ZenMonkey

ANSWER: I shared this story with my fiancé and he had some smart input on this:  “I wouldn’t say it’s a dealbreaker, but I would tell her that’s my proposal. If she wants to get married, then it’s on her. She can propose at any time, but I wouldn’t do it again.”

We’re both sorry you’re in this situation now. It shows shallowness on her part. Hopefully she is mature enough to see the error of her judgment. Good luck!

QUESTION: My boyfriend (27M) has been treating me (23F) differently since he got his ancestry DNA results back...

A few weeks ago, my (23F) boyfriend (27M) got his results back from one of those ancestry tests. He's never been interested in his family history before but one of his friends bought him the kit for his birthday.

A few days after seeing his results (which were nothing special, about 95 percent European and mostly just from England, where we live) he really excitedly told me that he'd been messaged by a group of people about a shared relative. Apparently all of them have an ancestor in common (my boyfriend's great (x 10) grandfather that can be linked to royal lineage.

I was pleased and a bit amused that my boyfriend was so happy, especially since he seemed to be telling every single person he knows and he posted on facebook about it. However since then I've noticed some uncomfortable behaviours from him that is making me second guess our relationship.

1. He quit his job two weeks ago (accountant) which was very unexpected and something we hadn't discussed before now. He gets defensive when I try to bring it up and ask if there was something in particular that triggered it. He has only said that he doesn't believe the 9-5 life is right for him.
2. He has suddenly started insisted on using condoms when we have sex. We have been together three years and my birth control (the copper coil) has never been an issue for him before. My boyfriend has started saying it is not good enough as a form of contraceptive by itself, which would be fine, except he has started making a few comments alongside this about how I'm trying to 'steal his genes' and implying that I want his bloodline.
3. He won't kiss me in public anymore or touch me at all around his family, which he has explained by saying he doesn't like PDA anymore and it's embarrassing. He is fine touching me when we're alone however.
4. He has asked me to look into my family history by making a family tree to  go alongside his. It's not something I care about or want to pursue (my family are also immigrants so I imagine harder to track than his) but since I refused he has made jokes that I must be scared to find out that my family 'don't match up' to his. As a sidenote, by traditional standards my family are a lot better off and more 'middle class' than his although this has never affected our relationship.

We've generally had a really good relationship before now and there have never been any major communication issues or anything like that. I'm really confused as to what's going through his mind right now and I could use some advice. Thank you.

TL;DR: my boyfriend's behaviour towards me has gotten a lot worse since he discovered he has connections to royalty in his family tree

ANSWER: He sounds deluded, does his royal highness have a history of mental illness?

He will be rocking up with a few corgis before long.

Edit: thanks for the gold and sliver

QUESTION: My (25m) Wife and Kid Died During Childbirth, I Want to Skip My Brother's Wedding

I will make this quick and save most of you the trouble of reading a lot. I am a Lt in the military and I work as a pilot.

A few months ago both my wife of three years and our child died while she was giving birth. Everyone tells me how sorry they are, how amazing of a woman she was, how much of a great father I would’ve have been. I don’t like hearing it, I don’t want to know what I could have been, should have been, or would have been because it doesn’t exist anymore.

My brother is getting married later this summer and everyone is preparing for that. I’m really happy for them and both families. Plus it slowly took everyone’s focus off me and they can focus on the happier future. I was obviously going to be a groomsmen for him, was going to give a speech after the best man, and just tease him in front of his new wife and family. My wife was looking forward to it and so was everyone else. People say they like my speeches and toasts, and my wife used to joke that every time I talk the room gets quiet so everyone can hear what I say.

I just don’t think I’m mentally prepared to go to my brother’s wedding. I don’t think I’ll be ready in a few months either. I already texted him it’s hard for me to meet up with the groomsmen once a month when they go out to dinner and plan stuff out. Thankfully he understands due to my job but the reality is I just don’t want to be around it. It’s not out of hate or angry or sorrow, I just really want to be alone and focus on work. It’s the only thing that keeps me going. That rush I feel when I take off at full speed and push the throttle harder once I’m soaring. Twisting the stick and pushing my body to feel that high. It’s the drive and push keeping me going and takes my mind off my miserable life.

I’ve been thinking of asking my commander for a TDY or if I could deploy with another squadron during the summer. Just hoping I can give a valid excuse why I can’t go to the wedding. I promise I’ll pay my brother his wedding respects before and after the wedding, I’ll even go over to his place once he’s married and spoil them with gifts.

I know it’s a horrible thing to not want to go to my little brother’s wedding but I honestly can’t do it. Every day I wish something would just happen to me during a flight exercise or while I’m driving to work or even some accident at work. My brother deserves a better brother who won’t abandon his wedding and I’m sorry I can’t be that stronger older brother.

Would it really be that bad if I skipped out on his wedding?

ANSWER: When you start wishing for accidents, it's time to see a shrink.  The last time I was inpatient at a psych hospital, at least half the people in with me were military.  You're not alone, but you do need to ask for help.

QUESTION: My (27M) fiancée (24F) has 'accidentally' lost/broken three engagement rings now... I'm starting to suspect she's doing it on purpose

I've (27M) been with my fiancée/girlfriend (24F) for three years now. I proposed a year ago, but it definitely wasn't out of the blue - she'd been not-so-subtly hinting at getting engaged for months at that point. Although we're both somewhat hot-headed, we generally have a good relationship and we occasionally only fight about small, normal things.

I know NOTHING about jewellery, but I spent a lot of time looking for the right ring to propose with. I talked to two of her closest friends to get their input, and in the end I spent around $4000 on the ring. When my fiancée saw it, she told me she loved it and I'm pretty sure she was telling the truth.

This January, my fiancée called me up in tears. She'd somehow lost the ring on her way home from work and she had no clue where it might be. I left work early to come help her search, but since she'd been riding the subway, the ring was long gone.

My fiancée was clearly distraught, so a few weeks later I dipped into my savings and bought her a different ring. It wasn't quite as expensive as the last, but it was from the same jeweller and still a good make.

Around June, I noticed one day that it had been a while since I saw my fiancée actually wear her engagement ring. She went pale and confessed to me that she thought she'd taken it off before bed one night and now it was lost somewhere in our flat. This time we searched for days and I dug up half the floorboards looking for it, but the ring is (to this day) missing.

At this point, buying another ring was out of the question (too expensive) so I asked her if she'd rather either a) have a cheap replacement ring (under $50) until after we're married, or b) go without a ring for now. She chose option b.

One day we were visiting my grandmother, who asked my fiancée where her ring was. When we told her it was lost, my grandmother was kind enough to give my fiancée one of her rings instead.

My fiancée seemed delighted and everything was working out perfectly until this week. I came home to find my grandmother's ring on the table, looking almost unrecognisable. My fiancée cried and told me that she'd managed to step on the ring that morning hard enough to break it.

I took the ring to a jewellery repair service right away. Sadly they told me that since a few small stones are missing and the original fitting is warped, the ring will never really be the same. They also told me that they were certain someone stepping on the ring couldn't realistically cause this amount of damage.

When I got home, I brought this up to my fiancée and asked her if she was 100% sure she'd only stepped on the ring. She completely flipped and yelled at me asking if I was calling her a liar. I mentioned what the jewellery store said, and she started screaming about me only caring about money and the 'cost' of the rings. It's been two days and we've barely spoken, especially as she's only coming out of our bedroom for meals.

TL;DR: my fiancée has lost two of her engagement rings and now she's broken a third. When I tried to talk with her about it, she exploded. Any advice on how to handle this?

ANSWER: A jeweler has just told you that damage didn't happen from it being stepped on

They have no incentive to lie to you

Don't let her gaslight you

QUESTION: [Update] I suspect my (31f) new boyfriend (32m) may be ftm transgender

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hzfn5h/i_31f_suspect_my_new_boyfriend_32m_may_be_f2m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Summary so far: Because of some medical information disclosed to me by him, I believed my new boyfriend was post-op transgender, ftm. You wonderful folks encouraged me to continue being supportive and open, and to let him come out to me at his own leisure.

Shortly after my original post, I sent him a text letting him know I was really into him and, short of rape, murder, or animal abuse, there wasn’t much he could tell me that would scare me away.

In person, our conversations were wonderful and deep and funny and flirty and fun. Then he’d go days and days without texting, calling, or anything.

I wrote this off as him being busy (he’s a first responder with a crazy schedule) and mostly just let it go. But something felt off.

I told him if he wasn’t interested anymore that was fine, and he could just tell me. Honestly, I can handle rejection pretty well. He got very defensive and asked where I’d get that idea.

After a particularly bad storm blew through our area, I texted him to check in, make sure he and his family were okay, etc. I got a series of one word responses, and asked if everything was okay, or if I’d done something to upset him. He said no, he just had a lot on his mind.

I told him that was fine, and that I understood, and that my anxiety was getting the best of me. I again said that if he needed to vent or talk or be distracted I was there for him. I also told him, though, that I just needed to know he was still interested in seeing me.

I got no response. For hours.

So I told him that was fine, and that I wished him the best, and that if he ever felt like he wanted to try again to hit me up. He sent me “Ok.” It really tore me up. I felt so close to him, and in person everything was so good.

Flash forward a few days and I was talking to a friend about the situation. Turns out she knows him. When I mentioned his name, she interjected “GOD, NO!” much to my confusion.

I’m at least the 3rd woman he’s done this with. Gets really close, really fast then basically drops off. So no clue what his issue is, but I’m sorry he doesn’t feel like he can trust me (or anyone else). That said, I can’t spend my life waiting for him to be ready.

Oh well, easy come, easy go.

ANSWER: What a shitty situation, I’m sorry you were on that emotional rollercoaster. I will say that you sound like a very kind and caring person. You were thoughtful to figure out the best way to approach the situation you perceived you were in, and had it been what you thought, I think the person on the other end would feel comforted and assured that you were a safe person to disclose that information to. I’m sorry this guy sucks at life and you got duped, but there’s someone else out there that will really respect and treasure your thoughtfulness.

QUESTION: My fiancée’s sister(28F) told me she’s in love with me(27M) and my fiancée(28F) is just settling for me

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iodouw/updatemy_fianc%C3%A9es_sister28f_told_me_shes_in_love/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

My fiancée, “Nancy”, and I are getting married in December. We’ve been going through a small rough patch since late June, I felt like everything was okay, but we were just out of sync. We’ve been together for 2 years, and this has happened before and we just come out of it usually.

I have a very good relationship with my fiancées twin sister, “Peggy”. We hung out a lot before she introduced me to her sister, so I’ve known her longer and she’s one of my best friends and is probably the person that knows me the best other than my family and Nancy. She and her sister also have a great relationship. No resentment, no anger towards each other just sisterly love.

Saturday I received a string of messages from Peggy that were telling me to not marry Nancy. She told me she didn’t love me like she should and if we got married we’d be in a loveless sexless marriage. I told her I didn’t believe her. She sent me screenshots of messages between her and Nancy. I wish I hadn’t read them. She said that I wasn’t the love of her life, that I wasn’t her soulmate, that’s I was just a good option and would be the a good provider and great dad to her kids, that I was “nice guy that’d any girl would be lucky to have, but he’s not the one for me.”

I asked Peggy why she told me all of this and she said she’s my best friend and she loves me. She said she’s wanted me forever, but couldn’t come between me and her sister like that. She said she’d love me like a wife should, that she fantasizes about being with me intimately, and that I drive her crazy. She asked me to leave Nancy and come be with her.

I’m so confused. I don’t know what to do about anything. I feel like my life had been turned completely upside down. I don’t know where to go from here.

ANSWER: If you believe that your fiancee might feel this way (that she wasn't just venting dramatically, or that Peggy is nuts enough to fake the messages) then it's a red flag big enough to block the wedding aisle.

However, you still owe it to your fiancee to discuss what's going on before ending things, so at least you know what's going on. Maybe her story is totally different.

And most importantly, don't get into a relationship with Peggy without a year or two to cool down away from all of them and maybe find someone better for you who's not part of this messy family dynamic.

QUESTION: My (36m) wife (33f) was sued, I'm feeling resentment towards her and I don't know how to move past it.

FWIW This is not a post asking for any legal or financial advice, we already have a lawyer and have help financially. No offense to reddit, but I’d rather not get any legal advice from a forum, but I’m okay getting relationship advice it seems.

As the title states my wife was recently sued, she lost and we had to pay. The money is a significant amount for us, we didn’t have much in savings or our emergency fund to begin with, and both of those accounts are now empty.

My currently problem is trying to move past the resentment and anger I’m feeling towards my wife. Until now I’ve always felt like we were a partnership in our marriage. But, since I’m the breadwinner I can’t help but to feel like I’m spending "my" money on something that isn’t my fault. I’ve had no problem paying the mortgage, and taking care of various financial burdens that come with being a married homeowner. However, I have been the only one to put money aside in our savings and other accounts to prepare for an emergency - like a totaled car, someone loses their job, medical bills, or an act of god… not a stupid lawsuit where I know my wife is guilty. She has a part time job and doesn’t make much money, but pays for smaller things when she can (like groceries and some random bills), but she does take care of a lot of cooking, cleaning and caring for our pets.

What did my wife do? (Note: I had no idea this was going on while it was happening).

She used linkedin to find her former ex best friend, she ended up creating a realistic looking fake linkedin profile with a vague occupation of ‘recruiter’. My wife ended up sending this ex-best friend, "Laura" a few messages pretending to be a recruiter in her line of work. Laura finally responded thinking that this recruiter was real, my wife wanted her phone number but Laura gave her a personal email address instead. My wife created a second fake linkedin profile and started to send messages to people with similar titles as Laura at her company. These messages said derogatory things about Laura, a mixture of truthful things but embarrassing and just fabricated bullshit to make Laura look bad. Her manager got one of these messages that claimed that Laura was a heavy drug user. Laura's manager talked to her about these messages and he felt like the messages were bizarre and seemed like someone was trying to troll or harass Laura. Well, Laura team had her back and helped her saved these messages. Not only that, but Laura requested that she be drug tested anyway, to provide further evidence that she was clean. My wife didn’t know this at this point, but Laura was pregnant. Several of her coworkers, including her manager testified on Laura behalf.

Using the personal email address she got from the fake recruiter profile, she was able to find a few social media platforms Laura was on and was able to figure out her husbands name. She did some more internet sleuthing and found Laura's husband on facebook. Laura's husband didn’t have much on his facebook profile, but you could see his business email address on it. My wife sent him an email claiming that Laura was cheating on him. The husband confronted Laura about this email and Laura encouraged him to keep responding to this person, and save the messages, as well as to start asking specific questions about this supposed affair.  My wife thought she was being clever and ended up telling the husband that Laura was cheating on him during the work week, she even gave him specific dates. What she didn’t realize was Laura had something turned on in google maps where it keeps years worth of historical gps data. Some of the dates my wife gave him also happened to be days where they both worked from home together. She also ended up giving him dates during a time they were on vacation together. Laura had her husband keep responding as much as possible to my wife and to backup all correspondence.

My wife was able to  find out when and where the baby shower was going to be. One of Laura friends had created a public registry for her and had the invitation online. My wife decided to show up unannounced (the baby shower took place in a semi-public place, they had rented out an area connected to the public business.) She did not make herself known immediately. Instead she looked for patrons that were entering and exiting the rented out room. She was able to get the attention of a few guests that had never met her and tried to gossip about Laura - my wife was telling people that Laura didn’t actually know who the father was, among other things. This was at an event where her husband was at as well. The word got back around to Laura and she spotted my wife and apparently immediately put together all the pieces of what happened.

I’m leaving a fair amount of information out - My wife was able to find phone numbers, social media accounts and email for other people in Laura circle and sent them messages about Laura on multiple occasions. All the messages were trying to paint Laura in an extremely derogatory light. All the events I’ve mentioned so far took place over a year or so.  My wife didn’t think to mask her IP address, so it was pretty easy to find out that all of these made up messages came from the same IP address, ours. Many of Laura's friends and family testified on her behalf, Laura had everyone saved as much digital evidence as possible - and it was a lot.

Laura and her husband hired a lawyer and decided to sue to my wife. They had ample evidence against her. All the saved messages, close friends and even her manager spoke on her behalf, she showed that she went to see a therapist once all the harassment started because she was depressed and anxious, she showed that she and her husband went to counseling after the accusations of her cheating. She even went above and beyond and had more drug tests done to show she was clean and my wife’s accusations were 100% false, and even had a paternity test done to show that my wife was again wrong and chose to lie.

I honestly felt awful for Laura, there were lots of tears on her end. You could tell how much emotional stress she had gone through. She said that being pregnant during the majority of this was absolutely horrific and was worried the stress and anxiety would somehow hurt her baby. She was pained that her one and only baby shower was ruined by my wife and that was something that could never be truly repaid or made up for. And that my wife’s harassment continued even after Laura gave birth and was trying to manage a newborn child.

My wife has never done anything this crazy before. I knew she could be a little petty and jealous of others, especially people she use to be friends with in the past, but it was only talk - no action. We’ve had a very happy marriage otherwise, we rarely fight, have a lot in common, we have a lot of fun together. But, she really fucked up this time. I don’t know how to move forward. I know someone is going to suggest therapy, but I really want to start building up an emergency fund again. We’re pretty screwed financially for awhile.

tl;dr Wife was sued by her former best friend, I emptied out all of our savings and sold a few things to pay for everything. I need help managing my resentment towards my wife and to move past this. Funds are low and we can't afford therapy right now. What can we do to move forward?

ANSWER: That is absolutely not normal and your wife clearly has some serious issues that I think you (and she, obviously) need to start addressing.  That level of harassment, and the duration of it is frankly terrifying, and I feel like you should be concentrating on dealing with that, rather than just the financial fallout.

QUESTION: I(19M) overheard my brother(16M) saying he wanted to rpe a girl at his school. Our parents won't try to help him.

Let me start this off by saying I always loved my brother ever since he was born. He was my best friend until I went to middle school when we started to drift apart. He was always a shy, quiet kid but I have no idea where it went wrong. I think it was when he was about 13 when he started to lose his cheerfulness, started to smile less and adopted his brooding demeanor. He openly asked me how he could get a girlfriend and how he could become more popular at school since he was 10 or 11, but I think as he started to go down a negative spiral he began talking about how he got the "ugly genes" out of the two of us, about how girls at school don't "respect" him enough even though he treats them like a "gentleman" would, about how he feels like an "incel" all the time. I'm genuinely worried about him. I went through a phase during middle school/high school when I used to hang out with the wrong sort of kids and I regret not being there for my brother and neglecting him when he needed me. I want to reconnect with him but I'm afraid that my brother who I thought I knew is gone for good. He made two friends at school before covid started, and at first I was happy to see he was starting to return to his cheerful self again, but recently he's just been acting more strangely. He never comes out of his room anymore and I thought he was talking to himself in there until I realized he was having phone calls. About deranged thoughts of how society works and all that. Then he went into a rant about how he wants to rape a girl at his school and fantasizes about keeping her in our basement. What the fuck do I do at this point? I try to talk to my parents about him but all they say is that he's a lost cause and that they're going to kick him out when he turns 18. I can't help but feel like if I was there for him he would've turned out better.

ANSWER: Take as much time as you can and spend it with him, go see a film. Take him out with you and your mates, expose him to new stuff and to new people. 
Just hang out with him. He may reject it but just make sure you keep inviting him, if you can make the activities slightly on the naughty/cool side of things that'll help. What he needs is exposure to new view points and ways of seeing the world and a big brother can make a massive difference, mine did to me in my darkest times.

EDIT: thanks for my first award! What a time to be alive!

QUESTION: My (24F) boyfriend (24) said that I’m not allowed to criticise slavery because I’m white-passing. He said that I would’ve lived a “comfortable life” under slavery. We argued and now he’s giving me the silent treatment.

TL;DR I am biracial (Black/White) and my BF is white. We were discussing slavery and he said that I have no right to criticise slavery because I look racially ambiguous/white-passing. He said that I shouldn’t complain because I would’ve lived a good life in that era as a mistress of a slaveowner. I called him an ignorant idiot and now he’s so offended that he won’t speak to me.

We’ve been in a relationship for four years and live together. For both of us it’s the first serious relationship and although it hasn’t always been easy, we’ve never had any significant problems. We are on the same page on most topics (racism, politics, finances etc) or so I thought at least.

Now with all these issues going on we’ve been talking about race a bit more than usual. For the record, I’m biracial but I have what most consider “Eurocentric” features so a lot of times people can’t really tell where I’m from.

Fast forward to a few days ago. We were watching 12 Years A Slave and I made some comments about how horrible slavery was. That’s when he dropped the bomb that I actually shouldn’t criticise slavery at all since I look white enough that I would’ve benefited from the system. (Honestly it felt like he wanted to say that for a long time). I asked him wtf he meant by that and he said me complaining about racism belittles the experience of black people.

I told him that I wouldn’t have benefitted from slavery at all since I’m literally 50% black despite my looks. He said that even if I didn’t directly benefit, I would’ve lived a “comfortable” life in that era. I asked how and he said slaveowners kept mixed women as mistresses so I would’ve spent most of my time being treated well and “popping out white babies”. He made it sound like it was a complete luxury. At this point I was so appalled that I called him an ignorant idiot and we started arguing.

He said that I’m just an “exotic looking white girl” who’s trying to feel oppressed and that I’m just as privileged as him. I told him that he really has no idea what he’s talking about and then he started ignoring me. We haven’t spoken for a few days (although he tried to initiate sex a few times and seems to be warming up to me again) and I really don’t know what to do. He’s never said something so ridiculous. I’m just so angry at his stupid comments and immaturity.

ANSWER: Yeah that was gonna be my comment. Everyone should criticize every form of slavery, because it's a fucked up thing that shouldn't exist at all. WTF.

QUESTION: I don't want to take part in my GF's (23F) sex ritual on our wedding night... but I still want to marry her

My post was capped because I didn't have a throwaway account but I'd like some advice:

So I'm (23M) getting married to my GF (23F) early next year if all goes to plan. I don't have a lot of family (I'm no contact with my dad for several years now.) She, however, has a huge extended family.

For the most part we get on great. They tend to be very loud and have huge personalities, which is sometimes hard for me to deal with since I've always been on the quiet side. But overall very warm and caring people.

Something weird I've noticed since we got engaged is that my GF's cousins sometimes make jokes about our wedding night. It's weird for them to joke about it since I'm pretty sure her family is aware we've slept together before since we share a bed at holiday gatherings and vacations.

A few nights ago we were discussing wedding plans and thinking about places to go on our honeymoon (if COVID-19 clears up and we can travel by then). My GF and I were brainstorming ideas when she tells me that we won't need a bridal suite right away. Obviously I ask why (we're getting married at a pretty nice hotel) and she says that she'd like for us to stay at her parent's house.

I don't really mind this - we're trying to save money for a house deposit anyway - but GF seems like she has more to say so I push for why she wants it. She tells me that there's a really old tradition in her family on the wedding night.

The husband and wife go into the master bedroom together and they are supposed to 'consummate' the marriage. The rest of the family are waiting outside the door so they can applaud them and cheer when they come out. Then a piece of the bed sheet is cut off and sewn into a big tapestry my GF's mother owns.

I think my GF saw I wasn't happy because she quickly told me that we wouldn't have to actually consummate the marriage if I felt uncomfortable and we could just pretend.

I don't want anything to do with this. I absolutely freaked and told her under no circumstances will I be doing that kind of thing in front of her whole family. When I came back from taking a walk to clear my head, she was now noticeably acting down and still is. I think she's also been texting her family about this because I received a text from her mother telling me that I 'don't understand the importance of family' and tradition yet and this kind of tradition has been around longer than I've been alive.

I don't know how I'm meant to go on from here. I really love my GF and she is the woman I want to spend my life with. I'm freaked out of course but she is my whole world. But how should I handle her family and navigate his 'tradition'?

TL;DR my girlfriend's family have a tradition where they stand outside the room on the wedding night. I still want to marry my GF but I don't want anything to do with this. Advice?

ANSWER: Tell them you'll do it, in return for a dowry of 100 head of cattle, a white stallion and a tract of arable land :)

QUESTION: Is it ok to buy my boyfriend flowers?

My boyfriend is kind of going thru a hard time, I know he's kind of sad so I wanna buy him a gift, he loves being spoiled.

Should I buy him flowers or is it too weird to buy a guy flowers? I know he likes roses but idk. Is it too odd? Would you like if your girlfriend bought you flowers?

Edit: wow! I never knew this is a common thing to do and I didn't know this will blown up like this! I did ask because I was unsure. Thank you all for commenting and sharing your sweet experiences, it made my day reading them. I will acknowledge all your advices with others gifts. ^^

ANSWER: I once bought my dad flowers, for no reason in particular. When I walked in with them he asked if they were for my mum, and got all giggly and embarrassed when I said they were for him. It was great.

QUESTION: My childhood "friend" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while I was sleeping. She told everyone and now my boyfriend is being ostracized from our friends. Except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place. [NSFW]

[UPDATE HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czqc2i/update_my_childhood_friend_went_through_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Throw away because of the sensitive subject matter.

So, there are three main players in the situation; my childhood friend, Sarah [31F], my long-time partner, John [34M], and myself [29F].

I've known that Sarah has had a crush on John for a long time. It's kind of an open secret in our group that no one talks about, but other than some longing looks and awkward interactions, Sarah has never crossed any boundaries. But because she does have this crush, she does stuff such as leaning over his shoulder to look at his phone screen and doing that playful shoulder slap that people do.

(My boyfriend and I had discussed it and decided, together, not to address it unless her crush became a problem since it seemed harmless.)

Apparently when she was doing that recently, she caught a glimpse of what looked like a photo of him having sex with me, so later, she went back and went through his gallery.

Which is full of photos and videos of him having sex with me while I'm sleeping. She took photos with her phone and then went and told everybody - except me!!! - that my boyfriend is assaulting me in my sleep. She apparently showed them her "evidence" as well.

I found this out the next day when another friend messaged me, incredibly concerned.

Now people are threatening to go to the cops, trying to stage interventions, and someone even told my dad I'm being abused.

But here's the thing - it's my fetish in the first place, not his. He took the photos and videos for me. The day after our "sessions", he sends them to me so I can watch them because it's better than porn.

But nobody believes me. They're accusing me of protecting my boyfriend and covering for a rpist. I don't know what to do. I'm scared that someone is going to call the police on him.

How do I fix my friendships and convince everybody that I'M the one who wanted it?

There is no text communication to exonerate my boyfriend, but I do have pages of internet history from my phone full of "limp porn" and sleeping fetish fantasy literature. I'm tempted to pull up my internet history and air my dirty laundry to fix this.

Please help. I'm so embarrassed, frustrated, and, honestly, really, really fucking mad.

Edit: since this needs to be said, YES, my boyfriend does have a passcode on his phone. It's a four digit code.

Edit edit:

- yes, I know she isn't my friend, which is why "friend" is in quotes.

- I have three friends on my side with this, so it's not everybody. Just mostly everybody. I was upset and generalizing last night.

- I am in the US.

- my boyfriend DOES HAVE A PASSCODE on his phone. Seriously. Stop blaming him. This is definitely not his fault.

Edit AGAIN since people just wanna try to blame my boyfriend and I: we attended a BBQ where EVERYBODY left their phones inside. We thought we were in a trusted, safe place.

You guys are being a little mean about this.

Edit (again):

Went to the police and will update when I can.

I went to the police last night, alone. After everything that was said, I was nervous about having John with me, just in case my consent wasn't enough for them.

Really. Y'all made me nervous.

I went in and told the police that pornographic videos of me were taken from my boyfriend's phone by a woman and then distributed around to two dozen people.

At first, the officer at the window was like, "I think that's a crime? Maybe? I've gotta call my supervisor."

That happened twice before the police were like, Okay, this might be a civil suite, but we don't know. We're going to take an information report and send an officer to speak with her to ask her to delete the photos and videos.

I gave my report and left. About fifteen minutes later, I got a phone call from the local PD. They told me that they thought my boyfriend might be the victim of a "sexploitation crime" based on my comments.

My comments being that Sarah has a vested interest in breaking apart my relationship to sexually pursue John and this interest was probably the reason she stole the videos in the first place.

They suggested finding a lawyer since law enforcement apparently has a shaky grasp on the laws in my state. Well, they told me that just in case it was a civil suite, I'd have a lawyer retained, and said lawyer could send a cease and desist.

So, that's about it.

A bunch of hemming and hawing and I don't knows. They'll "attempt" to get the videos deleted, but cannot seize the phone without a warrant.

I'm moving forward with both this and a social media announcement today.

ANSWER: How do you fix your friendships? Easy. Find new friends.

This girl had NO business going through YOUR boyfriends phone. She sounds like a fucking creep. She saw a glimpse of sex so she went through his phone? WHAT THE FUCK??

How did she gain access to his phone? Is there a password?

Contact the police about her distributing porn. Get them to confiscate her phone. She took pictures/videos of the videos of you during CONSENSUAL intercourse. And then showed people.

this is fucking crazy. best wishes OP.

QUESTION: My (26M) girlfriend (24F) found an engagement ring I was keeping safe for my friend until he was ready to propose. She thought it was for her and is furious that it wasn't.

I've been dating my girlfriend Laura for just over two years. We met as I was finishing my masters and she was in her last year of undergrad as we attended the same university. We have a pretty strong relationship overall, we get along well and have pretty similar views/goals in life, and I love her a great deal. She's definitely been the healthiest relationship I've ever had and I see a strong future with her.

This weekend has been awful, however. My best friend Rob came to me about a month ago and told me that he had a plan to propose to his long term girlfriend Grace of about seven years. The problem was that they live together and she's a very clean person, and he was afraid she might find the ring while cleaning before he was ready to propose. I offered to hide it for him at my house until he was ready, and he handed it over. I hid it in the back of my sock drawer and honestly kind of forgot about it until last Monday when he asked for it back. He (successfully!) proposed to Grace yesterday, and she posted a picture of the two of them on her instagram with the ring clearly visible.

Literally five minutes after she posted, Laura rang me absolutely fuming. She told me she'd found that ring three weeks ago, so why had I given it to Rob for Grace when I'd clearly chosen it especially for her? Was Grace mocking her with her post, just rubbing her nose into the fact that she'd "stolen" her ring? I tried to talk her down and explain that I'd just been keeping it safe for Rob and that I'd never intended to propose to her with it but that only made her more upset and she starting screaming at me that I'd absolutely built up her hopes and just destroyed them. She hung up on me, then texted me that I had three months to propose to her with "a better ring than Grace's" or she's going to break up with me.

Am I wrong for thinking this is a red flag? I know that she probably was really excited and I absolutely never meant to hurt her feelings with all of this, but the ring was never for her and she never should have known about it. We don't live together and I don't know what she was doing snooping in my drawers, or when she had the time to look in there, or what she was looking for her. More than that, I am 100% not ready for marriage. We've only been together for two years, haven't lived together, haven't even talked about marriage yet. I want to be living together for at least a year before we get engaged.

What do I do? I totally understand why she'd be upset but I just feel like she's invaded my privacy by looking through my stuff, and that I'm being treated badly for something that was never meant as a snub towards her. This is the first big fight we've had and I'm not sure if I'm just seeing red flags because I'm hurt, or if they're really there.

TL;DR: Girlfriend snooped and found a ring that I was keeping safe for a friend. She's angry that the ring wasn't for her, is demanding a proposal by Valentine's day or the relationship's off. Need help determining what my next move should be.

ANSWER: I think a brief period of irrationality might make sense. She handled things poorly and owes you an apology, but unlike other commenters, I'm not sure I'd tell you to run just yet.

Ignoring the snooping bit, for a moment:

Your girlfriend finds a ring, and naturally assumes the ring is for her. (Why else would you have tried to hide it in the sock drawer?!) ^^So ^^you ^^didn't ^^lose ^^it, ^^obviously, ^^but ^^this ^^wouldn't ^^occur ^^to ^^her.

For a month, she does her best to play it cool, but her heart is singing. She's picturing the ceremony, who she'll pick as her bridesmaids, the dress she'll wear.

Maybe she tells some close friends they'll be bridesmaids. They tell everyone else.

They try to figure out the next dinner you've planned with her so they can get your girlfriend a manicure... for those instagram proposal pictures she's a little embarrassed to be so excited about.

She tells her mother, who tells the whole family, and everyone's buzzing with anticipation. Her parents, if you've met them, expect you to get in touch soon to ask their blessing.

She's surprised how cooly you play things. You don't seem to have made any fancy dinner plans you tell her about, but she senses there's something off in how you behave. She knows you're thinking about the proposal too, as well as you try and hide it. Maybe you mention a trip to someone's hometown or something. As she sees it, everything is to be analyzed.

She assumes this proposal is going to be in the next month or so, and any time you make plans she wonders what your real plans are.

She pictures what your children might look like. If you're moving into a new place together. What couch you'll buy in your new place— what you'll put on the registry.

Then. She's in line at the supermarket, or sitting in her car in the driveway, and she's thinking about you— about your relationship. She's felt lost since finishing her undergraduate program. Without those academic life-tracks, things feel a little free-form. And that's scary.

But now... things seem a little clearer. Of course marrying you makes sense. You're the best relationship she's ever had.

Imagine how crushing it must be— how tied in knots her stomach is— when she sees the ring— her ring— on someone else's finger.

For a month, she's had her whole life figured out. In a moment, everything is instantly gone. She zooms in on the ring in a cold sweat, and it feels like you've broken up with her. She's temporarily unable to process things in the most rational way.

She processes her grief the way many people do—In a textbook [stages of grief] (https://dz9yg0snnohlc.cloudfront.net/new-understanding-the-stages-of-grief-1.png) way.

As soon as the initial paralysis of shock wears off, she calls you.

She's clearly in Denial.

She refuses to accept the ring was not for her, so she grills you on why you gave it away. Her heart is beating through her chest. It doesn't make sense to her. There's no way it was for another girl, it was in your dresser!

Next up, we've got Anger.

In a classic frustrated outpouring of bottled-up emotion, she screams at you for ruining the life she's mentally been settling into for a month. She's got a dozen people she needs to lose her dignity in front of, and countless others through the grapevine. And why? Because of you. (It seems.)

Then comes Bargaining.

Seeking in vain for a way out. Like when Kevin, from The Office, spills his chili, and tries to sweep it back into the pot off the floor. Or when Kevin, from The Office, crushes a turtle and tries to glue it back together.

She's trying to piece back together this fantasy she's had for a month, compounded by family and friends, at all costs. Silly as it is— pointless as it is— she's determined it make this work. So she gives you a crazy ultimatum. Crazy enough to work? Well, you came here, so maybe.

She's probably working through depression right now.

&nbsp;

I think she's totally valid in grieving. Marriage is a big deal, and in a way, she's going through a change not similar to a breakup right now.

I don't think she's valid in directing it at you. She snooped, and she got her punishment for it. A bigger punishment than she was expected, and a punishment that came completely out of her own actions.

Moving forward, I think you should treat this as though she's grieving over something entirely unrelated to you, because she is. (Though she doesn't seem to know it.)

Hopefully, with a little time, she'll cool off, rescind the ultimatum, and be deeply apologetic. And then you can cautiously move forward in the relationship.

If she doesn't apologize, for snooping, for her behavior over the phone, for everything— then I say run.

QUESTION: The way I (21f) met my boyfriend (20m) is a bit cringy. How do i tell people when they ask

So I met my boyfriend a year ago. I posted on my cities subreddit that I was lonely, i liked videogames and wanted to meet somebody.

I got about 50 messages all together. One guy responded that he liked fallout new vegas. I love that game so we exchanged messages about the game. I gave him my number and we texted all night. Our first phone call was over an hour.

He told me he was also lonely. I mentioned how i wanted a cuddle badly. He offered to cuddle me. We decided to have a cuddle date

We met up the following week. He picked me up from my local cafe and took me to his. We got into bed and cuddled for 3 hours.

That's how we met. I know it sounds a little cringy, but to me it wasn't. People have asked how we met and I've told the truth, though an abbreviated version, and people tend to give me a weird look.  I don't want to lie, but is there a way to say it without it coming across cringy?

ANSWER: Just tell people you met on the internet. It’s actually way more common now. I know of a couple who got married after playing World of Warcraft for years. Online social networking is a big part of our modern culture. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about.
You don’t have to tell people you cuddled the first time you got together if that’s the concern. You went out for coffee, got a long, the rest is history.

Edited to add: holy shit you guys really love the internet loving!

It’s 2019 guys, if you’ve found love, no matter how, and people AREN’T rooting for you, they suck!

QUESTION: Update: I (25F) agreed to be a surrogate for my sister and her husband (late 30s), but am regretting it now

Previous post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fve0oj/i_25f_agreed_to_be_a_surrogate_for_my_sister_and/

All the comments on my previous post showed me that I am way too young, dumb and ignorant with what I signed up with. I started researching actual lived experiences and I read so many horror stories that I've decided to not go ahead with being involved in any way, shape or form with helping them have kids.

In fact, I'm not even sure if I want to ever get pregnant after all the stories about 3rd and 4th degree tears, poop, miscarriages. I am clearly not in the right stage of life/maturity to even consider doing something of this magnitude.

The difficult part was mustering up the courage to call my sister to tell her my decision. I really look up to my sister and love her lots, and our family and religion has always been about helping others out where we can.

When I called her to tell her, we had a short convo at first where I basically said "sorry, can't do it but that doesn't mean I love you any less". She seemed sad but said she was happy to respect my decision and I thought that was it.

Then just last night, sister & BIL called me back over zoom. My sister was crying and begged me to reconsider, as both of them really wanted biological kids. BIL told me that they were really disappointed in me and hoped that I would find it within me to do this. When I told them my concerns, my BIL just said pregnancy & motherhood is a beautiful and natural process and that I was made for this.

I'm SO glad I did this over video call instead of in person, because I just hung up on them and faked having connection problems. I've been ignoring their texts so far and frankly I don't know what else to say.

But any way, thank you all from the bottom of my heart for opening my eyes :)

Edit 08/10: https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRAFE/comments/i777j0/an_update/

ANSWER: I would really like to know how they justify him wanting to sleep with you to concieve the child. And don't sorry about it. A loving sister would've never even put you in this position.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My [20] fiance's [27m] behavior while online gaming is destroying our relationship

I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu4pbd/my_20_fiances_27m_behavior_while_online_gaming_is/) a few weeks ago as I felt my fiance's behavior around video games had started to spiral out of control. A lot of the comments mentioned red flags like age difference, his other 'vices' like drinking and drugs, the fact that he might get violent with me, etc..

I spent a few days thinking about what others had said, and ended up reaching out to my cousin who I am quite close with and telling her a watered-down version of events. She expressed some concern and agreed that I should speak with fiance's brother. Fiance continued acting the same (no surprises there)in terms of gaming, with the yelling and late nights. That Sunday (several days after posting here) he became very upset because I went out to lunch with a few girls from school and he called me 4 times because he wanted me to pick up a takeout pizza and a case of beers and was upset and yelling at me, accusing me of being selfish because I didn't leave my girls lunch to get them. I got them on the way home and was met with accussations of being selfish and even cheating because I was 'late' and the beer was the wrong kind. I just shut down and went into the bathroom and cried for a while. I knew that something really needed to change.

The next day fiance left for work and I left for school just as usual. I called fiance's brother during my break between school and work and I basically told him that I had noticed some concerning behavior around the video games and that I was worried that it might spiral like the drugs and alcohol had. Fiance's brother pretty much agreed and stated he thinks fiance has an 'addictive personality' and might need some kind of professional help for this. Then, to my shock, he told me that fiance was at his house and asked if I wanted to speak with him. I was extremely taken aback because fiance was meant to be at work. I hung up with fiance's brother and called fiance's workplace. I was extremely nervous and felt like I was doing something sneaky and horrible, but I needed to know what was going on. I spoke with his manager and learned that he had QUIT his job weeks ago!! He told his manager his dad had a medical emergency and he had to move across the state to take care of him. WTF! So I guess he would just leave the house and fake going to work on the days he said he was working. After work I went home and fiance was gaming. I told him that we needed to talk and he tried to shut me down because he was in the middle of a match. He finally agreed to mute the game so he could hear me. I was literally shaking at this point and told him that I was worried about his gaming destroying the relationship. I said that I was seeing a pattern with the pills, the drinking, and the gaming. I said that I was worried about going through with the marriage when he treats me like a servant and is so disrespectful towards me and our apartment. At this point he unmuted the game and started ignoring me again. So I did something stupid and stood in front of the TV and said that I knew about him quitting his job to game all day. He FLIPPED OUT. He got violent and pushed me away from the TV. There was a lot of hitting and kicking (hit me with the controller). I got outside and was standing in the wet pavement with socks on for an hour or so as he locked the door behind me. He eventually came and apologized. He offered to get uber eats and watch a movie. I literally felt sick. I locked myself in the bathroom and just cried and looked at my county's domestic violence help page. He literally just kept gaming until I went to sleep.

The next day I couldn't go to school because I had a bad black eye, it was not something I could explain away. I wanted to just disappear. I got on the bus and went to the women's center. My cousin met me there and she was speechless at how bad I looked. I was very adament that I don't want to press charges or anything, I just needed help with the next steps of getting away. The social worker there was so nice and helpful, and didn't judge me at all. She helped me figure out how to get my stuff out of the apartment (cousin's husband and his friend went) and sat with my while I drafted and sent fiance a text stating that I cannot be with or marry someone who treats me this way. He called me nearly 20 times during the time I was at the center. I didn't answer the phone and the social worker encouraged me to block his number. For the short term I am staying with my cousin and her husband and I'm working on finding an apartment. Next month I'm meeting with a counselor who treats people who have escaped domestic violence through the center. I still feel hurt, sad, confused, and like I'm living in a nightmare. But for the past week or so I haven't been screamed at, sworn at, or had any of my things broken. I've also gone to bed before 11 every night. Someone on here sent me a PM saying that they thought fiance's behavior would escalate to him hurting or even killing me and they were right, so I'm just glad I was able to get away when I did.

I don't expect this to get a ton of attention but pretty much no one in my real life knows how bad it was and I just wanted to put this out here.

ANSWER: Take a picture of the black eye.  Keep it for the future, if you're ever feeling nostalgic, to remind yourself how he was willing to hurt you.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] Would it be wrong to ask if my wife is cheating?

Update 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gva7x5/update_im_31m_just_finding_out_that_my_wife_31f/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

The morning when she got home, her phone received a notification when she was sleeping. The messages were from an old college crush. Apparently she has been meeting him for sex instead of visiting her sister. This has been going on for over a year. She has met at his place, and our place. They were also emotionally involved. She asked him for more sex than she did with me our entire marriage. She managed to meet with him, whenever I was away at work, or with my friends. I confronted her, and she tried to lie about everything. I backed her in a corner with evidence, and she eventually came clean. She cried, and  tried apologizing serveral times, but I left the house. I had small suspicions over the years, but thought I was just being paranoid.

We haven't had sex since we've been married, and have been through counseling. Everything was great in our relationship otherwise. There was nothing wrong with her sex drive, she just enjoyed sex with other guy, and coming home to  paid bills. I am so depressed and angry. I did everything I could to be a great husband. I didn't deserve any of this. This will most likely cause trust issues in my future relationships.

Edit: We have no kids or own property together

ANSWER: This might seem like a small consolation, but there's a good chance her 'relationship' with this dude is going to fall apart now that their secret is out. If he actually wanted a real relationship with her she would have left you by now. Soooo, she's going to lose both of you. Because she fucking sucks. I hope she's miserable.

Sorry this is happening to you but you're going to be better off in the long run for having found out now. Before having kids with this horrible person.

QUESTION: My mum dumped my siblings on me and ghosted. I have no idea what to do.

Yeah. This is a doozy. I've been trying to post it since it happened but just haven't really been able to process it.

So I'm 23M, and I'm the oldest of five siblings, the others are 16M, 14F, 10F and 10M. Our mother is severely bipolar but very resistant to treatment and, to be frank, is an absolutely shit mother. I've done my best my whole life to raise my siblings since she clearly isn't going to, and I like to think I've done quite well. I managed to keep them out of the Care system most of the time, at least.

Two years ago, I finally moved out of my mum's house and started university. I stayed in the same town incase the kids needed me, but I decided I had to start putting myself first a little bit and I couldn't keep putting off my own life because my mum is a failure as a parent, you know? With the exception of a few minor incidents, it's actually gone rather a lot more smoothly than I thought thus far. I currently have a house with two other students from my uni, though one is currently back in her hometown for the lockdown.

So, the problem. Yesterday, there was a knock on the door around noonish. I wasn't expecting anyone but figured maybe it was the postman or my flatmate had ordered out for his lunch or whatever and opened it. To my shock, all four siblings are stood on the doorstep looking about as confused as I felt. 16yo informed me that Mum had dropped them off here without saying why or where she was going, and she was in the middle of a pretty intense manic episode and was just sort of rambling nonsenically instead of answering any questions. Of course I wasn't going to abandon the kids  so I let them in and have been trying desperately to get hold of mum ever since. I know she's getting my texts because I've been sending them on WhatsApp and it's showing me she's reading them. Also, when I call, it's ringing two or three times and then cutting out so she's clearly seeing the calls coming in and rejecting them, rather than it ringing out. I've tried reaching out to her friends with very similar results.

I don't know what to do. I don't have the space for 4 kids in the house and it's so unfair to my housemate (though bless his soul he's an absolute angel of a guy and keeps telling me not to worry and he's fine with it). I currently have the girls staying in other housemates vacant room (with her permission) and the boys are in my room with me. Obviously not ideal. I also frankly can't afford to take care of 4 kids all by myself. No idea what groceries are gonna look like from here on out. The kids haven't brought many belongings with them, so they don't have many clean clothes. 16M and probably 14F can get away with wearing my clothes if it comes to it, but I have no idea how I'm gonna clothe the twins if they're here for more than a few days. I don't want the kids going into the system if I can avoid it, I've had too many traumatic experiences with it myself. Can anyone wiser and calmer than I am offer some advice on what my options are here?

ANSWER: Call CPS, your siblings have something you didn’t have when you were part of the system. You.

CPS will see an adult sibling as a godsend. If you can point out what you would need to care for them until your mom can be brought back out of her manic episode, they will probably try to provide it.

That might include mom in medical care and you taking the kids home and caring for them there along with financial assistance to cover for groceries. Nothing special, but the goal isn’t for you to become a parent, the goal is for your mom to get treatment.

Focus on giving the CPS a solution that makes sense.

Good luck.

Update: mother of goodness this comment blew up. Thank you everyone for the awards. I hope OP can find the help he is seeking and that he and his siblings do well.

QUESTION: Update: My[M25] girlfriend[24] of 1.5 years broke up with me to be with my roommate[M25]. I just heard them through the wall.

It's been about a month since my post, unfortunately the mods deleted it from /r/relationships. I don't know if this one will be allowed but I figured I'd give an update to my situation.

Original Post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ykrq1/mym25_girlfriend24_of_15_years_broke_up_with_me/

> As the title says, we broke up. It was about 6 months ago and it was semi-amicable. We broke up because she was developing feelings for my roommate. Admittedly they are more compatible and he's an upgraded version of me, so I can see why it happened.
> 
> This isn't an evil thing, both asked my permission to start dating and don't do any PDA while I'm around. I still both consider them friends and I just want them to be happy.
> 
> For the most part, they are quiet at night. If I really listen I can hear whats going on, but they generally save it for when they are alone. Except for last night. We went out to the bar for his birthday and they got pretty drunk. I was the DD because I don't really drink. Anyway, last night we got home at close to 2am and all went to bed. I made sure they both got into bed, put water, advil, and buckets out just in case. I then put sleeping bags out for the other people and did the same. As I was brushing my teeth my ex walked in, hugged me and said she was sorry. She thanked me for always begin so nice and she promised to help me find a new girlfriend when I was ready. When I finally got to bed I could head muffled talking, mostly about how great the night was. Then it got quiet and then it started.

> I don't know how long it lasted, but it was louder than normal. I've been okay with the break up until now, I'm glad they're happy but last night I fell asleep crying.

> 
> Feel free to ignore this, I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm sad when I really think about the situation, but that's why I try not to.
> 
> TL;DR: My ex and roommate are sleeping together and they were loud last night.

Taking everyone's advice I announced that I was going to be moving out. My now ex-roommate pulled me aside and asked if it was because of his relationship. I told him yes, but I'm not going to make him sacrifice his happiness just for me. He decided to help me look for a new place and we found one. It's a one bedroom apartment that is closer to my work. My landlord is XRMs(ex-roommate) family friend, after XRM explained the situation I ended up getting a slight discount on rent for the first year.

XRM and XGF and a few other friends helped me move in. I had a house warming party and was specifically asked that I not prepare anything. 7 people came over with dinner, desert and booze. XRM and XGF also cleaned up after everyone finished eating. My XGF stayed a bit later than everyone and apologized for putting me through everything. She said she didn't really think about how it made me feel. She told me that she's talked to a few friends about finding me someone and that she had set up a blind date for me. It was great. We've gone out a few times since our first date.

The past few weeks have been the best in a long time, I never really realized how bad my situation was. Obviously everything isn't perfect, and I still have to work on my self esteem and standing up for myself but I'm in an infinitely better position than before.

TL;DR: I moved out and started dating a new girl.

ANSWER: If it's in the wrong sub or gets removed I just wanna say I'm glad you found happiness. You sound like a truly nice person and I wish you many a good karma +1

QUESTION: UPDATE - I (27F) have romantic and confused feelings for my coworker (30F). We have more or less been living together since COVID started and she is openly gay. I don't know if i am, and i am terrified i will lose my only friend if i mess this up.

Here was my original post: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/itnt00/i_27f_have_romantic_and_confused_feelings_for_my/)

I wanted to say thank you all you guys gave me a push to try something that I was on the fence about. For the first time in a long time I feel happy and content. I managed to sort my feelings out and realized that this is what I want.

We went on a few dates, and it went well, nothing huge since we are both leery of COVID. But I was able to present myself as her girlfriend, to her circle of friends and I had no issues with that. Most of her friends were very supportive.

Last night I pretty much told Laura everything I had said in my reddit post, and she fully accepted what I said, and seemed happy. I am also really glad I told her because apparently after the cottage she felt that I was not interested in her as anything more then a friend, and was going to move on emotionally.

She also has given me a drawer, a copy of her house keys, and a toothbrush and has told me I can stay there whenever I want, and if I really wanted to I could just move in since we have basically been living together almost since COVID started.

I will be honest I also realized that I don't know a whole lot about Laura, and she was completely comfortable telling me anything and everything. Which made me feel very comfortable.

We also talked about work, and she said she is going to transfer to a different team, just to avoid any complications from that.

I also told my parents about what is happening, and my mom was okay with it, however my dad was extremely supportive, and told me it didn't matter I am his daughter and that is all that matters.

The only thing still bothering me revolves around intimatcy/sex, which are things I don't know about. I told Laura about my confusion around that and she has assured me not to worry and when the time comes it will be fine.

I am probably rushing into stuff too much, but I feel happy for the first time. So thank you for helping me reddit.

TL;DR; I am finally able to find happiness, and it is working out. So thank you reddit

I need to sleep, but i will answer what i can tomorrow thank you for all the positive comments, it feels great.

ANSWER: Laura wants to take it slow because you are new to these feelings, she is doing the right thing. There is no need to stress about sex all the time, you should only start when your ready. And even when ready make sure to take a slow to make sure you are comfortable.

QUESTION: (UPDATE) My Roommate's (21F) Parents keep letting themselves into my (21F) apartment with the spare key my roommate gave them.

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bl31eh/my_roommates21f_parents_keep_letting_themselves/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

RM= roommate's mom   R=Roommate

I came back from my morning run around 7 am this morning, and RM and R were in the kitchen making some coffee. She has never been there this early before.

I decided to talk to them about everything prior to going to class. I atarted off with "hey auntie, can we talk?" (In brown culture everyone is called an aunt) and these are some points I listed:

1. I appreciate that she has been cooking and cleaning, but I want to do that on my own. I love to cook and felt that I was never allowed in my own kitchen. I also told her that I want to do my own laundry and clean my room myself.

2. I don't want her in my room. I reminded her that I talked to her about this when it first happened, and that's why I put the lock on the door.

3. I told her that if she wants to be with R, to let R text me and lmk that RM would be in the apartment.

They expressed understanding and I hugged it out with RM.

Before going to class, I put a load of laundry. My friend is having a birthday dinner today, and I decided to wear this cute white dress with an open back (my mom even got me this dress since she thought it was so cute) and tossed it in the washer so it could be fresh for tonight. I asked RM multiple times if she was planning on doing laundry today, and she said no. I told her that I would be back around 1, and she can do laundry when I finish mine later this afternoon if needed (I didn't want her touching my clothes). She was okay with it and said R didn't have laundry today. Cool. I left feeling really relieved, but I still locked my bedroom door.

I got back to my apartment about half hour ago, and I couldn't find my white dress. As soon as I came home, R looked nervous. My clothes were in the dryer, and I didn't do that for a fact. RM states that I put them in the dryer and just forgot. Ughhh. I locked myself in my room, and I know she probably took the dress as it was something she wouldn't approve of.

When I was in my room, I heard RM talking to R in our language, she told her daughter something along the lines of "idk why she's freaking out about that dress. In India, escorts and prostitutes wear those kinds of clothing." And she went on to tell R that I won't find a husband wearing stuff like this.

I honestly think she wanted me to hear all that.  is she is seriously just being a passive aggressive bitch to me rn? I'm trying so hard not to break down and cry.

I'm heading over to my parents right now and I'm telling them everything when they come back home tonight. I'll keep you posted.

UPDATE 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bm1ivc/update_2_my_roommates_21f_parents_keep_letting/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

ANSWER: Yeah, that’s a “your mom’s key is revoked” kind of situation. Not to say her mom is banned from the place, but she just can’t come in and make herself at home at her leisure. It’s not her house.

Definitely tell your parents, they will probably have more luck discussing this with the mom than you have.

QUESTION: [Update] I [M 32] ruined Christmas and I have no regrets.

I wanted to update the kind people who took the time to give me advice and affirmation last Christmas when I really needed it. I wanted to provide an update how Christmas and the year went.

ORIGINAL:  ([Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9jdy7/i_m_32_ruined_christmas_and_i_have_no_regrets/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf%EF%BF%BC)) Long story short.. I’m half-Korean and half-white. My white family has always been rude to my mom and treats her as an outsider. Every year my mom brings gifts for everyone and gets nothing in return. She never causes drama but gets treated like crap and I think it’s because of their own biases. My white grandma is 80 and the last grandparent alive. She is the only reason we get together with them. After 32 years I finally blew up on a rude family member (my aunt) who disrespected my mom... with a few expletives. I blew up in front of the whole family demanding that the behavior needs to stop. My actions ended Christmas because everyone left quickly after. I felt liberated for standing up for something I’ve been feeling for years. Last year I was looking for advice on how to manage the fallout of what I did.

UPDATE: The year has been interesting.. Immediately after Christmas I sent an apology letter to my aunt. It went against some advice but my letter requested to not let the situation impact the family. I left the lack of any relationship in her hands and shared everything can change if she gives my mom a little more respect. I decided to send a letter because she lives three hours away and I’ve never spoken to her on the phone more than 30 seconds. I didn’t think a phone call would help or fix the situation, especially after I blew up.

After Christmas I apologized to my grandma for what I did. I let my grandma know I sent an apology letter to my aunt. My grandma told me she is and always wants my mom to feel like she is part of the family. I could tell my grandma was on the verge of crying when she said that. My grandma told me blowing up was not ok but understood why I did it. Hearing that felt really good.

In regards to the letter. I got no response. My aunt denied ever getting it. We know my aunt got the letter because when my grandma confronted her about last Christmas my aunt went into a rant about several things I mentioned in my letter. My grandma did tell my aunt what she did was wrong and she needed to change.

In February my aunt didn’t come to my Grandmas 80th birthday party. She told other family members she didn’t want to “cause an argument” so she didn’t want to come. My aunt didn’t come to my grandma’s on Mother’s Day dinner because she supposedly had to work. My family didn’t get together the rest of the year.

Thanksgiving and Christmas came. Things are not perfect but Thanksgiving and Christmas went really well this year. I was going to post after Thanksgiving but the gathering was smaller than usual and I wanted to see how Christmas went. During Thanksgiving and Christmas everyone was very kind to my mom. It felt like everything shifted. Everyone spoke to her differently and it feels really good. My mom got to help in the kitchen for the first time ever. I know that sounds dumb but my mom has always wanted to help cook because she loves to cook. It was the first time she didn’t spend the whole day in the living room.

At one point during Thanksgiving my mom asked me to help her dry dishes. While we were washing/drying dishes my mom was smiling the entire time. At one point my mom stopped putting dishes away and randomly hugged me. We laughed and had fun the entire time. No one argued. No nasty remarks. My mom was treated as an equal and it felt really good.

In regards to the aunt that I yelled at last year. She came late to Thanksgiving.  So late, we were eating when she arrived. At Thanksgiving my mom did initiated the first interaction with my Aunt. She was not very conversational but polite to my mom. My aunt didn’t look at me the entire time. When she arrived I went to say hello and she turned away and kept her distance the entire time. She basically stated in a different room the entire time. She also left early and was the first to leave. The best part? I don’t care. I apologized and left future in her hands. If she treats my mom well she will get nothing but respect in return.

Christmas was as if nothing happened. My aunt didn’t really talk to me but she was incredibly nice to my mom. I’m ok with that. Both my parents said they have never seen my aunt so nice before. My mom got to help in the kitchen just like Thanksgiving. This year for the first time it felt like my mom was an equal in the family. Everyone was incredibly nice. No arguments, snide remarks or drama. I regret yelling but it changed everything. I think it put everyone on notice they need to change.

There was a lot of questions and comments about my dad. The comments was hard to hear but true. It helped me reflect on what my dad has/hasn’t done. The truth is my dad has been the glue of the family for years.. he spends so much time being the middle man and trying to repair issues. At times it’s been at the expense of my mom. Regardless, my dad’s lack of actions over the years doesn’t make it right. Over the summer I told my dad what I felt. I told him that I was disappointed in him and that his family has never been kind to my mom. I told him he should have done more. My dad didn’t take it well but he told me I did the right thing. My relationship with my dad is complicated. I know though I’m not going to make the same mistakes he has. We are different people and I will do whatever is needed.

If you’re reading this and have a similar situation. If you have people or someone rude in your family, try to take a moment to sit someone down. Hear them out and try to do the right thing from the start. When you have the convo, stay calm. If they are not willing to hear you.. then make it known. Blowing up could have gone either way and I’m lucky it fixed things. Try to loop in other family members before or after so they understand your reasons and can back you for your choice. My post last year gave me affirmation what I did was right, follow your heart.. it might fix years of issues.

TLDR: Last Christmas after witnessing years of rude behavior towards my Korean mom I blew up on a my aunt in front of the entire family. I demanded the behavior need to stop... with a few expletives. After I blew up it ruined Christmas. I tried to take the high road and apologize. The year was quiet and My aunt avoided the family until Thanksgiving/Christmas. Everything with my family has shifted and my mom is treated really well for the first time that I can remember. I’m glad I did what I did. Thank you for the advice.

[Update: 2021] Because of COVID, my grandma is in her 80s, and in declining health, we don’t do Holidays together. In early 2021 My brother and SIL moved back from Korea during COVID in 2020. We made Christmas amazing. My SIL is from Korea and we made Christmas amazing for her. We make her a full member of our family. We haven’t even seen my fathers side. Now we do Christmas with just my parents, no extended family. My parents cook Thanksgiving and Christmas together. I feel bad my Grandma celebrates with only one aunt (who looks after her). In some ways I’ve come realize she contributed to the dynamics too.

I truly love the holidays now. I’m now seeing someone and our families hang out. In some ways my mom gets to be the head female for the family, she doesn’t have to hide anymore.

ANSWER: That was nice to read. Glad your mom finally feels like part of the family! Good for you for standing up for her. Yelling may have made things tense at the time, but something had to be done and you handled it well otherwise.

QUESTION: I (36M) think my wife of 8 years (31F) is having an affair with our couples therapist (42M)

Throw away for obvious reasons.

So my wife and I have been having some communication issues for about a year or so and started to see a marriage counselor about 7 months ago.  At first it’s good and we start communicating better.

About three months ago she starts going to extra sessions for “self care”. Alone.

Around this time our couples sessions that happen with all three of us together (about three months ago) become much more one sided with me being the “bad guy” and the two of them kind of teaming up on me.

She starts telling her friends about “Danny” and how great he is for her “self care” but if her friends seem interested in making an appointment she says “he only does couples” or “he’s not taking new clients”which I think is weird because we have normally referred to him as “Dr. Soandso” and now he is suddenly “Danny”.  (I don’t know if he is actually not taking new clients.)

Around the time they started teaming up on me in the sessions (about three months ago) was around the last time my wife and I were intimate.

There have been a couple of other weird coincidences that I thought were puzzling, but three nights ago my wife said she had an emergency with her sister and had to go see her right away.  She went to the bathroom and showered and put on perfume and left.  It was about 9;30 at night and that seemed REALLY odd to me.

About a half hour later I tracked her iPhone and the location showed up as his office.

When she came home 3 hours later, I asked how her sister was and she kind of gave a weird “oh you know Jenny, drama queen” kind of answer.

I think I’m going to confront them in the session this Thursday.

ANSWER: [EDIT] I'm not here to "stick it" to the wife or lover, if my post conveyed that and you took it to be a reasonable attitude it is not. [EDIT]

Do not confront them.

Do not let them know you suspect anything.

Consider the advice from u/der_takin_ma_ and follow that logic; your therapist is not going to lose their job for you if they can help it.

Consider all the awful places this could go and your only proof seems to be a hunch.

It's their word against yours, and they're already risking their career if they're having an affair.

Report your therapist, hire a private investigator, and protect yourself by taking note of any strange occurrences and putting away a savings your wife can't access.

Do this now.

[EDIT] OP seems to have taken the self-destructive path, so I will now update this comment with good suggestions from other users.

u/mister_brain - It’s much more effective if his lawyer hires the P.I. or reports the therapist.

u/FluffyFunnyCat - It's only hiding assets if he doesn't disclose them during divorce proceedings. You're allowed to have your own accounts, you're just not allowed to lie about them in court. She still may be entitled to half, depending on where they live and other variables. Now if he  started spending it on frivolous things or giving the money away to drain their accounts out of spite or malice, then yea she could definitely sue him for her share. - [This was in response to a query as to the legality of putting aside some money. Also brought up by u/GBAPSDANN and u/Shirobon-]

u/YourTherapistSays - Only that she lied about a session - not objective in the sense that they’re having an affair. 
We obviously don’t have all the facts here - were individual sessions offered to OP as well? Is it possible OP is abusive and therapist is working with the spouse to create a safety plan for leaving? A stretch given the provided info but also not uncommon. We just don’t know. 
It’s important to remember there are three sides to every story: my side, your side, and the truth. - [Response to a claim the late night session was proof positive. There are so damn many variables in life, this is a healthy attitude to adopt in general.]

QUESTION: How do I (F27) tell my boyfriend (M29) that I'm not going to cancel my birthday dinner? Am I wrong for not wanting to cancel?

For context: My boyfriend loss his previous girlfriend to cancer in 2016. I'm his first relationship since she passed away.  In a sad coincidence, my birthday and the anniversary of his previous GF passing away are the exact same date. We have been together for 10 months so this is the first of my birthdays since we got together.

My birthday is next weekend and as every year my parents want me to visit them for my birthday and have dinner together with my grandma. I'm only child and so is my mom, so I'm grandma's only grandchild, so they always insist in celebrating my birthday together even thought I'm an adult and I live in another city.

When I told my boyfriend about my plans and asked him to visit my parents with me he got mad at me for planning  a birthday dinner with my parents on the same date his GF passed away. I felt like an idiot for not thinking about that, and I felt bad so I told him he didn't have to come if he didn't felt comfortable going to a dinner in that date, that I was going alone.

He still got mad at me for planning to leave him alone in that date. He insisted I cancelled the plans with my parents. At first I felt really bad thinking about leaving him alone in what is a hard day for him, so I agreed to cancel the dinner. But later when I was about to call my parents to cancel it I decided  against it. My grandma is 95 years old, I don't know for how much longer she is going to be with us, and I don't want to regret cancelling a chance to see her because I don't see her very often and she would be heartbroken if I cancel.

Besides my birthday and her anniversary are obviously going to fall on the same date every year, so if I accept cancelling now he might expect me to do that every year and I don't want to stop celebrating my birthday.

How do I tell my boyfriend I change my mind about cancelling my birthday dinner without making it look as if I don't care about his feelings? Also, am I wrong for not wanting to cancel, I know that day must be horrible for him.

&#x200B;

Edit: I didn't expect this post to have such a huge response. I'm still reading the comments, but thank you for all your inputs.

Edit 2:

1. My birthday is on March 1st, not Feb 29 (that would be cool, but i wasn't even born in a leap year).
2. I could try to re-schedule, I'm 100% sure my grandma is available every day, but I don't know about my parents, they have quite a busy schedule. Besides, it's easiest to meet up on a Sunday than any other day.
3. I know my boyfriend was seeing a therapist for some time to deal with all of these, but this was before I met him.
4. Yes, the age gap between my grandma and I is quite big. I was born in 1993 and she was born in 1924. Both her and my mom were mothers in their late 30s, hence why both my mom and I are only childs.

ANSWER: It’s only been 10 months you’re together. I’d go see your family. How has he coped the past couple of years?

QUESTION: Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.

I literally do not know what to do. This is long, TL;DR at bottom.

My wife and I have been married for 3 years, together for 6.  She's always been one of the most amazing people I've ever met. No huge fights, love languages match up, and we're both fairly active people which has been why we've always had a really strong relationship for so long. That's why this is so difficult for me.

We've both been doing pretty well in our careers the last few years.  She's in marketing and I work independently as an IT consultant, allowing me to set my own hours and be pretty flexible.  We decided last year that we wanted to start a family, her most likely keeping her job full time and me scaling back to part time.  We've both been anxious but pretty excited to have our own kids.

Long story short, I was diagnosed with azoospermia last December.  Blockage in the pipes just meant I wasn't actually producing any sperm when ejaculating. It's curable with surgery thankfully, and we finally got it scheduled this July.  She's got a high sex drive as do I, so we've still been very sexually active, but there should've been no way I could have gotten her pregnant.

She missed her period this week.  I couldn't imagine that she might actually be pregnant, right?  The babies are bottled in until they get the blockage out.  She took three tests though, and sure enough they're all positive.

At first I was stunned, because this shouldn't be possible. She's never been unfaithful to me in the past and never given me a reason not to trust her. I'm not the jealous type, but I'm literally stuck.  The doctors said this couldn't happen.  And I can't believe my wife would jeopardize the future we've been so excited for over some fling when we seem to have such a great emotional and physical connection.

My wife's been ecstatic. She's given no indication of any guilt or worry that she may have cheated. She was so excited when she first found out that I didn't express my worries then.  But she left for work and now I feel completely torn.  What if she did cheat?

Looking back now there's a few tiny things that didn't seem to be an issue but now have me wracking my brain for clues.  Her job often has her taking clients out for dinner and it's not uncommon for her to get back later in the evening. She definitely had a busy last few months, but that's not uncommon for her job. She always wears one of the same two perfumes, but she came back one night smelling completely different.  I remember seeing a text message on her lock screen of just a winky face, a different time, but assumed it was one of her girlfriends.

Fuck man I don't know what to do.  I set up an appointment on Monday to see if there's any chance it could be mine.  If it is mine and I accuse her of cheating I feel like the world's biggest asshole. But she's coming home in a few hours and I don't know what I'm going to say to her, I can't stop thinking of these small things that may have been her cheating and I just didn't see it.

Do I wait until the doctor appointment Monday before talking to her, or do bring up these insecurities while she's celebrating the pregnancy? I'm worried I won't be able to hide what's going on.

TL;DR:  Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July.  Wife got pregnant anyways.  It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery.  Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating.  Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.  Want to wait until Monday, but don't think I can hide it.  What do I tell her?

Edit:  I should add I've been cheated on before.  Our relationship has been pretty healthy, but that old fear is creeping back in now.  I'm not sure how to just wait until the appointment.

Edit I really hope yall are right that some freak sperm made it past.  My wife's coming home though in an hour and I have to decide if I'm going to put on a happy face until Monday or not.

Edit She texted saying she's going be home late

This is bringing up some old emotional scars I think and is just fucking with me.  I'm usually never this insecure or uncertain about being straightforward.  I think I need to just find some way to bring it up without being accusatory.

UPDATE: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c225le/update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids/?

ANSWER: I literally just studied this!

Ok so although you’ve been diagnosed with azoospermia it means that when they looked at your semen in the lab it didn’t have any sperm in it.  However, you produce a lot of semen and the lab only looks at a tiny fraction of it which usually gives a good response.  Usually you would repeat several times before concluding its azoospermia, although just because the lab didn’t see any sperm it can just mean that you had an incredibly low count so none of their samples from the sample you have showed any.

This doesn’t necessarily mean that for example in a normal ejaculation a normal guy would have 30-900million sperm which is usually about 15million per mL.  It’s possible you have maybe... even 1000 sperm per mL and you would still be diagnosed with azoospermia as it would not be expected that the likelihood of getting pregnant at the right time with only 1000 sperm would be probable: BUT IT CAN HAPPEN.

Even if you only had 1 sperm per mL of ejaculate you could still get her pregnant but you would definitely never find that 1 sperm as a biomedical scientist in a lab.

Good luck and happy fatherhood.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My ‘boyfriend’ (27) kept on driving to find somewhere to have sex even though I (23f) was basically having what I would say was a panic attack

LAST EDIT: I just want everyone to know that I have read every single comment that’s been posted on here and I would love to reply to every single one of you with my eternal thank you but I can’t, so please know that I really appreciate what everyone has said from the bottom of my heart ♥️

There’s still a handful of people which are too blind to see that these type of situations happen on a daily basis. It’s not “high school drama” as one has said, it’s real life and it happens to people every day. I don’t have to “post proof” just because a few people don’t believe me and I’m sincerely sorry that you feel it necessary to make your unwanted opinions known. Thank you for your time anyway but please know it’s not welcome here

Edit: I’m honestly lost for words. You’ve all collectively made me cry with all your amazing comments. I keep saying this over and over but I’m truly, honestly, wholeheartedly so thankful for all of you and your words mean more to me than any of you will ever know ♥️

Edit 2: a lot of you are suggesting I get a gun or carry some sort of weapon but being in the UK, I can’t legally do any of these things except carry my stupid pasta fork around with me

It might be a bit long as quite a bit happened

I want to say thank you to everyone that really truly helped me so much in my first post, especially u/1disposabledick and u/tyedyeballoon, you both gave me so much amazing advice and I literally owe you both my life. Thank you. Everyone else as well, I mean it from the bottom of my heart. I may not have been able to follow ALL of what you said but I tried for the most part

My update:

I text my ‘boyfriend’ the day after my last post and didn’t give any explanation at all, just that this was the end now well and truly and I wouldn’t hesitate to call the police if he came round. He didn’t reply to me. He didn’t ring, text, come to my house or anything. He hadn’t got in contact with me at all and the last time I spoke to him was when we were on the way back that night

I was really suspicious and a bit worried because I had no clue what was going to happen. I knew for a fact that he wouldn’t have just accepted it and it be done just like that.

In the fear that came with this silence, I had a bit of a breakdown and told my mum and dad everything that had happened including that night. Both of them went absolutely spare and they both kept apologising saying they couldn’t believe they hadn’t seen it sooner

3 days later, he came to my house. My parents were out with my dog, it was the first time they’d both gone out together and left me home alone since I told them. They’d probably been out about 15 minutes before my front door was being pounded on and he was screaming to come in. I rang my dad immediately and was crying to him and saying that he was here and he said that they’d be back home as soon as they could and they’d ring the police in case I couldn’t

My front door is mostly glass so eventually he just smashed it and let himself in. I had never seen anyone this angry before, he was swearing and shouting and all I could do was stand there and sob, it was really pathetic now that I look back on it but I truly didn’t know what to do

He punched the mirror that was hanging in the hallway and it smashed to pieces and then he punched me in the face, I literally fell back to the floor with my nose bleeding endlessly

My mum and dad came home and my neighbours were there and they were pulling him back and there was a lot of shouting and my mum was still on the phone to the police. They turned up minutes later and all of them struggled to get him into the police car

My mum took me down to A+E but I had to go in on my own because of all the virus stuff and they scanned my head and X-ray. I have a massive black eye now but no broken nose luckily. I was going to attach a picture but I don’t think I want my face on here now

The police were at my house when I got back and I had to relay loads of shit that had happened and what led up to this. And they’ve said that if I see or hear from him I need to ring a certain number straight away. This is the start of my restraining order which both my parents agreed I should get, especially now

He’s text me a few times since some really nasty messages, saying he was glad he punched me and he’d “been waiting to do it for a while” amongst other stuff but I haven’t been responding and instead just logging it all down with the police

I’m conflicted with how I feel. I wish it didn’t have to get to this point and I wish I’d seen things a lot sooner or done something more about it instead of giving in but on the other hand I’m glad that I can start to put this behind me. I’m crying a lot currently and my face is sore but i think that’s just down to the state things have been recently

A couple of people asked me where my fear of being out in the rain came from and I’ve decided to share why to give a bit more clarity of the seriousness of the situation. My sister and I were in a car crash back in 2018. It had been heavily raining during the ride and a lot of the roads were flooded. Her car swerved and she is no longer with us, it breaks my heart. He knew this but didn’t care

Again, thank you to everyone that gave me so much amazing advice, I honestly can’t thank you all enough because I genuinely think that you’ve all saved my life. Thank you truly x

ANSWER: This needs to be higher. He obviously watched her parents’ house for days to be able to coincidentally show up the minute they left together. OP, a restraining order is all well and good but now is not the time to let your guard down. Don’t be going anywhere alone.

QUESTION: My (25M) girlfriend (24F) destroyed my tanks of fire ants.

Before you ask, no, she doesn't have a problem with me keeping ants. I'm quite sure that's not the reason.

We had an argument earlier today. Later I left to get groceries and let her chill out. Came back, soon saw the state of the ant room (spare smaller bedroom where I keep them).

(guess I should give a crash course on ant farms so this makes sense: Most have two compartments. One emulates the underground colony with tunnels and chambers where the queen nests, then this is connected by a tube to a second part that emulates the above-ground world where the workers go to forage for food. Hope that makes sense. There's plenty of cool videos on Youtube of people's setups)

So anyway, my girlfriend had disconnected the two compartments, dumped the colony on the floor (so that's soil + ants) and dismantled the sides of the outworld part to leave the contents all over the place. I am lucky everything is plastic or there'd probably be broken glass everywhere too.

I've had these ants for over 2 years. There's hundreds of them. I have put hours and hours of work into growing this colony and crafting their environment. I know it will sound weird or stupid to some people but it's my hobby, similar to keeping fish in aquariums. Its like if someone dumped out your water and threw all the gravel and ornamentals around. Plus leaving your fish to die. Except while I'm sure some of the ants have died, plenty are still alive for now. They have free fucking range of the entire house now.

I am FURIOUS. Red fire ants are an invasive species that's gained a foothold in some parts of the country. Luckily not our part because of climate but as long as they're alive they'll sting any unsuspecting person who comes into contact with them or is walking barefoot. They can cause serious allergic reactions in some people. This can be FATAL. Ants are drawn to dark places so they'll very likely go into the walls. And don't worry, yes I've thoroughly alerted the other tenants in the house what happened and how to protect themselves. This is serious shit. And my girlfriend could not be fucked to think of anyone else as long as she got her "revenge".

I'm just so pissed because I've put so much research, always took utmost care safely handling them, never even had an accident and now it's all trashed. They're loose not because I did something wrong but because she went psycho. But everyone will still think it's my fault. Lets be real, insects and other exotic pets especially ones that pose a risk if they escape or are handled improperly aren't exactly looked well upon. The owner is always held responsible.

She did apologize. She said she just "got carried away" because she was upset. But I just don't know if I buy that because if she honestly had no control in the moment then why were my ants the only thing to end up destroyed. In a really thorough way at that. She knows it's importance to me. It's not like she just attacked my old books from college or something.

Also she'd been wearing shoes and gloves. That tells me the planning was there to not expose herself while exposing me and everyone else.

What the fuck should I do? I would honestly kick her out over this but it wouldn't be in the interest of public health because we're obviously quarantining together. Everyone is hunkered down. Right now we're in separate rooms as I am trying to clean this shit up best I can and she shut herself in the bedroom. No idea what to do now, I'm still in shock she did this. I'll need to fumigate the whole apartment to be sure they're gone and who knows when that will be able to happen.

PS living together for almost a year, dating for more than 2, if it matters.

TL;DR: In reaction to an argument my girlfriend destroyed my fire ants habitat while I was shopping. She apologized but I don't know if I can get over this or fully trust her. How should I handle it with her?

ANSWER: Wow. As someone who keeps many reptiles and insects, I would be absolutely devastated if someone destroyed the tanks, let alone endangered my animals. I know how much time, effort and care goes into the maintenance of these animals, especially ants, and I'm so sorry this happened to you. I don't have much advice relationship wise, but if it was me I know I'd want nothing to do with someone capable of such reckless behaviour. Good luck and I hope you can salvage your colony.

QUESTION: My 16 year old daughter found out that she has endometriosis, the idea that she may be infertile has really been affecting her and I don’t know how to help

Hello Reddit. My 16 year old daughter recently found out she more than likely has endometriosis. Her doctor didn’t wanna do the surgery to officially confirm it and instead just prescribed birth control to help with her extremely painful periods. She said the surgery was unnecessary and she wouldn’t put my daughter through the pain because of that and just kind of swept it under the rug.

It very well could not be endometriosis but something is definitely going on which is why the doctor came to the conclusion of it. Her periods are sometimes so painful that she screams and cries my name and calls me “mommy” and begs for help when she gets the pains. There’s been a few times where she’s been in the store and had to leave because she felt a big cramp coming on, which is why we took her to the doctor in the first place. Not to mention there are times when she literally wets her pants because she gets SUCH a strong uncontrollable cramp. It’s very heartbreaking seeing my baby girl go through that stuff.

As soon as we got home from the doctors office she instantly reached to Google and found out that 30-50% of women with it are infertile. And that those who do conceive a child are 80% more likely to miscarry than those without endometriosis.

When she found out she cried for nearly an hour. Sobbing, hyperventilating crying and it broke my heart. She told me she didn’t want kids anytime soon but knowing that someday she might not have any at all really hurt her.

I tried telling her that there are other options if she does happen to be infertile but that didn’t help. She googled the cost of IVF and cried because it’s so expensive. She told me that it just hurts that she can’t carry her own kid.

She’s a very family oriented girl, loves children and has been babysitting since she was 10. But she’s really changed since finding this out and I don’t know how to help her. I have 5 children and she mentions that every time I try and help. It almost seems as if she’s mad at me somehow.

She seems to be envious and loathe her brother and his wife as they recently had a baby. She blocked them on any social media and refuses to see them anymore. She doesn’t want to babysit anymore because she says it’s “pointless to gain a skill she won’t use in the future”.

There are days that she laughs and makes horrible jokes about it, and days that she cries and questions whether or not her body is broken and useless. I don’t know how to help her. Nothing I say gets through, it breaks my heart. How can I help her?

ANSWER: Get her a professional. She should talk to someone who knows about the condition as well as someone that isn’t related to her.
She’s not going to tell you the deepest,darkest feelings but she absolutely must tell someone for her own sake.

QUESTION: Update to: "My (27M) GF (22F) of a year slept with another guy while we were "taking it slow" a month into dating me": I broke up with her

[Original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gsb95j/my_27m_gf_22f_of_a_year_slept_with_another_guy/)

As the title says, I decided to break up with Jess. I kept going back and forth because I was worried I was throwing away a great thing over something that happened in the past. But the problem is I thought I really wouldn't able to get past it.

I can't help what she did was really shitty. Yes, I know that technically she did not cheat. But she knew that I wanted a real relationship and that we were potentially moving in that direction. But, meanwhile she expected me to plan (and pay for) interesting dates, court her and prove that I was "worthy" of her while she happily hooked up with randos who basically did nothing but show an interest in fucking. Fuck that.

In a follow up conversation it also came up that her friends sort of guided her to act like this. That she should basically allow herself to have fun and to keep her casual options open but with me to "make me work for it" and show that I wasn't just looking for sex but was capable of being a committed partner. The whole thing just seems so manipulative and ugly, and these were also mutual friends who I considered to be nice girls and now my friends as well. Now I never want to see any of those pieces of shit ever again.

Anyway, I know this is starting to sound a bit like a rant lol, but I felt pretty pissed off and basically called it quits. The actual breakup was actually quite unpleasant. No harsh words were exchanged, but Jess cried and we kind of talked about some happy times. I guess that's the hardest part about this, like I don't think she is a bad girl and maybe we could have had a nice future together like we did over the past few months. But in the end, I do think I made the right decision, I want to be with someone who treats me well from the get-go, not someone who manipulates me while playing games just so she can have her cake and eat it too.

ANSWER: >he whole thing just seems so manipulative and ugly ...  
>  
>I want to be with someone who treats me well from the get-go, not  someone who manipulates me while playing games just so she can have her  cake and eat it too.

Spot on.  You made the right decision.  I would never tolerate being with someone who felt the need to use the technical excuse "we weren't official" to play the field - its complete bullshit and show a complete lack of class and respect.

Furthermore, someone who is so intent on dating multiple guys at the same time is likely someone that a lot of guys would not consider for any sort of serious relationship.  If they are so needy for attention that it takes multiple guys every few weeks to fill their "social calendar", and they have to have an app to manage scheduling all of their dates, then that is not relationship material for most men.  Most men are not interested in getting serious with the town bicycle.

This could have all been avoided if she would have just been upfront about her intent to continue to see others.  It shouldn't have been left up to assume that she wasn't.   Of course, she knew he would probably dump her if she would have told him, so it is likely he would have had to asked.

While it may be acceptable in "modern dating" for women to be going through guys like potato chips, most guys that are looking for something serious are avoiding these types.  It would be far simpler if the people were just honest up-front about who they are, what they are planning on doing, and what they have been doing in the past.  That way, both parties can make an informed decision quickly.   If the guys doesn't want to go out with a woman that is dating multiple guys casually, or is into casual sex, or has a huge list of previous partners, then finding this out early lets him avoid wasting any time on someone that isn't going to be a match. Similarly, the girl can avoid wasting time on someone that isn't a match for her.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My (24f) husband (38M) keeps sexualising my childhood trauma...

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gwdaw1/my_24f_husband_38m_keeps_sexualising_my_childhood/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

First of all I want to say thank you to all the kind souls who left supportive and kind messages. I tried to read them all but there were just too many.

My husband and I have decided to separate for the time being as I can’t really get over just how weird and abusive he’s been over the past few months. He is currently letting me stay in the house until we figure out the next steps and although he keeps apologizing, I’ve decided to leave him and start my life over.

To everyone telling me to go back to my home country. I can’t. It’s not so easy. I did however call my family and told them everything and they were surprisingly supportive and we’ve talked everyday since my original post and I couldn’t be happier about that.

To everyone who left me horrible messages. Im sorry you are so full of hate and wish horrible things on people. But I will end up stronger than ever after this. So thank you.

My husband has been nothing but supportive In my wanting to leave and start over so all I can do is figure it out and take the advice of my family and my lawyer. Yes, I’ve been in contact with a lawyer but haven’t hired her yet as I’m waiting to get the money from my husband who has volunteered to pay for it.

Thanks again, hope this update was sufficient for everyone.

ANSWER: I don’t want to be that guy, but I really doubt he wants to pay for a lawyer that will help you file for divorce and probably receive some settlement too...

Be careful, manipulative people act really nice when they think shit hits the fan but just until they see this is real, after that, the monster comes out

QUESTION: My (23M) girlfriend’s (22F) diet is making her crazy. How to do I reason with her?

ThrowRA - she uses reddit more than me.

I’ll just get right to it. About 2 and a half weeks ago, my girlfriend decided that she wanted to lose weight. I have no idea how much (she won’t tell me her start weight or any of her goals), but I’m guessing it’s in the realm of 20-25 pounds. It’s no secret to me that she’s overweight, but I like her the way she is and this is the only way that I’ve ever known her.

Anyway, she signed up for that Noom program, which is basically an app for counting calories from what I understand. She eats a strict 1200 calories per day and drinks almost a gallon of water every day. In some ways it’s been good because I get a lot of home-cooked healthy dinners, but that’s beside the point. We’ve also started going on long walks (1+ miles) every other night or so, and she picked up some yoga off YouTube.

The problem is, since beginning her diet, her self esteem has spiraled out of control. She wakes up every morning and weighs herself and then tells me that she “doesn’t deserve food today because I gained .2 pounds overnight,” “eating is overrated,” “why don’t you break up with me for someone pretty,” stuff like that. This morning, she texted me to say that she’s been waking up an extra 30ish minutes early before work so that she has time to get back in bed and cry after weighing herself so she doesn’t burst into tears at her desk “again.” It’s nuts.

I’ve done a bunch of research and even met with a dietitian (a friend of mine) on her behalf, and I’ve learned more than I probably needed to about women and hormones and how birth control affects weight loss and all that nonsense, but she won’t listen to me when I try to reason with her. I just want to tell her that her body is in shock from the sudden adjustment in her eating habits and she needs to tough it out for 6 weeks. She doesn’t want to hear it, she’s too busy crying over a quarter of a pound and swearing up and down that she’s doomed to be ugly forever and I’m going to leave her for a “skinny legend.”

I love her, I really do. How do I reason with her?

last edit: I have been trying to reply to almost all the comments as they come in, and I know I didn’t get all of them, but I really do appreciate all of the insight that everyone has offered, except of course for people like my friends who are featured in the first two edits for suggesting that I break up with my girlfriend… But that’s beside the point. I think I have a good idea of the next steps that I should take as a supportive boyfriend to encourage her to get the help that she needs, and I’m hoping to be able to update you all on this soon. The only thing I haven’t enjoyed about this experience is the fact that this account that I just made this morning now has three times as much karma as my main. Thanks again

Edit: I generally hate people who edit posts after they already have hundreds of comments, but I just want to say to this guy [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hx1i21/my_23m_girlfriends_22f_diet_is_making_her_crazy/fz4g6v7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) that you are the reason women develop disordered eating and you should not be proud of yourself right now

Edit 2: I’m sorry if someone abandoned [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hx1i21/my_23m_girlfriends_22f_diet_is_making_her_crazy/fz4u8o7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)  during a tough time in your life, but I’m not going to leave my girlfriend just because she’s in a rough patch right now. We should be encouraging people who need help to seek it, not dump them because they’re vulnerable.

ANSWER: When my anorexia was at its worst I called in sick to work multiple times because I gained 0.2lbs and I couldn’t get out of bed.

She will most definitely resist help if she feels like she hasn’t lost enough weight yet. I would strongly recommend getting her therapy and reassuring her that it’s okay to eat and you’re attracted to her exactly as she is.

QUESTION: My [25M] girlfriend[29] suggested about having a FFM threesome. I was skeptical at first and politely turned it down but gave in when she kept on talking about how awesome it would be. Now she is giving me a hard time because I accepted the idea and didn't deny strongly. Am I being manipulated?

Hello all,
A few days ago my[25M] girlfriend[29] suggested that we should have a threesome with another girl.

Knowing her, I disagreed at first. She kept on insisting and I gave into the idea. I cherished the idea and we started talking about how we are going to get this done.
A few hours later she blocked me on messaging and was not responding to my calls. Then when I finally reached her she was crying. She seemed broken. She told me that I didn't deny her strong enough. She told me that had I ever insisted on having a threesome with another guy, she would have denied it. She was mad and we broke up because I didn't deny her strongly.
Basically, I feel as if she set up a trap and is now giving me a hard time for it..
I feel that I am being manipulated. Dear reddit, please help me out. Thanks.

UPDATE (2 weeks after the post): First off, Thanks a lot for this overwhelming response. The comments and messages helped through this turbulent time. Thanks a lot.

We had a lot of talks but the chances of something like this happening again felt high. So, I decided to break off this relationship as the whole ordeal took a mental toll on both of us. No clue about her intentions though, but I am at a much better place. Thank you reddit!

ANSWER: “Honey, please please do this with me, I really want to”

“Why can’t you read my mind? I was obviously lying and testing you but I’m too insecure to actually talk about my feelings in a healthy manner and I blame you for not knowing”

What a basket case. Get out while you can.

QUESTION: I[29f] tried to surprise my husband[28m] and all he just said “gross”

My husband and I have been having a bit of a dry spell over the last two weeks, which started when I wasn’t in the mood for a few days in a row and he was, and seems to have spiraled from there. Tonight since we’re stuck at home I figured I would try and surprise him when he got off work. I put on some lingerie and waited on the sofa around when he usually finishes his last conference call. I got a little over excited early and was touching myself a little bit, and he came out of his office.

He looked at me, seemed disgusted and immediately goes “ugh gross, do that in the bedroom or something” and walks away. I mean I was trying to do something fun and spontaneous and he says gross? I don’t even know how to respond to that. We haven’t talked since that and I’ve just been stewing on that.

I think I’ve gotten a little bit too much in my own head about this because my best plan right now seems like to electrocute him(joking for any that can’t tell). But I mean what kind of response is gross? Who says that?!

I need an outside perspective. How would you respond?

Update: well we had an apparently much needed conversation, and much of what was said was true, although he is neither gay nor cheating on me, and I have not gained weight, and nobody will be receiving any pictures of me.

He said that he’s sorry for calling it gross, but he feels like he’s always the one initiating and I’m always the one saying no, and whenever I do initiate I don’t put in as much effort as him. That the fact when he just stopped trying after the first couple days I said no that it took two weeks for anything to happen only proved it to him.

His first thought when he saw me was that I didn’t want to be interrupted, and his second was that after two weeks with nothing I didn’t even bother to ask or set a mood. And that’s apparently what culminated in the gross comment.

So we agreed that I would try to “woo” him a bit more and make him feel more wanted, and he wouldn’t take it to heart if I happen to say no a few days in a row.

ANSWER: Yeah like a few folks already pointed out he probably just thought you were sitting there masturbating randomly.  You should just bring it up casually and talk it through and see what happens. I mean he's your husband has he ever been a fan of spontaneous stuff like that?

QUESTION: UPDATE: My [24] boyfriend [25] of 3 and 1/2 years hasnt proposed and I'm starting to worry. I just want that promise.

The original link is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/50ihkx/my_24_boyfriend_25_of_3_and_12_years_hasnt/?utm_source=reddit-android)

I wanted to give an update on this post I wrote about 2 years ago. I got some great advice, I got a lot of tough love advice and some terrible advice. I know he was already committed by all of his actions and that I really needed to focus on college first before having to plan a wedding.

Well, it turned out my boyfriend at the time had been planning on proposing to me for a long time. He wanted to wait until I graduated college. A little after I graduated college, he took me on a hike. I knew this was a special hike because it was the same place we went for one of our earlier dates.

The first time we went on that date was magical. I always teased him that he never kissed me on the date. There was this perfect moment he was holding me in front of a beautiful picturesque lake as we were just enjoying each other's company in an embrace. I thought he was going to kiss me but he didn't.

I later kissed him first but always teased him that he didn't kiss me in that moment we had. He confessed he wasn't sure if I wanted to be kissed. He said he wanted to kiss me more than anything.

Well he took me back on the hike 4 years later, and when we got to that lake, he told me this is when he knew he was first in love with me. Then he got on one knee and proposed to me. I just kissed him and even forgot to say yes! So he asked, "Are you going to marry me or not?" And I said of course. We got married about a year later and we just celebrated our one year anniversary in October.

I've never been happier and I'm so excited to continue our life together!

Thank you for reading 😁

Edit: Grammar on TL DR

Edit: Wow! I did not expect this post to blow up like it did! Thank you all for the incredibly kind words. I'm sorry I can't respond to everyone but thank you. I'm glad I could brighten so many people's day! You all brightened mine :)

TL;DR UPDATE: My [24] boyfriend [25] of 3 and 1/2 years hadn't proposed and I was starting to worry. This is a two year update that my boyfriend at the time was planning on proposing all along. We have now been married for one year. I am so happy everything worked out the way it did.

ANSWER: When you said "my boyfriend at the time" my heart dropped. Great update and super glad you got it together and relaxed into your love and relationship!

QUESTION: Update: My(M26) wife(F26) is not happy

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hm1wdi/mym26_wifef26_isnt_happy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Thank you everyone for the advice from the original post. I just wanted to give the community an update. My wife finally got back yesterday from leaving to go see her sister. We talked for a little bit yesterday, but still came to the same thing she has been telling me. She doesn’t want to be with me because she doesn’t feel in love, emotionally connected, or intimate towards me. She views me as a friend. I told her she needed to choose either we work on this and go to counseling or it’s a divorce and we cut ties. She couldn’t decide and said to give her the weekend.

This morning I woke up early, made her breakfast and brought it to her in bed. Then took her out to eat for lunch and desert trying to just spark anything to see if she would agree to work on it. Well we sat down again after getting back and she said she wanted a divorce and she was 100% on that.

It was tough. A lot of crying, sadness, hurt, and all the emotions one would feel. I ended up just going to my room and she left for the night. I decided to get out and do something so I jogged and listed to some music for a bit. It helped.

I came to the realization that we all have such little time on earth and I don’t want to waste it moping around. I want to improve myself physically, emotionally, and mentally. I want to just enjoy life and find myself again. So I’m going to do that and one day I might meet someone who is perfect to continue the journey of life with me.

So I’m still sad and hurt, but all that to say I’m moving forward and trying to be positive. Thank you all for your support.

tl;dr Wife wants a divorce. I’m trying to stay positive and move one.

ANSWER: The end of a relationship is hard but it’s also such a great opportunity for growth, self compassion, and fun. The initial part of the separation is hard but just know that you will be okay, slowly things will get better. 
You’re still so young, you’re going to find someone that’s a better match for you. Just give yourself time to grieve and take care of yourself. When my bf and I broke up I listened to “Breakup Recover Podcast” by Barbara Stevens, she’s so calming and has a way of making you feel cared for and safe. There were days where I felt like shit but I would force myself to listen to it and I never regretted it. 
Hope you find happiness within yourself soon!

QUESTION: My(24f) dad (56m) committed suicide about 2 weeks ago and Im having a hard time grieving and being in school. I don't want to drop out. (UPDATE)

Hi everyone, my last post wasnt super popular or anything but I just thought I'd update you guys anyways!

About a month ago, I went back to school a week after my dad died, and obviously the last few weeks have been super hard. It took me awhile but I ended up getting back on my feet, ultimately school has become one of my biggest outlets as far as keeping myself busy goes. I ended up passing all my classes with all A's and B's and I'm on track to graduate this fall.

Thank you to everyone who believed in me and encouraged me to keep going. Its people like you that really helped me get through one of the hardest chapters of my life..

Life can be really fucking hard, so sometimes you just have to take the small victories where you can.

EDIT Wow never in a million years would I expect my post to blow up this much. I dont really know what else to say other than thank you. I try and find little signs from my dad and today I think it's all you guys, rootin for me. ❤️

ANSWER: I didn’t actually see your initial post but this struck a cord with me as my dad committed suicide last month and I too now have choices to make about school. I’m so sorry for your loss but well fucking done with those results! 💗 as the Kris Jenner meme says you’re doing amazing sweety

QUESTION: UPDATE : I (46F) have hurt my daughter (16F) by giving her friend(16F) a few books

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n7jcfj/i_46f_have_hurt_my_daughter_16f_by_giving_her/)  
I found the perspectives and guidance I received really helpful. I decided to just spend some time with her. She loves to bake and we baked together and we had some movie nights. her comments melted away and she became happier.

we were baking yesterday when she came out to me. I didn't make a big deal out of as I felt she didn't want me to. I just told her I loved her before continuing to bake as if nothing happened. We did have a conversation later on.

She told me that she and her friend had been together ( scary, how well kids can hide things.) Her girlfriend wanted to come out but she didn't and it had strained their relationship. It seems, they had a fight before we gave her the books to her (ex?) girlfriend and that had hurt her. Their relationship is in the limbo and she doesn't want to come out to the world right now. My husband ordered a small pride flag to keep in her room. The world is a bit crazy right now and we want her to have a space where she can be herself.

TL;DR : My daughter came out to me, her friend was actually her girlfriend and they had a fight.

ANSWER: I wish I had you as my mother. No I'm not gay but to take the time to learn from others on how to take care of your daughter lovingly is a really good trait and she is lucky that instead of you responding back in kind or from a place of negativity, you are responding with love.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I [26f] opened my husband's [32m] snapchat and it was a very explicit picture and caption from a girl. He's sitting not 20 feet from me & I don't know how to handle this.

Link to original post: https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4z9cgn/i_26f_opened_my_husbands_32m_snapchat_and_it_was/?ref=search_posts

Again, I am overwhelmed by the support and love I've received from everyone. It feels great to be comforted and cheered on by you all. Thank you so much.

So, husband cheated. He has been since "maybe two weeks before last Christmas", according to him.

I was very calm when confronting him and took the advice many of you gave me by telling him that he needs to explain to me who Roxy is and why she is his "best friend" on Snapchat. His face gave him away immediately but he still tried to lie to me at first.

He said that she works with his friend and they met when his friend invited her out to lunch with the two of them. At first, he claimed he only met her about two months ago. He said that they're "best friends" because he doesn't receive many snapchats from others and she is extremely active on the app. He said she just sends randoms and is really into fitness, so she sends a lot of "inspirational" snaps on being healthy and living a better life. He said that every once in a while, he'll send her something back, like a picture of a cheeseburger or something just to tease her about her level of health-consciousness.

First, I asked why he didn't just tell me about her. He said he didn't even think about it because she's just an acquaintance, not even a friend. Then I asked if he'd ever received anything even remotely inappropriate from her.

He answered with, "Not on purpose". I'm assuming he went with that because he knew I opened that snapchat and he probably knew it was a bad one.

I asked what "Not on purpose" means. He got very defensive. Started raising his voice and saying he doesn't need to explain what that means, that sometimes people accidentally send the wrong snapchats to the wrong people. Then he had the nerve to say something along the lines of, "I feel like I'm on trial here. People warned me that you'd get crazy when you're pregnant but I never thought it'd be this bad."

Now. As some of you mentioned in my last post, it seems amazing that I'm able to keep such a level-head. That is because I was raised by a mother who always told me that you never accomplish anything with anger. That you can be emotional, passionate, upset, etc. without ever raising your voice. Messages received quietly and concisely are just as loud and clear as messages received through yelling and screaming. That is how I have lived my life for 26 years, with the exception of just a few blow ups (I am human).

This moment was an exception. I didn't exactly yell and scream, but I became furious. For him to try to blame this on me being pregnant? How unoriginal and offensive. Long story short, he said he'd never seen me this crazy and I told him that I'd never seen a picture of another girl's pussy on my husband's snapchat before. He came back with that I shouldn't have looked at his snapchat. I came back with that it was an accident but even if it hadn't been, there shouldn't be any reason he's receiving snapchats like that for me to see- accidentally or not- in the first place. I told him that I may be pregnant but I'm also an intelligent person and I am his wife, so I knew he was lying and I deserved to know the truth. I asked if I could see his text messages to see if he's been texting Roxy. He said sure. No messages. Then I asked to see his Facebook messages. He looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He told me no. I asked why.

He finally broke and started to cry. Told me he couldn't let me see the messages because they would hurt me. Because they were inappropriate.

Then it all came out. They screwed in the backseat of her car the first night they met.

This is already long so I'll spare you all the details. But it's been an ongoing affair for months. No, they did not always use protection. Although I was recently screened for STIs, I'll be getting checked again in light of this information.

My uncle already assured me that if he was unfaithful, we would cream him in court. Really the only thing I'm willing to fight him tooth & nail for is our home; I put a lot of effort and money into making this home my dream space. I won't be seeking spousal support but I will seek child support.

I'm obviously heartbroken and told him to go stay in a hotel or with Roxy for all I cared (I confronted him last night). My mom & sister stayed with me last night and let me sob all over them for hours. Right now I'm sort of numb but I'm also thinking very clearly. I know what my next 10 moves are and I feel supported and secure in my decision to leave him and keep my baby.

A few things I just wanted to clarify: My husband is not a lawyer; his good friend is. There was some concern for my success in court if my husband is a lawyer. His friend is in environmental law so, while I'm sure he can provide some advice, he will not be my husband's divorce lawyer.

There were suggestions of me terminating my pregnancy. I fully support the right to choose and I would probably terminate the pregnancy if I was in a different financial position and lacked a support system. However, I work as a marketing manager for a large company. Not only does this allow me the privilege of working from home about 50% of the time, but it also grants me financial independence. I do not rely on my husband for money and I really never have. He works in tech so, while he makes a good salary, I will have no need for spousal support. I have a phenomenal support system; this baby will be loved so dearly by so many. Yes, I will have to deal with my husband for the rest of my life if I have this child and it will make future relationships for me more difficult, but it is worth it. I've wanted this baby since day one and I am her mother, which means that I am strong enough to raise her alone because I have to be strong enough.

Here's to hoping for a speedy divorce. I'm ready to be done with this marriage. Which is crazy because just a few days ago I thought my life was as close to perfect as you could get.

tl;dr Husband admitted to an affair. I will be proceeding with a divorce and will keep our baby. I'm numb but calm and feeling good about my decisions and how I handled the situation. I know there is a long road ahead of me and this will all probably really hit me soon. When it does, I'll mourn and grieve the end of what I had thought was a happy union. Right now I'm in self-preservation mode and much more focused on how to come out of this in the best position possible. Thank you so much for all the advice and support, Reddit!

Edit: Formatting

UPDATE: I know it has been only a short time since I posted this update but I need to tell you all how amazing all of you are. Wow, this much support is just... wow. I wish I could reply to all of your comments and messages but because of the volume, I'm just going to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to each and every one of you who read my posts, who commented, thought of me, wished my baby & me the best, messaged me, and anything else. I am currently at my parent's condo, sitting outside at their pool, sunbathing my little baby bump and reading each and every one of your amazing and empowering comments. I just want you all to have that image; that you have made me happy and content in a time when I am short on both. This is proof that love does exist, even if it doesn't within my, now over, relationship. And that is a powerful thing.

Love to you all.

Me again: I was going to post more details on what happened during the confrontation with my husband, etc., but then I decided against it. I should keep some details private; it's likely my husband has seen this post.

I will leave you with this:

My dad and I were up late talking last night and, as usual, he had the perfect thing to say to me. He told me that weak people are afraid of strong people. He told me to keep on terrifying the weak ones. That way, the only people who won't fear you are the bravest, strongest of people and those are the people who are worthy of you.

Then he said my husband is a spineless turd who couldn't kick it with the strongest woman in the world.

Just thought I'd leave you with that and encourage everyone to "be terrifying" by being strong and not standing for nonsense.

This is the last I will post on the matter. I have a lot ahead of me with everything and will probably go quiet on Reddit for a while. Time to get ready for court and to "be terrifying". :)

Thank you, thank you, thank you again. Love to all of you and best wishes.

Love,

-T

ANSWER: I've been thinking of you since I saw the original post a few days ago. It broke my heart to hear this, you deserve a thousand times better than a man like him.
You've handled the entire thing with utter grace by the sounds of things, I for one could not keep my cool especially if I had pregnancy hormones whizzing around my body. I am flawed by your measured response and strength to leave someone who quite clearly doesn't deserve you. That is true strength. Your child is lucky to have such a strong mother and role model. All the best for the future, you deserve happiness x

QUESTION: [UPDATE] Me [31F] with my husband [35 M] married 2 years together for 10. He doesn't want his kids to be like me.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2i34pr/me_31_f_with_my_husband_35_m_married_2_years/

It took me 3 more years, but I finally left him last year.

This post helped me see how much was wrong in our relationship, but I was still so hesitant to leave.

We had pets and a beautiful home together and I loved his family and we had so many inside jokes and plans for the future.

But eventually it was all just too much for me to take any longer. The day after his parents' 50th anniversary party, I told him I wanted a divorce. I just couldn't see myself living like that for 50 years.

I moved from the suburbs to the city with a friend. I rekindled some old friendships from high school and made a bunch of new friends who I am so thankful for. He kept the dog, I took the cats.

I thought my life was ending but it was just beginning.

I told my (very religious) family and they were all understanding and supportive. I've maintained friendships with a good number of our mutual friends, friendships I was worried about losing.

I'm working on my masters degree and volunteering and experiencing life and love and art and beauty like I never thought was possible.

I met a guy at a friend's punk rock show and we hit it off, but we are taking things very slowly. He is wonderful and so kind to me.

If you are in an abusive relationship, please don't be afraid to leave.

It gets so much better. I still miss him from time to time. I feel guilty about getting divorced, guilty for wasting my parents money on a failed marriage. I miss his parents. I miss my dog.

But I am SO MUCH happier. My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.

Thank you so much to everyone who offered advice and sympathized and even had harsh words for me deciding to stay.

tl;dr: Left my abusive husband. Life is much better.

EDIT: for those saying it didn’t sound that bad or abusive, you should know it got worse. It did escalate to physical abuse, us sleeping separately/no intimacy for a year.

If you think you are too old or too much trouble or have too much baggage or are too much anything, please believe that it is possible to find love again. Both loving yourself and having someone else love you 💕

ANSWER: >My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.

Yes! I remember reading once that what human beings are scared of most is uncertainty. So in a way, staying with your abusive husband -- while awful and full of emotional abuse -- was the safe option because you knew what you were in for. Leaving him was an act of bravery and I hope your future is full of warmth and love.

QUESTION: [Update]I [30f] want to discuss moving in with boyfriend [34m] but we have a significant difference in income.

OP:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i\_30f\_want\_to\_discuss\_moving\_in\_with\_boyfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i_30f_want_to_discuss_moving_in_with_boyfriend/)

Thanks for all the advice, I ended up broaching the topic last week.

As mentioned in the first post both my boyfriend and I have been hinting around the topic but hadn't directly discussed it. I was still on the fence about bringing it up myself when my boyfriend made a comment about how he's excited for us to live together (one day). I just responded with, "Well did you want to? My lease is up in July." and he said that he did.

It was before work when it happened so we left it at that for the day and got together that evening to work out details. I expressed to him at that point that while I would love living with him that my concern was that I wouldn't be able to contribute equally and I didn't want him feeling taken advantage of. He in turn expressed that he'd never want to put me in a bad position financially and that we could easily figure out something that would be fair while still putting me in a better financial position.

We ended up deciding we'd go with a lump sum monthly that I'll pay to him to cover all the costs, rather than splitting bills. The monthly amount he offered at first I actually upped because I didn't think he was being fair to himself, and it was still less than what I pay now. He seemed happy with that and it definitely works for me!

He keeps mentioning how excited he is to move in together, and came to my apartment last week to help me clean for photos to show it! We're deciding together what we'll keep out of my furniture vs. his, what we'll get rid of and what we're going to store. He's also mentioned a couple renovations he wants to get done around the condo so we're going to go together to pick stuff out and make it a summer project. :)

TL;DR: Boyfriend gave me an opening to ask about moving in so I seized it. All went well and we'll be moving in together in June!

Edit: Wow... this really blew up! Thanks to everyone for the super kind words. To address the most common comment here; we did discuss splitting proportionally but ultimately decided to go with a lump sum. I definitely see benefits to proportional splitting but for where we are right now and my financial situation I prefer a lump sum. It's still significantly less than what I'm paying now, and it wont fluctuate as the weather changes so I can count on what I owe monthly not changing.

Many people have mentioned chores as well. My boyfriend and I tend to do chores together. I mean right now with two separate places we each have our things that are more our responsibility but when I've stayed with him for a stretch of time we've just balanced together. He doesn't know how to cook but wants to learn so we cook meals together and then clean up together. We will each have our own washroom at his place (I've already taken over the main washroom and he uses the en suite). He volunteers at a local animal shelter once a week so those days I clean and cook if I'm around. But generally speaking we just treat doing chores as an opportunity to spend time together and be productive. :)

ANSWER: Aw, this is adorable! You guys sound like you communicate well and really care for each other, good luck!

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (30F) caught my husband (31M) in an affair and I don’t know how to move forward.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i7wkqu/i_30f_caught_my_husband_31m_in_an_affair_and_i/

First of all, I just want to thank everyone here for the support I received following my first post back in August. At the time, it truly felt like my world was ending. It was important to me to make this update because I need to tell anyone who’s currently going through the same thing—IT GETS BETTER. You will get so much better.

I had one conversation with my husband since everything happened—by his choice. It lasted maybe five minutes and was like talking to a robot. I know from others that he cries to people about how he ruined his life, but I have never once gotten an apology or the same show of regret. At this point, I don’t care. I know him and the other woman are still seeing each other and frankly, they deserve each other. Good for them.

While I still feel angry occasionally, I no longer mourn what I once had. Instead, I’m so excited for the life I now get to live. I moved to a small walkable city and gave myself my dream apartment. It makes me so happy to see how I’ve decorated it and to just live in a cozy place instead of our old dreary house.  I was the breadwinner in our marriage, and he would make me feel awful about wanting to pay for nice meals or do fun things. Since moving here, I’ve done a ton of foodie fun stuff and don’t feel guilty. It’s so refreshing.

I have dipped my toe into the dating pool again and had plenty of mediocre dates from dating apps. Recently, I found someone who I’ve really clicked with and am enjoying how appreciated and desired he’s made me feel.  It’s definitely early and we’re moving slow, but overall, dating has made me realize that I’m a catch who doesn’t have to settle.

Therapy has done wonders and I’m so happy I immediately dove into it. My therapist is proud of me. I’m proud of me. I’ve stopped looking at being divorced as a failure. He failed—not me. I’m genuinely happy and excited to wake up each morning and no longer feel like this terrible weight is sitting on my chest. The holidays were surprisingly easy and I found myself so happy to spend time with my family without having to compromise anything.

So all in all, life is good and there’s so much of it ahead. Looking back, I can’t believe I wasted so much time thinking about how I could get him to come home. I’ve made my own home and my own happiness and that is worth so so much more.

TLDR; Husband left me for another woman. He sucks, but things get better.

ANSWER: Thank you. I forgot to mention above, but I also got a new job offer and am happily busy with fulfilling work again as well!

QUESTION: Update to the pettiest question ever

Update to this petty thing: [https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3hi08p/stupidest\_question\_ever\_is\_there\_any\_polite\_way/](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3hi08p/stupidest_question_ever_is_there_any_polite_way/)

It  took 5 years and a marriage and he curled his eyelashes last week. He found my eyelash curler and asked what it was for and I told him how to test it on himself. He said he didn't notice any difference but his eyes sparkled for the first time.

He's not going to keep doing it but at least I know what his pupils look like now lol

TL;DR: I didn't ask him, he asked me.

ANSWER: Thank god, I've been on the edge of my seat for the last 5 years. Glad you guys got married and things are OK.

Give us another update in 5 years when you've got a house and a couple kids?

QUESTION: [UPDATE] I'm [28F] unsure if it's time to draw boundaries with my boyfriend [28M] and his coworker [late 20sF] who he got close to very quickly

Original post is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9cx874/im\_28f\_unsure\_if\_its\_time\_to\_draw\_boundaries\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9cx874/im_28f_unsure_if_its_time_to_draw_boundaries_with/)

TLDR of original: My boyfriend has become fast friends with a female coworker. She and her fiancé are now moving into our apartment building, and my boyfriend is seeing and talking to her more and more. I don't know if it's time to set boundaries or if I'm getting ahead of myself.

&#x200B;

A lot has happened since my last post, and I got some good advice there, so I wanted to post an update!

After I made the last post I came home from the trip with my family a couple of days later. I told my boyfriend that I wanted to talk to him about something and I brought up his friendship with Liz. I basically brought up all of my concerns from the post. I told him that I didn't want to discourage him from having a friend, but I also felt like they were talking quite a lot and spending a lot of time together, and that it was starting to make me feel uncomfortable.

My boyfriend took it really well! He immediately reassured me that he only saw her as a friend, and that he hadn't even realized how it could look to me. When I brought up how I felt like he wasn't being forthcoming with information (like how he didn't mention the phone call from her), he said that was 100% unintentional. He then immediately asked what he could do going forward to make me feel more comfortable. He offered to stop carpooling with her and to cut down on contact with her except for work-related stuff. I told him I didn't have a problem with the carpooling because financially it does make sense (he spends a lot of money on gas), but maybe he could try to text and call her outside of work a little bit less. I also told him I would really love to meet her and her fiance, and he enthusiastically agreed.

He set up a hang out for the following weekend - the two of us and Liz and her fiance all went out for drinks at a bar by our building (they'e moved in by now). It was actually really fun! It turns out we all have a ton in common. Liz and I do very similar work, and we all have common nerdy interests. It was a little awkward at first as meeting new people often is, but once we all got comfortable we had a blast. From there, we have all become fast friends, and Liz and I have developed our own separate friendship too. We text often, go over to each other's places for dinner sometimes, and hang out on weekends. I can honestly say I really like Liz (and her fiance) as a person and trust her 100%. I no longer have a problem with her friendship with my boyfriend at all. They do still carpool sometimes, but they've never hung out alone outside of work - it's always the four of us. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Finally, I have a separate - but slightly related - update: my boyfriend is now my FIANCE! Less than a month after I made my last post, he took me out for a really beautiful and romantic dinner. When we came home, our apartment was covered in roses and candles. I was so shocked I could barely move as he got down on one knee and proposed. I said YES and then cried for about two hours as we called all of our friends and family. It was absolutely perfect and we are getting married next year!

It turns out that Liz actually helped him plan the proposal and that was part of why they were talking a lot too! Since she lives in our building now, he had all of the flowers, candles, champagne, and accessories shipped to her and kept at her place until he was ready for them. He even had her hold onto the ring the week before he did it. After he proposed she came upstairs and took photos for us and cried with us. That was the moment I realized what a great friend she is to both of us.

So communication saves the day again! We're all great friends now, and Liz and I have regular girls nights to plan our weddings together :)

TL;DR: I talked to my boyfriend and he introduced me to Liz and her fiance right away. We're all great friends now and I'm no longer uncomfortable - but I am engaged!

EDIT: Wow, wow, wow!!!! I know this is stereotypical, but I never expected my post to blow up like this. I started reading the comments last night and planned to reply to some but then I got busy, and then this just got out of control! So let me just say here, thank you all SO MUCH for the support, advice, and well-wishes! You guys rule 😭 And thank you for the platinum, gold, and silver?! I’ve never gotten any of that before and now I’m a little sad that this is a throwaway and not my main, haha. I’ll pay it forward and gild someone today :)

ANSWER: Awww this is the kinda stuff I’m here for! I’m so glad the situation was resolved healthily and congrats on the engagement! 🤗☺️

QUESTION: UPDATE: Me [36 M] married to my Wife [36 F] 11 years, and I can't stop thinking about a girl I dated for 1 month 16 years ago.

Original Post 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lqpshq/me_36_m_married_to_my_wife_36_f_11_years_and_i/

So I mentioned to my wife vaguely that I was having a bit of a midlife crisis and ruminating on my past a bit too much. That I miss how I was physically at my peak in college.

She said she is also having a bit of a crisis, worried about longterm health and missing the shape she was in before kids.

We made a commitment to each other to get into shape and have changed our eating habits and bought a treadmill. I have been working out daily and my rumination issues have really dwindled. We also planned a nice vacation, and a few get togethers with frends in the next few months.

---
tl;dr: Told wife I was having a crisis without much detail. We are making strides to better ourselves and each other.

ANSWER: That’s a great update. I can promise you that the one month relationship would have never worked out, because it didn’t. And how it ended suggests that it never had staying power.

I hope that getting into shape helps you both. I think the pandemic also makes relationships tough because you’re likely no longer getting out and doing the things that brought you together (or, simply having time apart and separate interests). At least that’s been the case with my marriage! I think that would make it tempting to fantasize about some other reality that “could have” been (but really, it could have never been).

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My (28F) colleague (30F) didn't invite me to her wedding, and it's completely unravelled our friendship

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bctq5b/my_28f_colleague_30f_didnt_invite_me_to_her/)

So it took me a few days to decide the best way to approach this, but yesterday I had lunch with her again and had the conversation.

I started by saying: "So you've sent all your invitations out now, haven't you?"

She looked immediately panicked by my question and I knew right away that she didn't want me to go down this road.

When she said she had sent them all, I asked if that meant she could show me her venue now.

She showed me the website of it, including the photo gallery, and talked me through all about where everything was going to happen, all the flowers and decorations she was going to add etc. It's a nice enough country hotel with some pretty gardens, but I'm not sure what all the secrecy was for.

I probed a little more, asking who she's invited from work (the list didn't include me), said I was looking forward to seeing the photos so I could see how everything looked (she didn't correct me that I would see it on the day) and then I was completely sure that my lack of invitation wasn't an accident. She looked so relieved when I switched subject and asked if she's excited about her honeymoon and having a rest from all the wedding stress.

So I'm definitely not invited. I thought it over carefully and I have decided not to ask why, for three reasons:

1) The reason is already fairly obvious. She clearly doesn't think we're anything more than colleagues and I've misread the situation. (There were some other theories suggested e.g. jealous husband-to-be, associating me with her past grief, but considering everything I know about her and our history I'm sure it's not that.) I'm not sure why she didn't cool it on the wedding talk with someone she had no intention of inviting, or even just bring it up with me and explain why I'm not invited, but never mind.  
2) Having an awkward relationship at work is the last thing I want. I'm worried that if I push this and turn it into an "issue" that I'll look pathetic and needy, or it will just be unprofessional. I also run the risk of her badmouthing me to colleagues and mutual friends, and I will find it much easier and less messy to handle my own feelings quietly.   
3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down.

And you know, I'm fine with not going. It was never really about getting invited to a wedding, it was more having to face the fact that I'd been naive and taken for granted, and I felt silly that I'd invested way too much in this relationship. That's not all on her, because she was never obligated to be my friend.

Talking it through on my previous post actually really helped me work through my feelings. When I went back to work on Monday I felt much calmer and more detached from it emotionally.

I have looked back on our whole relationship and honestly she's always been self involved, entitled and narcissistic. Being a bride has just made it more obvious, but it's always been there. She's also never given back to me (besides helping me get my job, which of course I'm grateful for), in that she's never been willing to talk me through any problems I've had, and although I help her happily with her work, she says no if I ask her for help in return.

She has a few office enemies and even though I saw her negative traits that caused her to be disliked by some people, I overlooked them and defended her anyway. Now I have put a little distance there it's quite apparent that she's not a very nice person, and I'm genuinely OK with just moving on.

She hasn't really noticed the distance between us so far (or she has noticed and doesn't care/is relieved that I'm giving her space), so I intend to just continue with doing that. If she eventually asks why, or I get the sense that she's trying to rekindle our friendship, then it will be time to clear the air with how I've been feeling. If she doesn't and we just continue drifting, then that's probably for the best.

It's sad to lose a friend, and it will probably take me some time to get over it and to become comfortable with the change in our relationship, but I have other genuine friendships, and plenty of colleagues who are lovely people who I can get to know better now.

The main thing I really took from my original post, and I'm so glad I did post because I needed some tough love on this, is that my fear of confrontation really needs dealing with.

If I can learn how to better speak my mind as things are happening, that will stop things from building and building until I have to have a Serious Conversation and it makes what should have been a molehill into a mountain.

I also need to figure out how to have difficult conversations without having an anxiety attack, which not only weakens my message but is extremely distressing and puts me off dealing with things and being honest with people.

I had a couple of books on assertiveness recommended to me, so I've bought them to start me off. I'm also looking into going to a coach, or maybe a couple of therapy sessions at least, to try and better myself. I don't want to hurt other people by doing this, so this has become top priority for me.

Thank you so much everyone who pointed that out to me. I was aware of it but I didn't think it was a problem and figured I'd just be that way all my life. Now I know better. Thank you for being so honest with me.

Also thank you to those who talked me through the one-sided friendship issue. I'm a good listener and have always attracted people who need to vent, but I only ever noticed the one-off conversations, and didn't think I was being taken advantage of as a long term listening ear.

I have been examining my other friendships in the last few days, to see if anyone else is using me in the same way, or if I've even been doing this to others and not had the self awareness to realise. There are a couple of changes I need to make, including a friendship that I need to set some boundaries in, and another one where I've not been giving back to the other person as much I should have. I have learned a really valuable lesson from this about maintaining healthy relationships, and I'm very grateful for that.

&#x200B;

TL;DR So I'm definitely not invited, our friendship is likely over (but that's actually OK) and I'm going to work on my assertiveness so I can handle things like this better next time. I'm also going to move forward having learned a good lesson about friendships being two-way.

Edit: A few people have been asking about the books I was recommended:
Nonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg
When I Say No I Feel Guilty by Manuel J Smith
Why Men Love Bitches by Sherry Argov

ANSWER: > 3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down.

Jesus christ kudos for having that kind of outlook on things.

QUESTION: update to: Husband and I are having our longest fight ever and I don't know what to do

link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/abayxw/husband\_and\_i\_are\_having\_our\_longest\_fight\_ever/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/abayxw/husband_and_i_are_having_our_longest_fight_ever/)

Soon after I made the post, my husband called me. He was babbling and I couldn't understand him, so I kept asking him to slow down. Then he started screaming (not yelling, literally just screaming). I freaked out because I thought he was being murdered or something. I tracked his phone to a park in town and called 911.

Turns out he had a complete mental breakdown. He's in the process of being diagnosed with a mental illness that usually shows up in people's 20s but for some reason manifested later in him. He's currently in an inpatient mental health program and already doing a lot better.

Thank you all again for the responses and advice on my original post.

&#x200B;

ANSWER: The onset of mental illness posts are the ones that I hate the most.

Often nobody is really at fault, but its likely the start of a long and difficult road for all involved.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (26F) want to propose to my boyfriend (25M) but just found out he plans to propose as well

Link to my original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/exp0i0/i_26f_want_to_propose_to_my_boyfriend_25m_but/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So yesterday he took me to run errands but he "randomly" decided to we should just have fun instead. He took me around the city, we tried all kinds of food, had honestly the most fun I've had since I was a kid, made memories off of little moments, I didn't think that much of it. I realized that the whole day had basically been an all day-date, I knew it had to be coming and I had the ring with me and I was going to try and propose at the same time (someone suggested this in my original post and I thought it would be cute)

He opened my door, walked me down a beautiful pathway and just looked me in the eyes and I said yes. He laughed and dropped down to one knee and I started crying and forgot that I was supposed to be proposing too. I don't even remember what he said, he was on his knee for a while saying what I'm sure were the sweetest things, but I was too busy crying. I'd already said yes before he even got down on one knee so he put the ring on my finger.

We went home and and I realized I didn't propose, he wanted to shower and we sometimes shower together so I proposed to him in there. He smiled and said “I wonder if when our first kid is born will it top this moment” then because I was on my knees in the shower he had to make a sex joke 😂

After we got out he held me while we called his parents (I'd already called my whole family in car ride home)

Yesterday was amazing and now I'm laying next to him while he plays video games and he's talking about our engagement to his friends and I couldn't be happier and I don't know how to contain all this and just ugh! I love you Nathan!❤️

Edit: Thank you to everyone congratulating us! I appreciate it very much 😊

TL;DR: He took me on a romantic all day date and popped the question. I was supposed to propose at the same time but was too busy crying form happiness, I proposed to him in the shower when we got home😂 I'm overjoyed right now!

ANSWER: I needed this positivity. This may sound weird coming from a random stranger, but I'm happy for you. Wish you all the best and your SO as well.

QUESTION: My (30F) husband (32M) impulse bought a dog. [update]

Update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cmu75w/my_30f_husband_32m_impulse_bought_a_dog/

Thank you all for the thorough responses. I read every comment you guys sent.

A few months ago I read a post where a woman sat down with her husband and outlined everything she takes care of at home in a list format. Like, kitchen: trash, dishes, wipe counters down. Etc. That way of communicating really stuck with me and when we went to see our therapist, I used the same format to express how much I do for the dog.

My husband told me that owning a dog was a joint effort and since I’m home all day it shouldn’t be a problem.

Which is when I realized that has been his excuse for everything. Cooking, chores, cleaning. I’m not sure how I became blind to it. I don’t know when I started bending over backwards to accommodate him.

We used to be a solid couple who helped each other out. I remember when I was still in school he’d come over to my apartment and clean the whole thing for me during finals. Or he took care of my elderly cat when I was away for a week and a half. He used to help me dry the dishes and it was always fun. We used to have so much fun and laugh all the time. At some point it all stopped.

I started crying right there in the middle of a sentence and he got concerned. I’m not a cryer the only time he’s ever seen me cry was when I had to put my beloved cat down a few years ago. But he held me for the first time in what felt like months and we had a serious heart to heart about how he made me feel. Not only with the dog but how stressed I’ve been with my job, how lonely I am, I don’t feel important and how we don’t feel like a team anymore, that I’m worried about us.

I guess it clicked for him because he really stepped up taking care of the dog. He started going into work earlier so he can come home early and hang out and make me dinner. It happened slowly over the course of the last few weeks and the routine suits us a lot better. We hired a trainer to make sure we can understand the dog’s boundaries together and the dog sleeps in a dog bed. Our bedroom life has slowly gotten back to where it was when we got married. We’re watching our favorite shows again and going out more. I’ve been putting my foot down more about my feelings and he has been receptive. We are still going to therapy for now.

As for the dog, we’re going to keep him. Is he a No List dog? Yes. But is he a good puppy with a big heart? Yes. We have the money to afford him and he took off after training. It’s nice having a dog again.

TL;DR: husband and I went to therapy, we talked through our problems, we are giving our marriage the time and attention it needs to mend. We’re keeping the dog.

ANSWER: Good job on the communication. Things can sneak up on people and unfair routines can creep in. I'm glad that you two seem to be correcting course for your relationship and it's a big positive that he's putting in a lot more effort now.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] I [29F] am traveling overseas to meet my online "boyfriend" [38M] in a week. He just said he had to cancel

So many through comments and PMs requested an update from my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9vlueu/i_29f_am_traveling_overseas_to_meet_my_online/) and so I thought I'd do one!

After my post I FaceTimed him to say my what I wanted to say and end things. He tried to get me to post-pone my trip and even tried to give me money to make me less mad at him. I told him whatever we had was over as I could no longer trust him. He cried which made me feel weird. I wished him and his ex the best and ended the call.

I went on my trip and had a top class time. The Reddit community really astounds me sometimes. I received a lot of PMs of suggestions of things to do and see and the trip to Ireland became a trip of a lifetime. In Dublin I did meet up with a very kind Redditor who showed me around the city and came with me to a bunch of museums during my stay. I saw amazing sights, met a bunch of really cool people through my travels, and met a few really cute Irish boys. (;

I learned a lot about myself on my first solo trip abroad. I am pretty self reliant and I did a lot of self reflection. This "relationship" was my first "serious" one after my ex and I split up. I think in my desire for closeness with someone I ignored a lot of red flags and downplayed my self worth. I am now focusing on making real connections with people I meet in real life and have decided to stay away from anything long distance indefinitely.

My first night in Belfast I did message him after I had had a what was probably too many beers (damn you delicious Irish beers!) and he said he was sorry but it was what it had to be. It didn't really seem sincere and it extinguished any romantic notions I had.

Thank you to everyone who commented and PM'd me. It really made me excited for my trip and it was the best time!

TLDR; Online BF backed out but after some logistical rearranging I still went on my trip and had the best time ever. Glad I cancelled the bf and not the trip.

ANSWER: > Glad I cancelled the bf and not the trip.

I love this, lol! I'm glad I caught the update post, and am so happy that you went through with the trip! Wishing you oodles of happiness and success in the future, OP. ♥

QUESTION: Update: My wife [28F] found out that my mother [59F] and I [28M] have been lying to her about our (me and my wife's) baby [0M] for months

Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/az648p/my\_wife\_28f\_found\_out\_that\_my\_mother\_59f\_and\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/az648p/my_wife_28f_found_out_that_my_mother_59f_and_i/)

Don't think anyone would particularly care about an update but I all appreciated the insight anyways. So here's an update:

After I wrote the original post, my mom took my son to stay overnight with my wife's sister so that the two of us could have the house to ourselves.

We pretty much just talked for an hour while constantly reaffirming that we love each other a lot and want to sort this out. I apologized and explained why I did what I did. She said that feeling like she was there for our son's milestones was really just a band-aid solution that didn't actually convince her she was present. She said that if she actually had been using the milestones to feel like she was present, this would probably have felt worse for her. But since she wasn't, in her words, "deluding herself into thinking she's actually home", her main issue was that I lied which hurt her feelings. I apologized and explained that I honestly thought that she would prefer the lying if given the choice. She said she understood where I was coming from and that she felt betrayed when she realized, but she sees that I was doing it because I love her and she thinks we'll probably laugh about it with our grandkids one day (yes, I am very aware I don't deserve my wife).

Some things came out on my end that I wasn't going to tell her and didn't mention in my last post- namely, that I'm scared she's going to become suicidal. My uncle committed suicide when I was a child, in part from working in a high-stress job where he made a huge and costly mistake. One of my wife's colleagues attempted suicide while she was on mat leave. Being a working mom is bad enough, being a resident in this program is bad enough, both combined are a recipe for trouble. Since our son was born and the incident with her colleague happened, I've been afraid that if her home life wasn't perfect, it would push her over the edge. Anyways, she reassured me that that's not happening and I think saying it out loud also made me realize it's a pretty irrational, groundless fear.

We ordered takeout and sat together watching the real videos I have of all our son's firsts. I also have a special folder of pictures/videos of my son with my wife, so we went through that after. She almost choked from laughing so hard when I tentatively revealed the beanbag trick. I am the laughing stock of her friend-group chat. So I guess we're already at the stage where we're laughing about it.

Thank you to those who responded to the last post! The stereotype of someone in [r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships) advocating divorce every time anything happens is true.

tl;dr: marriage is work. I am stupid. We moved past it.

ANSWER: I've always heard that NO firsts ever happen in daycare. Until Mom sees it happening, it didn't happen. Many grandparents feel the same way.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (34F) feel unattractive and my husband (41M) of 5 years has low libido

I posted last summer about [struggles with my husband of 5 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/), our longest dry spell being 9 months.

I felt unattractive and undesirable, and wanted to have sex more often, but he was happy to never have sex again (aside from how that would affect me). I wanted to feel like a sex Goddess again. Reddit advised me all kinds of things, from checking testosterone, to therapy, and even that there was no hope and if I wanted to feel like a Goddess again, I'd have to leave him. The [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/estjlke?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that hit me hardest was jimmyjrdanceparty's who pointed out that I was allowed to feel the way I did.

Well, I feel like a Goddess again, everyone! :D

What happened? I decided to go to individual therapy, and focus on myself, work on myself. My physical self-image was a symptom of a larger problem. Troubles at work, troubles at home, a storm inside. During counselling, I opened the door to a cellar where I had been keeping my true self locked in the dark - ashamed of her. I was bullied as a kid, and I had no idea I had accumulated so much self-loathing since then. Releasing that was amazing and so freeing!

And so, by the time I said goodbye to my counsellor, I was stronger and more self-assured. I realised I had been sacrificing so much of myself for the sake of others (especially the important men in my life - my husband, my boss, my father, my manager, etc). I was constantly seeking approval, trying to please them. My relationships had gotten completely out of balance.

Things started to get complicated. I developed a crush on a colleague, and because I am demisexual, my attraction to my husband started to diminish. The more time passed the more I felt like I just didn't care anymore what he thought of me.

At a low point, I said to my husband: "You know, you always keep your thoughts to yourself. I used to find it mysterious and interesting - like a puzzle I could unwrap. But now I realise that there's actually no mystery to unravel. There's just nothing. And the silence is boring." It was hurtful and unkind. I'm not proud of it. Something changed after that. Both for him, and for me.

Over the course of the next few months I gave less, and I took more. I went to conferences, I left the kids with my husband, I took time off work, I stopped making up for the mistakes of my superiors at work and let them deal with the consequences of their actions. I felt like I was coming home to my true self - my no nonsense kickass self.

One night my husband and I were watching Alien, and he confessed that ever since he'd seen the original as a boy, he'd really liked Ripley. She was the kind of woman he had wanted to marry. And so he married me. You should've seen my face, the tears wouldn't stop. I felt like he had finally told me what I needed to hear the most.

I got rid of my attraction to my colleague. It's actually not that hard as a demi, I just focused on everything I didn't like about them, and within a week or two the crush was totally gone. I find them a total turn-off now.

Do you remember I mention I wasn't able to initiate sex? That's because it was a huge turn-off for my husband. One evening we discussed why, and you know what? He felt too much pressure if I initiated, because he thought he'd have to perform. Once he realised that he can safely turn me down if he's not in the mood - and also that's it's OK for us to kiss and cuddle without it leading to something more - he's been OK with me initiating. You'd think you wouldn't get to age 40 without having figured that out, but hey... I guess people never cease to throw surprises!? Haha!

Our sex life improved a lot. I no longer needed his praise to sooth my self-loathing, so I was less needy about it. He initiated a bit more often. But more importantly, with greater enthusiasm and quality! He chooses what I wear sometimes - and I feel so beautiful when he looks at me like I am the only being that matters. And he compliments me! We even got into a bit of light D/s, which has spiced things up a lot!

Even though I had fallen out of love with him for a while, I have fallen back in love with my husband stronger and harder than ever before!! I couldn't be happier, I love myself, and I love him so SO much!! He's just the best partner I could ever wish for! <3

Thank you reddit for helping me through one of the hardest lows in my life, and thank you especially jimmyjrdanceparty for your advice and encouragement.

TLDR: I felt unattractive and my husband didn't want sex. I went to a counsellor. I stopped self-loathing. Husband and I fell back in love again & have great sex.

Update: OMG thank you thank you thank you for all the comments and awards! I have no words! I thought maybe 5 people would care about the update, not this amazing amount of encouragement! Thank you so much, so glad to have been on this journey with you. <3

ANSWER: This is the best post I have ever read on here. You changed your thoughts about yourself, which is the secret to life (IMO). Congrats and thank you for this empowering and amazing story!

QUESTION: UPDATE: My [24 F] boyfriend [26 M] of 6 months told me that I need to "unlove" the men from my past before I can love him.

Link to original post [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ccl1gt/my\_24\_f\_boyfriend\_26\_m\_of\_6\_months\_told\_me\_that\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ccl1gt/my_24_f_boyfriend_26_m_of_6_months_told_me_that_i/)

Figured I'd update my post from about a month ago. Unfortunately, there wasn't a happy ending, but I am very grateful for a lot of the advice I received here. Thank you, reddit, for helping me keep my head on straight!

After I made my first post, I read all the comments and thought about everything for a few days. A lot of people mentioned that they would not be comfortable with the frequency of my communication with my ex. I thought that was very fair. People also mentioned that Mark's behavior was pretty controlling and not ok. I also thought that was fair.

I went to talk to Mark and told him that I understood if he was uncomfortable with me being in touch with Eli weekly, and that I would be totally willing to cut that down. I also reiterated again that I was not currently in love with Eli and hadn't been for a while. Mark was understanding this time and seemed happy with the fact that I offered to cut down my contact with Eli.

But then I told Mark that although I was willing to do this, I wasn't happy with how he approached the issue and that I found his behavior controlling. I basically told him that I want him to approach issues in a more rational way and I would appreciate if he opened a dialogue rather than just telling me what to do, and that I wouldn't put up with him trying to "command" me to do something (especially something so ridiculous). I said everything in the same tone as I used for the first half of the conversation - I wasn't yelling at him or admonishing him, just trying to let him know where my boundaries are.

You guys - Mark. Flew. Off. The. Handle. He started SCREAMING at me. I obviously wasn't having it, so I got up to leave. He started throwing dishes and random kitchen items at me, and grabbed me and slammed my head into the door jam. I ended up with a nasty black eye and a busted lip. Luckily for me, a neighbor heard the commotion and called the cops. Mark was arrested and I was taken to the hospital. Yes, I'm pressing charges and filed for a restraining order.

Overall, it was a horrible incident but I'm glad this happened earlier in the relationship rather than later. And I am forever grateful for the neighbor who called the cops. Im also grateful to (most of) you guys for telling me that I wasn't being insane in my first post and for pointing out the early warning signs. It wasn't the best ending, but I'm ok and I'm just glad it's over. Take this as a cautionary tale, I guess!

TLDR: tried to have a rational conversation with Mark, he gave me a black eye and busted lip, it's over (thank God).

EDIT: I've gotten a lot of concerned messages (which I appreciate!) telling me to watch out for Mark now and that abusers are often at their most dangerous right after a breakup. Just to ease everyone's mind: I'm staying with a classmate (who Mark does not know) for the time being, so I'm well-protected! Thanks everyone!

ANSWER: Him: WOULD A CONTROLLING PSYCHO DO THIS?!

I’m really glad you got out of there. I hope you heal quickly.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My best friend (20M) asked me (20M) out. I said yes. I didn't know it was a date.

The original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9du198/my_best_friend_20m_asked_me_20m_out_i_said_yes_i/

First of all, I wanted to thank people for responding. I was majorly panicking when I wrote the post, and the comments I got helped a ton to get me to relax before talking to Noah. I wasn't expecting such a huge response at the time and I was amazed, but looking back now I can see why it got so much attention. It was a pretty weird situation.

Next, I want to say we are both men (apparently this makes a big difference for some people in terms of advice). Some of the people who assumed I was a woman also made some weird comments and sent me some pretty gross messages. If you did this, please stop. That's not cool.

I gave a bit of an update as an edit to the original post, but now since it's been 3 months I thought I'd give you all an update about how things have been going since then, since it seems like there's been a bit of interest, and I'm still really thankful to all of you for helping me out.

Noah is doing really well. I could tell he was still a bit embarrassed for the first couple weeks, but after that he told me again that he was still happy he asked me because now he knew how I felt and he could get over it. He also thanked me for taking it so well, which is definitely thanks to what a lot of you said, so I guess I'm sort of passing his thanks on to you :P

One of the commenters said I should be careful not to do anything that seemed like flirting with him, so I tried keep that in check (we used to hug a lot, sit really close together, and tell each other flirty jokes, you get the idea, but I toned those all down a lot to give him space and not mess with his feelings). I honestly think I see now why he thought I might be into him, because my relationship with him was very affectionate. It's been a lesson for me on how to be more aware of how other people are interpreting my signals.

About a month after he asked me out, he asked me if I wanted to go to a gay bar with him. He made it super clear that it wasn't a date, but he did it in a really sarcastic way, which was a little embarrassing for me but also I think it was good that he could joke about it. So we went to a local gay bar together and we had a really good time. He's a bit introverted, so I played the wingman, and he ended up flirting with this really cute guy and he just seemed really happy.

That was like two months ago and we've gone to the same bar a couple more times since then. He's been getting a bit more comfortable putting himself out there which is really cool to see, and he's just been more open and happy for the last two months, always smiling and eager to go do stuff. Not sure how it's related but it's a noticeable change from before he asked me out.

I'm doing great too. I'm just really happy that I didn't hurt our relationship and that he's so happy. I also learned some important things from this whole situation about communication and being aware of how I present myself. Important lessons. I actually think I feel more confident now too, since he asked me out. Getting asked out feels good man.

It sounds kind of weird, but I think it made us closer. We've started talking about relationships more, which isn't something we really talked about before. He's gone on a few dates and he tells me about them, and the most recent guy he went out with he was really excited about, and I think he might be headed for his first serious relationship, which is amazing! That's actually what made me think of this post and decide to give you all an update.

TL;DR: So yeah, our relationship wasn't ruined and I still have my best friend. He's doing really well and I love seeing him so happy.

Thanks again for the help!

ANSWER: What a lovely happy update - and I had to go back and check your ages because the maturity and self awareness you have both shown is pretty impressive. Big smile from this mom 🙂 Happy holidays!

QUESTION: (Update) How do I (28f) break up with someone when I’m their (31m) everything?

[Link to original post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aab0wm/how_do_i_28f_break_up_with_someone_when_im_their/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Straight to it: I broke up with him a day after I made my original post a few months ago. I was emboldened by the support and, strangely enough, even some of the negative comments. I came home from work and blurted it out, straight and to the point. I told him that I wasn’t happy, I hadn’t been for a while, and that we would be separating. We agreed that he could stay in the extra bedroom for a few months while we got everything sorted but when the lease was up we would be going our separate ways.

The last few months have been hard. He went into full blown panic mode, promised to change in the ways I had waited years for, and had several actual melt downs begging me to stay. It was painful, but my resolve to live my own life never wavered.

I just signed a new lease (by myself) and have begun to casually date someone in the same field as me. Life has an excitement to it that I haven’t felt in years, it’s like I’ve taken my first deep breath in a long time.

So, if you’re on the fence about leaving someone but your lives are so enmeshed that you don’t see how it is possible: put yourself first, there is always a way out. Thank you!

TLDR: I broke up with my codependent boyfriend and am the happiest I have been in years.

ANSWER: Amen.

Leases, shared bills, mutual enjoyment of GOTs or Survivor while everything else is terrible is no reason to stay together.

I’ve told my sons. Keep an emergency fund that you NEVER touch. Don’t bail on relationships, but NEVER stay in a relationship because you don’t have first months/last months rent and security deposit.

EDIT - thanks for the gold!! Just trying to share some hard-earned wisdom.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My [27F] boyfriend's [27M] old crush returning after a few years away. I was worried he would leave me for her, sadly I was right.

Old post - https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xgz9v/my_25f_boyfriend_25m_had_a_crush_on_a_girl_25f/

He ended up breaking up with me about a month after she came back and got back with her. It's been two years since this all happened and I heard through the grapevine they got engaged last weekend. I've moved on and it's alright, but my heart breaks when I think of how insecure and self-conscious I felt when all this went down. I know I'll eventually find a guy who I won't have any worries about, until then I'm chilling.

TL;DR: I was right to be worried.

ANSWER: I get you. I was supposed to be getting engaged and married to a guy who I thought loved me. Come to find he was cheating on me. They have since gotten married and had a family.

The biggest thing that stung wasnt the fact that he cheated, but the thought that I wasn't good enough for him but she was. I had to realize that I was good enough for a good man.

You are good enough. You are worthy of love and affection. You are 100% worth it and there is someone out there who will see that. I promise you.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] Me [32/F] with my husband [39 M] 6-years, our sex life disappeared; he swears he's attracted to me and I'm not sure what to believe or do.

[Here is the original post.  It is from over two years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40tuc7/me_32f_with_my_husband_39_m_6years_our_sex_life/)

I know my original post is so old, but the biggest update only recently happened.  My therapist suggested I post about it here to help sort out how I feel right now and also as a warning to other people.  I feel like I have grown so much in the last few years and maybe I'm a bit less naive (or a bit more bitter... however you'd like to put it).

Through interacting with the comments, I came up with an ultimatum I would give my husband.

1.  He needed to get his medical stuff tested.

2.  He see someone psychologically.

3.  Couple's counseling.

I decided ahead of time that he'd have to do the legwork for this already.  I had already done so much legwork for this relationship and I wanted to make sure I didn't hold his hand through this either.

He took it surprisingly well for what the conversation was.  There were tears on both sides but he agreed that yes, he would be willing to do these things for the sake of the relationship.

And then days passed.  And a week past.  I finally brought it up again and it caused a minor fight where he told me he needed to do this sort of stuff on his own time.

A few more weeks past.  I realized that he did not care enough to do something about this.  It was a hard thing to realize, but it was clear as day.

I headed over a friend's house to talk things out, clear my head, and come up with a plan for divorce.

I drove home and a few minutes before I arrived, he got a phone call that his sister was in a coma and dying.  I booked him tickets to go see her.  She passed away a few hours after he saw her.

She left behind two late-teenage girls.  Who we were now partially responsible for.

So I pushed my pain down and decided to be the best aunt I can to these two girls.  I also got myself a dog (best decision ever in this situation) to keep my own spirits up.

I worked really hard at this and felt like my husband and I were getting closer in the process.

More recently, I started realizing that everything we were doing for the girls was initiated through me--not him.  So I started paying more attention.  He was getting annoyed at me making a big deal over surprise care packages their school suggested we send in and other things like that.  I was starting to resent that he wasn't caring for his nieces in the same way as I was.

On the youngest niece's graduation day, I asked him if he thought the other parents there would be getting flowers for the graduates and if that's something we should do.  This is when he totally lost it at me.  It was a string that started with him yelling about how I get too concerned about these sorts of things and ended with a rant about how I buy too many crackers when company comes over for dinner.  This started changing the lens I was looking at him through again.  Also, at this point, I felt like my nieces had launched into the world with lives of their own.

I started re-seeing the eyerolls when I talked.  The cutting remarks about my intelligence.  Oh, and the utter lack of sex.

So I started talking to people.  I started seeing a therapist.  And together, we all came up with a plan to discuss everything with him--probably ending in divorce (though I never took that as a definite).

I decided we had a different view of what a relationship and marriage should be.  My plan was to present that to him calmly and let him give his opinion of how he sees things.

I had a work trip so I took the time to recoup.  I went on a long hike, and even though I'm not really religious, I prayed the whole damn time about this.

So when I got home, in the calmest and most even way I could, I explained the situation as I saw it and asked for his feedback.  My friends and I rehearsed what would happen if he cried and begged for a chance to change--or what to do (or rather, where to go) if he got really angry.

But nothing prepared me for his reaction.  He agreed with me.  He said that everything felt "forced" to him and that this wasn't a natural relationship.  That he married me because that was the path he was on, and since he wasn't planning on having kids, it's not like that mattered all that much.  In fact, he prefers being alone generally.

He then finished by asking if I thought we should get couple's counseling.  I calmly said that given what he just said, I didn't think that was an option.  He immediately started trying to talk next steps, who gets what, etc.  He brought up that he could probably technically fight for alimony but that he wouldn't.  And said he wouldn't fight for my dog if I don't fight to go after his seperate finances.

I think this was the most painful in the moment reaction I could have had from him.  I told him I would give him some space that night, so I drove to my friend's house and cried my eyes out.  Him not fighting it is ultimately better for the long run, but it's really hard to realize that your husband of 5 years (and partner for 8) never really loved or cared for you.

I should have listened to my gut all along.

We had that talk last night.  I'm currently sitting in a coffee shop, typing this all out.  I'm a relatively attractive person and I channeled my frustrations over the last few years into lifting and working out almost every day.  So I'm hopeful when it comes to love in the future.

I don't really know what my next step is.  I might drive to my brother's.  I might look for a storage facility.  It's a bit overwhelming to think about.

Overall, I'm so grateful this is happening now and that I won't be looking back at my life when I'm 85 years old, disappointed that it never really started.  I have my life in front of me and it's a big scary place.  But after I finish crying my eyes out, it's one step in front of the other.

And thank you everyone for all your help.

tl/dr:  Put off divorce due to spouse's sister dying and despite everything we worked on together, found out he never really loved me.

ANSWER: I am so sorry..

I wanted to come here to say, specifically, thank you so much for being an amazing aunt to those girls. I lost my mom when I was 15 and my aunts were hands-down the biggest blessing during that time. I don’t know if I would have chosen to continue living if it hadn’t been for their support. So thank you for being so incredibly selfless and supportive for your nieces.

QUESTION: UPDATE: recently found out that I (17M) got into my brother's (19M) former dream university which he did not get accepted to last year, feeling guilty about really wanting to go now

Update to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95s4ri/recently_found_out_that_i_17m_got_into_my/)

On Saturday I was able to speak to my brother and tell him that I got into the university. He was really happy for me, like a lot of people said he would be. When I told him I got in he gave me a huge hug and was really excited. It was such a huge relief.

He asked me if it was my top choice, since he didn't know I had applied. I told him it was and he said that we have to celebrate then. He told me I didnt seem excited enough and I should be really proud of myself, and he asked if it was the shock of just finding out.

When I told him I find out a few days ago and he was the only one that knew he asked me whats going on, because I wasnt reacting to the great news like it was great news. I admitted that I worried about telling him because I didnt want him to be mad.

We talked about it and he basically said what everyone in the comments said, that he's proud of me and happy for me. I mentioned that I got into a different program than his and my requirements were lower, and he told me to not downplay my success and to stop worrying about him being mad because he wasn't. He told me that when I told out parents he wanted me to be more confident and proud of myself, because I did something great.

Yesterday while we were hanging out at his buddy's house he told me I should tell them the news, when I didnt want to because I hate talking about myself he asked if could tell them, which I told him was OK. they were all happy for me too. Honestly, he's reaction was better than I even hoped for, but looking back I should have expected it from him because that's always been the type of brother he is.

TL;DR told my brother I got into the university and he incredibly supportive and happy for me. He told me not limit my success to make other people more comfortable, and that he was proud of me (which meant a lot to hear).

ANSWER: Respect to the brother for being 19 but behaving like a real adult here. Setting a great example for little bro.

QUESTION: Update: My [25f] boyfriend [26m] of 10 months is best friends with his ex [20s?f]. She refuses to meet me and it's getting weird

Link to OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6mql7n/my_25f_boyfriend_26m_of_10_months_is_best_friends/

I wrote my previous post over a year ago, and a lot has happened since then. I wanted to give everyone an update, since the advice on this sub was really helpful at the time.

For a few months after I wrote my OP, nothing much happened. Jeff and I continued dating, and he continued being friends/partners with Jenna. I never met her, but everything else in our relationship seemed to be going so well that I decided I'd try to deal with it.

Things got really hard, however, when I had to take a work contract 12 hours away from home for three months. I hardly saw Jeff the whole time, and I looked at Jenna's instagram almost every day to see if she'd posted more photos of them together. More often than not, she had. Since I wasn't physically present, I felt like Jenna was his real girlfriend. I felt completely worthless and constantly stressed out, knowing my boyfriend was spending all his time with another woman who I already had suspicions about.

While I was away for work, I decided to break up with Jeff. I broke up with as soon as I came back, and I made it very clear that his relationship with Jenna was intolerable for me. I told him he was going to have a hard time dating anyone who wasn't her as long as she was still in his life. He kept saying he didn't understand why it was such a problem. He told me he couldn't control her behaviour, but he promised me he hadn't cheated on me. I explained to him that by allowing their friendship to continue, he was condoning her behaviour. I told him I didn't really even care if he'd physically cheated or not, since he'd already shown disrespect for me and our relationship.

I didn't speak to him for a few months and I went on with my life. I took another contract out of town and even considered moving permanently to another city. One night, though, Jeff called me and apologized. He said he had been thinking about our relationship a lot and realized he had been in the wrong. He said his relationship with Jenna was beginning to feel toxic to him, and he'd made arrangements to dissolve their business partnership. After that, I decided to meet up with him (not necessarily give him another chance) and discuss the situation further. When we met up, he promised to stop talking to Jenna and unfollowed her on all social media.

As of now, he has not spoken to her in six months, and we've gotten back together. We actually ran into her at a concert a few weeks ago, and they didn't even say hi to each other. I feel much more respected and confident in my relationship now.

TLDR: I broke up with my boyfriend. He ended his friendship/partnership with his ex and we have gotten back together.

ANSWER: Wow. Good for both of you that the communication ended up working and you're happy together now. Congrats and hope it works out.

QUESTION: Update 2: I (30F) caught my husband (31M) in an affair and don’t know how to move forward.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/vfJzYwOX6V

Update 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/uMVTyBbusT

Wow. I can’t believe this happened over five years ago now. In some ways, it feels like it happened to me in a different life. I still get messages asking about this and figured I could add some insight into how life can look a few years down the line after everything gets completely and utterly wrecked. Good news—If you put in the work, it looks pretty fucking great.

First of all—where is my ex husband now? I haven’t had contact with him since September of 2020 and largely don’t keep track of things but I can see that this man still follows me on Instagram and watches all of my stories. I considered blocking him, but just let it be. I think it’s the petty part of me who’s living a full life that’s fine with rubbing it in a bit.

He and the affair partner did get married after a whoopsie kid and I’m pretty sure they had another. But they also both lost their jobs as teachers (he got her a job at his school, so she was working with an entire staff that knew they had an affair) and had to move to the middle of nowhere. Last I heard of them, the affair partner had been texting his former best friend unhinged rants about not including them in get togethers or allowing my ex-husband to be a groomsman in his wedding.

But enough about them, because they already took up way too many pages in my story.  When we last left off, I think I had just moved to a new city (shoutout to Richmond, VA!) and was largely just finding myself again. I think the change of scenery was the best thing that I did for myself. I was never meant to live in the suburbs and moving to a beautiful little city where I can walk to coffee shops, bakeries and bookstores honestly helped my mental health as much as the therapy. I bought a house here a couple years ago and have really settled in.

Then I got my puppy, a corgi named Bilbo Baggins who really is the true love of my life. He is the greasiest thing to happen to me and is just such a fantastic chonky guy. We go to a local dog park with a bar all the time and he even has his own lil’ dog social group. Kids aren’t something I plan on, so he is basically my son.

It hasn’t all been perfect. My dad died, my best friend moved across the country, and I largely haven’t really been dating much the past couple of years.  Dating hasn’t been a huge priority for me and my friends say that I’m probably too picky. I say that I know what it’s like to be in a marriage with someone who might love you but doesn’t like you and it’s worth not settling.

But while I may be single, I am fulfilled and busy. My birthday is Saturday and I’ll be spending it in Paris at a Lady Gaga concert. I saw Sabrina Carpenter in Amsterdam, Taylor Swift in Lyon, Springsteen in Edinburgh, Noah Kahan at Fenway Park. Earlier this year I was able to visit Katmai National Park and see the brown bears in the falls. I have a DnD group and a really amazing village of people I love.

I would not be in this headspace if I didn’t go to therapy and work out the why of me settling for this man in the first place. True story: When planning our honeymoon in New Zealand, I, of course, had to plan the entire thing despite him picking the location. He refused to do any driving, so we had to do a guided tour that left on specific dates. He pretended to not be able to get a day off of work when we needed to leave until I started crying and begging him to just ask his boss for it because literally no other flights worked. That’s when he said he actually always had the day off but wanted to make sure I was actually working hard enough to choose good flights.

Anyway, I chose to marry… that and it was a lot to unpack in therapy.  But I’m glad I did because without it I don’t think I’d have built this life for myself. At the end of the day, what happened set me up to live a happier life than what I was living so in some ways, I’m thankful for the experience, shitty as it was.

If you’re in the middle of something terrible, unfair, and world-shattering to you, just know that it’s not forever. While this experience has made me a bit of a believer in karma, I also know that there was a lot of work to get myself out of that big black mental hole. Sometimes it seemed that I would slide back in it but by looking forward and figuring myself out, I eventually clawed my way out. I think you can too—and that you’re worth fighting for.

TLDR: Got therapy, life is good, ex-husband stalks me on Instagram, and maybe we should all get dogs for our mental health.

ANSWER: I feel like following this story and you having this be your current chapter is the best thing I've heard this year.

I'm so happy for you!

Never settle, know your worth. And give the Sir some skritches!

Also, Richmond is a beautiful city. I grew up as a teenager there.

QUESTION: I (22F) just found out my boyfriend (38M) lied about his age for a year—what do I do?

I (22F) recently found out my boyfriend (38M) lied about his age for a year. We met at work, got along, and became official 6 months ago. This is my first relationship, and now I feel completely broken.

He claimed to be 31 years old the first time we met. I was unsure about the age gap, but after seeing how well we connected, I decided to give it a chance.

This morning, we went to do some legal paperwork where I needed his ID. At the office, he kept handing his ID upside down to the staff and refused to let me see it after asking nicely, claiming privacy. By then I had my doubts, though I wasn’t exactly sure what he was hiding.

I finally confronted him saying that I needed to see his ID or I wouldn't be able to trust him anymore. It escalated to, "What are you hiding from me?" He never answered directly. Back home, after much insistence, he gave up and told me the truth:

He lied about his age because he felt bad about being old and wanted to feel younger. He said he knew I wouldn’t accept being with him if I knew his real age, and that he “was planning on telling me” eventually because his guilt was getting hard to manage. He admitted that what he did was wrong, then tried to reassure me that it wasn’t my fault, that I was an excellent girlfriend and person, and that everything we shared was real. I closed the door in his face after telling him I needed to process everything.

This feels like a nightmare. And hurts like shit.

I trusted him, shared my life and my love, and even planned a future together—moving abroad, traveling, building a new life. Now I feel so betrayed, angry, and heartbroken.

I can't believe I was lied to for so long, something so fundamental. I don’t know what to do next. Should I try to salvage this, or just walk away?

Edit: About the “legal paperwork” part, I think I worded it wrong. It’s nothing that really binds me to him in any way. Nothing I can’t undo. He just helped me with some documents that I needed to show for my residence certificate.

TL;DR: My first boyfriend (38M/22F) lied about his age for over a year. I just found out he’s 38, not 31. I feel betrayed and don’t know if I can trust him again.

ANSWER: He wanted you to move out of country before telling you the truth.

That would terrify any reasonable person.

QUESTION: Bf left after seeing ex's engagement post

Okay so, I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (30M) for a little over two years now. We just moved in together a few months ago. Last night we were doomscrolling on insta reels and his ex's post popped up abt her getting engaged

I don't rly know much about their relationship in detail other than her cheating on my bf with her current fiance while she was engaged to my bf (they were together for 5 yrs and it's been 3.5 yrs since they broke up), so ik that it didn't end well with them and it's just a sour topic so i never rly bring it up. I don’t follow her but she's kind of famous on insta as she is a food vlogger and I watch a lot of that content that's y she popped up.

Anyways when he saw it he like froze and became tense i asked him if everything was ok and he said yeah but i asked if that he looked tense because of the post he just brushed it off and rolled over to go to sleep and then thing is we didn't even rly cuddle when we cuddle like almost every night when going to sleep.

I woke up around 2 a.m. and he was gone. Like, completely gone.  he was nowhere in our house. I called him, like, 10 ,15 times. No answer ,Phone was switched off. I even called one of his friends, and they had no clue where he was. I was thinking of calling his mom but ik she would have blown his phone up so i decided to wait and call my frnd she also suggested to wait a few hours so i did

Then around 3:30 ish  he finally calls me back,i ask him wtf is he doing And he just says I'm fine pls don't call me rn ill explain later and he hangs up b4 i could say anything properly

I tried calling again obviously bcoz what does that even mean like I don't get why he would even be upset about that post seeing they broke up so long ago I can't imagine leaving your gf over this at night. He didn't explicitly say anything abt the reason he went off but I'm pretty sure it's bcoz of the post. I stopped calling him after a few times as hes not going to pick up i rly don't know what to do.

Things have been good with us until now this is the first time i have ever felt like I'm being betrayed by him. I don't even know where he is . Should I leave him alone and give him space I just feel sick abt this situation.

Tldr- bf left in middle of night after finding his ex got engaged and is not responding to me

Update-
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/BBZhLPoYPW

Posting again bcoz previous update post got removed for some reason.

Hey guys,
First of all, thank you to everyone who commented , I didn’t expect so many people to respond, and honestly, reading through your messages kept me from spiraling even more.

I tried to go back to sleep after the post. He did come back around 6 am .he looked like shit cuz ig he hadn't slept. He had just been driving around according to him. I didn't even know what to say to him luckily he was the one who talked first. He apologized a lot of times for running away and for ignoring my calls. I obv asked him wtf happened and why he would ditch me like that and abt his ex. He told me he had a panic attack and he didn't want me to witness it so he went to his car and after that he drove off . He explained that it wasn't bcoz he wasn't over her and that he never wanted her back(i asked him if he was still in love w her). He said it just happened after seeing that pic of them together and happy, he said he depressed after everything went down w his ex but he thought he was fine when he started dating me and that he has been rly happy.

But he panicked bcoz it hit him that she was actually happy and their break up hasn't affected her like it has him seeing she was with the guy she cheated on my bf with and he started overthinking that what if he could never be happy like that when  getting engaged again and getting married to me.

I was honestly a bit shocked at first bcoz we had talked abt how he would love to marry me someday and I didn't rly understand how to comprehend this info but we talked for like 2 hours and he was genuinely sry and he doesn't seem like he's not over her.

He did say he wants to find that kind of happiness with me and he wants that future with me and he apologized again for being an asshole. I made it clear to him if he ever runs off like that we r done and he agreed and honestly we were both kind of crying by the end of our Convo and i also blocked his ex on my insta (he already had her blocked b4 anyone speculates)

I think i could forgive him. Thank you again for all your help the comments helped a lot. We might try therapy.

Tldr- he came back and we talked abt how he had a panick attack thinking if could be as happy as her and we resolved it out.

ANSWER: i dont understand why people are attacking you in these comments. if i had made it to the stage of moving in with someone and one night they left out of nowhere, id be concerned too, no matter what happened the day before. and while yes he probably just needs time to process the engagement, it wouldve been easy to tell you that. he didnt even have to say it in person or on the phone, he could leave and then send a quick text right after to let you know that he just needed some time alone and that he was alright. you're valid to be upset about this

i understand his distress but it's been 3 and a half years. the least he can do is give you the courtesy of telling you he was leaving to be on his own for a bit instead of letting you wake up alone in the middle of the night and leaving you to panic

QUESTION: UPDATE- Married within a year, and now I’m seeing red flags I ignored before — how do I handle this?(27F/33M)

Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/t08KmdcFxt

Update:

27F/33M

I had a conversation with my husband yesterday and gave him an ultimatum. I brought up therapy again, something I’ve suggested in the past, but he said he can’t do it right now because he’s looking for a job and wants to be financially stable first, which I can understand. However, he also said that even after getting a job, he would only consider therapy, then went on a rant about how therapy is useless.

I told him that if he’s not open to therapy, he could at least speak with a pastor or counselor at our church since that is free. He refused again, saying he has too much on his plate. I even suggested having just one conversation and not committing to anything long-term, but he said he’s tired of me bringing it up.

At this point, I’ve decided to leave. I’m currently looking for a job and hoping things fall into place so I can get my own place soon. I feel scared and heartbroken, but I know it’s necessary. I wish I hadn’t ignored the red flags, but I’m choosing to give myself grace. It’s a terrible feeling, but I know I’ll be okay.

Thank you to everyone who commented on my original post. Your words gave me clarity and courage.

TL;DR: He refused therapy or help, so I’ve decided to leave and start over.

ANSWER: It seemed very clear from the post that he didn't actually want to change, someone who recognised their own insecurities and wanted to change would stop making it yours manage and go to therapy, he's done neither. You've made the right choice.

It sounds like neither of you are currently working, I don't know how you sustained that situation but do you have family or friends you can go stay with so you can leave immediately? Even if that involves moving, it's not like you have a job tying you to your current area - which obviously isn't great financially but freeing in terms of leaving and starting afresh.

QUESTION: My (35f) mil (60f) only wants provide childcare for our daughter(3 months f) not our son (3m) and my wife (33f) and I are not on the same page as how to handle this.

Hi everyone,

My mother-in-law initially offered to help with childcare one day a week and seemed enthusiastic. However, after our daughter was born, she made it clear she only wants to care for her. She claims it’s “fair” because she didn’t help with our son when he was a baby and my mother did.

For context, we did offer before our son was born and my mother offered, but when we asked, my mil reacted like a deer in headlights, so we dropped it. We’ve had multiple discussions since, explaining that we don’t agree with her only wanting one child, and she seemed to understand—but a week later, she goes back to only wanting to care for our daughter and pretending we agreed to that.

We’re unsure why this is happening. It might be because we’re a lesbian couple and she only wants to bond with the child she is biologically related to, or maybe she wasn’t ready before but is now. Either way, she has said multiple times that she doesn’t want to take care of our son. She has said this in front of our son.

I feel like the weekly childcare arrangement is off because I don’t trust her to care for both children equally. My wife feels that we haven’t explicitly said she must take both children or none, and that we should give her a chance.

This argument is devolving in my wife saying I'm trying to isolate her from her parents and I'm treating her like she is a bad person. I just want to protect our kids. I don't know what to do anymore. Should I truly offer her another chance?

tl;dr my wife and I heavily disagree how we should handle my mil wanting to play favourites with childcare

ANSWER: Why do I feel like because your wife gave birth to your daughter and you gave birth to your son, your MIL thinks daughter is her grandchild while son is NOT?

Have you ever asked your wife, what would she tell your son when he asks “Why Grammy never let me stay” or “Why Grammy doesn’t like me” or “Why Grammy always prioritize little sister”?

This is something you should clear with your wife first, because she is enabling her mom’s favoritism and her way of not counting your son as family. What if she escalates? What if she tries to exclude your son in family activities? What if resentment builds between your children due to Grammy?

QUESTION: My boyfriend (33M) keeps saying “Have fun on your date” whenever I (32F) leave the house — how do I get him to stop?

Almost every time I leave the house, my boyfriend says something like “Have fun on your date.” Sometimes he’ll even text it to me after I’ve gone.

There’s absolutely no reason for him to think I’d be seeing anyone else. Nothing’s ever happened that would make him suspicious — he just says these things out of nowhere. I find it really disrespectful and gross. I’ve never cheated, never given him a reason to doubt me, and I don’t even have anyone else in my life I could “go on a date” with.

We’ve lived together almost the entire year we’ve been dating. He didn’t used to say things like this, but now he’s constantly making passive-aggressive comments if I’m on my phone, like:

“If you want to talk to someone else, just do it.”
“You don’t have to hide that you’re talking to another guy.”

I’ve told him many times how offensive and damaging these comments are, but he doesn’t care — he seems to truly believe that what he is doing is somehow harmless.   I feel my respect for him slipping every time he does it. I’m honestly at the point where, if we didn’t live together, I’d already have broken up with him. Unfortunately, it is not going to be easy to separate from him at this point or for awhile due to financial reasons.

How should I handle this behavior when he refuses to take it seriously?

Also, how can I articulate the reason why this feels so gross ? I am struggling to find the words.

⸻

TL;DR:
My boyfriend keeps making sarcastic comments like “Have fun on your date” whenever I leave the house, even though I’ve never given him any reason to distrust me. I’ve told him it’s disrespectful, but he doesn’t stop. What should I do?

ANSWER: “If we didn’t live together I’d already have broken up with him”

You answered your own question about what to do next. It just requires the additional step of also moving out.

QUESTION: My mom found out about my private life and says she’ll never forgive me. I don’t know what to do.

I (27F) come from a conservative religious background.  I live abroad now, but recently something happened that completely broke my relationship with my mom (55F).

I gave her my old phone because hers stopped working. Before giving it away, I deleted WhatsApp, thinking all my private conversations were gone. Unfortunately, when she reinstalled it, all my old chats were restored — including some very personal messages and “flirty” conversations.

When she saw them, she was devastated and furious. She said I had brought shame, that I was no longer her daughter, and that she regretted giving birth to me. She blocked me, then unblocked me just to say hurtful things like calling me names. She even told me not to tell my relatives that we don't talk anymore, or she'd show them everything so they'd know the truth about me.

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. She had warned me that if it happened again, she would cut me off — and this time, she did.

I feel destroyed inside. I keep blaming myself, but at the same time, I feel like her reaction is too extreme. I know what I did isn’t acceptable in her eyes, but it hurts to lose my mom like this.
I’m far from home, I feel ashamed and empty, and I don’t know how to move forward.

Has anyone else gone through something like this — especially in a strict religious family? How did you cope with losing your parent emotionally, even if they’re still alive?

EDIT : For context, these messages were related to my active sexual life, so she's hurting for knowing that I'm sexually active.

TL;DR: My mom (55F) found out about parts of my private life that go against our religious background, feels deeply betrayed, and refuses to forgive me. I (27F) love her but don’t know if I should try to contact her again or let her go.

ANSWER: >I keep blaming myself,

The worst choice here is to blame yourself for living your own life.

Your mom is hateful and willing to drop her own daughter because she sent flirty messages. Someone willing to do that is a shameful, awful person.

To move forward, you have to understand exactly this, that your mother is not a good person and that you may be better off without her, even though it hurts now.

QUESTION: My, 40F, husband, 45M,been living with my dad for work. I think he’s cheating.

I, 40F, have been with my husband Brian (fake name), 45M, for almost two decades. We have four kids. A few years ago, we moved from our hometown, a major city, to a smaller, quiet town about three hours away in another state. At the time, we only had our two oldest children, and childcare wasn’t an issue.

Brian was able to find employment fairly quickly when we moved, and I worked from home full-time, which gave me the opportunity to care for our kids, the home, and our marriage. Things were great until I became pregnant with our now third child and developed some health issues.

Because Brian had to call out frequently due to my hospitalizations during the pregnancy, he was eventually forced to resign from his job due to attendance and performance. During delivery, there was an accident and my baby and I almost didn’t survive. The baby was in the NICU for months recovering. She is now a happy and mostly healthy baby. After she came home, Brian worked odd jobs to bring in money, but his primary concern was making sure the kids and I were okay.

A few days before our youngest turned 1, we found out that we were having our fourth and last child. That pregnancy was tough as well, but things went relatively okay until delivery. During the delivery, I was injured by my surgeon, which prevented me from caring for my newborn and our other kids. I was on bed rest for a few months recovering from the C-section and the injury.

Brian waited on me hand and foot and worked reduced hours. We lived off savings and my disability checks from my employer. My father also sent money to help us out. Once I recovered, I returned to work full-time, but Brian wasn’t able to find steady employment. We made things work for a while, but unexpected expenses in the home and with our taxes drove up our costs.

Eventually, Brian found a full-time job back in our home city; great pay, benefits, and room for overtime. My father offered to let him live with him so he wouldn’t have to commute six hours a day or pay any bills while there. Brian was hesitant to leave because I’d still been dealing with health issues since our last child, but I assured him I’d be fine.

At first, things were great. When he moved in with my dad, Brian would call and text frequently; during his breaks, lunches, and in the evenings. We’d video chat for hours while he talked to me and the kids. On Fridays, he’d come home and visit until early Monday mornings. I’d drive him to work with our two youngest kids, then drive back home. Sometimes, the kids and I would go up Friday afternoon to visit him and my dad and drive back Sunday so he wouldn’t be burnt out.

But then the calls started to slow down. I figured he was busy or tired. One night, because we share locations, I checked the app around 10 p.m. and saw he was at a bar. I texted him, asking what was up. He responded around 3 a.m., saying he’d gone out with friends after work. I felt uncomfortable but told myself not to be insecure. I told myself that Brian deserved to unwind after everything he’d done for me and the kids.

The late nights at bars and restaurants continued for a few weeks. The money in our joint account started depleting from his outings to the point where I had to remind him we needed the money for bills. He stopped coming home on weekends, and when I visited, he seemed distant and glued to his phone.

I asked if everything was okay with him and with us. He said it was. I asked about his new friends, but his answers were vague.

One weekend at my dad’s house, Brian was in another room when his phone rang. The name “V” popped up with no picture. I’d never heard that name before. A few minutes later, my dad’s phone rang. I heard him briefly say something to the person on the phone, then tell Brian to “check his phone when he gets a chance.” Brian picked it up, sent a text, looked at me, and set the phone down face-first. I asked who it was. He just said, “A friend.”

My insecurities got the best of me, so I looked through Brian’s Facebook. He doesn’t post much, but suddenly, all his profile pictures had new “likes” from someone who had me blocked. Using my old unused account (under my maiden name), I found that person. It was a woman named Vanessa, 33F.

On her public page, I saw photos of her and Brian at bars, restaurants, and, heartbreakingly, in my father’s living room and building lobby. In every photo, Vanessa was hugged up on Brian or wrapped around his arm. His wedding ring was off. She tagged him in the photos, but the tags didn’t appear on his profile.

I was devastated. Instead of confronting him right away, I packed up the kids and went home. Brian didn’t protest and seemed clueless. My dad asked if I was okay; I said I didn’t feel well and wanted to leave. Brian quietly helped me pack.

I took screenshots of everything. That was three weeks ago.

Since then, I haven’t talked to Brian much. When he calls, I hand the phone to whichever kid is closest, even the one-year-old. I’ve focused on work and the kids, but I keep checking Vanessa’s page and taking more screenshots as she posts more pictures.

Last night, Brian texted asking why I’d been distant. Furious, I sent him all the screenshots. For about ten minutes, I saw the typing bubble appear and disappear. Then he finally replied: “She’s just a coworker.”

I asked him how he’d feel if I were constantly out with a coworker, hugged up in photos. No reply. I asked why he brought this coworker to my father’s house. He said, “Just to introduce them.” I asked why he hadn’t introduced any other coworkers. Silence.

It’s been about nine hours and I haven’t heard from him since. I’m heartbroken. I don’t want to be a divorced single mom, but I refuse to live in with this kind of disrespect.

Advice needed: What should my next steps be?

TL;DR:
My husband (45M) and I (40F) have been together nearly 20 years and have 4 kids. He took a good job back in our hometown and moved in with my dad to avoid a long commute. At first he called and visited often, but then he got distant, started going out drinking, and stopped coming home. I found Facebook photos of him with a younger woman (33F) out at bars, restaurants, and even at my dad’s house, with his wedding ring off. When I confronted him, he said she’s “just a coworker” and hasn’t spoken to me since. I’m heartbroken and unsure what to do next.

ANSWER: Idk what’s worse about this story. Everything he’s doing or the fact that not only did the dad cover for him the whole time, he is also communicating with this woman on behalf of your husband, and right in front of you.  Im sorry, that’s fucked up and I hope you find your way through it. You should not let yourself be treated like that no matter if it makes you a single divorced person.

QUESTION: Found my partner’s old divorce case online — don’t know what to believe now

I (27F) have been seeing a man (35M) for about four months. He’s divorced and has a young daughter. He told me that his marriage ended because of his ex’s accusations and that she was a narcissist.

I just found their divorce case online. It matches what he told me but with details that shocked me: ICU stay, which I knew about, but it mentions seizure from alcohol use, bottles hidden around the house, and his ex claiming he wasn’t safe around their kid.

He told me those things were exaggerated and that the judge ruled in his favor for 50/50 custody, which is true. But now I’m stuck between believing that he’s genuinely recovering and worrying that he still drinks or minimizes it. We smoke weed together sometimes, and he seems totally functional—steady job, great dad, responsible—but I can’t shake the fear that I’m missing something.

I don’t want to judge him unfairly, but I also don’t want to ignore red flags. What’s a fair, healthy way to ask about this without sounding accusatory or controlling?

Tl;dr: found the court case for the guy I'm dating. It mentions that he's an alcoholic to a dangerous level. He's told me that his ex accused him of different things to get full custody, but I'm now concerned.

ANSWER: I say trust your gut. Like, easy as that, trust your gut, girl. Think about it since you’re having to ask reddit.

I once met a guy who seemed okay, but then he got kinda stalkerish and I tried to brush it off because he was very good friends with my friend group. It wasn’t getting better and I looked him up; turns out he was on probation and parole for breaking a girl’s jaw after she broke up with him (and breaking that no contact order). That was shocking, but the biggest shock was that my other friends knew not only how uncomfortable he made me, but they knew about that incident and never told me. Stopped all contact with all of them immediately and called his parole officer.

QUESTION: My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) live together: I found out how he sees the world, now I don’t know if I should stay.

(Re-upload with edits: my previous post was removed for formatting.)

My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been together for two years. I live at his house and don’t pay rent (it’s one of his parents’ properties).

Over the last six months our relationship has been slowly deteriorating. I’ve had multiple conversations with him about how his communication style hurts me and others, and how little effort he puts into understanding me.

A few examples:
1 Once, I mentioned seeing a male friend and he spent the dinner spiraling into topics like calling himself (grandparents immigrated from Italy to Aus) as “ethnic” as my Asian/Middle Eastern best friend, saying “no one should be friends with Germans, we’ve moved on too fast from the Holocaust,” and “old people don’t deserve respect.” It was bizarre and uncomfortable.

2 When we need to solve small domestic issues (like fixing a drain), he often derails the conversation into his own feelings rather than focusing on the task, getting visibly upset at me.

3 When I’m overwhelmed and trying to self-regulate by being quiet or still, he panics and asks what he did wrong, which forces me to comfort him instead of calming myself.

4 I’m autistic, and my tone can be flat. He often misreads it as hostility, especially around practical or “adult” topics.

5 The other night, he made fun of the way I walked and looked, even doing a hurtful impression. I said “that’s not a nice thing to do to your girlfriend,” and he exploded into, “what about thank you for cooking dinner? Why is it never thank you?”

The breaking point came this week when we took our puppy to be de-sexed. I filled out the vet consent form while he watched. Because I’d be at work during the procedure, I made sure the clinic knew to call him first. I signed my own name at the bottom (as the form requires) and added his details below. Later that day, I discovered a private ChatGPT thread where he described the whole event with anger and resentment, accusing me of being controlling and writing my phone number in its required section (above his) to “belittle” him. Reading that was shattering. It showed me how warped his perception of me has become.

That’s been our pattern: I act from practicality or care, he interprets it as attack or disrespect.

I wouldn’t call our relationship abusive. Most days are neutral, some are lovely, and about 10–20% of the time things get really painful. He’s affectionate and loving, and I truly love him and the life we’ve built: our home, our routines, our puppy. But when anything serious happens, he becomes reactive, defensive, or mean, and I end up feeling small and unseen.

Logistically, leaving is hard. I work part-time (four days a week) and study at university. If I rent, I’ll have around $400 a week to live on. That means shared custody of the dog, major financial stress, and losing the most comfortable home I’ve ever had. But staying means continuing to feel unheard and distorted.

My question: How do I decide whether to stay or leave when the relationship isn’t entirely bad but feels fundamentally incompatible? What concrete steps can I take to make the right decision?

TL;DR: My boyfriend believes I am antagonising him when I’m taking care of logistics or myself. He’s great most of the time and I love the life we share beyond these issues, but I’m worried I’ll never see him the same. I’d appreciate advice on how to move forward and protect my peace.

ANSWER: Your boyfriend is mentally unwell OP.  Take the dog and find a place of your own. There are reg flags all over the place with your BF.

QUESTION: Husband recycled a proposal from the previous relationship.

tl;dr husband proposed in the same exact way, word for word, location etc as he did with his previous relationship. How do I get over this?

I '33F' just found out that my husband '35M' of 7 years, proposed to me in the same exact way as he proposed to his ex wife. 
Same day, Xmas eve, same exact location and used the same shpiel. Thankfully he didn't use the same damn ring too.....

It's not a situation where he wasn't over the ex. I truly think it's just pure lack of originality or imagination. 
Idk if I'm being dramatic but I am hurt and sick over this. I've cried non stop. Can't look at him or even talk to him. I gave him the ring back and told him to do it over and make it special. I wanted my own. But honestly, if he does, idk if that would make me feel better. How do I move passed this? 
This isn't something I would leave him over but it is something that has definitely hurt our relationship. 
Any suggestions on how to work through this?

ANSWER: He lacks originality.  I found out my husband took his second wife on a honeymoon on the same vacation that was the only out of the region vacation the two of us ever went to.  While he was having an affair with her, he was introducing him to the same restaurants I had introduced him to in this city, and my favorite restaurant became "their place."  I would not really move past that myself, to be honest with you.  In fact, he's married to his third wife, and they own a hobby shop based on the only hobby I ever had when married to him, a hobby he used to make fun of me doing.

QUESTION: How do I tell my husband I’m uncomfortable with him staying with a female colleague on work trips?

I was going to post this on AITAH but since I’m 95% sure I’m not the asshole, I guess I’m looking for relationship advice instead. Soooo… would I be the asshole if I \[38f\] told my husband \[40m\] I don’t want him to stay with a colleague \[45F, single\] when they travel together for work?

My husband and Colleague are part of a dozen independently contracted people within a professional creative group, which manages projects with clients. Husband and Colleague find their work to be complimentary, so they’re hoping to work on more projects together. Husband and I live in City A, we’re from City B (where both sets of parents live), and City C is where Professional Group and Colleague are based.

Last time Husband was working in City C he stayed on Colleague’s couch. Fine, whatever, not a big deal for a one-off thing. Then he had a job in City B last week that she worked with him on, and they stayed at his parents house together Tues-Saturday. To clarify: City B is my hometown, where my family also lives. I didn’t know about this until he was on the way out the door Tuesday. If he had mentioned it I probably would have said “oh, wouldn’t everyone be more comfortable if she was put up in a hotel?” Granted, budget was a consideration, but my feeling is that if the group, client, or husband can’t afford an assistant on a project, then it can’t be a requisite for the job. And this isn’t a one time scenario, he plans to keep working with her, so this will definitely come up again in some iteration.

Relationship background: Husband and I have been together for 4 years, married for 6 months. We were actually together for a while 15 years ago but our paths diverged. In a crazy full circle way we were brought back together and I’m happier than I’ve ever been in a partnership. Our relationship is based on mutual respect and admiration, and he is extremely loyal when it comes to friends, family, and me. I want to make it clear that I trust him 100%. This isn’t about infidelity, it’s about boundaries and respect and how he shows that he cares about my feelings.

All week I’ve been dealing with icks and ughs about this. It’s been occupying a huge portion of my thoughts. I was by myself while they were working together every day, sharing meals, presumably hanging out until bedtime? And then of course there are my irrational, neurotic thoughts like “did he make coffee for her every morning? Did she use my MIL’s shampoo? Does he think she’s cooler than me? Is he going to run off to City C because it’s way more rewarding than our life together??” I hate that I’m this insecure and jealous and prone to ruminating on this stuff. Yes, I have a therapist, yes, we talk about this sort of thing.  It might be different if I had met Colleague or knew ANY details about her at all. All I know about her is that they have a lot in common and she’s apparently comfortable with this level of familiarity with a married colleague.

I’m already prepared for how it will go if I bring this up. His reaction at best is going to be invalidating my feelings in the guise of reassurance (“you’re being silly! That’s ridiculous, what are you worried about?”) or defensive (“why are you admonishing me when I’ve done nothing wrong?”) He bristles when it comes to personal critique, which makes it hard to express my feelings sometimes. He’s not one to conform to the conventions of society, so me saying “this is objectively inappropriate” or “this simply isn’t done” would not be useful arguments. He usually means well, but can be really blind to how his actions affect me. I’m really hoping that me saying I’m uncomfortable is enough for him to agree to the very reasonable request of getting Colleague a damn hotel room next time.

Ok, so here’s a part I was on the fence about adding in, because all of the above is enough for being upset, but it’s important in the context of my emotional needs not being prioritized (and it definitely adds to my sensitive emotional state). My mom died 3 months ago, so I drove up to City B on Friday to prep for my mom’s Sunday memorial celebration. I thought Husband was going to join me at my parent’s house across town Friday night, but I guess there was a miscommunication and he had to do a bit more work on this project Saturday. We talked about this on the phone Thursday and he told me he was probably going to stay with his parents Saturday night too, so Colleague wouldn’t be uncomfortable at the house without him there. I basically told him no, I needed him with me. I honestly can’t even believe he entertained the idea of prioritizing her comfort over my need for his support during a huge emotional life event. A few days before the memorial.

I love this person. I trust him, but I’m frustrated and sad. Why is he such a dummy when it comes to all this shit?? The big work job is done, and we got through the memorial. Now I guess I’m looking for some communication advice, some validation, and maybe personal experience. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this.

tl;dr: Husband is overfamiliar with a female colleague. He doesn’t think it’s a problem, but the real issue is that he's oblivious to how this makes me feel. I’m not sure how to raise it without him getting defensive.

ANSWER: Okay so this

Does not jive with this

I’m already prepared for how it will go if I bring this up. His reaction at best is going to be invalidating my feelings in the guise of reassurance (“you’re being silly! That’s ridiculous, what are you worried about?”) or defensive (“why are you admonishing me when I’ve done nothing wrong?”)

There’s some cognitive dissonance going on here and tbh I think this perfect marriage full of admiration and respect is a story you’re telling yourself. Because I’m not seeing much respect coming from his side. And I think you’re being naive to say there’s definitely no infidelity going on. He’s having this woman stay at his parents’ house, that’s so far beyond the boundaries of a work relationship it borders on hilarity.

And now he’s trying to abandon you in your time of need to make her more comfortable? At best this is an emotional affair. At worst it’s already turned physical.

QUESTION: My bf (M23) stood me (F22) up on Halloween and doesn’t know why

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years, and he’s always been amazing, but on Halloween, he stood me up and can't explain why. I want to forgive him, but I am still so upset.

We both had different events to go to first, but we agreed that we’d meet up later at a club, which is something we had discussed all week. I knew he was with friends, so I told him he could invite them, but that regardless of what his friends where doing we were going to go out. I texted around 9 PM that I was ready, and he replied saying he was picking up his friends and would meet me at the club. I told him it was a 20-minute walk for me, so he should let me know when he was heading out.

I didn’t hear back from him until 11:40 PM when he texted saying he was finally on his way. By then, I would’ve gotten there around midnight, and I wasn’t comfortable walking through downtown that late. Plus, he and his friends ended up not even going in because the lines were too long. So, basically, I spent hours doing intricate makeup and dressing up all so that I could be stood up by my own bf.

What made it even worse was that the next day was Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead/ celebrate the dead), which was really important to me as I’m Latina, and I just lost my grandpa. My boyfriend was supposed to help me set up my grandpa’s shrine and make food, but he completely forgot.

He came over with gifts to apologize, but his only explanation was, “I’m sorry, I don’t know what happened.” When I asked if he thought it was okay for a woman to walk alone downtown that late, he lied and said he would’ve gotten me an Uber, but nowhere in his messages did he mention that. He also tried to play it off as “miscommunication,” when it was really just a lack of communication on his part. I told him I needed space and sent him home.

Later, when he apologized again, he kept saying that thinking about what he did makes him upset and sick. Normally I appreciate when he expresses his feelings, but I told him that in this case, I truly didn’t care how he felt because I was the one who was wronged and upset. I don’t know if that was too harsh, but I genuinely don’t understand how him being nauseous was supposed to help me feel any better.

The next day, after some pushing, he said he’s been emotionally checked out because of how stressful his doctorate program has been and that he forgets things easily when they’re not “in front of him.” I don’t really know what to make of that.

He’s always been supportive and kind before this, especially when my grandpa passed. I don’t think he’s cheating, which I know is always possible, but cheating is one of his biggest fears, so I doubt this is the case. This whole situation isn’t typical for him, but his explanation feels weak, and I’m not sure how to move forward. I want to forgive him, but I also feel really hurt and disappointed.

How would you handle something like this? Should I try to talk to him again, or just give him more space?

ANSWER: He was out enjoying himself with his friends and totally ‘forgot’ he was supposed to be meeting up with you. He doesn’t want to admit that, so his ‘I don’t know what happened’ isn’t true, and is flimsy at best. And the fact he thought it would be okay for you to walk to a club at that time is absolutely ridiculous plus, and I’m just guessing, he was too hungover to help you the following day when you really needed his support. All in all, he hasn’t exactly covered himself in boyfriend glory, has he? Updateme!

QUESTION: I want to divorce my husband. But he wants another chance. Am I being heartless?

Hi reddit. Like the title says, I (f31) want to divorce my husband (m32), but i'm afraid I may be acting too quickly? For context, we've been together for 12 years, married for 3. He's always had a strong temper and frankly, my parents never fully approved of our relationship because of it. I'm the complete opposite, shy, eternally optomistic, a little too nice (husband says I'm a pushover). Anyway, while we dated he would often be rude to me but his excuse was that he was stressed out from college or he was tired, or he had something else going on. And I believed him.

Fast forward to our first year of marriage, and I found out the hard way that it wasn't college or any of that. It was just his actual personality. He hates talking about, well, anything. We never talk about money which is outrageous to me because we're married, I can't talk to him about family drama because it annoys him, can't talk about my feelings because he'll get mad, insult me and walk away. He's not only rude to me now but to my parents too. Despite the fact that they've given us a house, a piece of land, helped us get out of a debt, etc. And I could not be more embarassed.

Mostly, I feel stupid. My parents warned me again and again. My dad especially, because he noticed early on how different we were. But my husband always said opposites attract (sounds kind of stupid now). And he wasn't as mean then as he is now, in fact, he got along great with my parents back then. He even got them gifts and things. Now, he's moody all the time but even moreso when we go over to their house. He won't even engage in conversation, all he does is look down at him phone the entire time. It honestly feels like he doesn't care about being part of the family. Whenever someone tries to give him adive, he doesn't take it well, like he's smarter than everyone else and there's nothing you can say to him that he doesn't already know. The few times we do talk, we end up arguing because everything I say is always wrong and "i don't know what I'm talking about" or "I'm ignorant". Mind you, we both have college degrees. All in all, I'm just so disapointed and embarrased by the kind of person he is. Btw, he's not like that around his friends.

I brought up the possibility of getting a divorce during an argument and he's been nicer to me ever since. But I've seen this side of him before. He's promised to change in the past and has said that he can't live without me. This is the only time I've truly seen him so remorseful though.

TD;LR: Am I being too rash in suggesting to my husband that we divorce because of how he treats me? Should I give him another chance?

ANSWER: No, you're not being too rash to divorce someone who is not nice to you or your family and has never been, who insults you and who you can't communicate with. In fact, I have no idea why you've stayed with him this long.

QUESTION: How can I (21M) make my Chinese dad (61M) get a life?

The title might sound a bit harsh, but I honestly don’t know how else to phrase it.

There’s a lot to unpack here, but here I go (TL;DR at the bottom):

My dad is a Chinese immigrant who moved to California in the early 2000s. To this day, he hasn’t learned much English, which has really limited his ability to explore new things — even simple stuff like trying non-Chinese restaurants. Over time, that’s made him more closed off and unwilling to try anything new.

He’s naturally introverted, and with his difficult personality and years of working tirelessly since coming here, he’s struggled to make friends. As a result, he doesn’t have many hobbies or much of a social life.

Now that he finally has more free time, I’ve been trying to get him to enjoy life a bit more — to go out, meet people, or pick up a hobby. But whenever I suggest something, he just says things like “There’s nothing to do here in America” or “Nothing interests me.” I know those are excuses — I think it’s hard for him because he can’t read or speak English, so everything outside his comfort zone feels impossible. Still, it’s tough watching him just… fade into routine.

I’d love to know if anyone has gone through something similar or has advice on how to help a parent like this.

Some background that might be helpful:  
My dad doesn’t have the best relationship with our family (my mom, sister, and me). He wasn’t really a great husband or father figure when I was growing up. He and my mom fought a lot, mostly because he’d spend so much time at the casino playing poker — which he insists “isn’t gambling” because it “takes skill” and “helps him relieve stress.” But back then, we were struggling financially, living in affordable housing, so it only made things worse.

He also had a lot of anger issues and poor communication skills. He couldn’t empathize or see things from my mom’s point of view, which led to constant fighting. My sister ended up developing lasting trauma from it, and I’ve always had a hard time talking to him too.

That said, something changed earlier this year. We visited some old family friends — people who somehow have stuck by him despite knowing his flaws — and they had yet another intervention with him. This time, it seemed to click. Around the same time, I broke down in front of him and told him how all of this affected me. I think that really got through to him, because since then, he’s been trying to change, little by little.

Honestly, I’m still conflicted. Writing this all out makes me realize how complicated it is. My dad isn’t the best person, but he’s still my dad — and I know he did what he could with what he had. I just want to help him find a way to live more meaningfully instead of wasting away.

TL;DR:  
My dad isn’t perfect, but he’s still my dad. He doesn’t have many friends or hobbies, and I want to help him find some so he can live a fuller, happier life. Any advice or similar experiences would really mean a lot.

ANSWER: Your best bet is probably to find out where other senior Chinese guys hang out and take him there. He'll be able to communicate and feel a lot more comfortable. Maybe he'll make friends.

QUESTION: M55 How direct can you be to ask relatives to invite you for the holidays?

I (M55) am suddenly without immediate family: no spouse, no kids and nobody at home with me.

I am dreading the holidays.

I have (1) an aunt, uncle and cousins in one city a few hours away and (2) a brother and his family in another city a few hours away.

I’ve usually just waited for invitations and if they didn’t come, I’d spend holidays with immediate family at my home, but immediate family is now gone.

My sister-in-law has said “we’ve got to get you to come out sometime” and I said, “sure!”, but I don’t know if that was just a general statement or if it was supposed to be an invitation.  My aunt said, “we need to stay in touch” but it would be kind of weird to invite myself to their house.

How do I get an invitation for Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas dinner?

That’s all I need; I can stay in a hotel.

TL;DR: how direct can you be in asking family members for an invitation for the holidays if you’re all alone?

ANSWER: My brother reached out for a thanksgiving one year, he hadn’t been to family events in years. He just said “hey sis, I really wanted to spend the holiday with family, do you have anything going on that I could come to?” damn near broke my fucking heart that I didn’t make it clear enough to him that he’s ALWAYS invited, I didn’t ever think I needed to invite him to these things.

I’m really glad he asked, because now I always invite him.

QUESTION: My (23F) BF (23M) said he’d consider breaking up with me if I changed my appearance and now I can’t look at him the same.

TL;DR:
My BF hates all forms of body modification and has made it clear he doesn’t like when I change my appearance. When I mentioned tattooing over a fading mole, he sternly told me not to “Do that to my face.” When I asked if he’d break up with me over something a bodily change I made he didn’t like, he said yes. He apologized afterward, but I can’t shake how disrespected I feel or how hard it is to be affectionate again.

I (23F) have been dating my BF (23M) “Andre” for a little over 2 years. It’s both our first relationship. Andre has always hated any kind of bodily change: tattoos, piercings, dye, even getting a hand stamp at the bar. He scrubs it off the second we get home.

I’m the opposite. I love tattoos (I have 3), I’ve dyed my hair ginger (naturally blonde), and I have a few piercings. Since we started dating, though, I’ve only added one ear piercing and changed my hair tint slightly. Whenever I bring up wanting something new (like tattoos or piercings), he gets visibly uncomfortable. His voice goes high, eyebrows raise, and he starts asking, “How much of a change are you thinking?”

His facial expressions alone have always felt like a subtle threat to our relationship. if I go too far, he’ll stop being attracted to me or even consider leaving. That’s honestly a big part of why I’ve stopped changing my appearance at all.

Earlier this week, I mentioned that a small mole on my nose is starting to lose pigment, and I brought up maybe tattooing over it with brown ink kind of like a freckle tattoo or microblading. His response was instant and firm: “Do not do that to your face.”
That hit me hard. He didn’t even ask why I wanted to do it or how I felt about it just completely shut it down and told me what to do.

Later that night, I texted him and asked, “If I did something to my appearance that you didn’t like, would you break up with me?”
His reply: “Yes, I could see it playing a factor.”
My stomach dropped. I called two of my friends to make sure I wasn’t losing my mind and they both said that was insane. I ignored him for a bit, and when he called back, I ended up yelling at him for almost an hour (which is unlike me). That’s when it seemed to finally hit him how serious this was. He started crying, apologized, and admitted he was being inconsiderate and disrespectful. The next night, he told me he realized how entitled it was to act like he has any say over my body, and that he needs to work on his reactions. He said he understands I’m my own person and that my choices have nothing to do with him.
I told him straight up that he needs to always speak to me like an equal, and that just because he gets to see my body doesn’t mean he gets to control it. I made it very clear if he ever does this again, I’m gone.

I also told him I’m not applying to jobs in his area anymore. Someone who would consider breaking up with me over a freckle doesn’t deserve me moving states for them.
We’re still together, but now I feel… icked out. I don’t want to be affectionate or sweet toward him. even though he’s apologized and seems to be reflecting. I feel like he doesn’t deserve that from me right now, but I also feel mean with giving him nothing to work with.

How do I forgive him? Will that natural affection come back with time? Is it harder because we live far apart? I get forgive but don’t forget, but how?

ANSWER: Relationship aside, please be careful about tattooing over your mole. You want to be able to monitor moles for changes and tattooing over it could get in the way of that.

QUESTION: How do I (26F) break up with my fiancé (28M) of 7 yrs without destroying him? The timing feels cruel.

See my last post about why…

TL;DR:
I love my fiancé but know the relationship needs to end. He lives with me in my family’s home, is struggling in school, and has a birthday/holidays coming up. Ending things now feels cruel, but pretending until the end of the year also feels wrong. How do I break up in a way that causes the least damage?

I (late 20s F) am at the point where I know I need to end things with my fiancé (late 20s M). I love him, but after reading the feedback on my last post and really sitting with the things I didn’t want to admit, I know I can’t continue this relationship.

The problem is… the timing feels awful.

He currently lives with me in my old family home. It’s not technically either of our places—my parents don’t live here, but two of my adult sisters do. Asking him to leave feels like kicking him out to nowhere, even though he does have family he could go to. I just know it’ll shake his sense of stability.

He’s also really struggling in school. I don’t want to pile this on while he’s barely hanging on academically. College is rough, I’ve been there and completely understand. I’ve told him multiple times that I’m unhappy, but I know this will still blindside him.

Part of me wants to end things now because living like this—acting like I’m not completely torn—feels emotionally draining and dishonest. But the other part of me wants to wait until the semester is over… except then it’s his birthday in mid-December, and then Christmas. It feels cruel no matter what.

I’m torn between doing what’s healthiest for me vs. trying to protect him from more stress.
Do I need to end it now, or should I let him have the end of the year without adding this pain?
Any advice on how to do this in the least damaging way is appreciated. Honestly I’m not sure if I’m mentally prepared for it now - please give me your honest advice I’ve never had to break up like this before

ANSWER: The only reason to delay ANYTHING about this would be to give him a chance to get his bearings and find a better living situation.

Which would sorta mean breaking up with him and then giving him a week or two or more to sort of figure out his next living situation.

There's no point in delaying through Christmas just to wait until the ball drops on New Year to shout "Surprise, we're breaking up! Pack your shit!"

Also... you need to brace yourself for being the "bad guy" here. There is only so much you can do here to soften this landing. You are about to wreck this dude's whooole existence. The odds of getting a handshake and a thanks for the memories card is... low.

QUESTION: My gf (F23) is trying to move in with me (M31) way too soon

I (M31) started dating his new person (F23) back in July. Things were going great and we decided to make our relationship official after a vacation a few weeks ago.

The problem happened as soon as we got back from vacation. She lives with her mom and apparently when she got back home, she got into this big fight with her mom's bum ass boyfriend. Now she refuses to go back home until homeboy moves out. I'm trying to be a good boyfriend and let her stay with me for a while, but "a while" is starting to feel permanent. Her mom's boyfriend doesnt even have a job and theres no sign of him moving out any time soon. It doesn't help that my apartment is tiny and I hate not having space to myself.

A couple days ago she asked me if we could get a place together when my lease ends in February, and since she's already living with me, that would mean she permanently moved in 2 days after becoming my girlfriend. Thats way too fast for me and tbh it feels like shes taking advantage of my kindness and resources. I genuinely don't know what to do because I don't want to kick her out with no place to go but I also don't feel comfortable with her moving in on such short notice. How can we resolve this problem?

TL;DR girlfriend of 2 days is trying to live in my tiny apartment now

ANSWER: Well, first of all, if you date a woman eight years younger than you she’s gonna be in a different place in life and have different expectations. That should be a no-brainer. You want a grownup, date a grownup.

That said, you’re going to have to have a conversation with her and however you put it, she will feel rejected and upset. Just be prepared to remain calm and kind. Explain that you’re not ready to live with someone. That you need her to have a plan for her living arrangements that isn’t just live with you.

QUESTION: Update: How do I (27 M) get my gf (24 F) to understand that I can’t do it all on my own. Is this the end?

My last post on this [(can be found here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ok0qa9/how_do_i_27_m_get_my_gf_24_f_to_understand_that_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) got a lot of responses so I wanted to give a recent update.

A couple days after that post, on November 1st my family had a Halloween party. We attended as we have been staying with my parents. It was fun, it was going good. I allowed myself to just relax, had a few drinks which I don’t often. I “let loose”. This all came crumbling down though when my gf made a comment/joke about getting married. She asked “Do you want to marry me?” I said “Yes!” She asked “so when are we getting married?” I said “When we get married!” she responded “So you don’t want to marry me” I responded “That’s not what I’m saying” and then it got quiet. Now mind you, this was a few hours into the party, after we had a good bit to drink. So it wasn’t really the time or place to have a serious conversation about our future marriage.

Later we are in our room, to escape the party for a bit. She says sorry. I tell her thank you. She says something about how it was just joke. I tell her that the joke isn’t really funny given we’ve had all of these conversations regarding issues we’ve been having, how before we even really think about getting married I’d like for us to be out of my parents house again. She says she wishes joking about marriage wasn’t a stressor. I said that it isn’t just about the marriage, it’s about the accusation that I don’t want to. When I’ve been trying so hard to get us to a point where we have our own place, where I can afford a ring, where we have finances to plan a wedding. And know we are having a good foundation for our shared future. And the fact I reassure her nearly every week. I do so many things to show her I love her, care about her, and want a future. So when she says things like that, I feel unheard in how much I am struggle to carry all of this by myself.

The rest of the convo is a bit of a blur (alcohol and it being late doesn’t help), but it turns into a fight. It went on for about 2 hours. Which really sucks, because I’ve said time and time again I’m really uncomfortable having these conversations while we’ve had drinks and when it’s late. But nonetheless there we are.

I tell her that I don’t want to get married until I feel like I can depend on her. She says that I can, that she listens to me when I talk about work. I tell her that I mean like seriously depend on her, like what if I lose my job? What if I get deathly ill? I want to feel like we aren’t totally fucked, because she will be able to be there for us. I tell her about how we were supposed to have a check-in mid-October, to discuss her progress on things we had talked about fixing in July to keep the relationship going. That we never had that check-in, and it is past that but she hasn’t done these things. I told her I was glad that our conflicts had become less, but that these things were still not being met. She immediately got defensive and said “so how long were you going to wait to talk to me about this if I didn’t joke about marriage?” I said “not long at all, I was getting my thoughts together, and deciding when we should sit down and talk. October just ended.” She ends up telling me about how she has looked into a program at our old university and how she has had two phone calls with them that led nowhere. I was aware of one of these. I asked if she had ordered her transcript and applied to FAFSA like we talked about. She said no. She said it’s all confusing and she doesn’t know what to do. That it’s “hard.” I tell her “You can ask for help when you starting do it and I’ll help. you know when I was looking at going for my masters recently, I applied to both FAFSA and got my transcript in one day. It isn’t hard too hard.” she then brings up us having different capacities.

It some how derails and we are talking about the past. It’s hard to remember all that was said or how we got there. But I do remember telling her how it’s hard to trust her, because she hasn’t done these things, and because right before her psychosis this year, she admitted to me, that early in our relationship she had been posting nudes on a secret Snapchat to try and sell them, browsed Tinder, and apparently had her coworkers thinking I was abusive, that we were in an open relationship, etc. She justified the nudes by saying she was trying to make us money (which we didn't need to do, as I had a teaching job at this time. Also I don't have an issue with some posting nudes online, it's that we had talked about it early on, as she used to do it, and I told her I just didn't want the one's she sent me to be the same one's she posted, because I wanted to feel special, and then SHE decided she didn't want to do it anymore), and that she only did it like once a month, and didn’t do it for that long. And also that it never came up. As if I was supposed to know and ask?? She didn’t respond to the Tinder thing. She also said she didn’t know why her coworkers thought that of me, that she always told them how great I was. She said she speculates it’s because they thought it was odd she had a job and needed to work while I had a teaching job. I told her that, the point is she kept that all from me, while I took my first “grown up job” to try and start building our future, and she was doing all of that, and kept it from me for years. She said she was super supportive of me during that time.

We end up back to the original topic of what we had agreed she would do. I said something about how she has had 3 and a half months to make real progress and figure these things out, and she has done less than what I managed to do in a single morning. She got upset and she said very angrily “so what you want me to get my transcript, apply for FAFSA, and start applying??” I said “well yeah, that’s what we agreed to. It was either that or find another job.” She was upset that I didn’t see her having a phone call with a university about a program as enough. She said she needed me to see that as a good step. I said it was a good step, but it isn’t what we agreed to by this point. She was upset and said something about “so the conflict being less isn’t good? Because I haven’t done this?” I said “No I’ve said the conflict being less is good, it’s just that this was an important part of what we agreed to.” I had said several times in the conversation I was happy about that. I also around this point reminded her what I said last time we had these talks, which is that if she didn't want to go back to school or get a better job, that it was fine, we would just be wanting different things in life, and I wouldn't hate her for that, I would still love her, we would just not be compatible which happens sometimes. She stated multiple times this is what she wants, this is what she wants to do.

Honestly, this whole thing for me is in fragments. I remember points at which she kept trying to change why we almost broke up in the past. She tried to say she is worried to talk to me because I’ll just “break up” with her. And I had to tell her the reason we have almost broke up, was the first time, it was because I told her I got tremors and heart rate spikes when I felt like we were going to have conflict and she belittled me for it. The second time it was because she continuously ran over my boundaries, and had a whole meltdown that started from her tripping and falling when hanging out with family and being embarrassed. Which then went from me supporting her for being embarrassed and trying to make her feel better, to somehow being accusations that I didn’t love her, and she spiraled for like 4 hours, until nearly 5 AM, threatened to not go to my nephews birthday party with me the next day because I told her I think it’d be best if we continued talking about it in the morning, since we were both tired and have had a few drinks. Which she refused to do, and she blew up my phone and criticized my therapy for “changing me.” These weren’t light hearted moments for me, these weren’t just any conversation leading me to think it may be best for us to part ways. This is the second time she has tried to reframe these scenarios as me casually wanting to leave. Instead of what they truly were, which was her pushing me as far as I could go. She also said it’s my fault she has the job she has. That I “made her take it.” Because I’m the one who found it, and told her to apply to there, to get out of the other job that was making her absolutely miserable. Like that job made her seriously depressed. And that we had agreed it was something she could do while she figured something more long term out. But I never made her take it, I suggested it because the other job made me very worried for her and her mental health.

I had 5 heart rate notifications from my Apple Watch from the stress of this conversation. By the end things had settled, she apologized for not doing more, and asked me to promise I wouldn’t break up with her the next day, the next week, and this year. The party was over and everyone had gone to bed, so I missed out on seeing my aunts for longer as they left before we even woke up the next day.

Since then, I’ve just been feeling very confused. I feel sad, angry, confused, and kind of numb. I feel like I don’t remember everything, so if it seems like it doesn’t make sense, I’m sorry.

I just don’t really know what to think. Part of me really feels like this is the end. I just felt like all of our issues are not being dealt with, and that every issue we’ve had, I have to fight against her rewriting what happened. It’s just so confusing. I love her, I really do, so my heart hurts, but I just feel like things shouldn't be this hard. She's been extremely kind since this conversation, and she submitted to get her transcript. But yeah I just don't know. I am really just exhausted of things being like this, and I really wish we didn't have to have an argument for something to happen.

TLDR: Update from my last post. We had a chat, under not good circumstances. I feel very confused and lost. I think maybe it’s just time to throw in the towel. Is this something that can be fixed? Am I being reasonable?

ANSWER: Hon, she is never going to grow while you’re taking care of (frankly enabling) her. She needs to be on her own to figure shit out, and you deserve better than this. Break up, make it a CLEAN break, no contact, and recover. Once you are outside of the situation, you’re gonna realize how unhealthy it is.

QUESTION: My (30F) boyfriend (28M) doesnt have a job and just got kicked out. Im concerned about him staying at mine. What should I do?

Hey humans, I need perspective. Help a friend out. I (30F) have been dating a guy (28M) for two years.

At the beginning of our relationship I was struck by the depth of our conversations, his (verbal) support of my painting, and how he turned his life around (gave up drugs and alcohol 3 years ago). He took practical steps to show up for me—changed the litter box for my cats, took the recycling out, took my car to get the tires rotated. In the past I dated guys who talked a big game, but never did anything, so I felt so hopeful.

(For extra context, both of my parents are mentally ill drug addicts so there’s lots of pain there and kinda… hope for care? Which I know I need therapy for).

Anyway, while we’ve been together I squared away my first year of a social work masters program and it was the hardest thing Ive ever done. In the meantime, he lost his job 8 months ago and has been playing music on the weekends to scrape by. I told him the high risk of that (lack of savings, etc) was making me nervous. He also really wasnt scraping by bc he didnt have enough money for food… so I started paying. Now I buy almost all of our groceries, and Ive been pleading with him to get a more secure job in addition to music… just a bookstore or something 2 days a week! (or something).

Anyway he wont. He is working really hard to make enough money with music, but he wont get another job. And yesterday he got asked to leave his living situation so… He needs somewhere to land. He’s not from this town, so there aren’t a ton of options. I want to be a good partner and show up, but my nervous system is terrified.

More context: He was asked to leave bc his landlord wanted to move his daughter & her fam into the property. He never missed a rent payment.

He did say he may have found something for work this week, and with losing his housing maybe he’ll be more open to change?

When I question him about the situation I feel like our conversation always ends up with my “trauma.” ie: clearly Im having a big reaction bc I have trauma and it’s not fair to him bc Im not seeing all he does for me.

On top of all of it the uncertainty and anxiety makes me heartbroken bc Im yearning for a “forever home” with someone.

Extra context: before he was asked to leave his place, he was spending most nights at mine anyways. But, it feels different if he were to not have a place of his own.

My question is: If I were a friend, what would you advise me to do? Is it amoral to tell him he cant stay with me? (or maybe to stay with not just me? me part time and his moms part time?) If he does stay here, is there anything I can do to stay sane? (make a chore chart, or something? and have a timeline?). If Im telling him he cant move in… what should I tell him yo do? Im open to the thoughts

TL;DR My (30F) boyfriend (28M) doesnt have a job and just got kicked out. Im concerned about him staying at mine. What should I do?

ANSWER: I think that your gut is telling you something and you should take some time to listen to it. It's not a moral to see that someone isn't willing to really put in the work and effort to build a life and be a partner and want to keep some distance and safety. The fact that you are expressing these concerns and he's chalking them up to "trauma" is really manipulative

QUESTION: How can I help my husband understand that appreciation in marriage should go both ways?

I (29F) and my husband (29M) have been together for 10 years and married for 1. Lately, we’ve been arguing about household responsibilities — but for me, it’s less about chores and more about feeling appreciated.

He often tells me that I should be grateful he helps around the house because he’s the “breadwinner.” I do appreciate everything he does, but I also work full time — 10 to 12 hour shifts, 5 days a week, as a pet groomer. I handle most of the cooking, cleaning, dishes, and general organizing at home. He handles laundry more often, manages the yard and finances, and does most of the grocery shopping.

The grocery part has mostly fallen to him because we’ve been sharing one car. We moved from Philadelphia about two years ago, and until recently, I didn’t have my driver’s license (I used to be really anxious about driving). I finally got my license last week and am now looking for my own car, which will let me help more with errands and take some things off his plate.

Still, when I try to explain that while I’m thankful for what he does, I also deserve gratitude for working and keeping up with the home, it turns into an argument. He takes it as me being ungrateful or trying to “one-up” him, which isn’t what I mean at all. I just want mutual appreciation — not a scoreboard.

How can I bring this up in a way that helps him see that appreciation should go both ways, without it turning into another fight?

TL;DR:
29F married to 29M for 1 year (together 10). My husband says I should be grateful that he helps around the house since he’s the main earner, but I also work full time and handle most housework. I just want him to understand that gratitude should go both ways — how can I communicate that without starting another argument?

ANSWER: You're explaining your reasoning extremely clearly here, and it's a totally reasonable ask - so if he's not "getting" it, it's likely because he doesn't want to. There are a few reasons why that may be, unfortunately none of them are great.

QUESTION: My (21F) partner (21M) just came out as transgender, and I feel confused.

Me (21F) and my partner (21M) have been dating for three years, right before we graduated high school, when she identified as a male. Yesterday, she called me for a serious talk, and told me that she was transgender.

Of course, I want to be by her side and help her with her transition. However, I don’t know what to do, as I see myself only being attracted to men. I don’t want to hurt her because of my sexuality.

I am still so in love with her, and I don’t want to end our relationship, but I see myself as straight. As of now, I can’t see a future with a woman. I don’t know what to do, and I need advice. Should I stay? Should I break up with her? What do I do? The last thing I want to do is hurt her.

TL;DR - My partner just came out as transgender, and I don’t know if I should stay or leave the relationship, as I identify as straight, even though I’m still in love with her.

ANSWER: check out r/mypartneristrans

if you’re not attracted to women, it’s okay to break up - you can support her without being in a romantic relationship

QUESTION: My husband (37M) blames me (35F) for our child being on the autism spectrum

In the pre diagnosis phase he started to shut me out and drink more. She is now officially diagnosed and is a beautiful and happy 3 year old who lives life in her own way. She is minimally verbal and requires a lot of extra support (we are level 2 for those familiar with the level stuffs).

I tried to bring this up. He rejects the notion but isn’t himself. He was my rock and best friend. But I went through a period of time that I couldn’t trust him to take care of her. He let her elope multiple times while I was at work and had to have a home visit from CPS.

I think he is drinking too much and putting us in financial trouble with his drinking and reckless spending. I don’t think divorce is something I want but don’t know how to fix this. How do we move through this? Please do not just say therapy because I have tried.

TL;DR!

We have been friends/ dated since high school. He is a reliable and good person. When I unexpectedly got pregnant with our son (now 8 years old) it was the logical thing to get married and build a life together but now all of that is in jeopardy.

ANSWER: I think the better question is it safe for your child to be in the current environment rather than do you want a divorce. If he is an unsafe person, then you have your answer.

QUESTION: We were ALMOST perfect for six years, bought a house together... then everything fell apart. (Me 25M.. Her 25F)

So me and her been together for 6 years! Everything was great! Even perfect! In my head she was the woman I was going to live my whole life with. We just bought a house and it’s been 2 months we have it. I recently had a harder past 2 months. All my friends were moving some place far so I felt a certain way like I was losing them. So I was a bit more distant, in a mini depression, wanted to do nothing all the time and was always refusing her (let’s say for small activities like walks, etc). I was in my head a lot and was more distant from her and did not really talk about it to her. So she was a bit disconnecting from me.

She, 1 month ago, started to game with a work colleague that she discovered liked playing WOW. They started playing every night and me, not naturally jealous, started to feel things were strange… like she was just watching movies with him online and you know doing stuff she normally would never do.

At a certain point, 2 weeks ago, I asked her if everything was great between us and she then said that she was loving me less. I asked her, shocked and a bit hurt, if she is in love maybe with him or maybe she’s having some feelings for him and she then said yes. My heart shattered… my heart EXPLODED…

We then came to the conclusion where she would stop contacting him. She told him and they stopped talking. The day after she came home and I saw that she was distant. I asked her if she was doubting us and if she still wanted to try working on stuff. She said no, so then we broke up. She moved to her parents’ place...

A week after that she decided that she loved me and wanted to work on us. She came back, I left her as much space as she needed. The first night she spent it on the couch and then the second night she gave me a hug and touched my arm a bit, nothing too serious, and then slept in the same bed with me asking me for a kiss before going to sleep.

The third night I unloaded my bag so I let her know that I feel the guilt, like I fucked up everything by being closed off and being stupid to leave her and not being as much present as I used to be. She after this came in my chest and cuddled me “sensually” and kissed me deeply.

The day after, she came back from work and I saw in her that she was different, a bit weird, bizarre, like she was hiding something. I then asked her if she had something she would like to tell me. She then sat down and told me that she’s not loving me anymore and that she has difficulty trying to work on our relationship and seeing me giving my 2000% for her and she could not give that much to me. She also told me that the whole week she was giving me love not because she wanted to but because she knew I wanted it.

We then had a big conversation, a rough one, and concluded that it’s maybe too early to take the big decision to completely cut off the bridges. The night after I exploded, my heart is destroyed, I don’t know what to think or do anymore, so I go for a car ride alone. She then started texting me a lot. She started asking me where I am and if I want to watch a movie with her. I said yes. We watched the movie, she asked for my hand, I gave her. We then went to bed, she asked me “can I cuddle with you? I need reassurance.” I said yes. We then did some adult stuff...

And now we are 2 days after the movie night. She didn’t tell me I love you or cuddled me since... but this morning before leaving to work she came in the room and kissed me goodbye and said I love you. I love her so much. I have no idea what to do anymore. What to think... I’m lost... I’m hurt... and I want some advice and some exterior advice on my situation.

TL;DR: Been with my girlfriend for 6 years, just bought a house. I went through a rough couple of months and got distant. She started gaming and connecting with a coworker, developed feelings for him, and said she loves me less. We broke up, then she came back saying she wanted to try again, but now she’s unsure and says she doesn’t love me anymore. I’m heartbroken, confused, and don’t know what to do.

ANSWER: Could 2 months of you withdrawing cause this much damage to a 6 year relationship that you describe as great and perfect?

I wonder if she saw it as great and perfect the way that you did.

QUESTION: My fiance (M29) always eats things I leave for myself (F26)/or takes all of the food snacks

My partner and I have been fighting over food lately (or I've been fighting with him). He is always asking if im gonna finish what's on my plate as I'm eating. Or Ill buy snacks and they're all gone before I can have any. Or last week I had wings for lunch and didn't finish them, he just ate them before I got home from work and didn't feel bad at all.

It's frustrating. I tried to bring it up today and he tells me I must have a problem with food because it's weird that I'm upset about it and I shouldn't be upset about wings from a week ago. But I'm obviously not upset about that specific thing. I feel like for me, its just like he doesn't respect my boundary which is why I'm upset.

This feels like a stupid thing to fight over but I just can't stand that I food I want goes missing because I didn't tell him directly "don't eat my leftovers" or "hey save me some caramel bites because I'm gonna want some".

How do I fix this? I don't want to fight with my partner about food. But now he's in our bedroom and told me to leave him alone. Ugh.

TLDR - Fiance eats food I want to save for later every time or snacks in hoping to eat and told me I have a food problem because I'm upset about it.

ANSWER: It's not a stupid thing to fight over. You were looking forward to your little treats and he took them from you with zero consideration for your feelings. Partners shouldn't do that to one another.

Talk to him and tell him clearly: my leftovers are off limits to you unless I say you can eat it. You can share my snacks but it's rude to eat an entire bag of something I bought for myself and not immediately replace it. If he had a non romantic roommate he wouldn't be eating all their food without asking; it's the same thing here.

QUESTION: Is my (34F) husband’s (35m) terrible spending habits a deal breaker or is this salvageable?

My husband and I have been together 10+ years, married for 6, and recently I gave birth to our 2 month old baby. When I was pregnant I discovered that he accrued credit card debt among other things. His debt and loans amounted to $40k, he also spent $6k on a road bike and a mountain bike, spent unknown thousands on collectable cards (Pokémon, baseball), and had no personal savings. He makes great money ($150k+) so it’s extra shocking that he spent so much money to not have savings and end up with debt. He also hid it all from me because he was trying to fix it on his own without me finding out. In the past he also gambled some unknown amount and has also lost $14k by investing all his savings in one company’s stock. We had many fights about this and he has expressed remorse and that he is turning a new leaf. We cancelled all his credit cards and are gradually paying off the debt. Is this a deal breaker? Or is this relationship salvageable?

Here are some additional pros and cons for context: 
Pros:
- we generally enjoy spending time together 
- he contributes and is involved with the family and household 
- he is a good father

Cons: 
- bad with money 
- no physical intimacy 
- no sexual chemistry

Tldr- my husband is bad with money and hid his debt from me but said he has changed. Is this relationship salvageable or would most people walk?

ANSWER: Apart from the “list” of pro’s and con’s you failed to mention that you clearly have lost respect for him. Add to that the missing intimacy and missing chemistry - your frustration levels are only going to increase while your tolerance levels for putting up with “bad stuff” will only decrease. Once those lines intersect downwards you’ve crossed a threshold. You might already be there given your post. Even if you salvage his spending (and thats a big iff) how can you salvage no chemistry and a lack of intimacy???  This has “doom” written all over it. Ugh.

QUESTION: I (22M) have a very complicated relationship with my (24F) best friend

I've been pretty much best friends with a girl for over 5 years, and there has always been chemistry and tension between us. We tried dating once but she backed out because of her own stated commitment issues and life circumstances.

I'm the closest thing she's ever had to a boyfriend and the only guy to ever even take her on a date which is crazy because shes very traditionally attractive and could have any guy.

We hang out 1-on-1 constantly, travel to motor races together, stay in hotels, and have slept in the same bed platonically many times. She tells me I'm very attractive and a great guy, is very flirty with me, we know everything about each other, her friends and family even say we should date, and when anyone has asked her for reasons why she wouldn't, she said she couldn't think of one.

She even made a marriage pact with me (her idea) and wants to come to my work Christmas party saying we could joke that we aren't "dating" but getting married in 8 years. She once called me while drunk and said I'm the only guy she's ever felt really cared about her and that I might be the only guy she's actually loved. But whenever I talk to or date other girls, she acts like she doesn't care and just says she knows I'll "find someone," which hurts because I want it to be her.

The worst part is that she completely deflects and shuts down any time I try to have a serious talk about us. We're also core members of our friend group so I'm scared of ruining things - but the limbo is draining me. How would you recommend I approach this?

TL;DR there's clearly romantic tension between me and my best friend but she shuts down whenever I bring it up. How do I approach this?

ANSWER: Well, since she doesn't want to talk about it, it's time to stop flirting and acting like her BF. She doesn't get GF treatment if she doesn't want to be your GF.

QUESTION: My boyfriend (27M) stays over almost every day but never helps with groceries or bills. How do I(25F) talk to him without sounding rude?

I(25F) need some advice because I feel stuck. My boyfriend(27M) and I have been together for a little over a year. He has his own place, but for the last few months he has been staying at my apartment almost every day. Sometimes he goes home only to pick up clothes or do some chores then he comes right back.

I love having him around. I really do. The problem is that my expenses have quietly doubled and I did not notice it at first. Groceries go way faster. The water and electricity bill are higher. I am the one cooking most nights because he is already here when I get home. He never does it on purpose, but he has slipped into the routine of treating my place like our place without the responsibilities that come with that.

Last week I realized I spent more on groceries than I usually do in an entire month. My rent and bills are manageable when it is just me, but not when I am basically hosting someone full time. I do not want to resent him, but I am already starting to feel irritated when I see the fridge emptying twice as fast.

The hard part is that he is not a bad person. If I asked directly, he would probably help. But I do not want to sound like I am charging him for staying with me. I also do not want him to think I am keeping score. I just want things to feel fair because right now it feels one sided.

How do I bring this up without making him feel attacked or unwelcome? Do I ask for a set amount each month? Do I tell him we should split groceries on the days he stays? I honestly do not know how to word it in a way that does not feel awkward.

I care about him a lot. I just want to find a healthy way to talk about this before it becomes a bigger problem. What is the best way to have this conversation?

TLDR: Boyfriend (27M) stays at my place almost every day and my expenses have increased a lot. He does not help with groceries or bills because we never talked about it. I (25F) want to ask him to contribute but I do not know how to bring it up without sounding rude or making him feel unwelcome.

ANSWER: If he is already there when you get home, why are YOU the one that has to cook? He could at least pull his weight by preparing meals for you if he is already there when you get home from work, like a decent partner would, even if you are paying for the food. I’d be pissed if I got home from work to find my partner had let themselves in, was using my water/power, eating me out of house and home, and still expected me to cook for them while not contributing anything financially or otherwise.

Do you want to live with him full-time? If so, it’s definitely time to have that conversation as he’s making himself very comfortable. Let him know that you care about him and enjoy his company, but if you are going to continue the relationship and build a future together, you need to have a conversation about splitting costs, division of labour and living arrangements. Show him copies of your bills before and after he started spending all his time at your place, and how much you are having to spend on food, and ask him to help you with the costs, because the increases are due to his presence. If you do want to live together, tell him that whatever you both will save in rent could be put towards the shared expenses.

If he is not willing to chip in, then you may want to reconsider this relationship, or at least start spending more time at his place so he can wear some costs. Why is he at your place so much? Do you live alone, and he has roommates or lives with family? Right now, he’s treating you like a free hotel with catering. What exactly is he contributing? He’s living his best life and probably saving himself a fortune by never being at his place or having to buy his own food. I’m guessing you also get stuck with cleaning up after him too?

QUESTION: My (36M) bf has made 0 friends or maintained 0 friendships since high school. I'm (31F) his only "friend" and it's wearing me down. What should I do?

As the title suggests, my boyfriend doesn't have any friends and relies on me for all social contact. He can also be really moody which makes it hard for me to know how I can help or respond to this.

For example, yesterday morning I got up for work. He was still asleep and I didn't want to wake him. I went out into the kitchen to start boiling the kettle and when I came back into the room his eyes were open and he was looking away from me and frowning. I smiled and said "oh! good morning! How did you sleep?" And he said "fine yeah" and still wouldn't look at me. I could already sense something was wrong and asked "is something wrong?" He said "why didn't you say good morning to me when you got up?"

I explained that I had thought he was asleep, and of course I would have said good morning if I knew he was awake but didn't want to wake him. He was angry and wouldn't speak to me, saying he couldn't believe I had ignored him when I got up. This turned into an argument and eventually I left to go for a morning walk.

I understand this is a really micro-level interaction, but it happens a lot and I'm getting so tired of this. The moodiness really gets to me. He also won't see a therapist even though he's been saying for almost a year that he will at some point. I see a therapist monthly and try really hard to keep on top of myself and my own emotions etc.

He doesn't have any friends, I mean actually zero friends. He never has had any friends since high school and this puts enormous pressure on me to be everything in his life (I'm 31, he's 36). And I try hard to keep my own friendships going, but it's gotten so hard since I started dating him 3 years ago. Every time I say I'm going out to see friends, he gets moody and gives the same reaction as above - he goes quiet, won't look at me and then says nothing is wrong, but then later on will blow up and say he doesn't understand why I'm seeing xyz, why I feel the need to go out etc. But equally when I ask him to join me, he either says no or goes further and asks why I don't just stay home or do something with him. Then whenever I try to broach the subject with him, he becomes incredibly moody or angry/sad.

I feel like I'm you crazy and I can't take it anymore. I'm feeling so isolated and just...sad. I don't know what to do. I want to leave but every time I say so he gets angry, then cries, then I end up deciding to stay. Meanwhile every time I do, he doesn't change anything and just continues with the moody behaviour. I don't want to be someone else's entire social life, whilst also missing out on my own social opportunities. But I'm scared of losing all the really good things about our relationship, and there are lots of them. I just can't imagine staying with him and getting married or having a kid (he really wants kids whereas I'm more on the fence) - I'd just rather be alone even though I know it'd be hard. Am I crazy? Help?

TL;DR I'm feeling responsible for my partner's emotions and entire social life, given he has no social circle and hasn't made any friends or maintained any friendships for the past 17 years. I have my own friends and social circles but am feeling like he doesn't want me to have friends. I don't know whether to leave or if I should  keep trying to work on the relationship. Any advice on what I can do?

ANSWER: There's a reason why he doesn't have any friends and it looks like you're finally seeing it.

Just because you've had a few good moments with him doesn't mean you have to stay with him forever.

QUESTION: My (29) boyfriend (30) is deeply enmeshed with his  parents (70 F, 72 M) and he’s an only child. It’s very difficult for me.

I (29F) am in a year relationship with someone (30M) who is very enmeshed with his narcissistic parents (70F, 72M). Our relationship is wonderful,  but it has been absolute hell with his parents, to the point I’ve had to hold boundaries and have gone no contact with his parents. He feels he can’t do this. He often says “they’re all I have” because he’s an only child.

He’s an only child and I’m his first really serious relationship where we live together, are planning a future, and we’re serious about getting married one day.

It’s like his parents have always hated me for this and have seen me as taking their son from them.

His parents financially abuse, verbally abuse, and heavily manipulate my partner… he’s basically like their servant.

They have made a series of poor financial decisions; overspending, luxury trips, clothes, spending over their means, expensive housing they can’t afford, etc…. They always tell us “we deserve to enjoy life”…..

They’re in a really bad spot now financially in their 70s and it’s really hard for my partner. His parents are desperate and basically in survival mode now. They’re guilt tripping him and being straight nasty about it all… basically telling him it’s his fault and guilt tripping him constantly to do things for them, financially support them, etc.

My partner already gave up the house he owns so they can live there for low cost, and I just feel they will always come first. We now pay $3200 in rent together, and while we can afford it, we keep having to make ourselves uncomfortable for his parents, or they throw a tantrum. We have a lot of financial goals we had to adjust now to accommodate for his parent’s poor life decisions.

It’s directly impacting me now, sometimes I feel it’s time to leave. His parents will always have a hold on our relationship as long as they’re alive and it’s just going to get worse as they age.

He’s starting to see how his parents are the more he interacts with my healthy family dynamic, and his parents resentment toward me has grown to the point I’ve had to cut them out of my life….. they try to put a wedge between us…..however, I know they’ll always impact our relationship as they are his parents even if I have no contact. Also….his programming runs deep of course over many years.

Any advice please?

TL;DR: my boyfriend’s parents are very difficult and use him for everything, but do not treat him or me well to the point I’ve cut them off completely. I feel it will never get better.

ANSWER: >(29F) am in a year relationship  
It’s been absolute hell,  
are planning a future, and we’re serious about getting married one day.

I cannot understand why you are planning a future with someone with whom it has been hell with and you've been dating for only a year.

QUESTION: My girlfriend (19F) cancelled my Thanksgiving flight during an argument, and now I’m unsure how to move forward. I’m (21M).

My girlfriend’s mother bought plane tickets for both of us to visit her family in Virginia for Thanksgiving. This would’ve been my first time meeting them, and I was genuinely excited.

A few days after the tickets were booked, my girlfriend and I had a disagreement about something related to her sorority process. She left my apartment upset and we didn’t speak for several hours. We made up the next day, but the following morning she told me she had cancelled my flight during the argument.

She didn’t pay for the ticket herself, and her family already knew I was supposed to come. She still hasn’t talked to her mom or anyone about what happened, so I don’t know if I’m still expected to come or if her family plans to rebook anything. I don’t want to pressure anyone or make assumptions, but the situation left me confused and disappointed.

I’m trying to approach this maturely, but I’m not sure how to communicate my feelings to her or how to move forward when the plans changed so suddenly.

How should I handle this conversation with her, and should I still go if the family decides to rebook the ticket?

TL;DR: My girlfriend cancelled my Thanksgiving flight that her mom bought during an argument, hasn’t talked to her family about it yet, and now I’m unsure how to move forward or whether I should still go.

ANSWER: Maybe next year. They won't be able to rebook for the same cost now, and honestly I would not want to meet her entire family with this hanging over your head.

QUESTION: 43/F Married 13 years. 46/M Husband betrayed me in multiple ways. I’m trying to figure out if people like him actually change or if I should walk.

Tl;dr
My husband lies to avoid conflict. How do I trust him to keep going thru this betrayal torture?

I’m using a throwaway because the details are embarrassing and honestly I don’t want anyone in my life connecting this to me.

My husband and I have been together 15 years, married 13. We have a 9-year-old son. Until recently, I thought we were solid. Not perfect, but solid. Turns out the foundation was rotting under my feet.

Here are the facts, and I’m trying to be fair about my part too. I want real feedback from people who have gone through things like this.

1. The strip club incident.

About six weeks ago, we went to a strip club together after sexy talk at dinner for his birthday. I’d never done anything like that with a partner, but he’s been venting about not frequent enough sex for a couple years so I thought this might spice it up and give us content to fantasize to after. We had a blast the first night though my feelings were a little hurt when he got too into her. He apologized and swore he’d stay sober and keep me emotionally safe next time. The next week, he went way over the line. The stripper touched him, he got “too aggressive,” and he orgasmed during a lap dance. This shattered me. He had just promised me emotional safety the week before. I felt stupid for trusting him.

2. His past and what he downplayed.

He worked in the club scene before we met. Always claimed it was “I worked in the office, just had a few dozen dances, nothing crazy.” Now I find out he’d been sucking strippers’ breasts and doing a lot more than he ever admitted. He has since estimated 50-100 dances over his lifetime when pressed. I’m sure that’s downplaying it too. I didn’t marry a saint, but I did expect the truth vs a picture of an innocent kid. He hid the real story for years. Yes I now know how naive this was of me. But he reassured me of the things that go on at the club when I asked before we went and I felt I’d be safe and he’d just be watching.

3. The money lies.

Twice he pulled money from a line of credit behind my back. The first time was 2022–2023 which almost led to us divorcing due to the risk, the amount, and the way he wouldn’t take ownership and said he was just “leaning into his business”. He promised he’d never do it again. Then he did it this year—$40k—for a sponsorship he couldn’t afford. Hid that too. Being in finance, I’m held to a high fiduciary standard, so it hits extra hard.

4. The porn and social media.

Hours a day. While I was drowning in work and parenting. He wasn’t cheating physically, but he was checked out. He deleted a few text messages with a woman he worked with (non-romantic from what he says, but hiding anything at this point hits hard). He has given multiple excuses.

5. The unnecessary lies.

This one killed me. Our son mentioned a conversation with us all together cuddling in bed about a conversation he had with his dad about my husband’s 4-5 ex-girlfriends. My husband instantly denied ever having the conversation gaslighting my son in the moment. Even when our kid said it happened last week. Was proud my kid held his ground and said “Dad you did say this.” It was such a low-stakes thing to lie about, and he still did it. I confronted him. He doubled down. When cornered, he backpedaled with “I didn’t think it was significant.”

6. Emotional stuff.

He often says he “doesn’t lie,” even when caught. His crying performative. Voice shakes, no tears. It’s hard to explain, but my gut screams he’s faking empathy instead of feeling it. He gets defensive instead of owning his choices. And when he does “own” something, it feels like he’s reading from a script.

Where I’m culpable:

I’m intense. I’m direct. I have a big career and a strong personality. I’m sure that has been intimidating for him. I’ve also been overwhelmed with work, parenting, and philanthropy. That said—none of this justifies lying or betraying someone.

Where I’m innocent:

I didn’t betray him. I didn’t lie. I didn’t do anything that required secrecy or cleanup. My “crime” is being successful and busy. His is breaking trust in every direction.

Therapy:

We’ve been in a therapy marathon for weeks. He journals now because his therapist told him to, not because he chose to. He says he wants to change, but his actions come in short spurts and fall apart fast. He has admitted he doesn’t know know how to show me empathy even after seeing all this pain. That was gutting.

My question:

Do people like this actually change?
Has anyone stayed and seen their partner do a full 180?
Or is this one of those “you already have your answer” situations?

I’ve read about people who are compulsive liars, people who can’t tolerate shame, people who crumble when confronted with their own behavior. I don’t want to raise my son in a home where his dad lies over small things and big things. But I also don’t want to blow up his world if there’s a real chance my husband can actually change.

If you’ve been the betrayed spouse or the betrayer who actually changed, I’d appreciate hearing your experience. What signs were real? What was fake progress? What should I be watching for?

I’m exhausted. I’m hurt. I don’t want to waste another year waiting for a miracle that won’t come.

Stay or go?
What do people like him actually do long-term?

ANSWER: Are you tired yet? I am just reading it. This dude lies at every single opportunity, how can you trust him about anything at all? And if you can't trust him, what's the point? Cut the weight and feel free and happier.

QUESTION: My husband (34M) has started talking down about my (27F) exercise habits, not sure how to approach the conversation

We've been together for 4 years and married almost a year. I was diagnosed with PCOS at 20 and spent my early 20s learning how to manage it. I take medication to manage insulin resistance and I do some form of exercise 5/6 days a week. Usually walking a mile, around 45mins/1 hour on my exercise bike, and I got really into squats this summer so they have been added in. I do the stairmaster when I'm able to physically go to the gym.

When we got together I had dropped around 80 pounds and was below my original goal weight. He was always very complimentary of this, saying it was impressive that I was able to stick with it and get the results I wanted. I easily maintained my weight the entire time we were dating, it does take time out of my day but I almost always got it done while he was at work so we could hang out. We tried to walk the mile together but he almost never felt like it and I preferred to get it out of the way earlier into the day anyway. My husband isn't massively overweight but he is definitely insecure about his weight, I think he looks great and am happy to support him wherever he's at.

Since we've married and moved in together he has slowly become less approving of my working out. It didn't happen at first but now it's like he views my very mild exercise as "excessive" and also done incorrectly apparently. He tells me I should do the bike for "15 minutes max, anything past that is not helping you", that my mile walk that takes me 20/30 minutes is "too long, you don't need that much", and finally to me proudly telling him how many squats I did was "You'll need to show me how you're doing it because I know you're definitely doing it wrong" (not even a "great job", also someone taught me years ago but he "doesn't believe it").

I've been getting annoyed about this new behavior but trying to push it aside for some reason. I finally got frustrated a few days ago because I was getting dressed to take my walk and he got very upset with me. Pouted and said "You don't need to do that, why don't you want to spend time with me?" We spend almost all of our free time together!!! Plus no one told him he couldn't walk with me, I just knew he was going to have an issue with it.

I've literally been gaining weight and his criticism is making it hard for me to stay motivated. I've always been so proud of getting on top of my health and I've felt so much better, but lately it feels like punishment. I'm not sure how to approach him, I think he feels unhappy with his body and habits and is pushing these things to me. I want to be kind but I also want to defend myself. My quality of life was so much worse before and I feel hurt and annoyed that it seems he would prefer I go back to that so it doesn't challenge him at all.

Tl;dr my husband suddenly dislikes my exercise habits and talks about how unnecessary or wrong I'm doing everything. I think it's unhappiness in himself and I want to be respectful to him, but he's not being very respectful to me so I'm not sure how to approach this chat.

ANSWER: My question is why are you pushing this to the side? This should be immediately addressed because he is getting the signal that this is okay. Your exercise habits predate him and are not for him to control. Have the discussion, he needs to stop.

QUESTION: Friend keeps messaging me  20–50 times a week and I don’t know how to handle it

TL;DR - Old friend messages me constantly despite my repeated attempts at boundaries. How do i stop this without being cruel?

\_\_

Hi all,

I (29F) have an old friend who I’m not very close with anymore (39M). We worked together for about a year when I was 18. We don’t hang out, I don’t really think about him day-to-day, and I usually reply maybe once every few weeks. But he sends me constant messages - mostly Facebook reels - literally every day. Sometimes it’s 10 a day, and recently I opened Messenger and saw 54 unread messages from him.

I haven’t replied in about 3 weeks. He keeps messaging anyway, and today he sent things like:  
“I don’t think you like me anymore haha you talk to me like once a month.”

He’s also asked if he could visit me while he’s in the area (I didn’t respond), and he keeps pushing past hints that I’m busy or not very active on Messenger.

For context, he has bipolar disorder and can be very intense and emotional. A few years ago when I tried to set boundaries, he told me he cried in the shower because he thought he was “losing me,” which made me feel horrible. I don’t want to hurt him or be cruel, but the constant messaging makes me uncomfortable and I don’t feel close enough to him to manage his emotional reactions.

I don’t want a big confrontation or to send a harsh message - but I also don’t want to reinforce this by replying and starting the cycle again. I've sent a couple of messages over the past year or so just saying 'Hey man, im not on facebook much" or other things along those lines. He just doesnt take the hint to stop messaging. Its relentless.

What’s the healthiest way to handle this?

Is it OK to just stop engaging at all? Should I send a short boundaries message? Mute him? Block him?

If you’ve dealt with something similar, what worked for you?

ANSWER: So dude has been overly attached to you since you were 18 and he was around 28. Without you encouraging it at any point by hanging out or entertaining himself outside of the workplace. And it's been 10 years and he's still going.

This is actually pretty damn creepy and scary. I agree with the longer comment advising you to get your ducks in order safety wise but I would also download or screenshot as much of your message history as you can in case you need to take the problem to law enforcement. Emphasize the very earliest interactions. The ones where you were 18 and he was nearly 30.

Be safe please!

QUESTION: My HUSBAND Always does STUPID experimental stuffs, how not to get ANGRY?

I am F(27) and my husband is M(28). Married for more than 2 years. My husband is a very clumsy person. He easily gets distracted. He says that he has ADHD, I also think that. But it is getting really stressful for me. He is not that careful with his spending. He tries to be careful, but the things he does ends up costing us more money. Recently, his mac was heating up when he worked on it, he saw from a yt video that suggested a small repair. So, to save money he ordered the kit for himself to fix it on his own. We are immigrants and every penny counts for us. I told him that even if it costs a little more he should go to a professional for these stuffs as he has no prior experience. He said yes i think you are right but ended up doing what he thought initially and damaged a more expensive sensitive part instead of fixing it. Now it might cost us 10-20 times more to repair that. This is just an example he keeps doing things like that and I am always stressed or anxious about him constantly about whatever he does. Even if I show anger because of that he did not listen to me he says that I am nagging and it is not right. If I can't say anything good in these typpa situation I might just stay quiet. His ADHD is increasing my anxiety and stress levels. What can I do to fix his these type of behaviours so that he takes more mature decisions and thinks maturely and logically before doing something. So that I no longer have panick attacks.

TL;DR My husband is always doing immature things and making immature decisions, I am getting hyper anxious day by day, what should I do?

ANSWER: 1. You're not having panic attacks. That is very different from being frequently angry with a spouse and having anxiety over money.

2. You can't "fix" him.

3. Your husband \may\ have ADHD -- has he actually been diagnosed? -- but "disregarding my partner's concerns" is not a symptom of ADHD. That's just a spouse being a jerk.

So the first thing I'd do is encourage your husband to actually get checked out for a formal diagnosis. If he has a problem that prevents him from being functional in certain ways that are very important to you, medication and teamwork to change how you divvy up tasks (like who is responsible for repairing a broken laptop) are things you can get from counselors who deal with people with these problems. I don't think it's helpful for you (or him) to pathologize all your relationship issues as being caused by a mental health disorder your husband may not even have. If he does, then HE has to do the work here, and YOU have modify your expectations and behaviors so that you find a dynamic that works for you.

As for the rest of it, when you say you're constantly stressed or anxious about what he does, that's a really bad mental state to be in. You can't parent a grown man. What are some practical things you can do to protect yourself from the impact of his impulsive decisions? (e.g. take over managing the household money) How about some emotional things you can do? (e.g. don't clean up his messes, leave the area and go someplace quiet away from him, etc.)

Does your husband CARE that you are having all these conflicts? And how did you resolve conflict before you got married? Surely this didn't just spring up out of nowhere.

QUESTION: Moved in with my boyfriend (23M) 3 months ago and I’m (22F) drained. Should I move out while he’s gone?

My boyfriend and I moved in together about three months ago, and ever since then I’ve felt completely overwhelmed. Before living together, things were great. But now I’m doing almost all the housework while working fully onsite, and he works hybrid and still barely handles his small chores unless I remind him multiple times. Whenever I bring up how stressed or frustrated I am, he says I’m “attacking” him or blowing things out of proportion.

Today I rushed out the door late for work and accidentally tipped over my sock drawer, and instead of being understanding, he texted me during lunch pointing it out in a passive aggressive way, even though I silently clean up after his messes every day. It made me realize how imbalanced things have become and how little accountability he takes. We’re going to be apart for a month starting Sunday, and I’m thinking about staying in an Airbnb until he leaves, then going back home when he’s gone and possibly moving out while he’s away so I can think clearly. I still care about him and would give the relationship another chance, but living together has brought out issues that are really draining me. Am I overreacting, or is this a sign we’re incompatible living together?

TL;DR: Since moving in with my boyfriend, I’ve ended up doing almost all the chores while he gets defensive whenever I bring it up. Today was my breaking point, and I’m considering moving out while he’s away for a month. Not sure if it’s dramatic or the right move. What should I do?

ANSWER: Get out now while you still have your fire, because it gets a lot harder to leave once you’ve forgiven him two or three or twenty times. It does not get better, seriously. This is supposed to be the honeymoon period of living together. It’s the best it will ever be, right now.

QUESTION: Bonding with parents feels impossible because I (28M) feel like I have to walk on eggshells.

I (28M) often find myself in this position where bonding with my dad (63M), I might say something conversational and it gets interpreted as me not having a good time.

For example, I come over so we can watch films together over dinner, and let's say we watch a movie and even though I liked the overall film, I might say, 'It was good. It kind of dragged at points but it was a great narrative.'

Somehow that gets translated into him profusely apologizing: "I'm so sorry I made you watch that. I liked it, I just thought you might, but I won't make you watch any more-"

As much as I try telling him that I did like it, he doesn't seem to hear me. It's like one wrong move, and suddenly, it's all over. My mom is pretty similar, but right now, I'm focusing more on my dad.

This has happened across several experiences throughout my life and unfortunately, we're not that close. I want to be closer, but I feel anxious about saying anything around him. Anyone experience anything similar?? How do you get around it??

TL;DR: I want to bond with my dad, but even small comments make him fret and over-apologize. I feel anxious speaking around him and don’t know how to communicate honestly without upsetting him.

ANSWER: How does he react if you just mention what you liked about it?

One of my colleagues wrote a book that was . . . okay, but not that great. But it did have a really strong sense of place, and when I said that I'd read the book, I pointed that out. He then said he was really happy to hear that, because he'd worked really hard on that, and it turned out that I didn't have to say anything else at all.

It sounds like your dad has some insecurities. Have you seen this show up in other ways, with other people in his life?

QUESTION: I (32f) am being made to choose between my ex con (34m) brother in law or the rest of my in laws by my mother in law (51f)

I really need advice here. Please help! Names in the story have been changed for anonymity.

I'm a 32f and have been married to my husband, Lucas (32m), for almost 7 years. We dated long before that, basically since we were both 18. I was a co-worker with his mom Bella(51f) when my husband and I were still dating, and so we've always been pretty close. My mother in law tends to keep my son(7m) with her over the weekends because she loves him and loves spending time with him doing fun things he'll enjoy. I've been accepted into Lucas's extended family with open arms and feel very welcomed by everyone. They may not always understand me and I may not always understand them, but we try and are always there for each other.

As a child, my brother in law, Tom (34m), hung out with the sorts of people that got involved with drugs and gang related activity. Lucas was then made to be the responsible one in the family in Tom's place and basically become a mini adult to help raise/care for his cousins and younger brother while his mom and the aunts worked on their careers. It was a turbulent household with an abusive man married to my mother in law, which had a big effect on the kids. Tom would basically do what and go wherever he wanted.

I've been told that Tom was doing drug deals, tried to pretend to be my husband when he'd gotten arrested one time, (thank God a family member was able to set that straight), broke into his mom's house when he wasn't supposed to be there, got shot in a drug deal gone wrong and has stolen someone's car. And those are just the things that I've been told about. There's most likely much more.

After the drug deal gone wrong, Tom was sent to prison for a few years. He got out, and within just a few months, he stole someone's car which broke his parole and was sent back to jail. So now he's been in jail for at least 5 years. (Sorry, I haven't been keeping track of exact dates.) Now he's out of jail again and has been since sometime in July of this year, I think. And that was when the initial issue started. Not with my brother-in-law but with my mother-in-law.

I believe that Bella truly does love her children, but I also feel like she has a large amount of guilt for how her son's life turned out. I think that she's trying her best to make up for lost time as quickly as possible. However, she's doing it in a way that's making others uncomfortable and is pushing other family members' boundaries.

Around when my brother-in-law got out of jail, my husband's entire extended family had been planning a trip to a water park together for an Aunt's birthday and everyone was looking forward to it for almost a year. However, Bella tried to insist that we invite Tom, too. Some of my husband's family are in law enforcement and have young children. They were not comfortable with that idea, especially with him so freshly out. My mother-in-law then tried to dig her heels in and say that if he couldn't come then she wouldn't come, and then the aunt that was putting on the entire trip for herself and the family almost canceled the whole thing over the drama! Luckily, my mother-in-law saw reason before we left, Tom didn't come and the trip stayed on.

Which brings us to the problem that I'm having now: Bella is trying to plan her own Thanksgiving away from the rest of the extended family because Tom isn't invited. And that would be an okay choice for her to make. However, my husband and I are now being made to choose sides. Either we support my mother-in-law and Tom, or we support the boundaries of the rest of the family. I don't really know what to do. Honestly, I don't like Tom. From what I've heard about him, and how I hear him talk to Bella, Lucas and my son (7m), I just don't like him as a person. Even without the crimes he's committed, he's rude and selfish. If he was not related to my husband, I would never be around him. But my mother-in-law is making this extremely personal. She insists that Lucas, my son, me, my other brother in law Dax(22m), Tom, his daughter (14f) and his daughter's mom Angel (??f) all forfeit going to the annual extended family Thanksgiving.

I don't believe that this is a fair choice, especially for my young son. Usually, at the big extended family Thanksgiving, all of the kids play together all night, watch holiday movies and then write out their Christmas lists to Santa. We all play family games like charades or trivia. All of the adults exchange white elephant slips to know who they're buying for that year. Then all of the adults plan on Black Friday shopping to try and knock out most of the lists. I don't see how making my son sit with a bunch of adults awkwardly all night it's supposed to help anything or show support.

And did I mention that I have my own family's Thanksgiving to attend? Every year it's a struggle to balance two separate Thanksgivings on the same day but we somehow manage. Now I have all of this added stress to the decision making and need to essentially choose to do three Thanksgivings or upset someone by not attending one of theirs.

I tried to appeal to my mother-in-law to ask if maybe we could get together with Tom on a different day, and tried to explain that the family just needs time to see whether or not he's changed and to rebuild trust with him. That he made a series of poor life decisions and that these are the consequences. I'm not saying that he shouldn't have a Thanksgiving with the family members that want to support him right now, I think that that's very good of Bella to want to do. I just think that she is letting her emotions cloud her judgment and that this could be the start of a rift between the family and unnecessary tension. My son cried today when he heard that we wouldn't be going to his cousin's house this year and it broke my heart. I think I'm leaning toward choosing to go to the extended family's Thanksgiving, now, instead.

How will future holidays go? Christmas? Easter? Birthdays? Anniversaries? Etc etc.

Not to mention that my mother-in-law is lashing out and has essentially said that she doesn't care what me and my son do, but that she expects my husband to attend her Thanksgiving because she would hope that all of her sons would want to spend the holidays with her. So now she's trying to keep my husband with her. How is that fair to my son and I!? I don't know what to do! I have so many past traumas, current mental health issues and people pleasing tendancies that this is really putting a strain on me. My husband is very non confrontational and hates that he's being forced into choosing.

Lucas has already tried to discuss this with her but she still insists on doing it this way. When my husband first told me about her plans, I expressed how upset that I was and how unfair it was for our son and he agreed. But he still wants to support his mom, even if he doesn't have a good relationship with his brother and isn't super close with his mom. He doesn't know what to do, and neither do I. I don't know what Lucas will choose to do.

Please, I'm begging for advice or people's perspectives! I really need help!

Tl;Dr:

My mother in law wants us to choose between her awful son or the extended family Thanksgiving tradition this year since he just got out of jail. Help!

ANSWER: I would choose not to spend my thanksgiving with an asshole or the woman trying to force me to do so. Your husband needs to step up, this is his family to deal with.

QUESTION: Married within a year, and now I’m seeing red flags I ignored before — how do I handle this? (27F/33M)

Hi, this is a long read. Bear with me. Im a 27/F. My husband is 33M and we’ve been married for a year. I’m looking for some advice on how to handle this situation. I feel like I have no one to talk to, and I really need to vent while also getting someone’s perspective.

My husband and I got engaged and married all within a year. Everything happened pretty fast, but we both deeply desired marriage. Now that we’re married, some of the subtle red flags I noticed before are starting to repeat themselves.

My husband is very paranoid. He often assumes I’m cheating or doing something shady when I never have and never would. We attend church, and he gets upset when I put effort into my appearance. He assumes I’m dressing up to seek attention — even though I keep to myself at church and rarely engage in conversation unless I have to.

A few weeks ago, he went on a brief trip. While he was away, I booked a hair appointment. He became upset, saying I must be getting my hair done to entertain another man while he was gone, and created a whole argument about it. The truth is, that was the only available appointment time.

When he returned from his trip, he inspected the entire house, looking for signs that I had company while he was gone. In the past, he has often asked to look through my phone — and I’ve allowed it because I have nothing to hide.

If a man at church looks my way, or if he sees me glance at someone, he interrogates me and asks if I know them or if I’m trying to get attention. He frequently asks about my whereabouts, even though he has my location and I’m always transparent about where I am and what I’m doing.

One particular incident stands out — I was on my way to a church meeting (I serve at church), and I left early because I like to be punctual. He called me and told me to come back, accusing me of leaving early to mingle and potentially meet other men.

These are just a few examples of many similar incidents that have occurred. He says he wants to change and asks me to give him time. I believe he’s genuine in that desire, and he truly does have amazing qualities. Every time he realizes he’s wrong, he apologizes. I understand that change takes time, but when these episodes happen, he becomes a different person — angry and loud. And it honestly scares me. He’s not physically abusive but I’ve become so anxious around him.

I don’t know if I should wait it out or leave. He plans to seek therapy, but hasn’t yet. He says he can fix the issue himself, he just has to be self aware. I want to give him a chance, but I also know this behavior could get worse once kids are involved. I’m torn and don’t know what to do.

TL;DR: My husband and I married quickly, and now his paranoia and constant accusations of cheating are becoming overwhelming. He says he’ll get therapy, but I’m torn between waiting it out or leaving.

ANSWER: Please leave if he doesn't treat his insecurities- he's being extremely controlling and  isolating you, the first steps towards more physical abuse.

QUESTION: After 4 years together still no proposal. How long do I continue to wait?

I’ve (39F) been with my BF (37M) for four years and we’ve been living together for over two. Before I gave up my apartment and moved into his house, I asked where he saw our relationship going and his timeline for commitment. He said if after a year of living together everything was going well, we’d get engaged. This matched with what I wanted, so I moved in.

A year passed and no proposal. I bring up the conversation we had before I moved in and he said he’s saving up for the ring. Then his friend asked us if we were going to get engaged, and my BF said yes, soon. So, I was reassured we were still on the same page.

Then we get to two years living together, and still no proposal. The type of rings I like are not expensive, and with his salary I know he would have saved up enough by then. Then his brother got engaged after only two years with his GF. I know all relationships have their own timelines, but the news made me reflect. So, I straight up asked my BF why he hadn’t proposed.

At first his excuse was that planning a wedding was such a hassle. This didn’t ring true, so I said I thought he wasn’t being honest. Then he confided some struggles with his mental health and fears that I would grow resentful of ways he couldn’t contribute to the relationship due to them. I was surprised because those things are not deal breakers for me, I’m not upset by them, and I don’t think I’ve ever expressed resentment.

He said he’d thought about returning to therapy to work on things and asked me to give him some time. I agreed, but he’s not forthcoming if/when his appointments are or what he’s working on – which I understand I have no right to know. He’s allowed to keep his therapy private if that’s what’s best for his therapeutic journey. But, I wish I had some insight to know my waiting will be worthwhile.

I don’t question his struggles, but I’m having a hard time believing he’s not just stalling. He’s expressed some reservations about me, mainly that I’m not social enough, especially with his family. I’m a super introvert, but I’ve really tried with his family. I once expressed a worry that his family mistook my shyness for disinterest, but he assured me they understood and liked me, so I don’t know what the problem is.

My other doubt is that he talks about doing things and often doesn’t follow through. Like, he’s been saying he was going to take me on a weekend trip since the first year together, but he’s never done it. During the same time he’s planned and gone on four trips with friends and family. I don’t doubt that he would enjoy a trip with me, he just doesn’t care enough to actually plan it.

Recently, we went to his friend’s wedding, and another of his friends asked if we’re getting engaged, and my BF again said soon. I just don’t believe it anymore. I don’t doubt his love for me. We do a lot of stuff together and he’s physically affectionate. But I can’t ignore this feeling he doesn’t want to marry me and never will. I don’t think he wants to break up, but he also doesn’t want to commit.

I get upset about this every other day and I’m just so tired. I’m nearing forty and just want to know he wants to be my life partner. I feel four years is plenty of time to know someone. I have been open and transparent about who I am and what I have to offer. I don’t know how much longer I can wait around for him to decide to commit.

Do I stick around and see if he ever proposes, or follow my gut and cut my losses?

TLDR: After four years BF has not proposed even after saying multiple times he was planning to. Explanations are weak and I'm questioning if he'll ever do it.

ANSWER: I think it's time you look for your own apartment and move out. He is just stringing you along. Just consider: there is no actual factual reason he can't propose to you - the only valid explanation is that he just doesn't want to. It's heartbreaking that he stole the four years from you that were vital if you wanted to have children - I really hope you don't, because that would make it so much sadder.

Anyway, he's telling you loud and clear that he is not going to marry you - time to accept that and move on. You will be much happier once you're free from his push/pull mindgames.

QUESTION: Fiancé (31M) threw me (29F) under the bus to our friends

My fiancé and I are thinking about going to this music festival in a few months. We’re planning for it now since tickets go on sale tomorrow. We both really want to go, but money is the issue. Not only are we planning our wedding, but we are going to be renovating soon. As well as I have some debt I keep trying to pay off. I can’t pay it off since things like this keep coming up and we don’t wanna miss out.

Anyways, today in our group chat with our 4 other best friends (who know about my money struggles and us needing to save) we were chatting about renting an RV vs tent camping and I mentioned that I wanted to do whatever was cheapest since we’re a little tight on cash right now. I also mentioned that if that wasn’t an issue, we would do the RV in a heartbeat and I wanted to compare costs. I will add; I’ve never been the friend to complain about costs. In fact, I’ve always been really down and that’s how I’ve found myself in some hot water with debt. I’m only being “stingy” because I haven’t been able to pay it off and we’re planning a wedding and such

My fiancé and I were texting separately about all of this and he even agreed with me- even stating this wasn’t even worth it, he’d rather go on a vacation, he doesn’t mind tent camping and we could bring all our own stuff etc. We ended up saying that we would chat more about it later when he got home so we were on the same page. BTW the cost difference with tent camping vs RV would be 400-500$ total.

Our group chat kept popping off about the RV and I sent a text saying “Fiancé and I are going to chat more about it tonight and get back to you guys”. My fiancé then messaged me separately saying “stop telling them about money problems, you’re making us sound poor”. I apologized and said I wouldn’t mention it again. He then proceeds to text in our group chat saying “oh yeah by the way we’re for sure doing the RV, that makes the most sense” and just completely threw me under the bus.

I got super pissed at him because wtf we literally were just chatting about it and he acted like he would have my back. I totally felt like I was the bad guy/the only one not 100% about the RV. It especially sucked because everyone else is like “what why wouldn’t we do the RV?” And are all gung ho about it. He told me that he didn’t want our girl best friend thinking we didn’t want to do it and he sensed she was upset we were on the fence about the RV so he said that… I literally was like so you’re putting her potential feelings over my feelings? I am the one struggling to pay off my debt and trying to be smart.

I’m so annoyed and frustrated with him. How do I approach this with him?

Tl;dr my fiancé threw me under the bus with our friends

ANSWER: The way he talks to you is problematic. He can convey his thoughts and feelings without cussing at you.

QUESTION: How can you really start to accept that people won't change? (Relationship with ADHD)

The relationship between me (28F) and my boyfriend (31M) is pretty decent overall. Our communication is good for the most part, we can be very honest with each other, we respect each other and act usually very supportive of the other. We've been together for 5 years now.

One thing I cannot get behind though is the fact that he has some traits and qualities I cannot change and which will, very likely, never change. Most of our arguments are about the same topics. Often times it's about his lacking degree of emotional regulation towards inconveniences or stress in general. He frequently uses me as an 'emotional dumpster' when he wants to vent about the world and whatever happened to him that upset him (note: not all of these things are really overblown and unreasonable as my wording might make it seem). Recently this happens a lot more frequently and it's exhausting.

He's already in therapy because of depression and ADHD (already medicated). I know that emotional regulation is especially hard for people with ADHD and this is what makes this so incredibly frustrating. I'm at a point where I don't wanna hear about all these same things anymore that bother him. He's just venting about it at me, not changing anything (e.g. talk to the person at work that actually upset him) or trying to work with his emotions to not always react this hard (which again, might not even be possible). To add some extra salt to the wound: He formed a new friendship with another person at work which is all fun and giggles all the time. So basically, he comes home, tells me how much fun he's had with this person and what cool stuff they've been doing this day, and then starts to vent. It feels like I'm being served all the negativity he's built up over the day, and this person is experiencing all the fluffy joy he has to offer instead (he's a very fun and goofy guy when he's not venting and marinating in his own misery). Yes, it's honestly the first time in perhaps 10+ years I felt some sort of jealousy.

I've voiced my wish for not being used as his private therapist all the time many, maaany times. He always apologizes and wants to better himself. Never does. We also get into other discussions about the same stuff over and over again, too. Also mostly related to his ADHD (cleaning, putting some effort into planning special days like anniversaries). In general, he's apologizing all the time and I believe him but at this point I can almost predict the words that come out of his mouth every time we're having this conversation.

A part of me feels like 'well, it's the ADHD, suck it up. If you like him, YOU have to find a way to deal with all this, not the other way round'. Another part, that has a lot of old childhood trauma mixed into this emotional response, screams at me that I cannot accept my boundaries not being heard. I don't want to go into details of my backstory, let's just summarize that I've had my fair share of therapy to work through this independently. I feel stable and pretty safe in that regard. But these two backgrounds—one person with ADHD, one with former PTSD—feel like a nightmare to mix.

Is anyone out there, perhaps with the same combination in their relationship, who can perhaps offer some advice? How can I not get triggered by making the experience of 'nothing will ever change, just swallow your anger and adjust your needs' over and over? It goes heavily against what I learned back then in therapy. All of this is really sucking the light out of our relationship. The fun times get less and less, all this 'drama' is leaving me so exhausted and depressed. One part of me is slowly giving up, since it all seems so hopeless to me. Please, offer some advice.

TL;DR: ADHD boyfriend (in therapy & medicated) constantly uses me as emotional dumpster + we have the same arguments over and over to no avail. Therefore getting depressed myself since I feel like I just cannot expect any change at all + this heavily triggers some of my former trauma memories of helplessness.

Edit: Adjusted TL;DR

ANSWER: By ending the relationship. I have severe ADHD and it's my job to manage/regulate my emotions and symptoms. I don't get a pass to shit on people who love me.

QUESTION: I (26F) need a reality check before I move cross country with my ex (29F).

Five years ago, I was married to a man while discovering my queer identity. He was supportive simply because he was a horny man and loved to imagine it, and encouraged me to explore. That is when I met Zoe through a queer dating app.

During the pandemic, our connection developed quickly and deeply. We had virtual cooking nights, painted together, planned creative dates, and all from opposite coasts. By the end of the year, we each separated our partners as we each wanted to do for years, and she moved across the country to be with me. For a week, it was magic. Then reality hit.

Despite sharing important values and perspectives, we were wildly different: our personalities, family dynamics, and ways of handling conflict clashed hard. I was going through a divorce and struggling in a conservative town where neither of us felt safe. Fights turned volatile, once even physical as she hit my throat when she was triggered as she thought I called her stupid during an argument. After nine chaotic months, we moved apart but kept talking.

Over the next couple of years, we tried to heal. Therapy helped me and she turned to secretive spiritual communities and meditation programs. That secrecy, along with our fundamental differences, always left me feeling confused, awkward, and divided (granted, I often feel that way as a person anyway).

In recent months, she asked me to be her girlfriend again. Things were calm and steady, though not romantic. No hand holding, no cuddling, separate rooms, but an awkward “dance” through our individual routines near each other each day. We’ve become great friends and roommates, sharing our lives but without intimacy. Still, I hoped our peace meant progress — and I was content as we had a great balance at home, and we each lived as our holistic, sober, celibate selves comfortably around one another.

Then, when prompted as I was in desperate need for clarity, she told me the truth: she doesn’t want a romantic partnership with me. She cares deeply, but she feels fear and sadness for me: for my small support system, my sensitivity as autistic person, my autoimmune conditions, and how we’ve impacted each other over time. It hurt, but I finally had clarity.

Now we are supposed to move to her hometown this spring, as we’ve planned for over a year, to care for her family that needs consistent care. On paper, it makes sense. We coexist well as friends and co-parents to our cats. But part of me knows I’d end up feeling alone and resentful while she’s surrounded by family.

I could instead move back to my home coast to be closer to the few family members I’m close with. It would mean living alone for the first time in my adulthood, which terrifies and excites me in equal measure. It feels like a real beginning. It feels like I finally would be able to be in my own orbit rather than someone else’s.

I think I already know the answer, but I can’t help second-guessing myself:

Would it be foolish or selfish to choose independence and move on my own instead of following her to support her, and care for her family?

—

TL;DR: My partner of five years and I planned to move to her hometown across the country to care for her family in the spring. She let me know that she is not interested in me romantically, but wants to remain as the good friends we are. Do I make the move I promised to make or move for myself for the first time in my adulthood?

ANSWER: > It feels like a real beginning. It feels like I finally would be able to be in my own orbit rather than someone else’s.

This sounds like an opportunity too good to pass up.

QUESTION: [UPDATE - 7 years later] For years, my [35F] husband [37M] said that if I want stability in our life, I have to make it happen. I did. And now things are worse than ever. Help?

I was recently cleaning out my bookmarks and [found this old throwaway](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9tdkqa/for_years_my_35f_husband_37m_said_that_if_i_want/), and obviously the two posts I made with it. I'm not sure why now, but I feel compelled to write a followup. Maybe it'll give people the bravery to change or at least an example of how sticking with what you know isn't always the best choice.

An obviously very long story short, with the help of those posts and a lot of long nights of thinking, I left my husband. In fact, it took him going away for a long weekend to realize how much happier and at peace I felt without him around... At first the split was amicable, but looking back I think he was just waiting for me to come rushing back to him once I "realized my mistake." When that didn't happen and he could see I was actually serious about building a new life for myself, a switch flipped. We only spoke when he needed something from me and eventually that stopped too. Enough about him.

I'm now 42, happier and healthier and more satisfied than I've been my whole life. I picked me and that was the best choice I could've ever made. I lived alone for the first time and my god, the peace of having my own space... unrivaled. I ended up staying in that apartment for 5 years, not a moving box in sight. I put art on the walls, I knew my neighbors. I made a home. I grew my career and went back to school. Made friends, built a little community.

I've done a ton of therapy and realized that the abusive patterns my parents created in childhood were just repeating with my ex. I fell in love, a real love, a supportive love that encourages growth and security. I'm doing new work, work that helps people and is so much more than just chasing money. All of those things have created a life that's more rewarding than I ever thought possible for myself.

I've gone through some really shitty times too, illness, cancer scares, deaths, loss... but I have no idea how I would've come out the other side without the community I'd built around me. Even something as simple as people at your local coffee shop recognizing you is a comfort after feeling adrift and alone for so long. Anyway, if I were to respond to myself from 7 years ago, this is what I would say.

>Leave the loser. He doesn't care about you, never did. He only cares about what you can do for him and now that you aren't serving him... well. Just go. You are capable of doing difficult things, and you are worthy of the work it takes to accomplish them. Trust your abilities, trust your gut - it's been screaming at you for years now, honey. Life can be so much more than you've experienced, but you have to make it happen for yourself.

TL;DR: Left my husband, happier than ever.

EDIT: I'm surprised but happy this found so many people! I genuinely thought I was going to bookend this story and have it disappear into the ether. But whatever urge I had to write it, and whatever brought you to reading it... who knows? Maybe it was meant to. Thank you for all the messages and comments, I feel so grateful to have this perspective and experience.

ANSWER: It's really ridiculous the mount [edit: amount] of women I know who leave marriages and blossom, thrive, are so much happier for it. You don't see that much talked about in the outside world. It's really remarkable.

QUESTION: I am considering leaving my husband over keeping a lock on on of our doors and refusing to open it

Hi everyone. Very sad to be posting this but I F29 am considering separating from my husband M33 of 5 years over a big issue we just had a couple of days ago. My husband has always cared about his things, and he puts all his valuables in his office where he works remotely 3 days a week. He put a lock on the outside of the office door 6 months ago to supposedly keep his things safe from our destructive toddler. I let it go, but found it a bit odd since the key is usually no where to be found.

Anyways, I recently went in the office to get our bird's perch out the room, and he was hovering acting really suspicious. He defensively said what do you need in there? And I said the bird's perch...but then instantly felt he was hiding something from me. I also noticed he locked the door after that. After we put our toddler to sleep, I told him I needed to go in the room to change the sheets on our guest mattress because we have visitors soon. He was acting defensive again and said he would do it another time. That is when I said what are you hiding in there? You are getting really defensive, and its weird that I am locked out of a space in my own home and have to ask permission to enter. He got more defensive until I eventually said you need to unlock the door and let me see what is in there because you are hiding something.

Long story short, he admitted to hiding weed in the room and playing video games when I go to sleep. But he REFUSED to open the door. I told him i'm going to sit by the door until he unlocks it because I think he is hiding something worse since those things aren't that big of a deal. You guys, he literally refused. I tried begging, I tried getting the lock open, I tried everything I could think of. Not only would he not unlock the door, but he was gaslighting me the entire time telling me i'm crazy and it must be my pregnancy hormones thinking there was something else in there? He said that if he opens the door, he would be giving in to my pushiness. He also kept touching my leg and telling me he was sorry i'm going through this like I was making all of this up in my head.

Unfortunately, I got too tired around 2am (keep in mine i'm pregnant having to deal with this) and told him i'm going to sleep and whatever he is hiding in there he can get rid of in the morning, but i'm done. In the morning, the room was perfectly staged with his little weed pen out and switch game. He has changed the lock on the door to a normal one that only locks when someone is in the room, but still seems to see no problem with what he has done. He is still adamant that it is perfectly normal to lock a door from the outside if you have important things in there. He also said there was nothing else in there and he just couldn't for the life of him let me in after I said we needed to go through his stuff. He said that was controlling behavior and giving in would be saying that was okay.

I guess what i'm asking is...is it normal to put a lock on an office door even on the outside? Would a separation by the best next steps? I have a toddler and a baby coming, and really don't want to have to do this alone if I don't need to.

ANSWER: Yeah he was hiding something in there. If you’re lucky it’s something he’s just embarrassed by that he doesn’t want to share. But if it’s not that, I’d guess hard drugs or a porn habit that’s borderline cheating, since apparently he needs somewhere private to indulge. You could try asking him for a drug test to see how he responds.

QUESTION: My boyfriend turned me into a baby and I don’t feel like myself anymore

I (30F) used to be a very independent person. For example, I’ve travelled to over 30 countries all by myself by age 25. I knew how to survive anywhere in the world. My parents were abusive, so I escaped home and lived on my own as soon as I became an adult. I enjoyed living by myself and doing everything by myself.

Then I met my boyfriend (27M) a few years ago. Despite being younger than me, he treats me like a baby and started doing everything for me. He always takes me to work and picks me up after work since I don’t have a car. Without him, I would’ve walked or taken public transport. I’ve always been grateful to him for doing this. Not only that, but he also does all the housework. He does most of grocery shopping and cooking and cleaning and laundry. When we go on a trip, he plans everything.

Life with him was so convenient that I got used to doing nothing by myself in a few years. All my friends say they are jealous that I have such a good boyfriend who does everything for me. I thought so, too. But suddenly I realised that I can’t do anything by myself anymore? When he goes on a business trip and leaves me alone for a week, I find it so stressful and exhausting to do house chores like cooking and cleaning, which I always did by myself before meeting him.

I became much less independent than I was 10 years ago and I don’t feel like myself anymore. On the other hand, I feel like I’m finally receiving the love and treatment I didn’t receive from my parents and it’s compensating my miserable childhood. He says I need to be treated like a baby now because I didn’t have the chance in my childhood.

I’m aware that this isn’t healthy in the long term. What should I change?

TL;DR: I used to be an independent person, but my boyfriend treats me like a baby and does everything for me and now I can’t do things like house chores by myself. I lost the independent person I was and turned into a baby.

ANSWER: Girl you got a guy like this. Start picking up the efforts and put in 50% rather than him doing 90%, and you both are SET. If he continues doing all this, he's gonna be burnt out sooner or later.

QUESTION: Bf (19m) and I (17f) were mugged. He ran away and left me alone with the mugger. I can't see him in the same light anymore

Yesterday I was hanging out with my bf and we were in a not so great part of our city. Suddenly a guy approached us to ask for indications and asked us to help him get there and we helped him (stupid i know). After getting there he pulled out a knife and asked for all our money.

Bf ran away and left me alone with the mugger. Lucklily he just wanted my money so i gave him all the money i had and then he went away.

After that i went inside a bar and called my parents. My parents were furious with bf and tried to call him but he did not pick up. We then went to the police and then returned home and after maybe 2 hours i received a call from bf asking me where i was and telling me he alerted the police. I exploded on him and he did not even apologized but kept telling me he did the best he could.

My question is: is there any way to recover from this? My image of him is shattered

TL;DR: boyfriend left me during a mugging. I can't see him in the same light anymore

ANSWER: >>  is there any way to recover from this?

I personally do not think so. I am so sorry this happened to you.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (26F) think my boyfriend (30M) is exaggerating or faking his illness

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jefjhu/help\_i\_26f\_think\_my\_boyfriend\_30m\_is\_exaggerating/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jefjhu/help_i_26f_think_my_boyfriend_30m_is_exaggerating/)

Thank you to everyone who responded to my post and was so compassionate and kind. It was incredible to hear from so many people who actively battle chronic pain/illness and those with loved ones who do. I hope to continue deepening my empathy towards anyone who is struggling with an invisible illness.

On to my update. Armed with some fresh perspectives (and some fresh frustrations, lol) I talked to my boyfriend and told him that he needs to see a doctor or I will no longer be able to support him financially and stand by while he remains unemployed and unmotivated to get the help he needs. I also addressed the idea of managing/balancing his energy levels differently so that we're able to share household responsibilities more effectively, spend quality time together, and keep him doing the things he loves with his friends.

His response was...really bad. He told me that if I'm not willing to "step up and clean around the house" (something I'm already doing) that there's no use living together and that my efforts to clean are the bare minimum and not good enough for his standards anyway. He was also really mad that I haven't taken initiative to take care of yard projects and car repairs. He sat there and spouted off a whole list of things I'm not noticing and cleaning. And, once again, he was focused on this idea that I don't like his friends/am jealous of them and want him spending less time with them, which isn't true at all.

This really stung. He basically brushed over everything I said and focused on my perceived faults. This told me everything I need to know and I told him I was leaving. He was just...mad. Not sad or hurt at all. I'm still crying excessively over his whole reaction. I still don't know how real or unreal his chronic pain is, but I guess it doesn't matter anymore.

Thank you again, everyone, for your support and kindness. I'm truly at a loss.

TLDR: My (26F) boyfriend (30M) of almost two years and I have separated over his inability to address his chronic pain.

ANSWER: OP, I remember your first post. I know you’re very sad right now, and you have a right to be. But don’t let grief overstay its welcome — you are so much better off and he just lost his bang maid, expect him to come crawling back when he realizes you’re serious. Don’t believe anything he says.

This internet stranger is proud of you. You deserve someone who can be your partner regardless of whether they have an illness — that doesn’t mean they’re critical or cruel.

QUESTION: My Husband Told Me He’s Filing For Divorce Today

My Husband (34M) told me (32F) that he’s fed up and going to file for divorce.  We’ve been married for 1 year, together for 4 years. He is very angry, and I feel depleted and numb.

Backstory: 
My husband suffers from a type of OCD called Relationship OCD otherwise known as Retroactive Jealousy. It is where he fixates on my past sexual relationships, particularly on one person, a person who I have not even spoken to in over 8 years.

He can get triggered anytime, anywhere. We could be watching TV and a character will have the same name and he will get triggered. Last weekend, we were at a concert celebrating our one year wedding anniversary and someone came on stage wearing a jersey that is for the same sport this person used to play. He wanted to leave the concert immediately, we ended up fighting and our anniversary was ruined.

Anytime he is triggered, his energy completely shifts from warm, goofy and loving to ice cold and bothered and he shuts me out. It is a very sad, confusing, frustrating and isolating experience for me and for him, it’s mental turmoil.

Pretty much every single fight we have had in our relationship has stemmed from his retroactive jealousy. Other than that, we’ve been extremely happy. Unfortunately, every time he gets triggered it chips away at my happiness. I walk on eggshells and feel anxiety sometimes because I never know when he will get triggered next.

I thought he might get better with time / after marriage because he would finally see that I want him and only him forever, I was wrong.

Ever since he was triggered on our anniversary last weekend and we fought, things have never been worse. Something feels different about this time, like I finally realized this isn’t going away or I’ve hit my breaking point. We’ve been cordial to each other all week and sleeping in the same bed but no sex.

Yesterday, he asked me if “I’m ready to go back to being loving again”. I told him my concerns and how he needs to seek support / medication for this RJ. I also thanked him for giving me space (which literally just meant not initiating sex) and he got an attitude and say “yea well I was upset too”.

It felt clear to me in this moment that he wasn’t really listening to me and to be fair, I sometimes have a difficult time seeing things from his side as well. Sometimes his aggressive approach and victim mindset in conversation makes me automatically defensive.

He ended up storming out of the room and slept in the guest room (where he always sleeps when he’s upset or for his everyday naps) and has been slamming every door he walks through ever since.

At this point, there is so much tension that I told him I will move his things from the master bedroom to the guest room so that we both can have space to process what we’re feeling.

He left for the day to go golfing, a new hobby he picked up that he has trashed for the last 4 years.. While he was away I moved his stuff. I did not move it to upset him, I truly feel broken and anxious when I’m around him now and just need a little space to process everything.

He came home from golf and was livid. He said he wasn’t interested in being roommates and this was no way to live. I told him once again that I need space to process everything and he said rudely “you’ve had enough space, you’ve had a week of space. Instead of moving my belongings all day you could have instead come up with a way to communicate.” I told him I did try communicating with him yesterday and he got upset. I told him that the way he is currently speaking to me is with an aggressive tone to which he replied “Because I’m angry! This is ridiculous. I won’t be married to someone who can’t resolve simple issues, I won’t have kids with that person, I’m filing for divorce.”

I responded that I don’t want a divorce all I am asking for is a little space for us to work through this. I don’t remember what he responded but he didn’t care that I said that and I think again he just repeated he was filing for divorce.

After he said that he left the house. The crazy part is I still don’t feel much? I don’t feel angry or sad, just numb. Perhaps I’m over it or it could be some kind of coping mechanism to protect myself.

I’ve never spoken to friends or family about his RJ because I love him and didn’t want them to think negatively about him. I think it’s finally time I open up to my mother about it. I feel very alone.

I’m not sure what to do or where to go from here. I’ve never been more in love with anyone in my life. He was caring, made me laugh, bought me flowers, supported me when I was laid off from my job, etc. but I am just not sure I can be in this relationship anymore now with how he’s acting. Not taking accountability, being rude to me and instead of giving me the space I need, threatening to divorce instead.

REDDIT: It would help to hear from you (an outside perspective) on this. I am too in it to think clearly at the moment. Even if no one responds, it felt nice to be able to type this out.

TL;DR: Husband has ROCD (retroactive jealousy) that causes most of our fights. After a bad trigger on our anniversary, he’s now threatening divorce because I asked for space, claiming I am incapable of solving issues. I feel numb and don’t know if this relationship is salvageable.

____________________

UPDATE: I am blown away at the amount of support this post has gotten. Thank you to everyone who has responded and to the mod of this post for giving me a great book recommendation. As many of you guessed, his threat of divorce was not real.

For the first time in 4 years I truly put my foot down and told my husband that I will no longer put up with this treatment. I told him that if he continues to choose not to seek help and instead continue to hurt me, then I’m not staying (and he knows I mean it). I told him I love him, but I love me and my mental health more.

Since this long conversation he has set up an immediate plan:

Daily plan: 
 Morning reflection / meditation
 Medicine / Vitamins: Fluoxetine, magnesium, omega 3
 Workout

Weekly plan:
 Meet with therapist / start ERP (first session is scheduled for this weekend)

I told him that I support him, but that he needs to do deep reflection and work on himself before we can start rebuilding our relationship. I plan on leaving town this week to spend some time with my mother and will be working on an exit plan to have just in case the day comes.

I have found a lot of strength and growth within myself throughout this process,  and am very proud of myself.

I can’t describe how it felt going from feeling so isolated and alone to feeling like I have a community who supports me through this post. So if you’re scrolling and see someone who needs help, just know that your comment can make a big difference. <3

ANSWER: This divorce would be a gift, honestly.

I don't know if this is genuine, but its absolutely wild.

QUESTION: UPDATE:  My boyfriend [M24] and I [F24] have too much sex and I can´t handle it anymore. How do I explain it to him that it exhausts me and how do I negotiate new intimacy with him?

Original post: [My boyfriend \[M24\] and I \[F24\] have too much sex and I can´t handle it anymore. How do I explain it to him that it exhausts me and how do I negotiate new intimacy with him? : r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ge7l3a/my_boyfriend_m24_and_i_f24_have_too_much_sex_and/)

I spend a lot of time reading through everyone's replies and looking inwards about how I feel. I gathered my thoughts and spend a few days making a list of what I wanted to say when we have the big conversation. On a weekend when we had planned to spend the day together I sat him down and told him the following points:

I love him to the moon and back and want to show him that I love him, make him feel desired, loved and appreciated

BUT

Having so much sex with such frequency is physically exhausting to me which causes me to avoid sex and even sex acts I enjoy because I don´t have enough energy and motivation to do it. This also causes me to orgasm not as often anymore. I also need time to physically recover before it may even start to become painful. I feel like sex has become the single defining aspect of our relationship and many other parts like doing activities together, romantic dates, just talking and cuddling have taken a backseat. I also feel exhausted emotionally and underappreciated from giving as much as I can (which I gladly do for the people I love) while little comes back from the other side of the relationship.

I then proceeded to explain the things I like during sex and what makes me go wild, hoping to show him that I still want to have sex with him. I also made a few more compliments just to keep the vibe positive and because I meant it.

He reacted pretty well all things considered. He listened and let me finish, but asked for a little time to think about it. Obviously I gladly agreed. We spend the rest of the day together without him initiating once. At the end of the day he said that he wants me to enjoy sex just as much as he does and that he loves me.

I was really hopeful for the next week and a half. We spend our time together like usual and he asked for sex about one half as often as before our talk. We even had days without sex at all. He also started to ask "Do you want to have sex with me?" instead of physically initiating like he did before, like touching me somewhere, hugging me from behind and similar things. He also stopped asking for pictures of me and when he did it were just selfies. I was so happy that I even took the initiative once and he seemingly loved it when I asked for sex.

Then one day he sat me down with a stern look and said that he hated what this relationship has turned into. To him it feels like we are now just roommates or platonic friends instead of lovers. He told me that the one time I initiated after he was overjoyed to finally "fuck me again" his heart was broken because I suddenly wasn´t as submissive as usually (I asked to be eaten out and was on top with some more dominant dirty talk) and that all of that is not what he signed up for. He doesn´t want to walk on eggshells waiting for when I am finally in the mood, but have what he deserves in the relationship.

Basically he gave me an ultimatum: either we return to how it was before the talk starting right now or he leaves me. Guess who doesn´t have a boyfriend anymore?

I spend the last few days bawling my eyes out and eating lots of ice cream and watching some shitty shows. What he said hurt me a lot and I do not love him anymore, but still the feeling of loss and sadness is all too real.    He was my first relationship and for the past two years he was my entire world. No I have to gather up the broken shards he left behind.

TL;DR: I took your advice and talked with him about my feelings. He pretended to be ok with it for a while and then left me after demanding more sex again.

ANSWER: Yeesh I'm sorry, but I'm so glad you stood up for yourself, because the way he reacted exposed even more red flags.

Do not take him back if he asks, he may try to manipulate you with the breakup so that you're more submissive next time.

QUESTION: I don’t want to relocate to India with my husband

Tldr: I, European 26, f doesn’t want ro relocate to India with my husband Punjabi 29, m due to cultural differences and lifestyle changes being too much for me to handle.

My husband is a Punjabi and I am a European NZ. We have been married for three years and he has been living in New Zealand for 10 years. I have been to India many times for three months at a time each go.

My husband has decided he wants to relocate us to India permanently, I really don’t want to. I would never force him to distance himself from his roots but I honestly don’t think I could cope with India for atleast 6 - 8 months a year, he said we could visit NZ yearly apparently. I made a compromise with him that I visit India for three months  a year and he can stay 6-8 months a year. He says life in India would be better for us because we would have more money and he has more connections in business there etc. My husband didn’t agree to this and said where ever and whatever the husband says the wife should follow. He said he Weill buy me a car in India and I can get a job teaching English to pre schoolers. I can only speak the basics on Punjabi and no one in Punjab but his parents and a few of his relatives who don’t speak English anyway.

I am really conflicted and cry about this often because I feel like I’m going to be giving up my freedom and individuality.

The times I have stayed in India have been hard at some points as my husbands house is rural and I can’t leave or go anywhere without him. I don’t get to wear what I like and to be honest if I say I don’t want to eat or drink something that is culturally Punjabi I found his family judged me so much. His parents also told me to stop watching English tv shows in the house. I followed their instructions and turned it off but felt super sad after wards.

I think that maybe I am being selfish for not wanting to live in India but I don’t want to be trapped with no where to go. I think I will go mad. Any insight on my situation would be appreciated. Sorry my paragraphs and words are all over the place, my thoughts in my head and just a mess at the moment.

ANSWER: “Whatever the husband says, the wife should do.” He’s telling you who he is. Just wait until you are isolated and surrounded by this belief/culture.

QUESTION: UPDATE: Boyfriend slept with someone else while we were on a break

Origional post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Z9RsQy6S1Y

Firstly, thank you for all the useful advice I was given on my original post. I was unable to reply because it was locked but thank you all.

Since I found out my (39F) boyfriend (40M) of 14 years slept with someone else, I broke up with him. He stayed living in my flat for 2 months (on a tight deadline) so he could find a home as he is jobless. He didn't. He is now homeless.

His mum pressured me to have him for longer as there is a cold snap here and he's on the streets but I said no. His mum can take him in if she is so worried.

I found out it was the lady he has been spending time with at the gym. I think he wanted to try that to see if it was better.

That is all. I now live alone (with dog).

TLDR: I chucked him out. He's homeless.

ANSWER: If he knew he was going to be homeless that far in advance and didn't sort out any income then that's on him. Who would want to have anything to do with someone who behaves like that.

QUESTION: My husband (63M) goes cycling way too much leaving me, his (60F) wife alone. How do I help him understand he's losing me?

Good people, I need some help.

My husband (63M) and I (60F) have been happily married 30+ years. Five or so years ago he started cycling. He loved it and I was happy he found something he enjoyed and was good for him although I felt he was spending too much money on bikes, tools, supplies, rides in races and weekend trips.

The last few years have been bad with the time he spends riding. It’s getting unbearable for me. He’s gone all the time. He takes two cycling classes a week at the gym, he rides there when he’s not taking classes and he’s out on the road or a path 4-6 days a week for 4-6 or 7 hours at a time coming home after 10 at night on weeknights. Oh, and works a full-time job on top of this.

Last month we went to Florida for three days to visit my family and of course he had to rent a bike and ride. In the last 5 months he’s left me alone to ride on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, Easter and Mother’s Day. He probably went riding on Valentines Day too, I don’t remember. As I post this, he’s in Chillicothe Ohio on a weekend ride and visit with friends.

This is not a communication issue as I have joked, talked, complained, yelled and cried and cried all many many times. I love my husband dearly and don’t want a divorce. But I can’t take being alone anymore. I'd rather be separated and alone than married and alone. But if I leave him, I feel I’d be letting our kids and grandkids down. I’m so lost and don’t know what to do. Nothing I do or say makes a difference to him.

I'm hoping a few people are willing to comment so I can show him this and maybe we can both learn something, or I can gain some insight. Thanks ahead for your helpful comments.

TLDR, My husband rides his bike and leaves me, his wife alone way too much and I have no idea what to do. Can you please offer some advice?

ANSWER: I'd sit down and talk about this and focus ENTIRELY on you and what you need. Do not say the words "you are cycling too much" or it will become an argument about whether he is cycling too much. Instead, say 'I need to spend more time with you" or "I need to know that you'll be physically present on holidays and vacations" and ask him how he's going to make that happen.

QUESTION: Wife is a whole new person after giving birth. I’m scared i’m going to lose her.

My wife [30F] gave birth to our daughter 4 months ago. She doesnt work so she is a sahm. She is NOT the same person she was before the baby. Before birth we got into a serious argument maybe once every few months, now it's almost every weekend for almost no reason. Monday we were supposed to have a date night (drinking wine, watching movies, playing games, ends with sexual relations usually I'm (32M) holding her while we're watching a movie and she randomly blew up on me for no reason. Said she's sick of me and doesnt ever want to have sex again then storms out and locks herself in the bedroom. I prioritize her wellbeing. Make sure she's fed, hydrated, doing well mentally when she's with our daughter. She doesn't even seem happy to see me anymore when I'm home from work. Past fights recently have been about how she's not happy with me anymore after i snapped back one time about her nitpicking everything ive been doing recently (she has never once mentioned this before the baby), she's snapped on me because the baby was crying and I couldn't get her to sleep fast enough, also screamed at me because i ran a yellow light with her in the car. When we fight it's really hurtful things being said to me and I'm always saying sorry trying to defuse. I've done maybe 95% of the feedings at night so she can get about 7/8 hours of sleep consecutively and take baby from the moment i return from work so she can get alone time. I also do a lot of the household chores for her and it seems to land on deaf ears. She refuses counseling and won't talk to me about it and doesn't think it's a big deal. It seems like our marriage is close to an end and I'm scared. I care so much about her I hate seeing her like this. Can anyone relate?

TL;DR: wife gave birth 4 months ago and now randomly hates my very existence.

ANSWER: It could be postpartum depression or anxiety.

Four months post birth is a difficult time regardless, she may also be struggling to adapt to her new life. I remember there were moments where I felt like I hated my husband, especially in the early days.

I would try and get her to speak to a doctor.

QUESTION: Update: I told my boyfriend I loved him right after we had sex. How badly did I mess up?

Sl I (33f) made a post the other night (which can be found here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/TvHzNz4WpV) about how I’m with my first ever boyfriend (37m) and told him right after we had sex that I loved him and he didn’t immediately say it back so I freaked out and tried to backtrack before shutting him down and saying I wanted to move on. I left shortly after and just shut myself out from him for most of the next day. This morning I got a text message from him that said he misses me and was really loved to go out tonight, so I figured what the hell and we went out. While we were out, there was a moment during dinner that I reached over and held his hand and told him I was sorry I ignored him and told him about my abandonment issues and how self-destructive I can be when I’m scared people will leave me. I’m sure it’ll come as absolutely no shock to anyone that he was lovely and patient with me. We went back to his place and were snuggling and I was starting to fade away to sleep…

…then he said “love you, beautiful” (“beautiful” is his pet name for me. Corny but he says it’s very fitting lol). I stopped and then looked over at him, and then he said “you don’t have to say it back.” I said “but what if I wanna say it back?” and he told me to go ahead and I said “I love you too.” I rolled over on him and gave him a nice long kiss and then put my forehead on his before I started crying a little bit. I cannot tell you how badly I’ve wanted to say that to someone since I was 14 and it doesn’t even feel real. Feels like some dream I had that was nice but didn’t happen.

Riding this emotional high I can’t sleep so I’m writing this while he’s sleeping next to me. I have to get up in four hours to have enough time to go back home and get ready for work, but I don’t care. One bad day of crap sleep is forgettable, I’m gonna remember this night for the rest of my life. It’s way too soon for this, but I’m already getting giddy about putting my name in front of his last name.

So yeah. I’m in love you guys <3

tl;dr: follow up to the situation with me telling my boyfriend I loved him. He forgave me for shutting me out and later told me he loved me too.

ANSWER: If we're talking about silly crap we did after only two months... I had a psychotic episode and ran down the highway trying to get away from a guy I met on tinder screaming he was trying to kill me.

We've been together 4 years.

QUESTION: I (43F) read my fiancee's (56M) journals and don't know if I can marry him now

I (43F) am using a throwaway for obvious reasons here. Before I start YES I know I am a huge jerk for snooping in his (56M) email and I definitely found trouble, I accept that. I was working on his computer and his gmail was open and I saw my name so I opened it and it was a Word doc that he journaled. Curious of course I searched his inbox with my name and saw his entries and read them. Some of what he said has devastated me and shaken me to the core. We have been together almost 3 years, the first year on and off and was rocky. We have been living together since the summer. He is not home and I have not brought this up yet. I think I might faint and need some space. Should I get some distance and go to a hotel for the weekend? I thought we were in a great place. Over the past 10 months these are some of the things he's written about me: For reference i put \\\\ in place of my name.

"There are moments, in my dark thoughts, where I feel like being with her is a compromise for me, like this somehow diminishes me and that I am settling for her because I have ruined all of my other prospects and I’m too old to find someone else."

"At times, I wish she had stayed out of my life.  I wonder if I had stayed on my own if someone better would have come into my orbit.  There is so much to deal with, so many bad feelings and darkness.  I find that I am thinking about Lauren a lot but who’s to say that she would be any better.  The reality is that I met her on tour and fucked her a day later.  What kind of woman is that? I feel like I have pissed my life away and this is all that I am entitled to.  I have pissed away all of the good things in my life."

"Someone like \\\\ would never have been able to get to me. When I was younger, I had many opportunities to be with women like her but declined. I am uncertain about whether this is a good thought pattern to have."

"My mind wanders to places, like what it would have been like if someone like Lauren could have been in my life instead of \\\\.  Lauren has the advantage of existing in my mind as an ideal.  We never really got the chance to know each other outside of two nights and a week of texting and talking on the phone.  I know that she had a drug past but has been sober for over a decade.  I don’t think she was promiscuous; most guys that I know that knew her in the old days indicated that she didn’t have a lot of men in her life.  That’s not to say that there hasn’t been a lot of darkness in her life. It would have been easier to be with her.  There weren’t all of these men in her orbit like \\\\.  She was never married, so there was no divorce.  She’s not as emotionally damaged as \\\\.  In some ways, I feel like being with \\\\ is some sort of karmic thing, like this is what I deserve for being non-committal for most of my life.  I have my own damage.  Everyone likes to think that they are a good person but there are moments when I am not so sure about myself."

TL:DR I am not sure if I can go forward with this relationship after reading this.

ANSWER: One: if he could get with Lauren, he'd soon be finding fault with her, too.

Two: run as fast as you can. He doesn't even like you, at all. Don't be a placeholder. You're not even second best here.

I'm sorry for how you feel atm, but it's good that you know so you can make your own decisions.

QUESTION: Update: husband has a new chosen family he prioritizes and sees every week, I’m jealous and frustrated

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/JwBnrT9EL9

It’s been a while since- our little boy is 2.5 now. Thank you to everyone who commented - it was the kick in the butt I needed to lay down the law. Esp the folks that rightly pointed out I was a passive doormat without self respect — that stung but was true.

After my post, I had a big sit down with John on my the things I was upset about. My husband was traveling to be a groomsman for a good friend — I told him to stay out there for an additional week and decide: 
1. if he wanted to stay married and wanted to be a family
2. If he wanted the above, think about what needed to change on his part (not just Pam but other stuff too), how he was going to be a good husband/father going forward
3. Arrange to go over it with me and our marriage counselor on his return

Alternatively, if he didn’t do the above then when he got back we’d start logistics on separation and co-parenting.

And surprisingly, he did all the above. Apparently he reflected a lot at the wedding (his friend and his wife are such an in love couple) and thought a lot about us and our relationship and what he wanted.

He came back and proposed changes (immediate break from Pam/company and stop to their hobby — he’d play some dnd / mtg online but that was it), he’d take over remaining baby prep (nursery, logistics), and   promised to lay out a post-partum care plan for me and baby. He stuck to his word and also worked hard to regain my trust.

Then we had our son and my husband was over the moon in love. He and baby have been inseparable ever since and have an amazing adventure filled life with all the hobbies (baby/toddler swim, gym, soccer, co-op, and a great local parent community). After our kiddo was born Pam lost interest in my husband anyway (she doesn’t like kids) and shortly thereafter cheated on her poly relationship. Kevin and John have actually become good friends since then, but John is straight so I have no worries there.  And as I’ve reflected — I think I also just actually hated Pam — she’s everything I don’t like relying on men for affirmation, no job/life ambition, frivolous and stupid. And apparently (according to Kevin) the feeling was mutual - she thought I was a controlling, stuck up, robotic ivy league workaholic who didn’t appreciate or support my husbands hobbies/quirks. I was also a lot more emotiobal during pregnancy than normal. My husband- upon reflection liked being needed and admired

We had a lot to work through with us, but two years later we’re in a great spot (I also had a weird shift in hormones post-partum which made my sex drive really really high which for us helped a lot with our relationship). Didn’t want this to be too long, but there were a lot of changes we implemented to get back to a loving place. John feels a lot of purpose in being a dad and supported me as my career has taken off. Sometimes things are still hard (my job is really high stress, toddlers are a lot of work, etc).

But we’re pretty happy. We spent this morning snuggling in bed with our toddler and dog pretending we were on a boat, making hair dryer sounds, and giving hugs. We live a pretty boring suburban kind of life - but it works for us.

Thanks everyone for the push for me to stand up for what I wanted and needed.

ANSWER: What a great update. I'm so glad your husband honestly reflected and chose you and the baby. Hope it stays that way!

QUESTION: Friend's [34M] Girlfriend [33F] Called Me [36F] A Pick-Me And Now My Friends Want Me To Apologize?

Hi everyone, I need some advice. I (36F) have a group of five friends. We hang out together a lot, playing video games, going to Friday Night Magic, watching movies, D&D, and just generally being nerdy. One of the friend group \[34M\], Bruce, has recently gotten a new girlfriend and we've tried to include her in our get togethers. The girlfriend \[33F\], I'll call her Silver, really seems to hate me, and I'm not sure what to do. I didn't notice it at first, if I'm honest. She came along to our May the 4th/Return of the 5th party/sleepover, one friend Peter \[35M\] helped her make a paladin to join in on a D&D one-shot when she said she wanted to learn, she's come along to FNM multiple times, etc.

However, the other night, while I was having a passionate debate with another friend, Steve \[36M\] about the atrocity that was Hush 2 from DC Comics, Silver absolutely lost it at me. She started yelling about how I was a 'Pick-Me' and how I was mad that she was in the group and that I wanted to sleep with all the boys \[?!?!?!\] but especially Peter. She yelled for like five minutes, while I just sat there like a deer in headlights, because I didn't know what to say? She accused me of making my Warlock sexy in D&D to make the boys want me, that I picked a "Pretty girl card" for my deck in Magic, that I tried to "dress sexy" for May the 4th. \[I wore an Ahsoka sleeveless tank top, no straps, just sleeveless.\]

I tried to tell her I have no interest in sleeping with Bruce, or any of my guy friends, and she just burst into tears. Peter said that maybe I should go, for now, because she was upset, so I did.

Now, on Discord, a bunch of them \[Peter, Bruce, Steve and Michael (33M) have all said I should apologize to her, with only Clark \[35M\] saying I have nothing to apologize for. There's been a lot of talk about 'keeping the peace,' but I'm not sure what I should apologize for? I didn't make a move on anyone. I haven't slept with or tried to sleep with any of my friends.

I'm not sure what I should do, or what I can do. I don't know what to apologize for and I feel like my friends are siding with her.

TL;DR: Friend's girlfriend called me a pick-me and went on a rant about how I'm trying to sleep with everyone and now my friends want me to apologize to her.

ANSWER: Sounds like she has major insecurity issues and sees you as a threat without really knowing you.  I would hold my ground and hopefully your friends come around since it seems like you are a decent person.

QUESTION: UPDATE 6 years later: I (F26) am in love with my best friend (M26) but he thinks a relationship is doomed to fail

Original post can be found  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dzdykr/i_f26_am_in_love_with_my_best_friend_m26_but_he/)

6 years ago I was here lamenting the feelings I caught for my fwb turned best friend (let’s call him Franky).

After the initial pain of rejection, we both agreed to stay best friends. We moved in together with 3 of our other friends, and lived as platonic roommates. We confided in each other all our dating woes, cooked together most nights, and continued having fun nights out. During that time I grew equally close to my other roommates, and had a casual Covid lockdown fling with one who is now one of my closest friends (shocker).

After 3 years of living together, I had finally (mostly) gotten over my feelings for Franky. We were both casually dating other people and in a good place. I had spent many holidays with his extended family as his best friend, and was content knowing that I had a life long friend. Then he had a big health scare. It ended up not being anything major, but at the time put a lot of things into perspective for the both of us.

The night Franky returned from the hospital we had a heart to heart. I cried as I told him how scared I was during the emergency and it ended with us both deciding to try dating seriously.

We moved out of the group house with our friends to a small condo together. It took some time to change from an awkward platonic relationship to a truly romantic one, but we allowed the relationship to take its own time and course.

It’s been 3 years together now. He is currently cradling our shared cat as we plan a romantic weekend get away to New York. He was right, after the one year mark we sat and had a big talk. We talked about what each of us needed to work on to continue the relationship. Instead of it being a relationship death sentence, it lead to both of us getting therapy, making positive changes, and brought us even closer.

We now have such open communication that even after 3 years we have not had a fight. I could not be happier to have my person, as well as the wonderful family that I now get to be a part of.

TLDR; after 3 years of remaining besties, a mortality check pushed us together. Celebrating 3 years of bliss and hopefully more to come :)

ANSWER: Love this for u both. also a good reminder that love doesn’t have an expiry date, it can come back around when both ppl are actually ready.

QUESTION: My (21f) bf (25m) is going on a week long trip to Italy. How do I not resent him?

So my bf of 2 years along with 7 of his coworkers got invited by his work to go on a one week trip to Italy. Everything is completely paid for. Meals, flights, excursions, they are renting a private yacht, they’re staying on a mansion on the beach. Literally a trip of a lifetime and he didn’t have to pay a dime

When he first told me I was honestly I was anxious because 7 months ago he had previously did something to break my trust and we were trying to build back. Come about a week away from his trip to Italy I found out that he had an option to bring a +1, expenses all completely paid for as well. literally all their other guys who were going invited their gf/wife. I was the only one left out.

That completely changed how I felt. It wasn’t just a work trip anymore. It felt very personal and left me wondering why he didn’t want to invite me while all the other men had no problem bringing girlfriend along?

When I brought it up he said “he didn’t know it would mean that much to me” and he views it as a “networking and making connections trip and doesn’t want to have to worry about keeping me entertained while he is busy networking and building connections”. Or something along those lines.

He told me I would basically just be sitting in our room the whole time which at least id be sitting in our room in a huge mansion on the beach and private yacht getting fed pasta every night. Instead I’m just sitting at the house.

I feel so hurt and excluded and now he is living his life across the world with him and a bunch of other happy couples while I’m at home trying not to spiral.

I honestly feel a lot of resentment building. He knew I was anxious of him going because of him previously breaking my trust and he knew he had the option to invite me but didn’t. He said he “never considered how id feel and was thinking of it from a different perspective.” Outside of him breaking my trust we have an incredible relationship. We never fight, he pays for my all school/bills, anything I want. Most importantly he is my best friend. And I don’t want to destroy what we have.

My question is am I being over emotional or is this a real red flag? How do I process this and not let it turn into long term resentment?

TL;DR: My bf of two years is going on a two week work trip to Italy along with 7 of his coworkers. All of who brought their gf/wife. I was the only one left out. Now I feel hurt, excluded, and unsure how not to resent him

ANSWER: Come on. He had the option to bring you and chose to spend the week in Italy without even asking you. That’s not someone who wants to spend time with you. Without knowing the details of breaking trust it sounds like Simone who wants to spend his vacation with another woman or at least keep his options open.

QUESTION: Dad (60m) is giving all his money to a 21-year-old he met while driving Uber. I’m at a loss.

My dad (60m) met a 21-year-old while driving for Uber and now I’m watching what looks like a slow-motion trainwreck.

She told him she was homeless, so he started paying for her hotel, got her a job, bought her a car, and in total has given her around $20k… in just two months. The worst part? He doesn’t have that kind of money. He’s borrowed some from me under false pretenses (which I now know went straight to her), and his credit score is in the 300s.

People have tried to warn him. Her friend called him saying she’s still with her ex and using him. Her ex’s mom said the same thing. Every time, she tells my dad they’re just jealous or dislike her.

It’s beyond surreal. He looks like Danny DeVito (no offense to the man), has nothing in savings, and yet thinks this 21-year-old is with him for love. They’ve known each other two months and he already tattooed her name on him. He’s even had the police recover the car he bought her multiple times—until the last time, when she got him to sign it over to her officially.

He swears she never asks for anything, but somehow he’s hemorrhaged $20k since meeting her. I don’t know how to make him see it. I’m torn between trying to intervene or stepping back until he crashes and then helping pick up the pieces… but it’s getting worse fast.

TL;DR: my dad gave 20k to a girl he met in 2 months and thinks she loves him, idk how to get him to realize she's 99% likely using him

ANSWER: Sometimes there's just nothing you can do. Don't give him your money, but on some level the attention this woman is giving him is worth the money to him.

QUESTION: My husband (33M) just asked me to quit my hobby and say goodbye to my hobby friends. I really don't want to say yes to that. What should I do?

Deleted

ANSWER: Are you currently being actively treated for your depression? That’s the root of the problems here. I don’t know if your husband is making your mental state worse, but I have a strong suspicion that your dynamic is.

But no, don’t let your husband isolate you from the only social outlet you have left. Isolation will make you feel even worse.

QUESTION: [Update] I [27F] don’t know how to deal with insecurities from dating bf [28M] who is much more attractive (7 years later)

Ok, a brief, mostly sad update. Previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bbvhkg/i_27f_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_insecurities/)

We got engaged a year ago, which felt like one of the best days of my life. The universe decided no, and earlier this year I found out my fiance cheated on me in the first months of our relationship and slept with his ex model fling a few times even though he had denied there was anything other than friendship between them. Found out because she still shares mutual friends with him and is in the same field, we were all at an event and she made a snide comment about it after a friend heard about our engagement and congratulated me.

I can't really put into words how betrayed I felt, our entire relationship built on lies and years of insecurity being validated after I finally put them to rest. We tried working through it, but I decided to break things off because I don't think I'll ever be able to trust him again. He made sounds about how it was an early mistake and that I'd be throwing away 5 years of our relationship, but tbh I felt like they never became a thing because she wasn't interested in more, not him. So yeah, I wish I could say all of the "but he picked you" comments were correct, but clearly it was too good to be true.

\\tl;dr\\ Starting over at 34 after finding out my fiance actually did cheat on me with his ex fling at the beginning of our relationship

ANSWER: > So yeah, I wish I could say all of the "but he picked you" comments were correct, but clearly it was too good to be true.

Just want to mention that him cheating has absolutely nothing to do with him being "more attractive" than you or even his ex being "more attractive" than you. Men cheat on beautiful women all the time, often with less attractive women and often when they themselves are unattractive.

Cheating is a character flaw. He would likely have cheated on the model too if they'd gotten together for real and will probably cheat on his next partner. I hope in all this you don't internalize that you were right to think he was too good-looking for you because that's absolutely not the problem.

QUESTION: (UPDATE) How do I (47M) tell my boyfriend (35M) that I'm a virgin?

Original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Rrnwj7gcmp

Hey everyone. I'm really greatful for all the advice and support I got on my original post. I posted another updates on the comments of the original.

Summary, I (47M) have been with my boyfriend (35M) for a little under a year. He wants to get physical, and I haven't told him that I've never had sex, because of my history of abuse. After getting advice in the comments, I ended up writing him a letter explaining that I'm a virgin, and touching on some details of my abuse.

I left the letter on the nightstand before I left for work. (My boyfriend works from home) when I got home, his daughter (2F) ran up to me for a hug like she always does. I scooped her up in a hug, and pretended to eat her little fingers.

We had dinner and put her to bed like usual, then my boyfriend asked me to sit on the couch. My stomach tied up in knots, and part of me just wanted to run out the front door.

I have to admit, you were all right. He immediately held my hand and told me he's not disappointed at all. He asked me a bit about my past and the abuse I suffered from my mother. I don't feel comfortable going into detail here, but I barely scratched the surface and I ended up crying in his arms. I never want to be without those arms in my life. His hands rubbing my back, resting my head on his chest to listen to his heartbeat, the smell of his cologne. It's the safest I've ever felt in my entire life.

Once I calmed down, we started looking for therapists near me, then the night went on like normal. Watching our favorite shows while cuddling on the couch, doomscrolling social media and showing each other funny posts. Then we went to bed.

I feel like a weight has lifted off my shoulders. I don't have to hide this about myself anymore. I don't have to live with the fear of my amazing boyfriend seeing me as a lesser man. I won't lie, I'm still anxious about not being able to satisfy him in bed, but we'll work on it together.

I have a therapy appointment for later this month. So things are going good!

Tl;Dr, I wrote my boyfriend a letter, we talked, and now I'm gonna go to therapy.

ANSWER: This literally made me tear up. I’m so glad you found someone who is empathetic and very understanding of your situation. Dealing with trauma in your past, does not invalidate you! You are more than just a body. You’re a living human being, who has gone through so much and deserves the world! Thank you for sharing this, and I’m glad to hear you will be going to therapy. Hopefully that helps you with your mental state, and overall well being. 🫶

QUESTION: Should I [F30] warn my coworker [M24] that he is alienating himself socially?

I [F30] work in a project-based profession. The projects take anywhere from six months to several years and you’re typically working with the same small group for the entire duration.

As a natural consequence of working closely with the same few people, friendships usually form, and we’ll all take lunch together sometimes or go for drinks after work, that kind of thing.

We have an especially copacetic group on my current project. We’ve been working together six months and we go out socially, we talk and joke around during the day. We’re not “friends” but it’s a tight knit group as coworkers go.

We have one coworker [M24] who is alienating himself from the group and I feel awful because he doesn’t seem to be aware of it.

He’s losing the good faith and camaraderie of everyone in the office and he doesn’t seem to understand why it’s happening. I can see that it’s upsetting to him and it’s unpleasant for too.

That being said, I don’t know him well at all, and I feel uncomfortable approaching him about the issue. He’s an overall nice guy and has some excellent qualities but they’re overshadowed by his tone deaf conduct.

The result is the entire team is spending less time together because we wouldn’t host an event with everyone except him, but most people also can’t stand to be around him more than they have to.

Should I say something to him and if so, what should I say?

His behaviors include but aren’t limited to:

—Acts like he’s the most experienced despite being one of the least; constantly interrupts or gives unsolicited advice to other specialties.

—Minimizes coworkers’ complaints; e.g., when someone said “the client keeps calling me on weekends,” he replied “maybe work harder so they won’t need to.”

—Gets angry if anyone uses a nickname version of his (very common) name, even from people who barely know him.

—Went to a bar with us and other teams then spent the whole night lecturing everyone about how he doesn’t drink because he’s healthier and has more willpower.

—Proudly and conspicuously tattled on coworkers for bending the dress code when no clients were around, leading to a companywide memo.

TL;DR: Younger coworker keeps alienating our tight-knit team with tone-deaf behavior (know-it-all, minimizes complaints, lectures at socials, tattles). He seems unaware. Should I say something?

ANSWER: The only thing I could see doing is questioning his inappropriate behavior in the moment. Addressing his interrupting- making sure the person who was interrupted gets to finish their thought, questioning if he thinks an unhelpful suggestion is actually helpful etc

Calling out behavior that shouldn't be happening may make him see that it's unpleasant, or at least give everyone else the license to also call out his inappropriateness.

QUESTION: I [29F] have lost attraction to my [27NB] disabled partner and I'm at a loss for what to do.

My partner and I met and started dating 6 years ago. When we first met they didnt identify as non-binary, and we started our relationship as a lesbian relationship. I am a lesbian and I am not attracted to men. I have tried, many times, it just does not happen for me and I cannot force it. That being said they were the love of my life. We fell very very in love and I have never experienced the acceptance they showed me. The love they showed me was magic and I look back with very strong fondness at that time of my life.

They started to transition in earnest 3 years ago. They were very hesitant to do so initially. They knew I'm a lesbian and was not attracted to men. And they didnt want to transition for that reason. I encouraged them to do it wholeheartedly, because being trans is something you do for yourself, not for anyone else. I assured them that I wasn't considering leaving them over that,  and that it was men i wasnt attracted to not non-binary people. I told them that they had to do it for themselves. That it was crucial, even. And they did, they've been on T for quite a while and are much more masculine and in general pass as a man. They're non-binary, but yeah even so we get read as a straight couple and theyre often referred to as my boyfriend (a term they like). Over time though... its just not the same anymore. I struggle with intimacy with them, I am still deeply attracted to who they are. But their body has changed and their demeanor has changed and it's just no longer within what I'm attracted to. Its starting to hurt me to force myself through it. I want them to be happy but I am unsatisfied in several ways and have had a lot of feelings that I'm not voicing because I do not want to hurt them in any way.

They are also disabled and reliant on me for a lot of things. I rely on them for a lot too, as I am not always in the best mental state. Neither of us has a relationship with our families. We both experienced a lot of abuse growing up so we're mostly by ourselves. I can work and am working but they aren't as they have been going to therapy. They wouldn't have anywhere to go if our relationship ended. They don't have support to fall back on. And their mental health fluctuates and at somewhat routine times they are suicidal. I'm so scared of what would happen if I did decide to leave.

I don't really know what I'm looking for. Someone who has been in this situation I guess? I feel so much guilt and fear. I'm semi-sick today because of how anxious this whole thing is making me. I'm so scared of being alone too. They do provide emotional support to me, which has been very helpful for me at times. I just don't know what to do. I feel like no matter how I look at the situation I'm in the wrong. That I'd be throwing away the life weve built together and that its my fault.

TL;DR my partner transitioned and I'm losing attraction to them but they are disabled and we are very dependent and I have no idea what to do.

ANSWER: This is pretty common for partners of people who decide to transition. There's no shame or harm in deciding that you are not attracted to their new self (with absolute respect for your partner — I am saying this as a transgender woman!).

You're allowed to feel the way you're feeling. I know it hurts and feels awful and it does not at all reflect how you feel about your partner. But you need to do what is right for you — just like they did for themself (with your blessing).

Edited to add that I'm rooting for you both and wish you peace and light.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My [24] boyfriend [25] of 3 and 1/2 years hasnt proposed and I'm starting to worry. I just want that promise.

The original link is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/50ihkx/my_24_boyfriend_25_of_3_and_12_years_hasnt/?utm_source=reddit-android)

I wanted to give an update on this post I wrote about 2 years ago. I got some great advice, I got a lot of tough love advice and some terrible advice. I know he was already committed by all of his actions and that I really needed to focus on college first before having to plan a wedding.

Well, it turned out my boyfriend at the time had been planning on proposing to me for a long time. He wanted to wait until I graduated college. A little after I graduated college, he took me on a hike. I knew this was a special hike because it was the same place we went for one of our earlier dates.

The first time we went on that date was magical. I always teased him that he never kissed me on the date. There was this perfect moment he was holding me in front of a beautiful picturesque lake as we were just enjoying each other's company in an embrace. I thought he was going to kiss me but he didn't.

I later kissed him first but always teased him that he didn't kiss me in that moment we had. He confessed he wasn't sure if I wanted to be kissed. He said he wanted to kiss me more than anything.

Well he took me back on the hike 4 years later, and when we got to that lake, he told me this is when he knew he was first in love with me. Then he got on one knee and proposed to me. I just kissed him and even forgot to say yes! So he asked, "Are you going to marry me or not?" And I said of course. We got married about a year later and we just celebrated our one year anniversary in October.

I've never been happier and I'm so excited to continue our life together!

Thank you for reading 😁

Edit: Grammar on TL DR

Edit: Wow! I did not expect this post to blow up like it did! Thank you all for the incredibly kind words. I'm sorry I can't respond to everyone but thank you. I'm glad I could brighten so many people's day! You all brightened mine :)

TL;DR UPDATE: My [24] boyfriend [25] of 3 and 1/2 years hadn't proposed and I was starting to worry. This is a two year update that my boyfriend at the time was planning on proposing all along. We have now been married for one year. I am so happy everything worked out the way it did.

ANSWER: When you said "my boyfriend at the time" my heart dropped. Great update and super glad you got it together and relaxed into your love and relationship!

QUESTION: Update: My(M26) wife(F26) is not happy

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hm1wdi/mym26_wifef26_isnt_happy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Thank you everyone for the advice from the original post. I just wanted to give the community an update. My wife finally got back yesterday from leaving to go see her sister. We talked for a little bit yesterday, but still came to the same thing she has been telling me. She doesn’t want to be with me because she doesn’t feel in love, emotionally connected, or intimate towards me. She views me as a friend. I told her she needed to choose either we work on this and go to counseling or it’s a divorce and we cut ties. She couldn’t decide and said to give her the weekend.

This morning I woke up early, made her breakfast and brought it to her in bed. Then took her out to eat for lunch and desert trying to just spark anything to see if she would agree to work on it. Well we sat down again after getting back and she said she wanted a divorce and she was 100% on that.

It was tough. A lot of crying, sadness, hurt, and all the emotions one would feel. I ended up just going to my room and she left for the night. I decided to get out and do something so I jogged and listed to some music for a bit. It helped.

I came to the realization that we all have such little time on earth and I don’t want to waste it moping around. I want to improve myself physically, emotionally, and mentally. I want to just enjoy life and find myself again. So I’m going to do that and one day I might meet someone who is perfect to continue the journey of life with me.

So I’m still sad and hurt, but all that to say I’m moving forward and trying to be positive. Thank you all for your support.

tl;dr Wife wants a divorce. I’m trying to stay positive and move one.

ANSWER: The end of a relationship is hard but it’s also such a great opportunity for growth, self compassion, and fun. The initial part of the separation is hard but just know that you will be okay, slowly things will get better. 
You’re still so young, you’re going to find someone that’s a better match for you. Just give yourself time to grieve and take care of yourself. When my bf and I broke up I listened to “Breakup Recover Podcast” by Barbara Stevens, she’s so calming and has a way of making you feel cared for and safe. There were days where I felt like shit but I would force myself to listen to it and I never regretted it. 
Hope you find happiness within yourself soon!

QUESTION: My(24f) dad (56m) committed suicide about 2 weeks ago and Im having a hard time grieving and being in school. I don't want to drop out. (UPDATE)

Hi everyone, my last post wasnt super popular or anything but I just thought I'd update you guys anyways!

About a month ago, I went back to school a week after my dad died, and obviously the last few weeks have been super hard. It took me awhile but I ended up getting back on my feet, ultimately school has become one of my biggest outlets as far as keeping myself busy goes. I ended up passing all my classes with all A's and B's and I'm on track to graduate this fall.

Thank you to everyone who believed in me and encouraged me to keep going. Its people like you that really helped me get through one of the hardest chapters of my life..

Life can be really fucking hard, so sometimes you just have to take the small victories where you can.

EDIT Wow never in a million years would I expect my post to blow up this much. I dont really know what else to say other than thank you. I try and find little signs from my dad and today I think it's all you guys, rootin for me. ❤️

ANSWER: I didn’t actually see your initial post but this struck a cord with me as my dad committed suicide last month and I too now have choices to make about school. I’m so sorry for your loss but well fucking done with those results! 💗 as the Kris Jenner meme says you’re doing amazing sweety

QUESTION: UPDATE : I (46F) have hurt my daughter (16F) by giving her friend(16F) a few books

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n7jcfj/i_46f_have_hurt_my_daughter_16f_by_giving_her/)  
I found the perspectives and guidance I received really helpful. I decided to just spend some time with her. She loves to bake and we baked together and we had some movie nights. her comments melted away and she became happier.

we were baking yesterday when she came out to me. I didn't make a big deal out of as I felt she didn't want me to. I just told her I loved her before continuing to bake as if nothing happened. We did have a conversation later on.

She told me that she and her friend had been together ( scary, how well kids can hide things.) Her girlfriend wanted to come out but she didn't and it had strained their relationship. It seems, they had a fight before we gave her the books to her (ex?) girlfriend and that had hurt her. Their relationship is in the limbo and she doesn't want to come out to the world right now. My husband ordered a small pride flag to keep in her room. The world is a bit crazy right now and we want her to have a space where she can be herself.

TL;DR : My daughter came out to me, her friend was actually her girlfriend and they had a fight.

ANSWER: I wish I had you as my mother. No I'm not gay but to take the time to learn from others on how to take care of your daughter lovingly is a really good trait and she is lucky that instead of you responding back in kind or from a place of negativity, you are responding with love.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I [26f] opened my husband's [32m] snapchat and it was a very explicit picture and caption from a girl. He's sitting not 20 feet from me & I don't know how to handle this.

Link to original post: https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4z9cgn/i_26f_opened_my_husbands_32m_snapchat_and_it_was/?ref=search_posts

Again, I am overwhelmed by the support and love I've received from everyone. It feels great to be comforted and cheered on by you all. Thank you so much.

So, husband cheated. He has been since "maybe two weeks before last Christmas", according to him.

I was very calm when confronting him and took the advice many of you gave me by telling him that he needs to explain to me who Roxy is and why she is his "best friend" on Snapchat. His face gave him away immediately but he still tried to lie to me at first.

He said that she works with his friend and they met when his friend invited her out to lunch with the two of them. At first, he claimed he only met her about two months ago. He said that they're "best friends" because he doesn't receive many snapchats from others and she is extremely active on the app. He said she just sends randoms and is really into fitness, so she sends a lot of "inspirational" snaps on being healthy and living a better life. He said that every once in a while, he'll send her something back, like a picture of a cheeseburger or something just to tease her about her level of health-consciousness.

First, I asked why he didn't just tell me about her. He said he didn't even think about it because she's just an acquaintance, not even a friend. Then I asked if he'd ever received anything even remotely inappropriate from her.

He answered with, "Not on purpose". I'm assuming he went with that because he knew I opened that snapchat and he probably knew it was a bad one.

I asked what "Not on purpose" means. He got very defensive. Started raising his voice and saying he doesn't need to explain what that means, that sometimes people accidentally send the wrong snapchats to the wrong people. Then he had the nerve to say something along the lines of, "I feel like I'm on trial here. People warned me that you'd get crazy when you're pregnant but I never thought it'd be this bad."

Now. As some of you mentioned in my last post, it seems amazing that I'm able to keep such a level-head. That is because I was raised by a mother who always told me that you never accomplish anything with anger. That you can be emotional, passionate, upset, etc. without ever raising your voice. Messages received quietly and concisely are just as loud and clear as messages received through yelling and screaming. That is how I have lived my life for 26 years, with the exception of just a few blow ups (I am human).

This moment was an exception. I didn't exactly yell and scream, but I became furious. For him to try to blame this on me being pregnant? How unoriginal and offensive. Long story short, he said he'd never seen me this crazy and I told him that I'd never seen a picture of another girl's pussy on my husband's snapchat before. He came back with that I shouldn't have looked at his snapchat. I came back with that it was an accident but even if it hadn't been, there shouldn't be any reason he's receiving snapchats like that for me to see- accidentally or not- in the first place. I told him that I may be pregnant but I'm also an intelligent person and I am his wife, so I knew he was lying and I deserved to know the truth. I asked if I could see his text messages to see if he's been texting Roxy. He said sure. No messages. Then I asked to see his Facebook messages. He looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He told me no. I asked why.

He finally broke and started to cry. Told me he couldn't let me see the messages because they would hurt me. Because they were inappropriate.

Then it all came out. They screwed in the backseat of her car the first night they met.

This is already long so I'll spare you all the details. But it's been an ongoing affair for months. No, they did not always use protection. Although I was recently screened for STIs, I'll be getting checked again in light of this information.

My uncle already assured me that if he was unfaithful, we would cream him in court. Really the only thing I'm willing to fight him tooth & nail for is our home; I put a lot of effort and money into making this home my dream space. I won't be seeking spousal support but I will seek child support.

I'm obviously heartbroken and told him to go stay in a hotel or with Roxy for all I cared (I confronted him last night). My mom & sister stayed with me last night and let me sob all over them for hours. Right now I'm sort of numb but I'm also thinking very clearly. I know what my next 10 moves are and I feel supported and secure in my decision to leave him and keep my baby.

A few things I just wanted to clarify: My husband is not a lawyer; his good friend is. There was some concern for my success in court if my husband is a lawyer. His friend is in environmental law so, while I'm sure he can provide some advice, he will not be my husband's divorce lawyer.

There were suggestions of me terminating my pregnancy. I fully support the right to choose and I would probably terminate the pregnancy if I was in a different financial position and lacked a support system. However, I work as a marketing manager for a large company. Not only does this allow me the privilege of working from home about 50% of the time, but it also grants me financial independence. I do not rely on my husband for money and I really never have. He works in tech so, while he makes a good salary, I will have no need for spousal support. I have a phenomenal support system; this baby will be loved so dearly by so many. Yes, I will have to deal with my husband for the rest of my life if I have this child and it will make future relationships for me more difficult, but it is worth it. I've wanted this baby since day one and I am her mother, which means that I am strong enough to raise her alone because I have to be strong enough.

Here's to hoping for a speedy divorce. I'm ready to be done with this marriage. Which is crazy because just a few days ago I thought my life was as close to perfect as you could get.

tl;dr Husband admitted to an affair. I will be proceeding with a divorce and will keep our baby. I'm numb but calm and feeling good about my decisions and how I handled the situation. I know there is a long road ahead of me and this will all probably really hit me soon. When it does, I'll mourn and grieve the end of what I had thought was a happy union. Right now I'm in self-preservation mode and much more focused on how to come out of this in the best position possible. Thank you so much for all the advice and support, Reddit!

UPDATE: I know it has been only a short time since I posted this update but I need to tell you all how amazing all of you are. Wow, this much support is just... wow. I wish I could reply to all of your comments and messages but because of the volume, I'm just going to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to each and every one of you who read my posts, who commented, thought of me, wished my baby & me the best, messaged me, and anything else. I am currently at my parent's condo, sitting outside at their pool, sunbathing my little baby bump and reading each and every one of your amazing and empowering comments. I just want you all to have that image; that you have made me happy and content in a time when I am short on both. This is proof that love does exist, even if it doesn't within my, now over, relationship. And that is a powerful thing.

Love to you all.

Me again: I was going to post more details on what happened during the confrontation with my husband, etc., but then I decided against it. I should keep some details private; it's likely my husband has seen this post.

I will leave you with this:

My dad and I were up late talking last night and, as usual, he had the perfect thing to say to me. He told me that weak people are afraid of strong people. He told me to keep on terrifying the weak ones. That way, the only people who won't fear you are the bravest, strongest of people and those are the people who are worthy of you.

Then he said my husband is a spineless turd who couldn't kick it with the strongest woman in the world.

Just thought I'd leave you with that and encourage everyone to "be terrifying" by being strong and not standing for nonsense.

This is the last I will post on the matter. I have a lot ahead of me with everything and will probably go quiet on Reddit for a while. Time to get ready for court and to "be terrifying". :)

Thank you, thank you, thank you again. Love to all of you and best wishes.

Love,

-T

ANSWER: I've been thinking of you since I saw the original post a few days ago. It broke my heart to hear this, you deserve a thousand times better than a man like him.
You've handled the entire thing with utter grace by the sounds of things, I for one could not keep my cool especially if I had pregnancy hormones whizzing around my body. I am flawed by your measured response and strength to leave someone who quite clearly doesn't deserve you. That is true strength. Your child is lucky to have such a strong mother and role model. All the best for the future, you deserve happiness x

QUESTION: [UPDATE] Me [31F] with my husband [35 M] married 2 years together for 10. He doesn't want his kids to be like me.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2i34pr/me_31_f_with_my_husband_35_m_married_2_years/

It took me 3 more years, but I finally left him last year.

This post helped me see how much was wrong in our relationship, but I was still so hesitant to leave.

We had pets and a beautiful home together and I loved his family and we had so many inside jokes and plans for the future.

But eventually it was all just too much for me to take any longer. The day after his parents' 50th anniversary party, I told him I wanted a divorce. I just couldn't see myself living like that for 50 years.

I moved from the suburbs to the city with a friend. I rekindled some old friendships from high school and made a bunch of new friends who I am so thankful for. He kept the dog, I took the cats.

I thought my life was ending but it was just beginning.

I told my (very religious) family and they were all understanding and supportive. I've maintained friendships with a good number of our mutual friends, friendships I was worried about losing.

I'm working on my masters degree and volunteering and experiencing life and love and art and beauty like I never thought was possible.

I met a guy at a friend's punk rock show and we hit it off, but we are taking things very slowly. He is wonderful and so kind to me.

If you are in an abusive relationship, please don't be afraid to leave.

It gets so much better. I still miss him from time to time. I feel guilty about getting divorced, guilty for wasting my parents money on a failed marriage. I miss his parents. I miss my dog.

But I am SO MUCH happier. My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.

Thank you so much to everyone who offered advice and sympathized and even had harsh words for me deciding to stay.

tl;dr: Left my abusive husband. Life is much better.

EDIT: for those saying it didn’t sound that bad or abusive, you should know it got worse. It did escalate to physical abuse, us sleeping separately/no intimacy for a year.

If you think you are too old or too much trouble or have too much baggage or are too much anything, please believe that it is possible to find love again. Both loving yourself and having someone else love you 💕

ANSWER: >My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.

Yes! I remember reading once that what human beings are scared of most is uncertainty. So in a way, staying with your abusive husband -- while awful and full of emotional abuse -- was the safe option because you knew what you were in for. Leaving him was an act of bravery and I hope your future is full of warmth and love.

QUESTION: [Update]I [30f] want to discuss moving in with boyfriend [34m] but we have a significant difference in income.

OP:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i\_30f\_want\_to\_discuss\_moving\_in\_with\_boyfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i_30f_want_to_discuss_moving_in_with_boyfriend/)

Thanks for all the advice, I ended up broaching the topic last week.

As mentioned in the first post both my boyfriend and I have been hinting around the topic but hadn't directly discussed it. I was still on the fence about bringing it up myself when my boyfriend made a comment about how he's excited for us to live together (one day). I just responded with, "Well did you want to? My lease is up in July." and he said that he did.

It was before work when it happened so we left it at that for the day and got together that evening to work out details. I expressed to him at that point that while I would love living with him that my concern was that I wouldn't be able to contribute equally and I didn't want him feeling taken advantage of. He in turn expressed that he'd never want to put me in a bad position financially and that we could easily figure out something that would be fair while still putting me in a better financial position.

We ended up deciding we'd go with a lump sum monthly that I'll pay to him to cover all the costs, rather than splitting bills. The monthly amount he offered at first I actually upped because I didn't think he was being fair to himself, and it was still less than what I pay now. He seemed happy with that and it definitely works for me!

He keeps mentioning how excited he is to move in together, and came to my apartment last week to help me clean for photos to show it! We're deciding together what we'll keep out of my furniture vs. his, what we'll get rid of and what we're going to store. He's also mentioned a couple renovations he wants to get done around the condo so we're going to go together to pick stuff out and make it a summer project. :)

TL;DR: Boyfriend gave me an opening to ask about moving in so I seized it. All went well and we'll be moving in together in June!

Edit: Wow... this really blew up! Thanks to everyone for the super kind words. To address the most common comment here; we did discuss splitting proportionally but ultimately decided to go with a lump sum. I definitely see benefits to proportional splitting but for where we are right now and my financial situation I prefer a lump sum. It's still significantly less than what I'm paying now, and it wont fluctuate as the weather changes so I can count on what I owe monthly not changing.

Many people have mentioned chores as well. My boyfriend and I tend to do chores together. I mean right now with two separate places we each have our things that are more our responsibility but when I've stayed with him for a stretch of time we've just balanced together. He doesn't know how to cook but wants to learn so we cook meals together and then clean up together. We will each have our own washroom at his place (I've already taken over the main washroom and he uses the en suite). He volunteers at a local animal shelter once a week so those days I clean and cook if I'm around. But generally speaking we just treat doing chores as an opportunity to spend time together and be productive. :)

ANSWER: Aw, this is adorable! You guys sound like you communicate well and really care for each other, good luck!

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (30F) caught my husband (31M) in an affair and I don’t know how to move forward.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i7wkqu/i_30f_caught_my_husband_31m_in_an_affair_and_i/

First of all, I just want to thank everyone here for the support I received following my first post back in August. At the time, it truly felt like my world was ending. It was important to me to make this update because I need to tell anyone who’s currently going through the same thing—IT GETS BETTER. You will get so much better.

I had one conversation with my husband since everything happened—by his choice. It lasted maybe five minutes and was like talking to a robot. I know from others that he cries to people about how he ruined his life, but I have never once gotten an apology or the same show of regret. At this point, I don’t care. I know him and the other woman are still seeing each other and frankly, they deserve each other. Good for them.

While I still feel angry occasionally, I no longer mourn what I once had. Instead, I’m so excited for the life I now get to live. I moved to a small walkable city and gave myself my dream apartment. It makes me so happy to see how I’ve decorated it and to just live in a cozy place instead of our old dreary house.  I was the breadwinner in our marriage, and he would make me feel awful about wanting to pay for nice meals or do fun things. Since moving here, I’ve done a ton of foodie fun stuff and don’t feel guilty. It’s so refreshing.

I have dipped my toe into the dating pool again and had plenty of mediocre dates from dating apps. Recently, I found someone who I’ve really clicked with and am enjoying how appreciated and desired he’s made me feel.  It’s definitely early and we’re moving slow, but overall, dating has made me realize that I’m a catch who doesn’t have to settle.

Therapy has done wonders and I’m so happy I immediately dove into it. My therapist is proud of me. I’m proud of me. I’ve stopped looking at being divorced as a failure. He failed—not me. I’m genuinely happy and excited to wake up each morning and no longer feel like this terrible weight is sitting on my chest. The holidays were surprisingly easy and I found myself so happy to spend time with my family without having to compromise anything.

So all in all, life is good and there’s so much of it ahead. Looking back, I can’t believe I wasted so much time thinking about how I could get him to come home. I’ve made my own home and my own happiness and that is worth so so much more.

TLDR; Husband left me for another woman. He sucks, but things get better.

ANSWER: Thank you. I forgot to mention above, but I also got a new job offer and am happily busy with fulfilling work again as well!

QUESTION: Update to the pettiest question ever

Update to this petty thing: [https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3hi08p/stupidest\_question\_ever\_is\_there\_any\_polite\_way/](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3hi08p/stupidest_question_ever_is_there_any_polite_way/)

It  took 5 years and a marriage and he curled his eyelashes last week. He found my eyelash curler and asked what it was for and I told him how to test it on himself. He said he didn't notice any difference but his eyes sparkled for the first time.

He's not going to keep doing it but at least I know what his pupils look like now lol

TL;DR: I didn't ask him, he asked me.

ANSWER: Thank god, I've been on the edge of my seat for the last 5 years. Glad you guys got married and things are OK.

Give us another update in 5 years when you've got a house and a couple kids?

QUESTION: [UPDATE] I'm [28F] unsure if it's time to draw boundaries with my boyfriend [28M] and his coworker [late 20sF] who he got close to very quickly

Original post is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9cx874/im\_28f\_unsure\_if\_its\_time\_to\_draw\_boundaries\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9cx874/im_28f_unsure_if_its_time_to_draw_boundaries_with/)

TLDR of original: My boyfriend has become fast friends with a female coworker. She and her fiancé are now moving into our apartment building, and my boyfriend is seeing and talking to her more and more. I don't know if it's time to set boundaries or if I'm getting ahead of myself.

&#x200B;

A lot has happened since my last post, and I got some good advice there, so I wanted to post an update!

After I made the last post I came home from the trip with my family a couple of days later. I told my boyfriend that I wanted to talk to him about something and I brought up his friendship with Liz. I basically brought up all of my concerns from the post. I told him that I didn't want to discourage him from having a friend, but I also felt like they were talking quite a lot and spending a lot of time together, and that it was starting to make me feel uncomfortable.

My boyfriend took it really well! He immediately reassured me that he only saw her as a friend, and that he hadn't even realized how it could look to me. When I brought up how I felt like he wasn't being forthcoming with information (like how he didn't mention the phone call from her), he said that was 100% unintentional. He then immediately asked what he could do going forward to make me feel more comfortable. He offered to stop carpooling with her and to cut down on contact with her except for work-related stuff. I told him I didn't have a problem with the carpooling because financially it does make sense (he spends a lot of money on gas), but maybe he could try to text and call her outside of work a little bit less. I also told him I would really love to meet her and her fiance, and he enthusiastically agreed.

He set up a hang out for the following weekend - the two of us and Liz and her fiance all went out for drinks at a bar by our building (they'e moved in by now). It was actually really fun! It turns out we all have a ton in common. Liz and I do very similar work, and we all have common nerdy interests. It was a little awkward at first as meeting new people often is, but once we all got comfortable we had a blast. From there, we have all become fast friends, and Liz and I have developed our own separate friendship too. We text often, go over to each other's places for dinner sometimes, and hang out on weekends. I can honestly say I really like Liz (and her fiance) as a person and trust her 100%. I no longer have a problem with her friendship with my boyfriend at all. They do still carpool sometimes, but they've never hung out alone outside of work - it's always the four of us. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Finally, I have a separate - but slightly related - update: my boyfriend is now my FIANCE! Less than a month after I made my last post, he took me out for a really beautiful and romantic dinner. When we came home, our apartment was covered in roses and candles. I was so shocked I could barely move as he got down on one knee and proposed. I said YES and then cried for about two hours as we called all of our friends and family. It was absolutely perfect and we are getting married next year!

It turns out that Liz actually helped him plan the proposal and that was part of why they were talking a lot too! Since she lives in our building now, he had all of the flowers, candles, champagne, and accessories shipped to her and kept at her place until he was ready for them. He even had her hold onto the ring the week before he did it. After he proposed she came upstairs and took photos for us and cried with us. That was the moment I realized what a great friend she is to both of us.

So communication saves the day again! We're all great friends now, and Liz and I have regular girls nights to plan our weddings together :)

TL;DR: I talked to my boyfriend and he introduced me to Liz and her fiance right away. We're all great friends now and I'm no longer uncomfortable - but I am engaged!

EDIT: Wow, wow, wow!!!! I know this is stereotypical, but I never expected my post to blow up like this. I started reading the comments last night and planned to reply to some but then I got busy, and then this just got out of control! So let me just say here, thank you all SO MUCH for the support, advice, and well-wishes! You guys rule 😭 And thank you for the platinum, gold, and silver?! I’ve never gotten any of that before and now I’m a little sad that this is a throwaway and not my main, haha. I’ll pay it forward and gild someone today :)

ANSWER: Awww this is the kinda stuff I’m here for! I’m so glad the situation was resolved healthily and congrats on the engagement! 🤗☺️

QUESTION: UPDATE: Me [36 M] married to my Wife [36 F] 11 years, and I can't stop thinking about a girl I dated for 1 month 16 years ago.

Original Post 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lqpshq/me_36_m_married_to_my_wife_36_f_11_years_and_i/

So I mentioned to my wife vaguely that I was having a bit of a midlife crisis and ruminating on my past a bit too much. That I miss how I was physically at my peak in college.

She said she is also having a bit of a crisis, worried about longterm health and missing the shape she was in before kids.

We made a commitment to each other to get into shape and have changed our eating habits and bought a treadmill. I have been working out daily and my rumination issues have really dwindled. We also planned a nice vacation, and a few get togethers with frends in the next few months.

---
tl;dr: Told wife I was having a crisis without much detail. We are making strides to better ourselves and each other.

ANSWER: That’s a great update. I can promise you that the one month relationship would have never worked out, because it didn’t. And how it ended suggests that it never had staying power.

I hope that getting into shape helps you both. I think the pandemic also makes relationships tough because you’re likely no longer getting out and doing the things that brought you together (or, simply having time apart and separate interests). At least that’s been the case with my marriage! I think that would make it tempting to fantasize about some other reality that “could have” been (but really, it could have never been).

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My (28F) colleague (30F) didn't invite me to her wedding, and it's completely unravelled our friendship

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bctq5b/my_28f_colleague_30f_didnt_invite_me_to_her/)

So it took me a few days to decide the best way to approach this, but yesterday I had lunch with her again and had the conversation.

I started by saying: "So you've sent all your invitations out now, haven't you?"

She looked immediately panicked by my question and I knew right away that she didn't want me to go down this road.

When she said she had sent them all, I asked if that meant she could show me her venue now.

She showed me the website of it, including the photo gallery, and talked me through all about where everything was going to happen, all the flowers and decorations she was going to add etc. It's a nice enough country hotel with some pretty gardens, but I'm not sure what all the secrecy was for.

I probed a little more, asking who she's invited from work (the list didn't include me), said I was looking forward to seeing the photos so I could see how everything looked (she didn't correct me that I would see it on the day) and then I was completely sure that my lack of invitation wasn't an accident. She looked so relieved when I switched subject and asked if she's excited about her honeymoon and having a rest from all the wedding stress.

So I'm definitely not invited. I thought it over carefully and I have decided not to ask why, for three reasons:

1) The reason is already fairly obvious. She clearly doesn't think we're anything more than colleagues and I've misread the situation. (There were some other theories suggested e.g. jealous husband-to-be, associating me with her past grief, but considering everything I know about her and our history I'm sure it's not that.) I'm not sure why she didn't cool it on the wedding talk with someone she had no intention of inviting, or even just bring it up with me and explain why I'm not invited, but never mind.  
2) Having an awkward relationship at work is the last thing I want. I'm worried that if I push this and turn it into an "issue" that I'll look pathetic and needy, or it will just be unprofessional. I also run the risk of her badmouthing me to colleagues and mutual friends, and I will find it much easier and less messy to handle my own feelings quietly.   
3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down.

And you know, I'm fine with not going. It was never really about getting invited to a wedding, it was more having to face the fact that I'd been naive and taken for granted, and I felt silly that I'd invested way too much in this relationship. That's not all on her, because she was never obligated to be my friend.

Talking it through on my previous post actually really helped me work through my feelings. When I went back to work on Monday I felt much calmer and more detached from it emotionally.

I have looked back on our whole relationship and honestly she's always been self involved, entitled and narcissistic. Being a bride has just made it more obvious, but it's always been there. She's also never given back to me (besides helping me get my job, which of course I'm grateful for), in that she's never been willing to talk me through any problems I've had, and although I help her happily with her work, she says no if I ask her for help in return.

She has a few office enemies and even though I saw her negative traits that caused her to be disliked by some people, I overlooked them and defended her anyway. Now I have put a little distance there it's quite apparent that she's not a very nice person, and I'm genuinely OK with just moving on.

She hasn't really noticed the distance between us so far (or she has noticed and doesn't care/is relieved that I'm giving her space), so I intend to just continue with doing that. If she eventually asks why, or I get the sense that she's trying to rekindle our friendship, then it will be time to clear the air with how I've been feeling. If she doesn't and we just continue drifting, then that's probably for the best.

It's sad to lose a friend, and it will probably take me some time to get over it and to become comfortable with the change in our relationship, but I have other genuine friendships, and plenty of colleagues who are lovely people who I can get to know better now.

The main thing I really took from my original post, and I'm so glad I did post because I needed some tough love on this, is that my fear of confrontation really needs dealing with.

If I can learn how to better speak my mind as things are happening, that will stop things from building and building until I have to have a Serious Conversation and it makes what should have been a molehill into a mountain.

I also need to figure out how to have difficult conversations without having an anxiety attack, which not only weakens my message but is extremely distressing and puts me off dealing with things and being honest with people.

I had a couple of books on assertiveness recommended to me, so I've bought them to start me off. I'm also looking into going to a coach, or maybe a couple of therapy sessions at least, to try and better myself. I don't want to hurt other people by doing this, so this has become top priority for me.

Thank you so much everyone who pointed that out to me. I was aware of it but I didn't think it was a problem and figured I'd just be that way all my life. Now I know better. Thank you for being so honest with me.

Also thank you to those who talked me through the one-sided friendship issue. I'm a good listener and have always attracted people who need to vent, but I only ever noticed the one-off conversations, and didn't think I was being taken advantage of as a long term listening ear.

I have been examining my other friendships in the last few days, to see if anyone else is using me in the same way, or if I've even been doing this to others and not had the self awareness to realise. There are a couple of changes I need to make, including a friendship that I need to set some boundaries in, and another one where I've not been giving back to the other person as much I should have. I have learned a really valuable lesson from this about maintaining healthy relationships, and I'm very grateful for that.

&#x200B;

TL;DR So I'm definitely not invited, our friendship is likely over (but that's actually OK) and I'm going to work on my assertiveness so I can handle things like this better next time. I'm also going to move forward having learned a good lesson about friendships being two-way.

Edit: A few people have been asking about the books I was recommended:
Nonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg
When I Say No I Feel Guilty by Manuel J Smith
Why Men Love Bitches by Sherry Argov

ANSWER: > 3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down.

Jesus christ kudos for having that kind of outlook on things.

QUESTION: update to: Husband and I are having our longest fight ever and I don't know what to do

link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/abayxw/husband\_and\_i\_are\_having\_our\_longest\_fight\_ever/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/abayxw/husband_and_i_are_having_our_longest_fight_ever/)

Soon after I made the post, my husband called me. He was babbling and I couldn't understand him, so I kept asking him to slow down. Then he started screaming (not yelling, literally just screaming). I freaked out because I thought he was being murdered or something. I tracked his phone to a park in town and called 911.

Turns out he had a complete mental breakdown. He's in the process of being diagnosed with a mental illness that usually shows up in people's 20s but for some reason manifested later in him. He's currently in an inpatient mental health program and already doing a lot better.

Thank you all again for the responses and advice on my original post.

&#x200B;

ANSWER: The onset of mental illness posts are the ones that I hate the most.

Often nobody is really at fault, but its likely the start of a long and difficult road for all involved.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (26F) want to propose to my boyfriend (25M) but just found out he plans to propose as well

Link to my original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/exp0i0/i_26f_want_to_propose_to_my_boyfriend_25m_but/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So yesterday he took me to run errands but he "randomly" decided to we should just have fun instead. He took me around the city, we tried all kinds of food, had honestly the most fun I've had since I was a kid, made memories off of little moments, I didn't think that much of it. I realized that the whole day had basically been an all day-date, I knew it had to be coming and I had the ring with me and I was going to try and propose at the same time (someone suggested this in my original post and I thought it would be cute)

He opened my door, walked me down a beautiful pathway and just looked me in the eyes and I said yes. He laughed and dropped down to one knee and I started crying and forgot that I was supposed to be proposing too. I don't even remember what he said, he was on his knee for a while saying what I'm sure were the sweetest things, but I was too busy crying. I'd already said yes before he even got down on one knee so he put the ring on my finger.

We went home and and I realized I didn't propose, he wanted to shower and we sometimes shower together so I proposed to him in there. He smiled and said “I wonder if when our first kid is born will it top this moment” then because I was on my knees in the shower he had to make a sex joke 😂

After we got out he held me while we called his parents (I'd already called my whole family in car ride home)

Yesterday was amazing and now I'm laying next to him while he plays video games and he's talking about our engagement to his friends and I couldn't be happier and I don't know how to contain all this and just ugh! I love you Nathan!❤️

Edit: Thank you to everyone congratulating us! I appreciate it very much 😊

TL;DR: He took me on a romantic all day date and popped the question. I was supposed to propose at the same time but was too busy crying form happiness, I proposed to him in the shower when we got home😂 I'm overjoyed right now!

ANSWER: I needed this positivity. This may sound weird coming from a random stranger, but I'm happy for you. Wish you all the best and your SO as well.

QUESTION: My (30F) husband (32M) impulse bought a dog. [update]

Update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cmu75w/my_30f_husband_32m_impulse_bought_a_dog/

Thank you all for the thorough responses. I read every comment you guys sent.

A few months ago I read a post where a woman sat down with her husband and outlined everything she takes care of at home in a list format. Like, kitchen: trash, dishes, wipe counters down. Etc. That way of communicating really stuck with me and when we went to see our therapist, I used the same format to express how much I do for the dog.

My husband told me that owning a dog was a joint effort and since I’m home all day it shouldn’t be a problem.

Which is when I realized that has been his excuse for everything. Cooking, chores, cleaning. I’m not sure how I became blind to it. I don’t know when I started bending over backwards to accommodate him.

We used to be a solid couple who helped each other out. I remember when I was still in school he’d come over to my apartment and clean the whole thing for me during finals. Or he took care of my elderly cat when I was away for a week and a half. He used to help me dry the dishes and it was always fun. We used to have so much fun and laugh all the time. At some point it all stopped.

I started crying right there in the middle of a sentence and he got concerned. I’m not a cryer the only time he’s ever seen me cry was when I had to put my beloved cat down a few years ago. But he held me for the first time in what felt like months and we had a serious heart to heart about how he made me feel. Not only with the dog but how stressed I’ve been with my job, how lonely I am, I don’t feel important and how we don’t feel like a team anymore, that I’m worried about us.

I guess it clicked for him because he really stepped up taking care of the dog. He started going into work earlier so he can come home early and hang out and make me dinner. It happened slowly over the course of the last few weeks and the routine suits us a lot better. We hired a trainer to make sure we can understand the dog’s boundaries together and the dog sleeps in a dog bed. Our bedroom life has slowly gotten back to where it was when we got married. We’re watching our favorite shows again and going out more. I’ve been putting my foot down more about my feelings and he has been receptive. We are still going to therapy for now.

As for the dog, we’re going to keep him. Is he a No List dog? Yes. But is he a good puppy with a big heart? Yes. We have the money to afford him and he took off after training. It’s nice having a dog again.

TL;DR: husband and I went to therapy, we talked through our problems, we are giving our marriage the time and attention it needs to mend. We’re keeping the dog.

ANSWER: Good job on the communication. Things can sneak up on people and unfair routines can creep in. I'm glad that you two seem to be correcting course for your relationship and it's a big positive that he's putting in a lot more effort now.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] I [29F] am traveling overseas to meet my online "boyfriend" [38M] in a week. He just said he had to cancel

So many through comments and PMs requested an update from my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9vlueu/i_29f_am_traveling_overseas_to_meet_my_online/) and so I thought I'd do one!

After my post I FaceTimed him to say my what I wanted to say and end things. He tried to get me to post-pone my trip and even tried to give me money to make me less mad at him. I told him whatever we had was over as I could no longer trust him. He cried which made me feel weird. I wished him and his ex the best and ended the call.

I went on my trip and had a top class time. The Reddit community really astounds me sometimes. I received a lot of PMs of suggestions of things to do and see and the trip to Ireland became a trip of a lifetime. In Dublin I did meet up with a very kind Redditor who showed me around the city and came with me to a bunch of museums during my stay. I saw amazing sights, met a bunch of really cool people through my travels, and met a few really cute Irish boys. (;

I learned a lot about myself on my first solo trip abroad. I am pretty self reliant and I did a lot of self reflection. This "relationship" was my first "serious" one after my ex and I split up. I think in my desire for closeness with someone I ignored a lot of red flags and downplayed my self worth. I am now focusing on making real connections with people I meet in real life and have decided to stay away from anything long distance indefinitely.

My first night in Belfast I did message him after I had had a what was probably too many beers (damn you delicious Irish beers!) and he said he was sorry but it was what it had to be. It didn't really seem sincere and it extinguished any romantic notions I had.

Thank you to everyone who commented and PM'd me. It really made me excited for my trip and it was the best time!

TLDR; Online BF backed out but after some logistical rearranging I still went on my trip and had the best time ever. Glad I cancelled the bf and not the trip.

ANSWER: > Glad I cancelled the bf and not the trip.

I love this, lol! I'm glad I caught the update post, and am so happy that you went through with the trip! Wishing you oodles of happiness and success in the future, OP. ♥

QUESTION: Update: My wife [28F] found out that my mother [59F] and I [28M] have been lying to her about our (me and my wife's) baby [0M] for months

Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/az648p/my\_wife\_28f\_found\_out\_that\_my\_mother\_59f\_and\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/az648p/my_wife_28f_found_out_that_my_mother_59f_and_i/)

Don't think anyone would particularly care about an update but I all appreciated the insight anyways. So here's an update:

After I wrote the original post, my mom took my son to stay overnight with my wife's sister so that the two of us could have the house to ourselves.

We pretty much just talked for an hour while constantly reaffirming that we love each other a lot and want to sort this out. I apologized and explained why I did what I did. She said that feeling like she was there for our son's milestones was really just a band-aid solution that didn't actually convince her she was present. She said that if she actually had been using the milestones to feel like she was present, this would probably have felt worse for her. But since she wasn't, in her words, "deluding herself into thinking she's actually home", her main issue was that I lied which hurt her feelings. I apologized and explained that I honestly thought that she would prefer the lying if given the choice. She said she understood where I was coming from and that she felt betrayed when she realized, but she sees that I was doing it because I love her and she thinks we'll probably laugh about it with our grandkids one day (yes, I am very aware I don't deserve my wife).

Some things came out on my end that I wasn't going to tell her and didn't mention in my last post- namely, that I'm scared she's going to become suicidal. My uncle committed suicide when I was a child, in part from working in a high-stress job where he made a huge and costly mistake. One of my wife's colleagues attempted suicide while she was on mat leave. Being a working mom is bad enough, being a resident in this program is bad enough, both combined are a recipe for trouble. Since our son was born and the incident with her colleague happened, I've been afraid that if her home life wasn't perfect, it would push her over the edge. Anyways, she reassured me that that's not happening and I think saying it out loud also made me realize it's a pretty irrational, groundless fear.

We ordered takeout and sat together watching the real videos I have of all our son's firsts. I also have a special folder of pictures/videos of my son with my wife, so we went through that after. She almost choked from laughing so hard when I tentatively revealed the beanbag trick. I am the laughing stock of her friend-group chat. So I guess we're already at the stage where we're laughing about it.

Thank you to those who responded to the last post! The stereotype of someone in [r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships) advocating divorce every time anything happens is true.

tl;dr: marriage is work. I am stupid. We moved past it.

ANSWER: I've always heard that NO firsts ever happen in daycare. Until Mom sees it happening, it didn't happen. Many grandparents feel the same way.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (34F) feel unattractive and my husband (41M) of 5 years has low libido

I posted last summer about [struggles with my husband of 5 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/), our longest dry spell being 9 months.

I felt unattractive and undesirable, and wanted to have sex more often, but he was happy to never have sex again (aside from how that would affect me). I wanted to feel like a sex Goddess again. Reddit advised me all kinds of things, from checking testosterone, to therapy, and even that there was no hope and if I wanted to feel like a Goddess again, I'd have to leave him. The [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/estjlke?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that hit me hardest was jimmyjrdanceparty's who pointed out that I was allowed to feel the way I did.

Well, I feel like a Goddess again, everyone! :D

What happened? I decided to go to individual therapy, and focus on myself, work on myself. My physical self-image was a symptom of a larger problem. Troubles at work, troubles at home, a storm inside. During counselling, I opened the door to a cellar where I had been keeping my true self locked in the dark - ashamed of her. I was bullied as a kid, and I had no idea I had accumulated so much self-loathing since then. Releasing that was amazing and so freeing!

And so, by the time I said goodbye to my counsellor, I was stronger and more self-assured. I realised I had been sacrificing so much of myself for the sake of others (especially the important men in my life - my husband, my boss, my father, my manager, etc). I was constantly seeking approval, trying to please them. My relationships had gotten completely out of balance.

Things started to get complicated. I developed a crush on a colleague, and because I am demisexual, my attraction to my husband started to diminish. The more time passed the more I felt like I just didn't care anymore what he thought of me.

At a low point, I said to my husband: "You know, you always keep your thoughts to yourself. I used to find it mysterious and interesting - like a puzzle I could unwrap. But now I realise that there's actually no mystery to unravel. There's just nothing. And the silence is boring." It was hurtful and unkind. I'm not proud of it. Something changed after that. Both for him, and for me.

Over the course of the next few months I gave less, and I took more. I went to conferences, I left the kids with my husband, I took time off work, I stopped making up for the mistakes of my superiors at work and let them deal with the consequences of their actions. I felt like I was coming home to my true self - my no nonsense kickass self.

One night my husband and I were watching Alien, and he confessed that ever since he'd seen the original as a boy, he'd really liked Ripley. She was the kind of woman he had wanted to marry. And so he married me. You should've seen my face, the tears wouldn't stop. I felt like he had finally told me what I needed to hear the most.

I got rid of my attraction to my colleague. It's actually not that hard as a demi, I just focused on everything I didn't like about them, and within a week or two the crush was totally gone. I find them a total turn-off now.

Do you remember I mention I wasn't able to initiate sex? That's because it was a huge turn-off for my husband. One evening we discussed why, and you know what? He felt too much pressure if I initiated, because he thought he'd have to perform. Once he realised that he can safely turn me down if he's not in the mood - and also that's it's OK for us to kiss and cuddle without it leading to something more - he's been OK with me initiating. You'd think you wouldn't get to age 40 without having figured that out, but hey... I guess people never cease to throw surprises!? Haha!

Our sex life improved a lot. I no longer needed his praise to sooth my self-loathing, so I was less needy about it. He initiated a bit more often. But more importantly, with greater enthusiasm and quality! He chooses what I wear sometimes - and I feel so beautiful when he looks at me like I am the only being that matters. And he compliments me! We even got into a bit of light D/s, which has spiced things up a lot!

Even though I had fallen out of love with him for a while, I have fallen back in love with my husband stronger and harder than ever before!! I couldn't be happier, I love myself, and I love him so SO much!! He's just the best partner I could ever wish for! <3

Thank you reddit for helping me through one of the hardest lows in my life, and thank you especially jimmyjrdanceparty for your advice and encouragement.

TLDR: I felt unattractive and my husband didn't want sex. I went to a counsellor. I stopped self-loathing. Husband and I fell back in love again & have great sex.

Update: OMG thank you thank you thank you for all the comments and awards! I have no words! I thought maybe 5 people would care about the update, not this amazing amount of encouragement! Thank you so much, so glad to have been on this journey with you. <3

ANSWER: This is the best post I have ever read on here. You changed your thoughts about yourself, which is the secret to life (IMO). Congrats and thank you for this empowering and amazing story!

QUESTION: UPDATE: My [24 F] boyfriend [26 M] of 6 months told me that I need to "unlove" the men from my past before I can love him.

Link to original post [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ccl1gt/my\_24\_f\_boyfriend\_26\_m\_of\_6\_months\_told\_me\_that\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ccl1gt/my_24_f_boyfriend_26_m_of_6_months_told_me_that_i/)

Figured I'd update my post from about a month ago. Unfortunately, there wasn't a happy ending, but I am very grateful for a lot of the advice I received here. Thank you, reddit, for helping me keep my head on straight!

After I made my first post, I read all the comments and thought about everything for a few days. A lot of people mentioned that they would not be comfortable with the frequency of my communication with my ex. I thought that was very fair. People also mentioned that Mark's behavior was pretty controlling and not ok. I also thought that was fair.

I went to talk to Mark and told him that I understood if he was uncomfortable with me being in touch with Eli weekly, and that I would be totally willing to cut that down. I also reiterated again that I was not currently in love with Eli and hadn't been for a while. Mark was understanding this time and seemed happy with the fact that I offered to cut down my contact with Eli.

But then I told Mark that although I was willing to do this, I wasn't happy with how he approached the issue and that I found his behavior controlling. I basically told him that I want him to approach issues in a more rational way and I would appreciate if he opened a dialogue rather than just telling me what to do, and that I wouldn't put up with him trying to "command" me to do something (especially something so ridiculous). I said everything in the same tone as I used for the first half of the conversation - I wasn't yelling at him or admonishing him, just trying to let him know where my boundaries are.

You guys - Mark. Flew. Off. The. Handle. He started SCREAMING at me. I obviously wasn't having it, so I got up to leave. He started throwing dishes and random kitchen items at me, and grabbed me and slammed my head into the door jam. I ended up with a nasty black eye and a busted lip. Luckily for me, a neighbor heard the commotion and called the cops. Mark was arrested and I was taken to the hospital. Yes, I'm pressing charges and filed for a restraining order.

Overall, it was a horrible incident but I'm glad this happened earlier in the relationship rather than later. And I am forever grateful for the neighbor who called the cops. Im also grateful to (most of) you guys for telling me that I wasn't being insane in my first post and for pointing out the early warning signs. It wasn't the best ending, but I'm ok and I'm just glad it's over. Take this as a cautionary tale, I guess!

TLDR: tried to have a rational conversation with Mark, he gave me a black eye and busted lip, it's over (thank God).

EDIT: I've gotten a lot of concerned messages (which I appreciate!) telling me to watch out for Mark now and that abusers are often at their most dangerous right after a breakup. Just to ease everyone's mind: I'm staying with a classmate (who Mark does not know) for the time being, so I'm well-protected! Thanks everyone!

ANSWER: Him: WOULD A CONTROLLING PSYCHO DO THIS?!

Him: (Smashes dishes and your head)

All of us: ...yes?

I’m really glad you got out of there. I hope you heal quickly.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My best friend (20M) asked me (20M) out. I said yes. I didn't know it was a date.

The original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9du198/my_best_friend_20m_asked_me_20m_out_i_said_yes_i/

First of all, I wanted to thank people for responding. I was majorly panicking when I wrote the post, and the comments I got helped a ton to get me to relax before talking to Noah. I wasn't expecting such a huge response at the time and I was amazed, but looking back now I can see why it got so much attention. It was a pretty weird situation.

Next, I want to say we are both men (apparently this makes a big difference for some people in terms of advice). Some of the people who assumed I was a woman also made some weird comments and sent me some pretty gross messages. If you did this, please stop. That's not cool.

I gave a bit of an update as an edit to the original post, but now since it's been 3 months I thought I'd give you all an update about how things have been going since then, since it seems like there's been a bit of interest, and I'm still really thankful to all of you for helping me out.

Noah is doing really well. I could tell he was still a bit embarrassed for the first couple weeks, but after that he told me again that he was still happy he asked me because now he knew how I felt and he could get over it. He also thanked me for taking it so well, which is definitely thanks to what a lot of you said, so I guess I'm sort of passing his thanks on to you :P

One of the commenters said I should be careful not to do anything that seemed like flirting with him, so I tried keep that in check (we used to hug a lot, sit really close together, and tell each other flirty jokes, you get the idea, but I toned those all down a lot to give him space and not mess with his feelings). I honestly think I see now why he thought I might be into him, because my relationship with him was very affectionate. It's been a lesson for me on how to be more aware of how other people are interpreting my signals.

About a month after he asked me out, he asked me if I wanted to go to a gay bar with him. He made it super clear that it wasn't a date, but he did it in a really sarcastic way, which was a little embarrassing for me but also I think it was good that he could joke about it. So we went to a local gay bar together and we had a really good time. He's a bit introverted, so I played the wingman, and he ended up flirting with this really cute guy and he just seemed really happy.

That was like two months ago and we've gone to the same bar a couple more times since then. He's been getting a bit more comfortable putting himself out there which is really cool to see, and he's just been more open and happy for the last two months, always smiling and eager to go do stuff. Not sure how it's related but it's a noticeable change from before he asked me out.

I'm doing great too. I'm just really happy that I didn't hurt our relationship and that he's so happy. I also learned some important things from this whole situation about communication and being aware of how I present myself. Important lessons. I actually think I feel more confident now too, since he asked me out. Getting asked out feels good man.

It sounds kind of weird, but I think it made us closer. We've started talking about relationships more, which isn't something we really talked about before. He's gone on a few dates and he tells me about them, and the most recent guy he went out with he was really excited about, and I think he might be headed for his first serious relationship, which is amazing! That's actually what made me think of this post and decide to give you all an update.

TL;DR: So yeah, our relationship wasn't ruined and I still have my best friend. He's doing really well and I love seeing him so happy.

Thanks again for the help!

ANSWER: What a lovely happy update - and I had to go back and check your ages because the maturity and self awareness you have both shown is pretty impressive. Big smile from this mom 🙂 Happy holidays!

QUESTION: (Update) How do I (28f) break up with someone when I’m their (31m) everything?

[Link to original post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aab0wm/how_do_i_28f_break_up_with_someone_when_im_their/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Straight to it: I broke up with him a day after I made my original post a few months ago. I was emboldened by the support and, strangely enough, even some of the negative comments. I came home from work and blurted it out, straight and to the point. I told him that I wasn’t happy, I hadn’t been for a while, and that we would be separating. We agreed that he could stay in the extra bedroom for a few months while we got everything sorted but when the lease was up we would be going our separate ways.

The last few months have been hard. He went into full blown panic mode, promised to change in the ways I had waited years for, and had several actual melt downs begging me to stay. It was painful, but my resolve to live my own life never wavered.

I just signed a new lease (by myself) and have begun to casually date someone in the same field as me. Life has an excitement to it that I haven’t felt in years, it’s like I’ve taken my first deep breath in a long time.

So, if you’re on the fence about leaving someone but your lives are so enmeshed that you don’t see how it is possible: put yourself first, there is always a way out. Thank you!

TLDR: I broke up with my codependent boyfriend and am the happiest I have been in years.

ANSWER: Amen.

Leases, shared bills, mutual enjoyment of GOTs or Survivor while everything else is terrible is no reason to stay together.

I’ve told my sons. Keep an emergency fund that you NEVER touch. Don’t bail on relationships, but NEVER stay in a relationship because you don’t have first months/last months rent and security deposit.

EDIT - thanks for the gold!! Just trying to share some hard-earned wisdom.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My [27F] boyfriend's [27M] old crush returning after a few years away. I was worried he would leave me for her, sadly I was right.

Old post - https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xgz9v/my_25f_boyfriend_25m_had_a_crush_on_a_girl_25f/

He ended up breaking up with me about a month after she came back and got back with her. It's been two years since this all happened and I heard through the grapevine they got engaged last weekend. I've moved on and it's alright, but my heart breaks when I think of how insecure and self-conscious I felt when all this went down. I know I'll eventually find a guy who I won't have any worries about, until then I'm chilling.

TL;DR: I was right to be worried.

ANSWER: I get you. I was supposed to be getting engaged and married to a guy who I thought loved me. Come to find he was cheating on me. They have since gotten married and had a family.

The biggest thing that stung wasnt the fact that he cheated, but the thought that I wasn't good enough for him but she was. I had to realize that I was good enough for a good man.

You are good enough. You are worthy of love and affection. You are 100% worth it and there is someone out there who will see that. I promise you.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] Me [32/F] with my husband [39 M] 6-years, our sex life disappeared; he swears he's attracted to me and I'm not sure what to believe or do.

[Here is the original post.  It is from over two years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40tuc7/me_32f_with_my_husband_39_m_6years_our_sex_life/)

I know my original post is so old, but the biggest update only recently happened.  My therapist suggested I post about it here to help sort out how I feel right now and also as a warning to other people.  I feel like I have grown so much in the last few years and maybe I'm a bit less naive (or a bit more bitter... however you'd like to put it).

Through interacting with the comments, I came up with an ultimatum I would give my husband.

1.  He needed to get his medical stuff tested.

2.  He see someone psychologically.

3.  Couple's counseling.

I decided ahead of time that he'd have to do the legwork for this already.  I had already done so much legwork for this relationship and I wanted to make sure I didn't hold his hand through this either.

He took it surprisingly well for what the conversation was.  There were tears on both sides but he agreed that yes, he would be willing to do these things for the sake of the relationship.

And then days passed.  And a week past.  I finally brought it up again and it caused a minor fight where he told me he needed to do this sort of stuff on his own time.

A few more weeks past.  I realized that he did not care enough to do something about this.  It was a hard thing to realize, but it was clear as day.

I headed over a friend's house to talk things out, clear my head, and come up with a plan for divorce.

I drove home and a few minutes before I arrived, he got a phone call that his sister was in a coma and dying.  I booked him tickets to go see her.  She passed away a few hours after he saw her.

She left behind two late-teenage girls.  Who we were now partially responsible for.

So I pushed my pain down and decided to be the best aunt I can to these two girls.  I also got myself a dog (best decision ever in this situation) to keep my own spirits up.

I worked really hard at this and felt like my husband and I were getting closer in the process.

More recently, I started realizing that everything we were doing for the girls was initiated through me--not him.  So I started paying more attention.  He was getting annoyed at me making a big deal over surprise care packages their school suggested we send in and other things like that.  I was starting to resent that he wasn't caring for his nieces in the same way as I was.

On the youngest niece's graduation day, I asked him if he thought the other parents there would be getting flowers for the graduates and if that's something we should do.  This is when he totally lost it at me.  It was a string that started with him yelling about how I get too concerned about these sorts of things and ended with a rant about how I buy too many crackers when company comes over for dinner.  This started changing the lens I was looking at him through again.  Also, at this point, I felt like my nieces had launched into the world with lives of their own.

I started re-seeing the eyerolls when I talked.  The cutting remarks about my intelligence.  Oh, and the utter lack of sex.

So I started talking to people.  I started seeing a therapist.  And together, we all came up with a plan to discuss everything with him--probably ending in divorce (though I never took that as a definite).

I decided we had a different view of what a relationship and marriage should be.  My plan was to present that to him calmly and let him give his opinion of how he sees things.

I had a work trip so I took the time to recoup.  I went on a long hike, and even though I'm not really religious, I prayed the whole damn time about this.

So when I got home, in the calmest and most even way I could, I explained the situation as I saw it and asked for his feedback.  My friends and I rehearsed what would happen if he cried and begged for a chance to change--or what to do (or rather, where to go) if he got really angry.

But nothing prepared me for his reaction.  He agreed with me.  He said that everything felt "forced" to him and that this wasn't a natural relationship.  That he married me because that was the path he was on, and since he wasn't planning on having kids, it's not like that mattered all that much.  In fact, he prefers being alone generally.

He then finished by asking if I thought we should get couple's counseling.  I calmly said that given what he just said, I didn't think that was an option.  He immediately started trying to talk next steps, who gets what, etc.  He brought up that he could probably technically fight for alimony but that he wouldn't.  And said he wouldn't fight for my dog if I don't fight to go after his seperate finances.

I think this was the most painful in the moment reaction I could have had from him.  I told him I would give him some space that night, so I drove to my friend's house and cried my eyes out.  Him not fighting it is ultimately better for the long run, but it's really hard to realize that your husband of 5 years (and partner for 8) never really loved or cared for you.

I should have listened to my gut all along.

We had that talk last night.  I'm currently sitting in a coffee shop, typing this all out.  I'm a relatively attractive person and I channeled my frustrations over the last few years into lifting and working out almost every day.  So I'm hopeful when it comes to love in the future.

I don't really know what my next step is.  I might drive to my brother's.  I might look for a storage facility.  It's a bit overwhelming to think about.

Overall, I'm so grateful this is happening now and that I won't be looking back at my life when I'm 85 years old, disappointed that it never really started.  I have my life in front of me and it's a big scary place.  But after I finish crying my eyes out, it's one step in front of the other.

And thank you everyone for all your help.

tl/dr:  Put off divorce due to spouse's sister dying and despite everything we worked on together, found out he never really loved me.

ANSWER: I am so sorry..

I wanted to come here to say, specifically, thank you so much for being an amazing aunt to those girls. I lost my mom when I was 15 and my aunts were hands-down the biggest blessing during that time. I don’t know if I would have chosen to continue living if it hadn’t been for their support. So thank you for being so incredibly selfless and supportive for your nieces.

QUESTION: UPDATE: recently found out that I (17M) got into my brother's (19M) former dream university which he did not get accepted to last year, feeling guilty about really wanting to go now

Update to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95s4ri/recently_found_out_that_i_17m_got_into_my/)

On Saturday I was able to speak to my brother and tell him that I got into the university. He was really happy for me, like a lot of people said he would be. When I told him I got in he gave me a huge hug and was really excited. It was such a huge relief.

He asked me if it was my top choice, since he didn't know I had applied. I told him it was and he said that we have to celebrate then. He told me I didnt seem excited enough and I should be really proud of myself, and he asked if it was the shock of just finding out.

When I told him I find out a few days ago and he was the only one that knew he asked me whats going on, because I wasnt reacting to the great news like it was great news. I admitted that I worried about telling him because I didnt want him to be mad.

We talked about it and he basically said what everyone in the comments said, that he's proud of me and happy for me. I mentioned that I got into a different program than his and my requirements were lower, and he told me to not downplay my success and to stop worrying about him being mad because he wasn't. He told me that when I told out parents he wanted me to be more confident and proud of myself, because I did something great.

Yesterday while we were hanging out at his buddy's house he told me I should tell them the news, when I didnt want to because I hate talking about myself he asked if could tell them, which I told him was OK. they were all happy for me too. Honestly, he's reaction was better than I even hoped for, but looking back I should have expected it from him because that's always been the type of brother he is.

TL;DR told my brother I got into the university and he incredibly supportive and happy for me. He told me not limit my success to make other people more comfortable, and that he was proud of me (which meant a lot to hear).

ANSWER: Respect to the brother for being 19 but behaving like a real adult here. Setting a great example for little bro.

QUESTION: Update: My [25f] boyfriend [26m] of 10 months is best friends with his ex [20s?f]. She refuses to meet me and it's getting weird

Link to OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6mql7n/my_25f_boyfriend_26m_of_10_months_is_best_friends/

I wrote my previous post over a year ago, and a lot has happened since then. I wanted to give everyone an update, since the advice on this sub was really helpful at the time.

For a few months after I wrote my OP, nothing much happened. Jeff and I continued dating, and he continued being friends/partners with Jenna. I never met her, but everything else in our relationship seemed to be going so well that I decided I'd try to deal with it.

Things got really hard, however, when I had to take a work contract 12 hours away from home for three months. I hardly saw Jeff the whole time, and I looked at Jenna's instagram almost every day to see if she'd posted more photos of them together. More often than not, she had. Since I wasn't physically present, I felt like Jenna was his real girlfriend. I felt completely worthless and constantly stressed out, knowing my boyfriend was spending all his time with another woman who I already had suspicions about.

While I was away for work, I decided to break up with Jeff. I broke up with as soon as I came back, and I made it very clear that his relationship with Jenna was intolerable for me. I told him he was going to have a hard time dating anyone who wasn't her as long as she was still in his life. He kept saying he didn't understand why it was such a problem. He told me he couldn't control her behaviour, but he promised me he hadn't cheated on me. I explained to him that by allowing their friendship to continue, he was condoning her behaviour. I told him I didn't really even care if he'd physically cheated or not, since he'd already shown disrespect for me and our relationship.

I didn't speak to him for a few months and I went on with my life. I took another contract out of town and even considered moving permanently to another city. One night, though, Jeff called me and apologized. He said he had been thinking about our relationship a lot and realized he had been in the wrong. He said his relationship with Jenna was beginning to feel toxic to him, and he'd made arrangements to dissolve their business partnership. After that, I decided to meet up with him (not necessarily give him another chance) and discuss the situation further. When we met up, he promised to stop talking to Jenna and unfollowed her on all social media.

As of now, he has not spoken to her in six months, and we've gotten back together. We actually ran into her at a concert a few weeks ago, and they didn't even say hi to each other. I feel much more respected and confident in my relationship now.

TLDR: I broke up with my boyfriend. He ended his friendship/partnership with his ex and we have gotten back together.

ANSWER: Wow. Good for both of you that the communication ended up working and you're happy together now. Congrats and hope it works out.

QUESTION: Update 2: I (30F) caught my husband (31M) in an affair and don’t know how to move forward.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/vfJzYwOX6V

Update 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/uMVTyBbusT

Wow. I can’t believe this happened over five years ago now. In some ways, it feels like it happened to me in a different life. I still get messages asking about this and figured I could add some insight into how life can look a few years down the line after everything gets completely and utterly wrecked. Good news—If you put in the work, it looks pretty fucking great.

First of all—where is my ex husband now? I haven’t had contact with him since September of 2020 and largely don’t keep track of things but I can see that this man still follows me on Instagram and watches all of my stories. I considered blocking him, but just let it be. I think it’s the petty part of me who’s living a full life that’s fine with rubbing it in a bit.

He and the affair partner did get married after a whoopsie kid and I’m pretty sure they had another. But they also both lost their jobs as teachers (he got her a job at his school, so she was working with an entire staff that knew they had an affair) and had to move to the middle of nowhere. Last I heard of them, the affair partner had been texting his former best friend unhinged rants about not including them in get togethers or allowing my ex-husband to be a groomsman in his wedding.

But enough about them, because they already took up way too many pages in my story.  When we last left off, I think I had just moved to a new city (shoutout to Richmond, VA!) and was largely just finding myself again. I think the change of scenery was the best thing that I did for myself. I was never meant to live in the suburbs and moving to a beautiful little city where I can walk to coffee shops, bakeries and bookstores honestly helped my mental health as much as the therapy. I bought a house here a couple years ago and have really settled in.

Then I got my puppy, a corgi named Bilbo Baggins who really is the true love of my life. He is the greasiest thing to happen to me and is just such a fantastic chonky guy. We go to a local dog park with a bar all the time and he even has his own lil’ dog social group. Kids aren’t something I plan on, so he is basically my son.

It hasn’t all been perfect. My dad died, my best friend moved across the country, and I largely haven’t really been dating much the past couple of years.  Dating hasn’t been a huge priority for me and my friends say that I’m probably too picky. I say that I know what it’s like to be in a marriage with someone who might love you but doesn’t like you and it’s worth not settling.

But while I may be single, I am fulfilled and busy. My birthday is Saturday and I’ll be spending it in Paris at a Lady Gaga concert. I saw Sabrina Carpenter in Amsterdam, Taylor Swift in Lyon, Springsteen in Edinburgh, Noah Kahan at Fenway Park. Earlier this year I was able to visit Katmai National Park and see the brown bears in the falls. I have a DnD group and a really amazing village of people I love.

I would not be in this headspace if I didn’t go to therapy and work out the why of me settling for this man in the first place. True story: When planning our honeymoon in New Zealand, I, of course, had to plan the entire thing despite him picking the location. He refused to do any driving, so we had to do a guided tour that left on specific dates. He pretended to not be able to get a day off of work when we needed to leave until I started crying and begging him to just ask his boss for it because literally no other flights worked. That’s when he said he actually always had the day off but wanted to make sure I was actually working hard enough to choose good flights.

Anyway, I chose to marry… that and it was a lot to unpack in therapy.  But I’m glad I did because without it I don’t think I’d have built this life for myself. At the end of the day, what happened set me up to live a happier life than what I was living so in some ways, I’m thankful for the experience, shitty as it was.

If you’re in the middle of something terrible, unfair, and world-shattering to you, just know that it’s not forever. While this experience has made me a bit of a believer in karma, I also know that there was a lot of work to get myself out of that big black mental hole. Sometimes it seemed that I would slide back in it but by looking forward and figuring myself out, I eventually clawed my way out. I think you can too—and that you’re worth fighting for.

TLDR: Got therapy, life is good, ex-husband stalks me on Instagram, and maybe we should all get dogs for our mental health.

ANSWER: I feel like following this story and you having this be your current chapter is the best thing I've heard this year.

I'm so happy for you!

Never settle, know your worth. And give the Sir some skritches!

Also, Richmond is a beautiful city. I grew up as a teenager there.

QUESTION: I (22F) just found out my boyfriend (38M) lied about his age for a year—what do I do?

I (22F) recently found out my boyfriend (38M) lied about his age for a year. We met at work, got along, and became official 6 months ago. This is my first relationship, and now I feel completely broken.

He claimed to be 31 years old the first time we met. I was unsure about the age gap, but after seeing how well we connected, I decided to give it a chance.

This morning, we went to do some legal paperwork where I needed his ID. At the office, he kept handing his ID upside down to the staff and refused to let me see it after asking nicely, claiming privacy. By then I had my doubts, though I wasn’t exactly sure what he was hiding.

I finally confronted him saying that I needed to see his ID or I wouldn't be able to trust him anymore. It escalated to, "What are you hiding from me?" He never answered directly. Back home, after much insistence, he gave up and told me the truth:

He lied about his age because he felt bad about being old and wanted to feel younger. He said he knew I wouldn’t accept being with him if I knew his real age, and that he “was planning on telling me” eventually because his guilt was getting hard to manage. He admitted that what he did was wrong, then tried to reassure me that it wasn’t my fault, that I was an excellent girlfriend and person, and that everything we shared was real. I closed the door in his face after telling him I needed to process everything.

This feels like a nightmare. And hurts like shit.

I trusted him, shared my life and my love, and even planned a future together—moving abroad, traveling, building a new life. Now I feel so betrayed, angry, and heartbroken.

I can't believe I was lied to for so long, something so fundamental. I don’t know what to do next. Should I try to salvage this, or just walk away?

Edit: About the “legal paperwork” part, I think I worded it wrong. It’s nothing that really binds me to him in any way. Nothing I can’t undo. He just helped me with some documents that I needed to show for my residence certificate.

TL;DR: My first boyfriend (38M/22F) lied about his age for over a year. I just found out he’s 38, not 31. I feel betrayed and don’t know if I can trust him again.

ANSWER: He wanted you to move out of country before telling you the truth.

That would terrify any reasonable person.

QUESTION: Bf left after seeing ex's engagement post

Okay so, I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (30M) for a little over two years now. We just moved in together a few months ago. Last night we were doomscrolling on insta reels and his ex's post popped up abt her getting engaged

I don't rly know much about their relationship in detail other than her cheating on my bf with her current fiance while she was engaged to my bf (they were together for 5 yrs and it's been 3.5 yrs since they broke up), so ik that it didn't end well with them and it's just a sour topic so i never rly bring it up. I don’t follow her but she's kind of famous on insta as she is a food vlogger and I watch a lot of that content that's y she popped up.

Anyways when he saw it he like froze and became tense i asked him if everything was ok and he said yeah but i asked if that he looked tense because of the post he just brushed it off and rolled over to go to sleep and then thing is we didn't even rly cuddle when we cuddle like almost every night when going to sleep.

I woke up around 2 a.m. and he was gone. Like, completely gone.  he was nowhere in our house. I called him, like, 10 ,15 times. No answer ,Phone was switched off. I even called one of his friends, and they had no clue where he was. I was thinking of calling his mom but ik she would have blown his phone up so i decided to wait and call my frnd she also suggested to wait a few hours so i did

Then around 3:30 ish  he finally calls me back,i ask him wtf is he doing And he just says I'm fine pls don't call me rn ill explain later and he hangs up b4 i could say anything properly

I tried calling again obviously bcoz what does that even mean like I don't get why he would even be upset about that post seeing they broke up so long ago I can't imagine leaving your gf over this at night. He didn't explicitly say anything abt the reason he went off but I'm pretty sure it's bcoz of the post. I stopped calling him after a few times as hes not going to pick up i rly don't know what to do.

Things have been good with us until now this is the first time i have ever felt like I'm being betrayed by him. I don't even know where he is . Should I leave him alone and give him space I just feel sick abt this situation.

Tldr- bf left in middle of night after finding his ex got engaged and is not responding to me

Update-
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/BBZhLPoYPW

Posting again bcoz previous update post got removed for some reason.

Hey guys,
First of all, thank you to everyone who commented , I didn’t expect so many people to respond, and honestly, reading through your messages kept me from spiraling even more.

I tried to go back to sleep after the post. He did come back around 6 am .he looked like shit cuz ig he hadn't slept. He had just been driving around according to him. I didn't even know what to say to him luckily he was the one who talked first. He apologized a lot of times for running away and for ignoring my calls. I obv asked him wtf happened and why he would ditch me like that and abt his ex. He told me he had a panic attack and he didn't want me to witness it so he went to his car and after that he drove off . He explained that it wasn't bcoz he wasn't over her and that he never wanted her back(i asked him if he was still in love w her). He said it just happened after seeing that pic of them together and happy, he said he depressed after everything went down w his ex but he thought he was fine when he started dating me and that he has been rly happy.

But he panicked bcoz it hit him that she was actually happy and their break up hasn't affected her like it has him seeing she was with the guy she cheated on my bf with and he started overthinking that what if he could never be happy like that when  getting engaged again and getting married to me.

I was honestly a bit shocked at first bcoz we had talked abt how he would love to marry me someday and I didn't rly understand how to comprehend this info but we talked for like 2 hours and he was genuinely sry and he doesn't seem like he's not over her.

He did say he wants to find that kind of happiness with me and he wants that future with me and he apologized again for being an asshole. I made it clear to him if he ever runs off like that we r done and he agreed and honestly we were both kind of crying by the end of our Convo and i also blocked his ex on my insta (he already had her blocked b4 anyone speculates)

I think i could forgive him. Thank you again for all your help the comments helped a lot. We might try therapy.

Tldr- he came back and we talked abt how he had a panick attack thinking if could be as happy as her and we resolved it out.

ANSWER: i dont understand why people are attacking you in these comments. if i had made it to the stage of moving in with someone and one night they left out of nowhere, id be concerned too, no matter what happened the day before. and while yes he probably just needs time to process the engagement, it wouldve been easy to tell you that. he didnt even have to say it in person or on the phone, he could leave and then send a quick text right after to let you know that he just needed some time alone and that he was alright. you're valid to be upset about this

i understand his distress but it's been 3 and a half years. the least he can do is give you the courtesy of telling you he was leaving to be on his own for a bit instead of letting you wake up alone in the middle of the night and leaving you to panic

QUESTION: UPDATE- Married within a year, and now I’m seeing red flags I ignored before — how do I handle this?(27F/33M)

Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/t08KmdcFxt

Update:

27F/33M

I had a conversation with my husband yesterday and gave him an ultimatum. I brought up therapy again, something I’ve suggested in the past, but he said he can’t do it right now because he’s looking for a job and wants to be financially stable first, which I can understand. However, he also said that even after getting a job, he would only consider therapy, then went on a rant about how therapy is useless.

I told him that if he’s not open to therapy, he could at least speak with a pastor or counselor at our church since that is free. He refused again, saying he has too much on his plate. I even suggested having just one conversation and not committing to anything long-term, but he said he’s tired of me bringing it up.

At this point, I’ve decided to leave. I’m currently looking for a job and hoping things fall into place so I can get my own place soon. I feel scared and heartbroken, but I know it’s necessary. I wish I hadn’t ignored the red flags, but I’m choosing to give myself grace. It’s a terrible feeling, but I know I’ll be okay.

Thank you to everyone who commented on my original post. Your words gave me clarity and courage.

TL;DR: He refused therapy or help, so I’ve decided to leave and start over.

ANSWER: It seemed very clear from the post that he didn't actually want to change, someone who recognised their own insecurities and wanted to change would stop making it yours manage and go to therapy, he's done neither. You've made the right choice.

It sounds like neither of you are currently working, I don't know how you sustained that situation but do you have family or friends you can go stay with so you can leave immediately? Even if that involves moving, it's not like you have a job tying you to your current area - which obviously isn't great financially but freeing in terms of leaving and starting afresh.

QUESTION: My (35f) mil (60f) only wants provide childcare for our daughter(3 months f) not our son (3m) and my wife (33f) and I are not on the same page as how to handle this.

Hi everyone,

My mother-in-law initially offered to help with childcare one day a week and seemed enthusiastic. However, after our daughter was born, she made it clear she only wants to care for her. She claims it’s “fair” because she didn’t help with our son when he was a baby and my mother did.

For context, we did offer before our son was born and my mother offered, but when we asked, my mil reacted like a deer in headlights, so we dropped it. We’ve had multiple discussions since, explaining that we don’t agree with her only wanting one child, and she seemed to understand—but a week later, she goes back to only wanting to care for our daughter and pretending we agreed to that.

We’re unsure why this is happening. It might be because we’re a lesbian couple and she only wants to bond with the child she is biologically related to, or maybe she wasn’t ready before but is now. Either way, she has said multiple times that she doesn’t want to take care of our son. She has said this in front of our son.

I feel like the weekly childcare arrangement is off because I don’t trust her to care for both children equally. My wife feels that we haven’t explicitly said she must take both children or none, and that we should give her a chance.

This argument is devolving in my wife saying I'm trying to isolate her from her parents and I'm treating her like she is a bad person. I just want to protect our kids. I don't know what to do anymore. Should I truly offer her another chance?

tl;dr my wife and I heavily disagree how we should handle my mil wanting to play favourites with childcare

ANSWER: Why do I feel like because your wife gave birth to your daughter and you gave birth to your son, your MIL thinks daughter is her grandchild while son is NOT?

Have you ever asked your wife, what would she tell your son when he asks “Why Grammy never let me stay” or “Why Grammy doesn’t like me” or “Why Grammy always prioritize little sister”?

This is something you should clear with your wife first, because she is enabling her mom’s favoritism and her way of not counting your son as family. What if she escalates? What if she tries to exclude your son in family activities? What if resentment builds between your children due to Grammy?

QUESTION: My boyfriend (33M) keeps saying “Have fun on your date” whenever I (32F) leave the house — how do I get him to stop?

Almost every time I leave the house, my boyfriend says something like “Have fun on your date.” Sometimes he’ll even text it to me after I’ve gone.

There’s absolutely no reason for him to think I’d be seeing anyone else. Nothing’s ever happened that would make him suspicious — he just says these things out of nowhere. I find it really disrespectful and gross. I’ve never cheated, never given him a reason to doubt me, and I don’t even have anyone else in my life I could “go on a date” with.

We’ve lived together almost the entire year we’ve been dating. He didn’t used to say things like this, but now he’s constantly making passive-aggressive comments if I’m on my phone, like:

“If you want to talk to someone else, just do it.”
“You don’t have to hide that you’re talking to another guy.”

I’ve told him many times how offensive and damaging these comments are, but he doesn’t care — he seems to truly believe that what he is doing is somehow harmless.   I feel my respect for him slipping every time he does it. I’m honestly at the point where, if we didn’t live together, I’d already have broken up with him. Unfortunately, it is not going to be easy to separate from him at this point or for awhile due to financial reasons.

How should I handle this behavior when he refuses to take it seriously?

Also, how can I articulate the reason why this feels so gross ? I am struggling to find the words.

⸻

TL;DR:
My boyfriend keeps making sarcastic comments like “Have fun on your date” whenever I leave the house, even though I’ve never given him any reason to distrust me. I’ve told him it’s disrespectful, but he doesn’t stop. What should I do?

ANSWER: “If we didn’t live together I’d already have broken up with him”

You answered your own question about what to do next. It just requires the additional step of also moving out.

QUESTION: My mom found out about my private life and says she’ll never forgive me. I don’t know what to do.

I (27F) come from a conservative religious background.  I live abroad now, but recently something happened that completely broke my relationship with my mom (55F).

I gave her my old phone because hers stopped working. Before giving it away, I deleted WhatsApp, thinking all my private conversations were gone. Unfortunately, when she reinstalled it, all my old chats were restored — including some very personal messages and “flirty” conversations.

When she saw them, she was devastated and furious. She said I had brought shame, that I was no longer her daughter, and that she regretted giving birth to me. She blocked me, then unblocked me just to say hurtful things like calling me names. She even told me not to tell my relatives that we don't talk anymore, or she'd show them everything so they'd know the truth about me.

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. She had warned me that if it happened again, she would cut me off — and this time, she did.

I feel destroyed inside. I keep blaming myself, but at the same time, I feel like her reaction is too extreme. I know what I did isn’t acceptable in her eyes, but it hurts to lose my mom like this.
I’m far from home, I feel ashamed and empty, and I don’t know how to move forward.

Has anyone else gone through something like this — especially in a strict religious family? How did you cope with losing your parent emotionally, even if they’re still alive?

EDIT : For context, these messages were related to my active sexual life, so she's hurting for knowing that I'm sexually active.

TL;DR: My mom (55F) found out about parts of my private life that go against our religious background, feels deeply betrayed, and refuses to forgive me. I (27F) love her but don’t know if I should try to contact her again or let her go.

ANSWER: >I keep blaming myself,

The worst choice here is to blame yourself for living your own life.

Your mom is hateful and willing to drop her own daughter because she sent flirty messages. Someone willing to do that is a shameful, awful person.

To move forward, you have to understand exactly this, that your mother is not a good person and that you may be better off without her, even though it hurts now.

QUESTION: My, 40F, husband, 45M,been living with my dad for work. I think he’s cheating.

I, 40F, have been with my husband Brian (fake name), 45M, for almost two decades. We have four kids. A few years ago, we moved from our hometown, a major city, to a smaller, quiet town about three hours away in another state. At the time, we only had our two oldest children, and childcare wasn’t an issue.

Brian was able to find employment fairly quickly when we moved, and I worked from home full-time, which gave me the opportunity to care for our kids, the home, and our marriage. Things were great until I became pregnant with our now third child and developed some health issues.

Because Brian had to call out frequently due to my hospitalizations during the pregnancy, he was eventually forced to resign from his job due to attendance and performance. During delivery, there was an accident and my baby and I almost didn’t survive. The baby was in the NICU for months recovering. She is now a happy and mostly healthy baby. After she came home, Brian worked odd jobs to bring in money, but his primary concern was making sure the kids and I were okay.

A few days before our youngest turned 1, we found out that we were having our fourth and last child. That pregnancy was tough as well, but things went relatively okay until delivery. During the delivery, I was injured by my surgeon, which prevented me from caring for my newborn and our other kids. I was on bed rest for a few months recovering from the C-section and the injury.

Brian waited on me hand and foot and worked reduced hours. We lived off savings and my disability checks from my employer. My father also sent money to help us out. Once I recovered, I returned to work full-time, but Brian wasn’t able to find steady employment. We made things work for a while, but unexpected expenses in the home and with our taxes drove up our costs.

Eventually, Brian found a full-time job back in our home city; great pay, benefits, and room for overtime. My father offered to let him live with him so he wouldn’t have to commute six hours a day or pay any bills while there. Brian was hesitant to leave because I’d still been dealing with health issues since our last child, but I assured him I’d be fine.

At first, things were great. When he moved in with my dad, Brian would call and text frequently; during his breaks, lunches, and in the evenings. We’d video chat for hours while he talked to me and the kids. On Fridays, he’d come home and visit until early Monday mornings. I’d drive him to work with our two youngest kids, then drive back home. Sometimes, the kids and I would go up Friday afternoon to visit him and my dad and drive back Sunday so he wouldn’t be burnt out.

But then the calls started to slow down. I figured he was busy or tired. One night, because we share locations, I checked the app around 10 p.m. and saw he was at a bar. I texted him, asking what was up. He responded around 3 a.m., saying he’d gone out with friends after work. I felt uncomfortable but told myself not to be insecure. I told myself that Brian deserved to unwind after everything he’d done for me and the kids.

The late nights at bars and restaurants continued for a few weeks. The money in our joint account started depleting from his outings to the point where I had to remind him we needed the money for bills. He stopped coming home on weekends, and when I visited, he seemed distant and glued to his phone.

I asked if everything was okay with him and with us. He said it was. I asked about his new friends, but his answers were vague.

One weekend at my dad’s house, Brian was in another room when his phone rang. The name “V” popped up with no picture. I’d never heard that name before. A few minutes later, my dad’s phone rang. I heard him briefly say something to the person on the phone, then tell Brian to “check his phone when he gets a chance.” Brian picked it up, sent a text, looked at me, and set the phone down face-first. I asked who it was. He just said, “A friend.”

My insecurities got the best of me, so I looked through Brian’s Facebook. He doesn’t post much, but suddenly, all his profile pictures had new “likes” from someone who had me blocked. Using my old unused account (under my maiden name), I found that person. It was a woman named Vanessa, 33F.

On her public page, I saw photos of her and Brian at bars, restaurants, and, heartbreakingly, in my father’s living room and building lobby. In every photo, Vanessa was hugged up on Brian or wrapped around his arm. His wedding ring was off. She tagged him in the photos, but the tags didn’t appear on his profile.

I was devastated. Instead of confronting him right away, I packed up the kids and went home. Brian didn’t protest and seemed clueless. My dad asked if I was okay; I said I didn’t feel well and wanted to leave. Brian quietly helped me pack.

I took screenshots of everything. That was three weeks ago.

Since then, I haven’t talked to Brian much. When he calls, I hand the phone to whichever kid is closest, even the one-year-old. I’ve focused on work and the kids, but I keep checking Vanessa’s page and taking more screenshots as she posts more pictures.

Last night, Brian texted asking why I’d been distant. Furious, I sent him all the screenshots. For about ten minutes, I saw the typing bubble appear and disappear. Then he finally replied: “She’s just a coworker.”

I asked him how he’d feel if I were constantly out with a coworker, hugged up in photos. No reply. I asked why he brought this coworker to my father’s house. He said, “Just to introduce them.” I asked why he hadn’t introduced any other coworkers. Silence.

It’s been about nine hours and I haven’t heard from him since. I’m heartbroken. I don’t want to be a divorced single mom, but I refuse to live in with this kind of disrespect.

Advice needed: What should my next steps be?

TL;DR:
My husband (45M) and I (40F) have been together nearly 20 years and have 4 kids. He took a good job back in our hometown and moved in with my dad to avoid a long commute. At first he called and visited often, but then he got distant, started going out drinking, and stopped coming home. I found Facebook photos of him with a younger woman (33F) out at bars, restaurants, and even at my dad’s house, with his wedding ring off. When I confronted him, he said she’s “just a coworker” and hasn’t spoken to me since. I’m heartbroken and unsure what to do next.

ANSWER: Idk what’s worse about this story. Everything he’s doing or the fact that not only did the dad cover for him the whole time, he is also communicating with this woman on behalf of your husband, and right in front of you.  Im sorry, that’s fucked up and I hope you find your way through it. You should not let yourself be treated like that no matter if it makes you a single divorced person.

QUESTION: Found my partner’s old divorce case online — don’t know what to believe now

I (27F) have been seeing a man (35M) for about four months. He’s divorced and has a young daughter. He told me that his marriage ended because of his ex’s accusations and that she was a narcissist.

I just found their divorce case online. It matches what he told me but with details that shocked me: ICU stay, which I knew about, but it mentions seizure from alcohol use, bottles hidden around the house, and his ex claiming he wasn’t safe around their kid.

He told me those things were exaggerated and that the judge ruled in his favor for 50/50 custody, which is true. But now I’m stuck between believing that he’s genuinely recovering and worrying that he still drinks or minimizes it. We smoke weed together sometimes, and he seems totally functional—steady job, great dad, responsible—but I can’t shake the fear that I’m missing something.

I don’t want to judge him unfairly, but I also don’t want to ignore red flags. What’s a fair, healthy way to ask about this without sounding accusatory or controlling?

Tl;dr: found the court case for the guy I'm dating. It mentions that he's an alcoholic to a dangerous level. He's told me that his ex accused him of different things to get full custody, but I'm now concerned.

ANSWER: I say trust your gut. Like, easy as that, trust your gut, girl. Think about it since you’re having to ask reddit.

I once met a guy who seemed okay, but then he got kinda stalkerish and I tried to brush it off because he was very good friends with my friend group. It wasn’t getting better and I looked him up; turns out he was on probation and parole for breaking a girl’s jaw after she broke up with him (and breaking that no contact order). That was shocking, but the biggest shock was that my other friends knew not only how uncomfortable he made me, but they knew about that incident and never told me. Stopped all contact with all of them immediately and called his parole officer.

QUESTION: My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) live together: I found out how he sees the world, now I don’t know if I should stay.

(Re-upload with edits: my previous post was removed for formatting.)

My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been together for two years. I live at his house and don’t pay rent (it’s one of his parents’ properties).

Over the last six months our relationship has been slowly deteriorating. I’ve had multiple conversations with him about how his communication style hurts me and others, and how little effort he puts into understanding me.

A few examples:
1 Once, I mentioned seeing a male friend and he spent the dinner spiraling into topics like calling himself (grandparents immigrated from Italy to Aus) as “ethnic” as my Asian/Middle Eastern best friend, saying “no one should be friends with Germans, we’ve moved on too fast from the Holocaust,” and “old people don’t deserve respect.” It was bizarre and uncomfortable.

2 When we need to solve small domestic issues (like fixing a drain), he often derails the conversation into his own feelings rather than focusing on the task, getting visibly upset at me.

3 When I’m overwhelmed and trying to self-regulate by being quiet or still, he panics and asks what he did wrong, which forces me to comfort him instead of calming myself.

4 I’m autistic, and my tone can be flat. He often misreads it as hostility, especially around practical or “adult” topics.

5 The other night, he made fun of the way I walked and looked, even doing a hurtful impression. I said “that’s not a nice thing to do to your girlfriend,” and he exploded into, “what about thank you for cooking dinner? Why is it never thank you?”

The breaking point came this week when we took our puppy to be de-sexed. I filled out the vet consent form while he watched. Because I’d be at work during the procedure, I made sure the clinic knew to call him first. I signed my own name at the bottom (as the form requires) and added his details below. Later that day, I discovered a private ChatGPT thread where he described the whole event with anger and resentment, accusing me of being controlling and writing my phone number in its required section (above his) to “belittle” him. Reading that was shattering. It showed me how warped his perception of me has become.

That’s been our pattern: I act from practicality or care, he interprets it as attack or disrespect.

I wouldn’t call our relationship abusive. Most days are neutral, some are lovely, and about 10–20% of the time things get really painful. He’s affectionate and loving, and I truly love him and the life we’ve built: our home, our routines, our puppy. But when anything serious happens, he becomes reactive, defensive, or mean, and I end up feeling small and unseen.

Logistically, leaving is hard. I work part-time (four days a week) and study at university. If I rent, I’ll have around $400 a week to live on. That means shared custody of the dog, major financial stress, and losing the most comfortable home I’ve ever had. But staying means continuing to feel unheard and distorted.

My question: How do I decide whether to stay or leave when the relationship isn’t entirely bad but feels fundamentally incompatible? What concrete steps can I take to make the right decision?

TL;DR: My boyfriend believes I am antagonising him when I’m taking care of logistics or myself. He’s great most of the time and I love the life we share beyond these issues, but I’m worried I’ll never see him the same. I’d appreciate advice on how to move forward and protect my peace.

ANSWER: Your boyfriend is mentally unwell OP.  Take the dog and find a place of your own. There are reg flags all over the place with your BF.

QUESTION: Husband recycled a proposal from the previous relationship.

tl;dr husband proposed in the same exact way, word for word, location etc as he did with his previous relationship. How do I get over this?

I '33F' just found out that my husband '35M' of 7 years, proposed to me in the same exact way as he proposed to his ex wife. 
Same day, Xmas eve, same exact location and used the same shpiel. Thankfully he didn't use the same damn ring too.....

It's not a situation where he wasn't over the ex. I truly think it's just pure lack of originality or imagination. 
Idk if I'm being dramatic but I am hurt and sick over this. I've cried non stop. Can't look at him or even talk to him. I gave him the ring back and told him to do it over and make it special. I wanted my own. But honestly, if he does, idk if that would make me feel better. How do I move passed this? 
This isn't something I would leave him over but it is something that has definitely hurt our relationship. 
Any suggestions on how to work through this?

ANSWER: He lacks originality.  I found out my husband took his second wife on a honeymoon on the same vacation that was the only out of the region vacation the two of us ever went to.  While he was having an affair with her, he was introducing him to the same restaurants I had introduced him to in this city, and my favorite restaurant became "their place."  I would not really move past that myself, to be honest with you.  In fact, he's married to his third wife, and they own a hobby shop based on the only hobby I ever had when married to him, a hobby he used to make fun of me doing.

QUESTION: How do I tell my husband I’m uncomfortable with him staying with a female colleague on work trips?

I was going to post this on AITAH but since I’m 95% sure I’m not the asshole, I guess I’m looking for relationship advice instead. Soooo… would I be the asshole if I \[38f\] told my husband \[40m\] I don’t want him to stay with a colleague \[45F, single\] when they travel together for work?

My husband and Colleague are part of a dozen independently contracted people within a professional creative group, which manages projects with clients. Husband and Colleague find their work to be complimentary, so they’re hoping to work on more projects together. Husband and I live in City A, we’re from City B (where both sets of parents live), and City C is where Professional Group and Colleague are based.

Last time Husband was working in City C he stayed on Colleague’s couch. Fine, whatever, not a big deal for a one-off thing. Then he had a job in City B last week that she worked with him on, and they stayed at his parents house together Tues-Saturday. To clarify: City B is my hometown, where my family also lives. I didn’t know about this until he was on the way out the door Tuesday. If he had mentioned it I probably would have said “oh, wouldn’t everyone be more comfortable if she was put up in a hotel?” Granted, budget was a consideration, but my feeling is that if the group, client, or husband can’t afford an assistant on a project, then it can’t be a requisite for the job. And this isn’t a one time scenario, he plans to keep working with her, so this will definitely come up again in some iteration.

Relationship background: Husband and I have been together for 4 years, married for 6 months. We were actually together for a while 15 years ago but our paths diverged. In a crazy full circle way we were brought back together and I’m happier than I’ve ever been in a partnership. Our relationship is based on mutual respect and admiration, and he is extremely loyal when it comes to friends, family, and me. I want to make it clear that I trust him 100%. This isn’t about infidelity, it’s about boundaries and respect and how he shows that he cares about my feelings.

All week I’ve been dealing with icks and ughs about this. It’s been occupying a huge portion of my thoughts. I was by myself while they were working together every day, sharing meals, presumably hanging out until bedtime? And then of course there are my irrational, neurotic thoughts like “did he make coffee for her every morning? Did she use my MIL’s shampoo? Does he think she’s cooler than me? Is he going to run off to City C because it’s way more rewarding than our life together??” I hate that I’m this insecure and jealous and prone to ruminating on this stuff. Yes, I have a therapist, yes, we talk about this sort of thing.  It might be different if I had met Colleague or knew ANY details about her at all. All I know about her is that they have a lot in common and she’s apparently comfortable with this level of familiarity with a married colleague.

I’m already prepared for how it will go if I bring this up. His reaction at best is going to be invalidating my feelings in the guise of reassurance (“you’re being silly! That’s ridiculous, what are you worried about?”) or defensive (“why are you admonishing me when I’ve done nothing wrong?”) He bristles when it comes to personal critique, which makes it hard to express my feelings sometimes. He’s not one to conform to the conventions of society, so me saying “this is objectively inappropriate” or “this simply isn’t done” would not be useful arguments. He usually means well, but can be really blind to how his actions affect me. I’m really hoping that me saying I’m uncomfortable is enough for him to agree to the very reasonable request of getting Colleague a damn hotel room next time.

Ok, so here’s a part I was on the fence about adding in, because all of the above is enough for being upset, but it’s important in the context of my emotional needs not being prioritized (and it definitely adds to my sensitive emotional state). My mom died 3 months ago, so I drove up to City B on Friday to prep for my mom’s Sunday memorial celebration. I thought Husband was going to join me at my parent’s house across town Friday night, but I guess there was a miscommunication and he had to do a bit more work on this project Saturday. We talked about this on the phone Thursday and he told me he was probably going to stay with his parents Saturday night too, so Colleague wouldn’t be uncomfortable at the house without him there. I basically told him no, I needed him with me. I honestly can’t even believe he entertained the idea of prioritizing her comfort over my need for his support during a huge emotional life event. A few days before the memorial.

I love this person. I trust him, but I’m frustrated and sad. Why is he such a dummy when it comes to all this shit?? The big work job is done, and we got through the memorial. Now I guess I’m looking for some communication advice, some validation, and maybe personal experience. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this.

tl;dr: Husband is overfamiliar with a female colleague. He doesn’t think it’s a problem, but the real issue is that he's oblivious to how this makes me feel. I’m not sure how to raise it without him getting defensive.

ANSWER: Okay so this

> Our relationship is based on mutual respect and admiration, and he is extremely loyal when it comes to friends, family, and me. I want to make it clear that I trust him 100%. This isn’t about infidelity, it’s about boundaries and respect and how he shows that he cares about my feelings.

Does not jive with this

I’m already prepared for how it will go if I bring this up. His reaction at best is going to be invalidating my feelings in the guise of reassurance (“you’re being silly! That’s ridiculous, what are you worried about?”) or defensive (“why are you admonishing me when I’ve done nothing wrong?”)

There’s some cognitive dissonance going on here and tbh I think this perfect marriage full of admiration and respect is a story you’re telling yourself. Because I’m not seeing much respect coming from his side. And I think you’re being naive to say there’s definitely no infidelity going on. He’s having this woman stay at his parents’ house, that’s so far beyond the boundaries of a work relationship it borders on hilarity.

And now he’s trying to abandon you in your time of need to make her more comfortable? At best this is an emotional affair. At worst it’s already turned physical.

QUESTION: My bf (M23) stood me (F22) up on Halloween and doesn’t know why

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years, and he’s always been amazing, but on Halloween, he stood me up and can't explain why. I want to forgive him, but I am still so upset.

We both had different events to go to first, but we agreed that we’d meet up later at a club, which is something we had discussed all week. I knew he was with friends, so I told him he could invite them, but that regardless of what his friends where doing we were going to go out. I texted around 9 PM that I was ready, and he replied saying he was picking up his friends and would meet me at the club. I told him it was a 20-minute walk for me, so he should let me know when he was heading out.

I didn’t hear back from him until 11:40 PM when he texted saying he was finally on his way. By then, I would’ve gotten there around midnight, and I wasn’t comfortable walking through downtown that late. Plus, he and his friends ended up not even going in because the lines were too long. So, basically, I spent hours doing intricate makeup and dressing up all so that I could be stood up by my own bf.

What made it even worse was that the next day was Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead/ celebrate the dead), which was really important to me as I’m Latina, and I just lost my grandpa. My boyfriend was supposed to help me set up my grandpa’s shrine and make food, but he completely forgot.

He came over with gifts to apologize, but his only explanation was, “I’m sorry, I don’t know what happened.” When I asked if he thought it was okay for a woman to walk alone downtown that late, he lied and said he would’ve gotten me an Uber, but nowhere in his messages did he mention that. He also tried to play it off as “miscommunication,” when it was really just a lack of communication on his part. I told him I needed space and sent him home.

Later, when he apologized again, he kept saying that thinking about what he did makes him upset and sick. Normally I appreciate when he expresses his feelings, but I told him that in this case, I truly didn’t care how he felt because I was the one who was wronged and upset. I don’t know if that was too harsh, but I genuinely don’t understand how him being nauseous was supposed to help me feel any better.

The next day, after some pushing, he said he’s been emotionally checked out because of how stressful his doctorate program has been and that he forgets things easily when they’re not “in front of him.” I don’t really know what to make of that.

He’s always been supportive and kind before this, especially when my grandpa passed. I don’t think he’s cheating, which I know is always possible, but cheating is one of his biggest fears, so I doubt this is the case. This whole situation isn’t typical for him, but his explanation feels weak, and I’m not sure how to move forward. I want to forgive him, but I also feel really hurt and disappointed.

How would you handle something like this? Should I try to talk to him again, or just give him more space?

ANSWER: He was out enjoying himself with his friends and totally ‘forgot’ he was supposed to be meeting up with you. He doesn’t want to admit that, so his ‘I don’t know what happened’ isn’t true, and is flimsy at best. And the fact he thought it would be okay for you to walk to a club at that time is absolutely ridiculous plus, and I’m just guessing, he was too hungover to help you the following day when you really needed his support. All in all, he hasn’t exactly covered himself in boyfriend glory, has he? Updateme!

QUESTION: I want to divorce my husband. But he wants another chance. Am I being heartless?

Hi reddit. Like the title says, I (f31) want to divorce my husband (m32), but i'm afraid I may be acting too quickly? For context, we've been together for 12 years, married for 3. He's always had a strong temper and frankly, my parents never fully approved of our relationship because of it. I'm the complete opposite, shy, eternally optomistic, a little too nice (husband says I'm a pushover). Anyway, while we dated he would often be rude to me but his excuse was that he was stressed out from college or he was tired, or he had something else going on. And I believed him.

Fast forward to our first year of marriage, and I found out the hard way that it wasn't college or any of that. It was just his actual personality. He hates talking about, well, anything. We never talk about money which is outrageous to me because we're married, I can't talk to him about family drama because it annoys him, can't talk about my feelings because he'll get mad, insult me and walk away. He's not only rude to me now but to my parents too. Despite the fact that they've given us a house, a piece of land, helped us get out of a debt, etc. And I could not be more embarassed.

Mostly, I feel stupid. My parents warned me again and again. My dad especially, because he noticed early on how different we were. But my husband always said opposites attract (sounds kind of stupid now). And he wasn't as mean then as he is now, in fact, he got along great with my parents back then. He even got them gifts and things. Now, he's moody all the time but even moreso when we go over to their house. He won't even engage in conversation, all he does is look down at him phone the entire time. It honestly feels like he doesn't care about being part of the family. Whenever someone tries to give him adive, he doesn't take it well, like he's smarter than everyone else and there's nothing you can say to him that he doesn't already know. The few times we do talk, we end up arguing because everything I say is always wrong and "i don't know what I'm talking about" or "I'm ignorant". Mind you, we both have college degrees. All in all, I'm just so disapointed and embarrased by the kind of person he is. Btw, he's not like that around his friends.

I brought up the possibility of getting a divorce during an argument and he's been nicer to me ever since. But I've seen this side of him before. He's promised to change in the past and has said that he can't live without me. This is the only time I've truly seen him so remorseful though.

TD;LR: Am I being too rash in suggesting to my husband that we divorce because of how he treats me? Should I give him another chance?

ANSWER: No, you're not being too rash to divorce someone who is not nice to you or your family and has never been, who insults you and who you can't communicate with. In fact, I have no idea why you've stayed with him this long.

QUESTION: How can I (21M) make my Chinese dad (61M) get a life?

The title might sound a bit harsh, but I honestly don’t know how else to phrase it.

There’s a lot to unpack here, but here I go (TL;DR at the bottom):

My dad is a Chinese immigrant who moved to California in the early 2000s. To this day, he hasn’t learned much English, which has really limited his ability to explore new things — even simple stuff like trying non-Chinese restaurants. Over time, that’s made him more closed off and unwilling to try anything new.

He’s naturally introverted, and with his difficult personality and years of working tirelessly since coming here, he’s struggled to make friends. As a result, he doesn’t have many hobbies or much of a social life.

Now that he finally has more free time, I’ve been trying to get him to enjoy life a bit more — to go out, meet people, or pick up a hobby. But whenever I suggest something, he just says things like “There’s nothing to do here in America” or “Nothing interests me.” I know those are excuses — I think it’s hard for him because he can’t read or speak English, so everything outside his comfort zone feels impossible. Still, it’s tough watching him just… fade into routine.

I’d love to know if anyone has gone through something similar or has advice on how to help a parent like this.

Some background that might be helpful:  
My dad doesn’t have the best relationship with our family (my mom, sister, and me). He wasn’t really a great husband or father figure when I was growing up. He and my mom fought a lot, mostly because he’d spend so much time at the casino playing poker — which he insists “isn’t gambling” because it “takes skill” and “helps him relieve stress.” But back then, we were struggling financially, living in affordable housing, so it only made things worse.

He also had a lot of anger issues and poor communication skills. He couldn’t empathize or see things from my mom’s point of view, which led to constant fighting. My sister ended up developing lasting trauma from it, and I’ve always had a hard time talking to him too.

That said, something changed earlier this year. We visited some old family friends — people who somehow have stuck by him despite knowing his flaws — and they had yet another intervention with him. This time, it seemed to click. Around the same time, I broke down in front of him and told him how all of this affected me. I think that really got through to him, because since then, he’s been trying to change, little by little.

Honestly, I’m still conflicted. Writing this all out makes me realize how complicated it is. My dad isn’t the best person, but he’s still my dad — and I know he did what he could with what he had. I just want to help him find a way to live more meaningfully instead of wasting away.

TL;DR:  
My dad isn’t perfect, but he’s still my dad. He doesn’t have many friends or hobbies, and I want to help him find some so he can live a fuller, happier life. Any advice or similar experiences would really mean a lot.

ANSWER: Your best bet is probably to find out where other senior Chinese guys hang out and take him there. He'll be able to communicate and feel a lot more comfortable. Maybe he'll make friends.

QUESTION: M55 How direct can you be to ask relatives to invite you for the holidays?

I (M55) am suddenly without immediate family: no spouse, no kids and nobody at home with me.

I am dreading the holidays.

I have (1) an aunt, uncle and cousins in one city a few hours away and (2) a brother and his family in another city a few hours away.

I’ve usually just waited for invitations and if they didn’t come, I’d spend holidays with immediate family at my home, but immediate family is now gone.

My sister-in-law has said “we’ve got to get you to come out sometime” and I said, “sure!”, but I don’t know if that was just a general statement or if it was supposed to be an invitation.  My aunt said, “we need to stay in touch” but it would be kind of weird to invite myself to their house.

How do I get an invitation for Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas dinner?

That’s all I need; I can stay in a hotel.

TL;DR: how direct can you be in asking family members for an invitation for the holidays if you’re all alone?

ANSWER: My brother reached out for a thanksgiving one year, he hadn’t been to family events in years. He just said “hey sis, I really wanted to spend the holiday with family, do you have anything going on that I could come to?” damn near broke my fucking heart that I didn’t make it clear enough to him that he’s ALWAYS invited, I didn’t ever think I needed to invite him to these things.

I’m really glad he asked, because now I always invite him.

QUESTION: My (23F) BF (23M) said he’d consider breaking up with me if I changed my appearance and now I can’t look at him the same.

TL;DR:
My BF hates all forms of body modification and has made it clear he doesn’t like when I change my appearance. When I mentioned tattooing over a fading mole, he sternly told me not to “Do that to my face.” When I asked if he’d break up with me over something a bodily change I made he didn’t like, he said yes. He apologized afterward, but I can’t shake how disrespected I feel or how hard it is to be affectionate again.

I (23F) have been dating my BF (23M) “Andre” for a little over 2 years. It’s both our first relationship. Andre has always hated any kind of bodily change: tattoos, piercings, dye, even getting a hand stamp at the bar. He scrubs it off the second we get home.

I’m the opposite. I love tattoos (I have 3), I’ve dyed my hair ginger (naturally blonde), and I have a few piercings. Since we started dating, though, I’ve only added one ear piercing and changed my hair tint slightly. Whenever I bring up wanting something new (like tattoos or piercings), he gets visibly uncomfortable. His voice goes high, eyebrows raise, and he starts asking, “How much of a change are you thinking?”

His facial expressions alone have always felt like a subtle threat to our relationship. if I go too far, he’ll stop being attracted to me or even consider leaving. That’s honestly a big part of why I’ve stopped changing my appearance at all.

Earlier this week, I mentioned that a small mole on my nose is starting to lose pigment, and I brought up maybe tattooing over it with brown ink kind of like a freckle tattoo or microblading. His response was instant and firm: “Do not do that to your face.”
That hit me hard. He didn’t even ask why I wanted to do it or how I felt about it just completely shut it down and told me what to do.

Later that night, I texted him and asked, “If I did something to my appearance that you didn’t like, would you break up with me?”
His reply: “Yes, I could see it playing a factor.”
My stomach dropped. I called two of my friends to make sure I wasn’t losing my mind and they both said that was insane. I ignored him for a bit, and when he called back, I ended up yelling at him for almost an hour (which is unlike me). That’s when it seemed to finally hit him how serious this was. He started crying, apologized, and admitted he was being inconsiderate and disrespectful. The next night, he told me he realized how entitled it was to act like he has any say over my body, and that he needs to work on his reactions. He said he understands I’m my own person and that my choices have nothing to do with him.
I told him straight up that he needs to always speak to me like an equal, and that just because he gets to see my body doesn’t mean he gets to control it. I made it very clear if he ever does this again, I’m gone.

I also told him I’m not applying to jobs in his area anymore. Someone who would consider breaking up with me over a freckle doesn’t deserve me moving states for them.
We’re still together, but now I feel… icked out. I don’t want to be affectionate or sweet toward him. even though he’s apologized and seems to be reflecting. I feel like he doesn’t deserve that from me right now, but I also feel mean with giving him nothing to work with.

How do I forgive him? Will that natural affection come back with time? Is it harder because we live far apart? I get forgive but don’t forget, but how?

ANSWER: Relationship aside, please be careful about tattooing over your mole. You want to be able to monitor moles for changes and tattooing over it could get in the way of that.

QUESTION: How do I (26F) break up with my fiancé (28M) of 7 yrs without destroying him? The timing feels cruel.

See my last post about why…

TL;DR:
I love my fiancé but know the relationship needs to end. He lives with me in my family’s home, is struggling in school, and has a birthday/holidays coming up. Ending things now feels cruel, but pretending until the end of the year also feels wrong. How do I break up in a way that causes the least damage?

I (late 20s F) am at the point where I know I need to end things with my fiancé (late 20s M). I love him, but after reading the feedback on my last post and really sitting with the things I didn’t want to admit, I know I can’t continue this relationship.

The problem is… the timing feels awful.

He currently lives with me in my old family home. It’s not technically either of our places—my parents don’t live here, but two of my adult sisters do. Asking him to leave feels like kicking him out to nowhere, even though he does have family he could go to. I just know it’ll shake his sense of stability.

He’s also really struggling in school. I don’t want to pile this on while he’s barely hanging on academically. College is rough, I’ve been there and completely understand. I’ve told him multiple times that I’m unhappy, but I know this will still blindside him.

Part of me wants to end things now because living like this—acting like I’m not completely torn—feels emotionally draining and dishonest. But the other part of me wants to wait until the semester is over… except then it’s his birthday in mid-December, and then Christmas. It feels cruel no matter what.

I’m torn between doing what’s healthiest for me vs. trying to protect him from more stress.
Do I need to end it now, or should I let him have the end of the year without adding this pain?
Any advice on how to do this in the least damaging way is appreciated. Honestly I’m not sure if I’m mentally prepared for it now - please give me your honest advice I’ve never had to break up like this before

ANSWER: The only reason to delay ANYTHING about this would be to give him a chance to get his bearings and find a better living situation.

Which would sorta mean breaking up with him and then giving him a week or two or more to sort of figure out his next living situation.

There's no point in delaying through Christmas just to wait until the ball drops on New Year to shout "Surprise, we're breaking up! Pack your shit!"

Also... you need to brace yourself for being the "bad guy" here. There is only so much you can do here to soften this landing. You are about to wreck this dude's whooole existence. The odds of getting a handshake and a thanks for the memories card is... low.

QUESTION: My gf (F23) is trying to move in with me (M31) way too soon

I (M31) started dating his new person (F23) back in July. Things were going great and we decided to make our relationship official after a vacation a few weeks ago.

The problem happened as soon as we got back from vacation. She lives with her mom and apparently when she got back home, she got into this big fight with her mom's bum ass boyfriend. Now she refuses to go back home until homeboy moves out. I'm trying to be a good boyfriend and let her stay with me for a while, but "a while" is starting to feel permanent. Her mom's boyfriend doesnt even have a job and theres no sign of him moving out any time soon. It doesn't help that my apartment is tiny and I hate not having space to myself.

A couple days ago she asked me if we could get a place together when my lease ends in February, and since she's already living with me, that would mean she permanently moved in 2 days after becoming my girlfriend. Thats way too fast for me and tbh it feels like shes taking advantage of my kindness and resources. I genuinely don't know what to do because I don't want to kick her out with no place to go but I also don't feel comfortable with her moving in on such short notice. How can we resolve this problem?

TL;DR girlfriend of 2 days is trying to live in my tiny apartment now

ANSWER: Well, first of all, if you date a woman eight years younger than you she’s gonna be in a different place in life and have different expectations. That should be a no-brainer. You want a grownup, date a grownup.

That said, you’re going to have to have a conversation with her and however you put it, she will feel rejected and upset. Just be prepared to remain calm and kind. Explain that you’re not ready to live with someone. That you need her to have a plan for her living arrangements that isn’t just live with you.

QUESTION: Update: How do I (27 M) get my gf (24 F) to understand that I can’t do it all on my own. Is this the end?

My last post on this [(can be found here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ok0qa9/how_do_i_27_m_get_my_gf_24_f_to_understand_that_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) got a lot of responses so I wanted to give a recent update.

A couple days after that post, on November 1st my family had a Halloween party. We attended as we have been staying with my parents. It was fun, it was going good. I allowed myself to just relax, had a few drinks which I don’t often. I “let loose”. This all came crumbling down though when my gf made a comment/joke about getting married. She asked “Do you want to marry me?” I said “Yes!” She asked “so when are we getting married?” I said “When we get married!” she responded “So you don’t want to marry me” I responded “That’s not what I’m saying” and then it got quiet. Now mind you, this was a few hours into the party, after we had a good bit to drink. So it wasn’t really the time or place to have a serious conversation about our future marriage.

Later we are in our room, to escape the party for a bit. She says sorry. I tell her thank you. She says something about how it was just joke. I tell her that the joke isn’t really funny given we’ve had all of these conversations regarding issues we’ve been having, how before we even really think about getting married I’d like for us to be out of my parents house again. She says she wishes joking about marriage wasn’t a stressor. I said that it isn’t just about the marriage, it’s about the accusation that I don’t want to. When I’ve been trying so hard to get us to a point where we have our own place, where I can afford a ring, where we have finances to plan a wedding. And know we are having a good foundation for our shared future. And the fact I reassure her nearly every week. I do so many things to show her I love her, care about her, and want a future. So when she says things like that, I feel unheard in how much I am struggle to carry all of this by myself.

The rest of the convo is a bit of a blur (alcohol and it being late doesn’t help), but it turns into a fight. It went on for about 2 hours. Which really sucks, because I’ve said time and time again I’m really uncomfortable having these conversations while we’ve had drinks and when it’s late. But nonetheless there we are.

I tell her that I don’t want to get married until I feel like I can depend on her. She says that I can, that she listens to me when I talk about work. I tell her that I mean like seriously depend on her, like what if I lose my job? What if I get deathly ill? I want to feel like we aren’t totally fucked, because she will be able to be there for us. I tell her about how we were supposed to have a check-in mid-October, to discuss her progress on things we had talked about fixing in July to keep the relationship going. That we never had that check-in, and it is past that but she hasn’t done these things. I told her I was glad that our conflicts had become less, but that these things were still not being met. She immediately got defensive and said “so how long were you going to wait to talk to me about this if I didn’t joke about marriage?” I said “not long at all, I was getting my thoughts together, and deciding when we should sit down and talk. October just ended.” She ends up telling me about how she has looked into a program at our old university and how she has had two phone calls with them that led nowhere. I was aware of one of these. I asked if she had ordered her transcript and applied to FAFSA like we talked about. She said no. She said it’s all confusing and she doesn’t know what to do. That it’s “hard.” I tell her “You can ask for help when you starting do it and I’ll help. you know when I was looking at going for my masters recently, I applied to both FAFSA and got my transcript in one day. It isn’t hard too hard.” she then brings up us having different capacities.

It some how derails and we are talking about the past. It’s hard to remember all that was said or how we got there. But I do remember telling her how it’s hard to trust her, because she hasn’t done these things, and because right before her psychosis this year, she admitted to me, that early in our relationship she had been posting nudes on a secret Snapchat to try and sell them, browsed Tinder, and apparently had her coworkers thinking I was abusive, that we were in an open relationship, etc. She justified the nudes by saying she was trying to make us money (which we didn't need to do, as I had a teaching job at this time. Also I don't have an issue with some posting nudes online, it's that we had talked about it early on, as she used to do it, and I told her I just didn't want the one's she sent me to be the same one's she posted, because I wanted to feel special, and then SHE decided she didn't want to do it anymore), and that she only did it like once a month, and didn’t do it for that long. And also that it never came up. As if I was supposed to know and ask?? She didn’t respond to the Tinder thing. She also said she didn’t know why her coworkers thought that of me, that she always told them how great I was. She said she speculates it’s because they thought it was odd she had a job and needed to work while I had a teaching job. I told her that, the point is she kept that all from me, while I took my first “grown up job” to try and start building our future, and she was doing all of that, and kept it from me for years. She said she was super supportive of me during that time.

We end up back to the original topic of what we had agreed she would do. I said something about how she has had 3 and a half months to make real progress and figure these things out, and she has done less than what I managed to do in a single morning. She got upset and she said very angrily “so what you want me to get my transcript, apply for FAFSA, and start applying??” I said “well yeah, that’s what we agreed to. It was either that or find another job.” She was upset that I didn’t see her having a phone call with a university about a program as enough. She said she needed me to see that as a good step. I said it was a good step, but it isn’t what we agreed to by this point. She was upset and said something about “so the conflict being less isn’t good? Because I haven’t done this?” I said “No I’ve said the conflict being less is good, it’s just that this was an important part of what we agreed to.” I had said several times in the conversation I was happy about that. I also around this point reminded her what I said last time we had these talks, which is that if she didn't want to go back to school or get a better job, that it was fine, we would just be wanting different things in life, and I wouldn't hate her for that, I would still love her, we would just not be compatible which happens sometimes. She stated multiple times this is what she wants, this is what she wants to do.

Honestly, this whole thing for me is in fragments. I remember points at which she kept trying to change why we almost broke up in the past. She tried to say she is worried to talk to me because I’ll just “break up” with her. And I had to tell her the reason we have almost broke up, was the first time, it was because I told her I got tremors and heart rate spikes when I felt like we were going to have conflict and she belittled me for it. The second time it was because she continuously ran over my boundaries, and had a whole meltdown that started from her tripping and falling when hanging out with family and being embarrassed. Which then went from me supporting her for being embarrassed and trying to make her feel better, to somehow being accusations that I didn’t love her, and she spiraled for like 4 hours, until nearly 5 AM, threatened to not go to my nephews birthday party with me the next day because I told her I think it’d be best if we continued talking about it in the morning, since we were both tired and have had a few drinks. Which she refused to do, and she blew up my phone and criticized my therapy for “changing me.” These weren’t light hearted moments for me, these weren’t just any conversation leading me to think it may be best for us to part ways. This is the second time she has tried to reframe these scenarios as me casually wanting to leave. Instead of what they truly were, which was her pushing me as far as I could go. She also said it’s my fault she has the job she has. That I “made her take it.” Because I’m the one who found it, and told her to apply to there, to get out of the other job that was making her absolutely miserable. Like that job made her seriously depressed. And that we had agreed it was something she could do while she figured something more long term out. But I never made her take it, I suggested it because the other job made me very worried for her and her mental health.

I had 5 heart rate notifications from my Apple Watch from the stress of this conversation. By the end things had settled, she apologized for not doing more, and asked me to promise I wouldn’t break up with her the next day, the next week, and this year. The party was over and everyone had gone to bed, so I missed out on seeing my aunts for longer as they left before we even woke up the next day.

Since then, I’ve just been feeling very confused. I feel sad, angry, confused, and kind of numb. I feel like I don’t remember everything, so if it seems like it doesn’t make sense, I’m sorry.

I just don’t really know what to think. Part of me really feels like this is the end. I just felt like all of our issues are not being dealt with, and that every issue we’ve had, I have to fight against her rewriting what happened. It’s just so confusing. I love her, I really do, so my heart hurts, but I just feel like things shouldn't be this hard. She's been extremely kind since this conversation, and she submitted to get her transcript. But yeah I just don't know. I am really just exhausted of things being like this, and I really wish we didn't have to have an argument for something to happen.

TLDR: Update from my last post. We had a chat, under not good circumstances. I feel very confused and lost. I think maybe it’s just time to throw in the towel. Is this something that can be fixed? Am I being reasonable?

ANSWER: Hon, she is never going to grow while you’re taking care of (frankly enabling) her. She needs to be on her own to figure shit out, and you deserve better than this. Break up, make it a CLEAN break, no contact, and recover. Once you are outside of the situation, you’re gonna realize how unhealthy it is.

QUESTION: My (30F) boyfriend (28M) doesnt have a job and just got kicked out. Im concerned about him staying at mine. What should I do?

Hey humans, I need perspective. Help a friend out. I (30F) have been dating a guy (28M) for two years.

At the beginning of our relationship I was struck by the depth of our conversations, his (verbal) support of my painting, and how he turned his life around (gave up drugs and alcohol 3 years ago). He took practical steps to show up for me—changed the litter box for my cats, took the recycling out, took my car to get the tires rotated. In the past I dated guys who talked a big game, but never did anything, so I felt so hopeful.

(For extra context, both of my parents are mentally ill drug addicts so there’s lots of pain there and kinda… hope for care? Which I know I need therapy for).

Anyway, while we’ve been together I squared away my first year of a social work masters program and it was the hardest thing Ive ever done. In the meantime, he lost his job 8 months ago and has been playing music on the weekends to scrape by. I told him the high risk of that (lack of savings, etc) was making me nervous. He also really wasnt scraping by bc he didnt have enough money for food… so I started paying. Now I buy almost all of our groceries, and Ive been pleading with him to get a more secure job in addition to music… just a bookstore or something 2 days a week! (or something).

Anyway he wont. He is working really hard to make enough money with music, but he wont get another job. And yesterday he got asked to leave his living situation so… He needs somewhere to land. He’s not from this town, so there aren’t a ton of options. I want to be a good partner and show up, but my nervous system is terrified.

More context: He was asked to leave bc his landlord wanted to move his daughter & her fam into the property. He never missed a rent payment.

He did say he may have found something for work this week, and with losing his housing maybe he’ll be more open to change?

When I question him about the situation I feel like our conversation always ends up with my “trauma.” ie: clearly Im having a big reaction bc I have trauma and it’s not fair to him bc Im not seeing all he does for me.

On top of all of it the uncertainty and anxiety makes me heartbroken bc Im yearning for a “forever home” with someone.

Extra context: before he was asked to leave his place, he was spending most nights at mine anyways. But, it feels different if he were to not have a place of his own.

My question is: If I were a friend, what would you advise me to do? Is it amoral to tell him he cant stay with me? (or maybe to stay with not just me? me part time and his moms part time?) If he does stay here, is there anything I can do to stay sane? (make a chore chart, or something? and have a timeline?). If Im telling him he cant move in… what should I tell him yo do? Im open to the thoughts

TL;DR My (30F) boyfriend (28M) doesnt have a job and just got kicked out. Im concerned about him staying at mine. What should I do?

ANSWER: I think that your gut is telling you something and you should take some time to listen to it. It's not a moral to see that someone isn't willing to really put in the work and effort to build a life and be a partner and want to keep some distance and safety. The fact that you are expressing these concerns and he's chalking them up to "trauma" is really manipulative

QUESTION: How can I help my husband understand that appreciation in marriage should go both ways?

I (29F) and my husband (29M) have been together for 10 years and married for 1. Lately, we’ve been arguing about household responsibilities — but for me, it’s less about chores and more about feeling appreciated.

He often tells me that I should be grateful he helps around the house because he’s the “breadwinner.” I do appreciate everything he does, but I also work full time — 10 to 12 hour shifts, 5 days a week, as a pet groomer. I handle most of the cooking, cleaning, dishes, and general organizing at home. He handles laundry more often, manages the yard and finances, and does most of the grocery shopping.

The grocery part has mostly fallen to him because we’ve been sharing one car. We moved from Philadelphia about two years ago, and until recently, I didn’t have my driver’s license (I used to be really anxious about driving). I finally got my license last week and am now looking for my own car, which will let me help more with errands and take some things off his plate.

Still, when I try to explain that while I’m thankful for what he does, I also deserve gratitude for working and keeping up with the home, it turns into an argument. He takes it as me being ungrateful or trying to “one-up” him, which isn’t what I mean at all. I just want mutual appreciation — not a scoreboard.

How can I bring this up in a way that helps him see that appreciation should go both ways, without it turning into another fight?

TL;DR:
29F married to 29M for 1 year (together 10). My husband says I should be grateful that he helps around the house since he’s the main earner, but I also work full time and handle most housework. I just want him to understand that gratitude should go both ways — how can I communicate that without starting another argument?

ANSWER: You're explaining your reasoning extremely clearly here, and it's a totally reasonable ask - so if he's not "getting" it, it's likely because he doesn't want to. There are a few reasons why that may be, unfortunately none of them are great.

QUESTION: My (21F) partner (21M) just came out as transgender, and I feel confused.

Me (21F) and my partner (21M) have been dating for three years, right before we graduated high school, when she identified as a male. Yesterday, she called me for a serious talk, and told me that she was transgender.

Of course, I want to be by her side and help her with her transition. However, I don’t know what to do, as I see myself only being attracted to men. I don’t want to hurt her because of my sexuality.

I am still so in love with her, and I don’t want to end our relationship, but I see myself as straight. As of now, I can’t see a future with a woman. I don’t know what to do, and I need advice. Should I stay? Should I break up with her? What do I do? The last thing I want to do is hurt her.

TL;DR - My partner just came out as transgender, and I don’t know if I should stay or leave the relationship, as I identify as straight, even though I’m still in love with her.

ANSWER: check out r/mypartneristrans

if you’re not attracted to women, it’s okay to break up - you can support her without being in a romantic relationship

QUESTION: My husband (37M) blames me (35F) for our child being on the autism spectrum

In the pre diagnosis phase he started to shut me out and drink more. She is now officially diagnosed and is a beautiful and happy 3 year old who lives life in her own way. She is minimally verbal and requires a lot of extra support (we are level 2 for those familiar with the level stuffs).

I tried to bring this up. He rejects the notion but isn’t himself. He was my rock and best friend. But I went through a period of time that I couldn’t trust him to take care of her. He let her elope multiple times while I was at work and had to have a home visit from CPS.

I think he is drinking too much and putting us in financial trouble with his drinking and reckless spending. I don’t think divorce is something I want but don’t know how to fix this. How do we move through this? Please do not just say therapy because I have tried.

TL;DR!

We have been friends/ dated since high school. He is a reliable and good person. When I unexpectedly got pregnant with our son (now 8 years old) it was the logical thing to get married and build a life together but now all of that is in jeopardy.

ANSWER: I think the better question is it safe for your child to be in the current environment rather than do you want a divorce. If he is an unsafe person, then you have your answer.

QUESTION: We were ALMOST perfect for six years, bought a house together... then everything fell apart. (Me 25M.. Her 25F)

So me and her been together for 6 years! Everything was great! Even perfect! In my head she was the woman I was going to live my whole life with. We just bought a house and it’s been 2 months we have it. I recently had a harder past 2 months. All my friends were moving some place far so I felt a certain way like I was losing them. So I was a bit more distant, in a mini depression, wanted to do nothing all the time and was always refusing her (let’s say for small activities like walks, etc). I was in my head a lot and was more distant from her and did not really talk about it to her. So she was a bit disconnecting from me.

She, 1 month ago, started to game with a work colleague that she discovered liked playing WOW. They started playing every night and me, not naturally jealous, started to feel things were strange… like she was just watching movies with him online and you know doing stuff she normally would never do.

At a certain point, 2 weeks ago, I asked her if everything was great between us and she then said that she was loving me less. I asked her, shocked and a bit hurt, if she is in love maybe with him or maybe she’s having some feelings for him and she then said yes. My heart shattered… my heart EXPLODED…

We then came to the conclusion where she would stop contacting him. She told him and they stopped talking. The day after she came home and I saw that she was distant. I asked her if she was doubting us and if she still wanted to try working on stuff. She said no, so then we broke up. She moved to her parents’ place...

A week after that she decided that she loved me and wanted to work on us. She came back, I left her as much space as she needed. The first night she spent it on the couch and then the second night she gave me a hug and touched my arm a bit, nothing too serious, and then slept in the same bed with me asking me for a kiss before going to sleep.

The third night I unloaded my bag so I let her know that I feel the guilt, like I fucked up everything by being closed off and being stupid to leave her and not being as much present as I used to be. She after this came in my chest and cuddled me “sensually” and kissed me deeply.

The day after, she came back from work and I saw in her that she was different, a bit weird, bizarre, like she was hiding something. I then asked her if she had something she would like to tell me. She then sat down and told me that she’s not loving me anymore and that she has difficulty trying to work on our relationship and seeing me giving my 2000% for her and she could not give that much to me. She also told me that the whole week she was giving me love not because she wanted to but because she knew I wanted it.

We then had a big conversation, a rough one, and concluded that it’s maybe too early to take the big decision to completely cut off the bridges. The night after I exploded, my heart is destroyed, I don’t know what to think or do anymore, so I go for a car ride alone. She then started texting me a lot. She started asking me where I am and if I want to watch a movie with her. I said yes. We watched the movie, she asked for my hand, I gave her. We then went to bed, she asked me “can I cuddle with you? I need reassurance.” I said yes. We then did some adult stuff...

And now we are 2 days after the movie night. She didn’t tell me I love you or cuddled me since... but this morning before leaving to work she came in the room and kissed me goodbye and said I love you. I love her so much. I have no idea what to do anymore. What to think... I’m lost... I’m hurt... and I want some advice and some exterior advice on my situation.

TL;DR: Been with my girlfriend for 6 years, just bought a house. I went through a rough couple of months and got distant. She started gaming and connecting with a coworker, developed feelings for him, and said she loves me less. We broke up, then she came back saying she wanted to try again, but now she’s unsure and says she doesn’t love me anymore. I’m heartbroken, confused, and don’t know what to do.

ANSWER: Could 2 months of you withdrawing cause this much damage to a 6 year relationship that you describe as great and perfect?

I wonder if she saw it as great and perfect the way that you did.

QUESTION: [UPDATE - 7 years later] For years, my [35F] husband [37M] said that if I want stability in our life, I have to make it happen. I did. And now things are worse than ever. Help?

I was recently cleaning out my bookmarks and [found this old throwaway](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9tdkqa/for_years_my_35f_husband_37m_said_that_if_i_want/), and obviously the two posts I made with it. I'm not sure why now, but I feel compelled to write a followup. Maybe it'll give people the bravery to change or at least an example of how sticking with what you know isn't always the best choice.

An obviously very long story short, with the help of those posts and a lot of long nights of thinking, I left my husband. In fact, it took him going away for a long weekend to realize how much happier and at peace I felt without him around... At first the split was amicable, but looking back I think he was just waiting for me to come rushing back to him once I "realized my mistake." When that didn't happen and he could see I was actually serious about building a new life for myself, a switch flipped. We only spoke when he needed something from me and eventually that stopped too. Enough about him.

I'm now 42, happier and healthier and more satisfied than I've been my whole life. I picked me and that was the best choice I could've ever made. I lived alone for the first time and my god, the peace of having my own space... unrivaled. I ended up staying in that apartment for 5 years, not a moving box in sight. I put art on the walls, I knew my neighbors. I made a home. I grew my career and went back to school. Made friends, built a little community.

I've done a ton of therapy and realized that the abusive patterns my parents created in childhood were just repeating with my ex. I fell in love, a real love, a supportive love that encourages growth and security. I'm doing new work, work that helps people and is so much more than just chasing money. All of those things have created a life that's more rewarding than I ever thought possible for myself.

I've gone through some really shitty times too, illness, cancer scares, deaths, loss... but I have no idea how I would've come out the other side without the community I'd built around me. Even something as simple as people at your local coffee shop recognizing you is a comfort after feeling adrift and alone for so long. Anyway, if I were to respond to myself from 7 years ago, this is what I would say.

>Leave the loser. He doesn't care about you, never did. He only cares about what you can do for him and now that you aren't serving him... well. Just go. You are capable of doing difficult things, and you are worthy of the work it takes to accomplish them. Trust your abilities, trust your gut - it's been screaming at you for years now, honey. Life can be so much more than you've experienced, but you have to make it happen for yourself.

TL;DR: Left my husband, happier than ever.

EDIT: I'm surprised but happy this found so many people! I genuinely thought I was going to bookend this story and have it disappear into the ether. But whatever urge I had to write it, and whatever brought you to reading it... who knows? Maybe it was meant to. Thank you for all the messages and comments, I feel so grateful to have this perspective and experience.

ANSWER: It's really ridiculous the mount [edit: amount] of women I know who leave marriages and blossom, thrive, are so much happier for it. You don't see that much talked about in the outside world. It's really remarkable.

QUESTION: I am considering leaving my husband over keeping a lock on on of our doors and refusing to open it

Hi everyone. Very sad to be posting this but I F29 am considering separating from my husband M33 of 5 years over a big issue we just had a couple of days ago. My husband has always cared about his things, and he puts all his valuables in his office where he works remotely 3 days a week. He put a lock on the outside of the office door 6 months ago to supposedly keep his things safe from our destructive toddler. I let it go, but found it a bit odd since the key is usually no where to be found.

Anyways, I recently went in the office to get our bird's perch out the room, and he was hovering acting really suspicious. He defensively said what do you need in there? And I said the bird's perch...but then instantly felt he was hiding something from me. I also noticed he locked the door after that. After we put our toddler to sleep, I told him I needed to go in the room to change the sheets on our guest mattress because we have visitors soon. He was acting defensive again and said he would do it another time. That is when I said what are you hiding in there? You are getting really defensive, and its weird that I am locked out of a space in my own home and have to ask permission to enter. He got more defensive until I eventually said you need to unlock the door and let me see what is in there because you are hiding something.

Long story short, he admitted to hiding weed in the room and playing video games when I go to sleep. But he REFUSED to open the door. I told him i'm going to sit by the door until he unlocks it because I think he is hiding something worse since those things aren't that big of a deal. You guys, he literally refused. I tried begging, I tried getting the lock open, I tried everything I could think of. Not only would he not unlock the door, but he was gaslighting me the entire time telling me i'm crazy and it must be my pregnancy hormones thinking there was something else in there? He said that if he opens the door, he would be giving in to my pushiness. He also kept touching my leg and telling me he was sorry i'm going through this like I was making all of this up in my head.

Unfortunately, I got too tired around 2am (keep in mine i'm pregnant having to deal with this) and told him i'm going to sleep and whatever he is hiding in there he can get rid of in the morning, but i'm done. In the morning, the room was perfectly staged with his little weed pen out and switch game. He has changed the lock on the door to a normal one that only locks when someone is in the room, but still seems to see no problem with what he has done. He is still adamant that it is perfectly normal to lock a door from the outside if you have important things in there. He also said there was nothing else in there and he just couldn't for the life of him let me in after I said we needed to go through his stuff. He said that was controlling behavior and giving in would be saying that was okay.

I guess what i'm asking is...is it normal to put a lock on an office door even on the outside? Would a separation by the best next steps? I have a toddler and a baby coming, and really don't want to have to do this alone if I don't need to.

ANSWER: Yeah he was hiding something in there. If you’re lucky it’s something he’s just embarrassed by that he doesn’t want to share. But if it’s not that, I’d guess hard drugs or a porn habit that’s borderline cheating, since apparently he needs somewhere private to indulge. You could try asking him for a drug test to see how he responds.

QUESTION: My boyfriend turned me into a baby and I don’t feel like myself anymore

I (30F) used to be a very independent person. For example, I’ve travelled to over 30 countries all by myself by age 25. I knew how to survive anywhere in the world. My parents were abusive, so I escaped home and lived on my own as soon as I became an adult. I enjoyed living by myself and doing everything by myself.

Then I met my boyfriend (27M) a few years ago. Despite being younger than me, he treats me like a baby and started doing everything for me. He always takes me to work and picks me up after work since I don’t have a car. Without him, I would’ve walked or taken public transport. I’ve always been grateful to him for doing this. Not only that, but he also does all the housework. He does most of grocery shopping and cooking and cleaning and laundry. When we go on a trip, he plans everything.

Life with him was so convenient that I got used to doing nothing by myself in a few years. All my friends say they are jealous that I have such a good boyfriend who does everything for me. I thought so, too. But suddenly I realised that I can’t do anything by myself anymore? When he goes on a business trip and leaves me alone for a week, I find it so stressful and exhausting to do house chores like cooking and cleaning, which I always did by myself before meeting him.

I became much less independent than I was 10 years ago and I don’t feel like myself anymore. On the other hand, I feel like I’m finally receiving the love and treatment I didn’t receive from my parents and it’s compensating my miserable childhood. He says I need to be treated like a baby now because I didn’t have the chance in my childhood.

I’m aware that this isn’t healthy in the long term. What should I change?

TL;DR: I used to be an independent person, but my boyfriend treats me like a baby and does everything for me and now I can’t do things like house chores by myself. I lost the independent person I was and turned into a baby.

ANSWER: Girl you got a guy like this. Start picking up the efforts and put in 50% rather than him doing 90%, and you both are SET. If he continues doing all this, he's gonna be burnt out sooner or later.

QUESTION: Bf (19m) and I (17f) were mugged. He ran away and left me alone with the mugger. I can't see him in the same light anymore

Yesterday I was hanging out with my bf and we were in a not so great part of our city. Suddenly a guy approached us to ask for indications and asked us to help him get there and we helped him (stupid i know). After getting there he pulled out a knife and asked for all our money.

Bf ran away and left me alone with the mugger. Lucklily he just wanted my money so i gave him all the money i had and then he went away.

After that i went inside a bar and called my parents. My parents were furious with bf and tried to call him but he did not pick up. We then went to the police and then returned home and after maybe 2 hours i received a call from bf asking me where i was and telling me he alerted the police. I exploded on him and he did not even apologized but kept telling me he did the best he could.

My question is: is there any way to recover from this? My image of him is shattered

TL;DR: boyfriend left me during a mugging. I can't see him in the same light anymore

ANSWER: >>  is there any way to recover from this?

I personally do not think so. I am so sorry this happened to you.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (26F) think my boyfriend (30M) is exaggerating or faking his illness

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jefjhu/help\_i\_26f\_think\_my\_boyfriend\_30m\_is\_exaggerating/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jefjhu/help_i_26f_think_my_boyfriend_30m_is_exaggerating/)

Thank you to everyone who responded to my post and was so compassionate and kind. It was incredible to hear from so many people who actively battle chronic pain/illness and those with loved ones who do. I hope to continue deepening my empathy towards anyone who is struggling with an invisible illness.

On to my update. Armed with some fresh perspectives (and some fresh frustrations, lol) I talked to my boyfriend and told him that he needs to see a doctor or I will no longer be able to support him financially and stand by while he remains unemployed and unmotivated to get the help he needs. I also addressed the idea of managing/balancing his energy levels differently so that we're able to share household responsibilities more effectively, spend quality time together, and keep him doing the things he loves with his friends.

His response was...really bad. He told me that if I'm not willing to "step up and clean around the house" (something I'm already doing) that there's no use living together and that my efforts to clean are the bare minimum and not good enough for his standards anyway. He was also really mad that I haven't taken initiative to take care of yard projects and car repairs. He sat there and spouted off a whole list of things I'm not noticing and cleaning. And, once again, he was focused on this idea that I don't like his friends/am jealous of them and want him spending less time with them, which isn't true at all.

This really stung. He basically brushed over everything I said and focused on my perceived faults. This told me everything I need to know and I told him I was leaving. He was just...mad. Not sad or hurt at all. I'm still crying excessively over his whole reaction. I still don't know how real or unreal his chronic pain is, but I guess it doesn't matter anymore.

Thank you again, everyone, for your support and kindness. I'm truly at a loss.

TLDR: My (26F) boyfriend (30M) of almost two years and I have separated over his inability to address his chronic pain.

ANSWER: OP, I remember your first post. I know you’re very sad right now, and you have a right to be. But don’t let grief overstay its welcome — you are so much better off and he just lost his bang maid, expect him to come crawling back when he realizes you’re serious. Don’t believe anything he says.

This internet stranger is proud of you. You deserve someone who can be your partner regardless of whether they have an illness — that doesn’t mean they’re critical or cruel.

QUESTION: My Husband Told Me He’s Filing For Divorce Today

My Husband (34M) told me (32F) that he’s fed up and going to file for divorce.  We’ve been married for 1 year, together for 4 years. He is very angry, and I feel depleted and numb.

Backstory: 
My husband suffers from a type of OCD called Relationship OCD otherwise known as Retroactive Jealousy. It is where he fixates on my past sexual relationships, particularly on one person, a person who I have not even spoken to in over 8 years.

He can get triggered anytime, anywhere. We could be watching TV and a character will have the same name and he will get triggered. Last weekend, we were at a concert celebrating our one year wedding anniversary and someone came on stage wearing a jersey that is for the same sport this person used to play. He wanted to leave the concert immediately, we ended up fighting and our anniversary was ruined.

Anytime he is triggered, his energy completely shifts from warm, goofy and loving to ice cold and bothered and he shuts me out. It is a very sad, confusing, frustrating and isolating experience for me and for him, it’s mental turmoil.

Pretty much every single fight we have had in our relationship has stemmed from his retroactive jealousy. Other than that, we’ve been extremely happy. Unfortunately, every time he gets triggered it chips away at my happiness. I walk on eggshells and feel anxiety sometimes because I never know when he will get triggered next.

I thought he might get better with time / after marriage because he would finally see that I want him and only him forever, I was wrong.

Ever since he was triggered on our anniversary last weekend and we fought, things have never been worse. Something feels different about this time, like I finally realized this isn’t going away or I’ve hit my breaking point. We’ve been cordial to each other all week and sleeping in the same bed but no sex.

Yesterday, he asked me if “I’m ready to go back to being loving again”. I told him my concerns and how he needs to seek support / medication for this RJ. I also thanked him for giving me space (which literally just meant not initiating sex) and he got an attitude and say “yea well I was upset too”.

It felt clear to me in this moment that he wasn’t really listening to me and to be fair, I sometimes have a difficult time seeing things from his side as well. Sometimes his aggressive approach and victim mindset in conversation makes me automatically defensive.

He ended up storming out of the room and slept in the guest room (where he always sleeps when he’s upset or for his everyday naps) and has been slamming every door he walks through ever since.

At this point, there is so much tension that I told him I will move his things from the master bedroom to the guest room so that we both can have space to process what we’re feeling.

He left for the day to go golfing, a new hobby he picked up that he has trashed for the last 4 years.. While he was away I moved his stuff. I did not move it to upset him, I truly feel broken and anxious when I’m around him now and just need a little space to process everything.

He came home from golf and was livid. He said he wasn’t interested in being roommates and this was no way to live. I told him once again that I need space to process everything and he said rudely “you’ve had enough space, you’ve had a week of space. Instead of moving my belongings all day you could have instead come up with a way to communicate.” I told him I did try communicating with him yesterday and he got upset. I told him that the way he is currently speaking to me is with an aggressive tone to which he replied “Because I’m angry! This is ridiculous. I won’t be married to someone who can’t resolve simple issues, I won’t have kids with that person, I’m filing for divorce.”

I responded that I don’t want a divorce all I am asking for is a little space for us to work through this. I don’t remember what he responded but he didn’t care that I said that and I think again he just repeated he was filing for divorce.

After he said that he left the house. The crazy part is I still don’t feel much? I don’t feel angry or sad, just numb. Perhaps I’m over it or it could be some kind of coping mechanism to protect myself.

I’ve never spoken to friends or family about his RJ because I love him and didn’t want them to think negatively about him. I think it’s finally time I open up to my mother about it. I feel very alone.

I’m not sure what to do or where to go from here. I’ve never been more in love with anyone in my life. He was caring, made me laugh, bought me flowers, supported me when I was laid off from my job, etc. but I am just not sure I can be in this relationship anymore now with how he’s acting. Not taking accountability, being rude to me and instead of giving me the space I need, threatening to divorce instead.

REDDIT: It would help to hear from you (an outside perspective) on this. I am too in it to think clearly at the moment. Even if no one responds, it felt nice to be able to type this out.

TL;DR: Husband has ROCD (retroactive jealousy) that causes most of our fights. After a bad trigger on our anniversary, he’s now threatening divorce because I asked for space, claiming I am incapable of solving issues. I feel numb and don’t know if this relationship is salvageable.

____________________

UPDATE: I am blown away at the amount of support this post has gotten. Thank you to everyone who has responded and to the mod of this post for giving me a great book recommendation. As many of you guessed, his threat of divorce was not real.

For the first time in 4 years I truly put my foot down and told my husband that I will no longer put up with this treatment. I told him that if he continues to choose not to seek help and instead continue to hurt me, then I’m not staying (and he knows I mean it). I told him I love him, but I love me and my mental health more.

Since this long conversation he has set up an immediate plan:

Daily plan: 
 Morning reflection / meditation
 Medicine / Vitamins: Fluoxetine, magnesium, omega 3
 Workout

Weekly plan:
 Meet with therapist / start ERP (first session is scheduled for this weekend)
 Read 50 pages of self help books: 
     The Art of Letting Go - read by 10/1
     The Happiness Trap - read by 10/1
     Overcoming Retroactive Jealousy - read by 10/15
     Brain Lock: Overcoming OCD -  read by 10/30

I told him that I support him, but that he needs to do deep reflection and work on himself before we can start rebuilding our relationship. I plan on leaving town this week to spend some time with my mother and will be working on an exit plan to have just in case the day comes.

I have found a lot of strength and growth within myself throughout this process,  and am very proud of myself.

I can’t describe how it felt going from feeling so isolated and alone to feeling like I have a community who supports me through this post. So if you’re scrolling and see someone who needs help, just know that your comment can make a big difference. <3

ANSWER: This divorce would be a gift, honestly.

I don't know if this is genuine, but its absolutely wild.

QUESTION: UPDATE:  My boyfriend [M24] and I [F24] have too much sex and I can´t handle it anymore. How do I explain it to him that it exhausts me and how do I negotiate new intimacy with him?

Original post: [My boyfriend \[M24\] and I \[F24\] have too much sex and I can´t handle it anymore. How do I explain it to him that it exhausts me and how do I negotiate new intimacy with him? : r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ge7l3a/my_boyfriend_m24_and_i_f24_have_too_much_sex_and/)

I spend a lot of time reading through everyone's replies and looking inwards about how I feel. I gathered my thoughts and spend a few days making a list of what I wanted to say when we have the big conversation. On a weekend when we had planned to spend the day together I sat him down and told him the following points:

I love him to the moon and back and want to show him that I love him, make him feel desired, loved and appreciated

BUT

Having so much sex with such frequency is physically exhausting to me which causes me to avoid sex and even sex acts I enjoy because I don´t have enough energy and motivation to do it. This also causes me to orgasm not as often anymore. I also need time to physically recover before it may even start to become painful. I feel like sex has become the single defining aspect of our relationship and many other parts like doing activities together, romantic dates, just talking and cuddling have taken a backseat. I also feel exhausted emotionally and underappreciated from giving as much as I can (which I gladly do for the people I love) while little comes back from the other side of the relationship.

I then proceeded to explain the things I like during sex and what makes me go wild, hoping to show him that I still want to have sex with him. I also made a few more compliments just to keep the vibe positive and because I meant it.

He reacted pretty well all things considered. He listened and let me finish, but asked for a little time to think about it. Obviously I gladly agreed. We spend the rest of the day together without him initiating once. At the end of the day he said that he wants me to enjoy sex just as much as he does and that he loves me.

I was really hopeful for the next week and a half. We spend our time together like usual and he asked for sex about one half as often as before our talk. We even had days without sex at all. He also started to ask "Do you want to have sex with me?" instead of physically initiating like he did before, like touching me somewhere, hugging me from behind and similar things. He also stopped asking for pictures of me and when he did it were just selfies. I was so happy that I even took the initiative once and he seemingly loved it when I asked for sex.

Then one day he sat me down with a stern look and said that he hated what this relationship has turned into. To him it feels like we are now just roommates or platonic friends instead of lovers. He told me that the one time I initiated after he was overjoyed to finally "fuck me again" his heart was broken because I suddenly wasn´t as submissive as usually (I asked to be eaten out and was on top with some more dominant dirty talk) and that all of that is not what he signed up for. He doesn´t want to walk on eggshells waiting for when I am finally in the mood, but have what he deserves in the relationship.

Basically he gave me an ultimatum: either we return to how it was before the talk starting right now or he leaves me. Guess who doesn´t have a boyfriend anymore?

I spend the last few days bawling my eyes out and eating lots of ice cream and watching some shitty shows. What he said hurt me a lot and I do not love him anymore, but still the feeling of loss and sadness is all too real.    He was my first relationship and for the past two years he was my entire world. No I have to gather up the broken shards he left behind.

TL;DR: I took your advice and talked with him about my feelings. He pretended to be ok with it for a while and then left me after demanding more sex again.

ANSWER: Yeesh I'm sorry, but I'm so glad you stood up for yourself, because the way he reacted exposed even more red flags.

Do not take him back if he asks, he may try to manipulate you with the breakup so that you're more submissive next time.

QUESTION: I don’t want to relocate to India with my husband

Tldr: I, European 26, f doesn’t want ro relocate to India with my husband Punjabi 29, m due to cultural differences and lifestyle changes being too much for me to handle.

My husband is a Punjabi and I am a European NZ. We have been married for three years and he has been living in New Zealand for 10 years. I have been to India many times for three months at a time each go.

My husband has decided he wants to relocate us to India permanently, I really don’t want to. I would never force him to distance himself from his roots but I honestly don’t think I could cope with India for atleast 6 - 8 months a year, he said we could visit NZ yearly apparently. I made a compromise with him that I visit India for three months  a year and he can stay 6-8 months a year. He says life in India would be better for us because we would have more money and he has more connections in business there etc. My husband didn’t agree to this and said where ever and whatever the husband says the wife should follow. He said he Weill buy me a car in India and I can get a job teaching English to pre schoolers. I can only speak the basics on Punjabi and no one in Punjab but his parents and a few of his relatives who don’t speak English anyway.

I am really conflicted and cry about this often because I feel like I’m going to be giving up my freedom and individuality.

The times I have stayed in India have been hard at some points as my husbands house is rural and I can’t leave or go anywhere without him. I don’t get to wear what I like and to be honest if I say I don’t want to eat or drink something that is culturally Punjabi I found his family judged me so much. His parents also told me to stop watching English tv shows in the house. I followed their instructions and turned it off but felt super sad after wards.

I think that maybe I am being selfish for not wanting to live in India but I don’t want to be trapped with no where to go. I think I will go mad. Any insight on my situation would be appreciated. Sorry my paragraphs and words are all over the place, my thoughts in my head and just a mess at the moment.

ANSWER: “Whatever the husband says, the wife should do.” He’s telling you who he is. Just wait until you are isolated and surrounded by this belief/culture.

QUESTION: UPDATE: Boyfriend slept with someone else while we were on a break

Origional post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Z9RsQy6S1Y

Firstly, thank you for all the useful advice I was given on my original post. I was unable to reply because it was locked but thank you all.

Since I found out my (39F) boyfriend (40M) of 14 years slept with someone else, I broke up with him. He stayed living in my flat for 2 months (on a tight deadline) so he could find a home as he is jobless. He didn't. He is now homeless.

His mum pressured me to have him for longer as there is a cold snap here and he's on the streets but I said no. His mum can take him in if she is so worried.

I found out it was the lady he has been spending time with at the gym. I think he wanted to try that to see if it was better.

That is all. I now live alone (with dog).

TLDR: I chucked him out. He's homeless.

ANSWER: If he knew he was going to be homeless that far in advance and didn't sort out any income then that's on him. Who would want to have anything to do with someone who behaves like that.

QUESTION: My husband (63M) goes cycling way too much leaving me, his (60F) wife alone. How do I help him understand he's losing me?

Good people, I need some help.

My husband (63M) and I (60F) have been happily married 30+ years. Five or so years ago he started cycling. He loved it and I was happy he found something he enjoyed and was good for him although I felt he was spending too much money on bikes, tools, supplies, rides in races and weekend trips.

The last few years have been bad with the time he spends riding. It’s getting unbearable for me. He’s gone all the time. He takes two cycling classes a week at the gym, he rides there when he’s not taking classes and he’s out on the road or a path 4-6 days a week for 4-6 or 7 hours at a time coming home after 10 at night on weeknights. Oh, and works a full-time job on top of this.

Last month we went to Florida for three days to visit my family and of course he had to rent a bike and ride. In the last 5 months he’s left me alone to ride on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, Easter and Mother’s Day. He probably went riding on Valentines Day too, I don’t remember. As I post this, he’s in Chillicothe Ohio on a weekend ride and visit with friends.

This is not a communication issue as I have joked, talked, complained, yelled and cried and cried all many many times. I love my husband dearly and don’t want a divorce. But I can’t take being alone anymore. I'd rather be separated and alone than married and alone. But if I leave him, I feel I’d be letting our kids and grandkids down. I’m so lost and don’t know what to do. Nothing I do or say makes a difference to him.

I'm hoping a few people are willing to comment so I can show him this and maybe we can both learn something, or I can gain some insight. Thanks ahead for your helpful comments.

TLDR, My husband rides his bike and leaves me, his wife alone way too much and I have no idea what to do. Can you please offer some advice?

ANSWER: I'd sit down and talk about this and focus ENTIRELY on you and what you need. Do not say the words "you are cycling too much" or it will become an argument about whether he is cycling too much. Instead, say 'I need to spend more time with you" or "I need to know that you'll be physically present on holidays and vacations" and ask him how he's going to make that happen.

QUESTION: Wife is a whole new person after giving birth. I’m scared i’m going to lose her.

My wife [30F] gave birth to our daughter 4 months ago. She doesnt work so she is a sahm. She is NOT the same person she was before the baby. Before birth we got into a serious argument maybe once every few months, now it's almost every weekend for almost no reason. Monday we were supposed to have a date night (drinking wine, watching movies, playing games, ends with sexual relations usually I'm (32M) holding her while we're watching a movie and she randomly blew up on me for no reason. Said she's sick of me and doesnt ever want to have sex again then storms out and locks herself in the bedroom. I prioritize her wellbeing. Make sure she's fed, hydrated, doing well mentally when she's with our daughter. She doesn't even seem happy to see me anymore when I'm home from work. Past fights recently have been about how she's not happy with me anymore after i snapped back one time about her nitpicking everything ive been doing recently (she has never once mentioned this before the baby), she's snapped on me because the baby was crying and I couldn't get her to sleep fast enough, also screamed at me because i ran a yellow light with her in the car. When we fight it's really hurtful things being said to me and I'm always saying sorry trying to defuse. I've done maybe 95% of the feedings at night so she can get about 7/8 hours of sleep consecutively and take baby from the moment i return from work so she can get alone time. I also do a lot of the household chores for her and it seems to land on deaf ears. She refuses counseling and won't talk to me about it and doesn't think it's a big deal. It seems like our marriage is close to an end and I'm scared. I care so much about her I hate seeing her like this. Can anyone relate?

TL;DR: wife gave birth 4 months ago and now randomly hates my very existence.

ANSWER: It could be postpartum depression or anxiety.

Four months post birth is a difficult time regardless, she may also be struggling to adapt to her new life. I remember there were moments where I felt like I hated my husband, especially in the early days.

I would try and get her to speak to a doctor.

QUESTION: Update: I told my boyfriend I loved him right after we had sex. How badly did I mess up?

Sl I (33f) made a post the other night (which can be found here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/TvHzNz4WpV) about how I’m with my first ever boyfriend (37m) and told him right after we had sex that I loved him and he didn’t immediately say it back so I freaked out and tried to backtrack before shutting him down and saying I wanted to move on. I left shortly after and just shut myself out from him for most of the next day. This morning I got a text message from him that said he misses me and was really loved to go out tonight, so I figured what the hell and we went out. While we were out, there was a moment during dinner that I reached over and held his hand and told him I was sorry I ignored him and told him about my abandonment issues and how self-destructive I can be when I’m scared people will leave me. I’m sure it’ll come as absolutely no shock to anyone that he was lovely and patient with me. We went back to his place and were snuggling and I was starting to fade away to sleep…

…then he said “love you, beautiful” (“beautiful” is his pet name for me. Corny but he says it’s very fitting lol). I stopped and then looked over at him, and then he said “you don’t have to say it back.” I said “but what if I wanna say it back?” and he told me to go ahead and I said “I love you too.” I rolled over on him and gave him a nice long kiss and then put my forehead on his before I started crying a little bit. I cannot tell you how badly I’ve wanted to say that to someone since I was 14 and it doesn’t even feel real. Feels like some dream I had that was nice but didn’t happen.

Riding this emotional high I can’t sleep so I’m writing this while he’s sleeping next to me. I have to get up in four hours to have enough time to go back home and get ready for work, but I don’t care. One bad day of crap sleep is forgettable, I’m gonna remember this night for the rest of my life. It’s way too soon for this, but I’m already getting giddy about putting my name in front of his last name.

So yeah. I’m in love you guys <3

tl;dr: follow up to the situation with me telling my boyfriend I loved him. He forgave me for shutting me out and later told me he loved me too.

ANSWER: If we're talking about silly crap we did after only two months... I had a psychotic episode and ran down the highway trying to get away from a guy I met on tinder screaming he was trying to kill me.

We've been together 4 years.

QUESTION: I (43F) read my fiancee's (56M) journals and don't know if I can marry him now

I (43F) am using a throwaway for obvious reasons here. Before I start YES I know I am a huge jerk for snooping in his (56M) email and I definitely found trouble, I accept that. I was working on his computer and his gmail was open and I saw my name so I opened it and it was a Word doc that he journaled. Curious of course I searched his inbox with my name and saw his entries and read them. Some of what he said has devastated me and shaken me to the core. We have been together almost 3 years, the first year on and off and was rocky. We have been living together since the summer. He is not home and I have not brought this up yet. I think I might faint and need some space. Should I get some distance and go to a hotel for the weekend? I thought we were in a great place. Over the past 10 months these are some of the things he's written about me: For reference i put \\\\ in place of my name.

"There are moments, in my dark thoughts, where I feel like being with her is a compromise for me, like this somehow diminishes me and that I am settling for her because I have ruined all of my other prospects and I’m too old to find someone else."

"At times, I wish she had stayed out of my life.  I wonder if I had stayed on my own if someone better would have come into my orbit.  There is so much to deal with, so many bad feelings and darkness.  I find that I am thinking about Lauren a lot but who’s to say that she would be any better.  The reality is that I met her on tour and fucked her a day later.  What kind of woman is that? I feel like I have pissed my life away and this is all that I am entitled to.  I have pissed away all of the good things in my life."

"Someone like \\\\ would never have been able to get to me. When I was younger, I had many opportunities to be with women like her but declined. I am uncertain about whether this is a good thought pattern to have."

"My mind wanders to places, like what it would have been like if someone like Lauren could have been in my life instead of \\\\.  Lauren has the advantage of existing in my mind as an ideal.  We never really got the chance to know each other outside of two nights and a week of texting and talking on the phone.  I know that she had a drug past but has been sober for over a decade.  I don’t think she was promiscuous; most guys that I know that knew her in the old days indicated that she didn’t have a lot of men in her life.  That’s not to say that there hasn’t been a lot of darkness in her life. It would have been easier to be with her.  There weren’t all of these men in her orbit like \\\\.  She was never married, so there was no divorce.  She’s not as emotionally damaged as \\\\.  In some ways, I feel like being with \\\\ is some sort of karmic thing, like this is what I deserve for being non-committal for most of my life.  I have my own damage.  Everyone likes to think that they are a good person but there are moments when I am not so sure about myself."

TL:DR I am not sure if I can go forward with this relationship after reading this.

ANSWER: One: if he could get with Lauren, he'd soon be finding fault with her, too.

Two: run as fast as you can. He doesn't even like you, at all. Don't be a placeholder. You're not even second best here.

I'm sorry for how you feel atm, but it's good that you know so you can make your own decisions.

QUESTION: Update: husband has a new chosen family he prioritizes and sees every week, I’m jealous and frustrated

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/JwBnrT9EL9

It’s been a while since- our little boy is 2.5 now. Thank you to everyone who commented - it was the kick in the butt I needed to lay down the law. Esp the folks that rightly pointed out I was a passive doormat without self respect — that stung but was true.

After my post, I had a big sit down with John on my the things I was upset about. My husband was traveling to be a groomsman for a good friend — I told him to stay out there for an additional week and decide: 
1. if he wanted to stay married and wanted to be a family
2. If he wanted the above, think about what needed to change on his part (not just Pam but other stuff too), how he was going to be a good husband/father going forward
3. Arrange to go over it with me and our marriage counselor on his return

Alternatively, if he didn’t do the above then when he got back we’d start logistics on separation and co-parenting.

And surprisingly, he did all the above. Apparently he reflected a lot at the wedding (his friend and his wife are such an in love couple) and thought a lot about us and our relationship and what he wanted.

He came back and proposed changes (immediate break from Pam/company and stop to their hobby — he’d play some dnd / mtg online but that was it), he’d take over remaining baby prep (nursery, logistics), and   promised to lay out a post-partum care plan for me and baby. He stuck to his word and also worked hard to regain my trust.

Then we had our son and my husband was over the moon in love. He and baby have been inseparable ever since and have an amazing adventure filled life with all the hobbies (baby/toddler swim, gym, soccer, co-op, and a great local parent community). After our kiddo was born Pam lost interest in my husband anyway (she doesn’t like kids) and shortly thereafter cheated on her poly relationship. Kevin and John have actually become good friends since then, but John is straight so I have no worries there.  And as I’ve reflected — I think I also just actually hated Pam — she’s everything I don’t like relying on men for affirmation, no job/life ambition, frivolous and stupid. And apparently (according to Kevin) the feeling was mutual - she thought I was a controlling, stuck up, robotic ivy league workaholic who didn’t appreciate or support my husbands hobbies/quirks. I was also a lot more emotiobal during pregnancy than normal. My husband- upon reflection liked being needed and admired

We had a lot to work through with us, but two years later we’re in a great spot (I also had a weird shift in hormones post-partum which made my sex drive really really high which for us helped a lot with our relationship). Didn’t want this to be too long, but there were a lot of changes we implemented to get back to a loving place. John feels a lot of purpose in being a dad and supported me as my career has taken off. Sometimes things are still hard (my job is really high stress, toddlers are a lot of work, etc).

But we’re pretty happy. We spent this morning snuggling in bed with our toddler and dog pretending we were on a boat, making hair dryer sounds, and giving hugs. We live a pretty boring suburban kind of life - but it works for us.

Thanks everyone for the push for me to stand up for what I wanted and needed.

ANSWER: What a great update. I'm so glad your husband honestly reflected and chose you and the baby. Hope it stays that way!

QUESTION: Friend's [34M] Girlfriend [33F] Called Me [36F] A Pick-Me And Now My Friends Want Me To Apologize?

Hi everyone, I need some advice. I (36F) have a group of five friends. We hang out together a lot, playing video games, going to Friday Night Magic, watching movies, D&D, and just generally being nerdy. One of the friend group \[34M\], Bruce, has recently gotten a new girlfriend and we've tried to include her in our get togethers. The girlfriend \[33F\], I'll call her Silver, really seems to hate me, and I'm not sure what to do. I didn't notice it at first, if I'm honest. She came along to our May the 4th/Return of the 5th party/sleepover, one friend Peter \[35M\] helped her make a paladin to join in on a D&D one-shot when she said she wanted to learn, she's come along to FNM multiple times, etc.

However, the other night, while I was having a passionate debate with another friend, Steve \[36M\] about the atrocity that was Hush 2 from DC Comics, Silver absolutely lost it at me. She started yelling about how I was a 'Pick-Me' and how I was mad that she was in the group and that I wanted to sleep with all the boys \[?!?!?!\] but especially Peter. She yelled for like five minutes, while I just sat there like a deer in headlights, because I didn't know what to say? She accused me of making my Warlock sexy in D&D to make the boys want me, that I picked a "Pretty girl card" for my deck in Magic, that I tried to "dress sexy" for May the 4th. \[I wore an Ahsoka sleeveless tank top, no straps, just sleeveless.\]

I tried to tell her I have no interest in sleeping with Bruce, or any of my guy friends, and she just burst into tears. Peter said that maybe I should go, for now, because she was upset, so I did.

Now, on Discord, a bunch of them \[Peter, Bruce, Steve and Michael (33M) have all said I should apologize to her, with only Clark \[35M\] saying I have nothing to apologize for. There's been a lot of talk about 'keeping the peace,' but I'm not sure what I should apologize for? I didn't make a move on anyone. I haven't slept with or tried to sleep with any of my friends.

I'm not sure what I should do, or what I can do. I don't know what to apologize for and I feel like my friends are siding with her.

TL;DR: Friend's girlfriend called me a pick-me and went on a rant about how I'm trying to sleep with everyone and now my friends want me to apologize to her.

ANSWER: Sounds like she has major insecurity issues and sees you as a threat without really knowing you.  I would hold my ground and hopefully your friends come around since it seems like you are a decent person.

QUESTION: UPDATE 6 years later: I (F26) am in love with my best friend (M26) but he thinks a relationship is doomed to fail

Original post can be found  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dzdykr/i_f26_am_in_love_with_my_best_friend_m26_but_he/)

6 years ago I was here lamenting the feelings I caught for my fwb turned best friend (let’s call him Franky).

After the initial pain of rejection, we both agreed to stay best friends. We moved in together with 3 of our other friends, and lived as platonic roommates. We confided in each other all our dating woes, cooked together most nights, and continued having fun nights out. During that time I grew equally close to my other roommates, and had a casual Covid lockdown fling with one who is now one of my closest friends (shocker).

After 3 years of living together, I had finally (mostly) gotten over my feelings for Franky. We were both casually dating other people and in a good place. I had spent many holidays with his extended family as his best friend, and was content knowing that I had a life long friend. Then he had a big health scare. It ended up not being anything major, but at the time put a lot of things into perspective for the both of us.

The night Franky returned from the hospital we had a heart to heart. I cried as I told him how scared I was during the emergency and it ended with us both deciding to try dating seriously.

We moved out of the group house with our friends to a small condo together. It took some time to change from an awkward platonic relationship to a truly romantic one, but we allowed the relationship to take its own time and course.

It’s been 3 years together now. He is currently cradling our shared cat as we plan a romantic weekend get away to New York. He was right, after the one year mark we sat and had a big talk. We talked about what each of us needed to work on to continue the relationship. Instead of it being a relationship death sentence, it lead to both of us getting therapy, making positive changes, and brought us even closer.

We now have such open communication that even after 3 years we have not had a fight. I could not be happier to have my person, as well as the wonderful family that I now get to be a part of.

TLDR; after 3 years of remaining besties, a mortality check pushed us together. Celebrating 3 years of bliss and hopefully more to come :)

ANSWER: Love this for u both. also a good reminder that love doesn’t have an expiry date, it can come back around when both ppl are actually ready.

QUESTION: My (21f) bf (25m) is going on a week long trip to Italy. How do I not resent him?

So my bf of 2 years along with 7 of his coworkers got invited by his work to go on a one week trip to Italy. Everything is completely paid for. Meals, flights, excursions, they are renting a private yacht, they’re staying on a mansion on the beach. Literally a trip of a lifetime and he didn’t have to pay a dime

When he first told me I was honestly I was anxious because 7 months ago he had previously did something to break my trust and we were trying to build back. Come about a week away from his trip to Italy I found out that he had an option to bring a +1, expenses all completely paid for as well. literally all their other guys who were going invited their gf/wife. I was the only one left out.

That completely changed how I felt. It wasn’t just a work trip anymore. It felt very personal and left me wondering why he didn’t want to invite me while all the other men had no problem bringing girlfriend along?

When I brought it up he said “he didn’t know it would mean that much to me” and he views it as a “networking and making connections trip and doesn’t want to have to worry about keeping me entertained while he is busy networking and building connections”. Or something along those lines.

He told me I would basically just be sitting in our room the whole time which at least id be sitting in our room in a huge mansion on the beach and private yacht getting fed pasta every night. Instead I’m just sitting at the house.

I feel so hurt and excluded and now he is living his life across the world with him and a bunch of other happy couples while I’m at home trying not to spiral.

I honestly feel a lot of resentment building. He knew I was anxious of him going because of him previously breaking my trust and he knew he had the option to invite me but didn’t. He said he “never considered how id feel and was thinking of it from a different perspective.” Outside of him breaking my trust we have an incredible relationship. We never fight, he pays for my all school/bills, anything I want. Most importantly he is my best friend. And I don’t want to destroy what we have.

My question is am I being over emotional or is this a real red flag? How do I process this and not let it turn into long term resentment?

TL;DR: My bf of two years is going on a two week work trip to Italy along with 7 of his coworkers. All of who brought their gf/wife. I was the only one left out. Now I feel hurt, excluded, and unsure how not to resent him

ANSWER: Come on. He had the option to bring you and chose to spend the week in Italy without even asking you. That’s not someone who wants to spend time with you. Without knowing the details of breaking trust it sounds like Simone who wants to spend his vacation with another woman or at least keep his options open.

QUESTION: Dad (60m) is giving all his money to a 21-year-old he met while driving Uber. I’m at a loss.

My dad (60m) met a 21-year-old while driving for Uber and now I’m watching what looks like a slow-motion trainwreck.

She told him she was homeless, so he started paying for her hotel, got her a job, bought her a car, and in total has given her around $20k… in just two months. The worst part? He doesn’t have that kind of money. He’s borrowed some from me under false pretenses (which I now know went straight to her), and his credit score is in the 300s.

People have tried to warn him. Her friend called him saying she’s still with her ex and using him. Her ex’s mom said the same thing. Every time, she tells my dad they’re just jealous or dislike her.

It’s beyond surreal. He looks like Danny DeVito (no offense to the man), has nothing in savings, and yet thinks this 21-year-old is with him for love. They’ve known each other two months and he already tattooed her name on him. He’s even had the police recover the car he bought her multiple times—until the last time, when she got him to sign it over to her officially.

He swears she never asks for anything, but somehow he’s hemorrhaged $20k since meeting her. I don’t know how to make him see it. I’m torn between trying to intervene or stepping back until he crashes and then helping pick up the pieces… but it’s getting worse fast.

TL;DR: my dad gave 20k to a girl he met in 2 months and thinks she loves him, idk how to get him to realize she's 99% likely using him

ANSWER: Sometimes there's just nothing you can do. Don't give him your money, but on some level the attention this woman is giving him is worth the money to him.

QUESTION: My husband (33M) just asked me to quit my hobby and say goodbye to my hobby friends. I really don't want to say yes to that. What should I do?

Deleted

ANSWER: Are you currently being actively treated for your depression? That’s the root of the problems here. I don’t know if your husband is making your mental state worse, but I have a strong suspicion that your dynamic is.

But no, don’t let your husband isolate you from the only social outlet you have left. Isolation will make you feel even worse.

QUESTION: [Update] I [27F] don’t know how to deal with insecurities from dating bf [28M] who is much more attractive (7 years later)

Ok, a brief, mostly sad update. Previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bbvhkg/i_27f_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_insecurities/)

We got engaged a year ago, which felt like one of the best days of my life. The universe decided no, and earlier this year I found out my fiance cheated on me in the first months of our relationship and slept with his ex model fling a few times even though he had denied there was anything other than friendship between them. Found out because she still shares mutual friends with him and is in the same field, we were all at an event and she made a snide comment about it after a friend heard about our engagement and congratulated me.

I can't really put into words how betrayed I felt, our entire relationship built on lies and years of insecurity being validated after I finally put them to rest. We tried working through it, but I decided to break things off because I don't think I'll ever be able to trust him again. He made sounds about how it was an early mistake and that I'd be throwing away 5 years of our relationship, but tbh I felt like they never became a thing because she wasn't interested in more, not him. So yeah, I wish I could say all of the "but he picked you" comments were correct, but clearly it was too good to be true.

\\tl;dr\\ Starting over at 34 after finding out my fiance actually did cheat on me with his ex fling at the beginning of our relationship

ANSWER: > So yeah, I wish I could say all of the "but he picked you" comments were correct, but clearly it was too good to be true.

Just want to mention that him cheating has absolutely nothing to do with him being "more attractive" than you or even his ex being "more attractive" than you. Men cheat on beautiful women all the time, often with less attractive women and often when they themselves are unattractive.

Cheating is a character flaw. He would likely have cheated on the model too if they'd gotten together for real and will probably cheat on his next partner. I hope in all this you don't internalize that you were right to think he was too good-looking for you because that's absolutely not the problem.

QUESTION: (UPDATE) How do I (47M) tell my boyfriend (35M) that I'm a virgin?

Original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Rrnwj7gcmp

Hey everyone. I'm really greatful for all the advice and support I got on my original post. I posted another updates on the comments of the original.

Summary, I (47M) have been with my boyfriend (35M) for a little under a year. He wants to get physical, and I haven't told him that I've never had sex, because of my history of abuse. After getting advice in the comments, I ended up writing him a letter explaining that I'm a virgin, and touching on some details of my abuse.

I left the letter on the nightstand before I left for work. (My boyfriend works from home) when I got home, his daughter (2F) ran up to me for a hug like she always does. I scooped her up in a hug, and pretended to eat her little fingers.

We had dinner and put her to bed like usual, then my boyfriend asked me to sit on the couch. My stomach tied up in knots, and part of me just wanted to run out the front door.

I have to admit, you were all right. He immediately held my hand and told me he's not disappointed at all. He asked me a bit about my past and the abuse I suffered from my mother. I don't feel comfortable going into detail here, but I barely scratched the surface and I ended up crying in his arms. I never want to be without those arms in my life. His hands rubbing my back, resting my head on his chest to listen to his heartbeat, the smell of his cologne. It's the safest I've ever felt in my entire life.

Once I calmed down, we started looking for therapists near me, then the night went on like normal. Watching our favorite shows while cuddling on the couch, doomscrolling social media and showing each other funny posts. Then we went to bed.

I feel like a weight has lifted off my shoulders. I don't have to hide this about myself anymore. I don't have to live with the fear of my amazing boyfriend seeing me as a lesser man. I won't lie, I'm still anxious about not being able to satisfy him in bed, but we'll work on it together.

I have a therapy appointment for later this month. So things are going good!

Tl;Dr, I wrote my boyfriend a letter, we talked, and now I'm gonna go to therapy.

ANSWER: This literally made me tear up. I’m so glad you found someone who is empathetic and very understanding of your situation. Dealing with trauma in your past, does not invalidate you! You are more than just a body. You’re a living human being, who has gone through so much and deserves the world! Thank you for sharing this, and I’m glad to hear you will be going to therapy. Hopefully that helps you with your mental state, and overall well being. 🫶

QUESTION: Should I [F30] warn my coworker [M24] that he is alienating himself socially?

I [F30] work in a project-based profession. The projects take anywhere from six months to several years and you’re typically working with the same small group for the entire duration.

As a natural consequence of working closely with the same few people, friendships usually form, and we’ll all take lunch together sometimes or go for drinks after work, that kind of thing.

We have an especially copacetic group on my current project. We’ve been working together six months and we go out socially, we talk and joke around during the day. We’re not “friends” but it’s a tight knit group as coworkers go.

We have one coworker [M24] who is alienating himself from the group and I feel awful because he doesn’t seem to be aware of it.

He’s losing the good faith and camaraderie of everyone in the office and he doesn’t seem to understand why it’s happening. I can see that it’s upsetting to him and it’s unpleasant for too.

That being said, I don’t know him well at all, and I feel uncomfortable approaching him about the issue. He’s an overall nice guy and has some excellent qualities but they’re overshadowed by his tone deaf conduct.

The result is the entire team is spending less time together because we wouldn’t host an event with everyone except him, but most people also can’t stand to be around him more than they have to.

Should I say something to him and if so, what should I say?

His behaviors include but aren’t limited to:

—Acts like he’s the most experienced despite being one of the least; constantly interrupts or gives unsolicited advice to other specialties.

—Minimizes coworkers’ complaints; e.g., when someone said “the client keeps calling me on weekends,” he replied “maybe work harder so they won’t need to.”

—Gets angry if anyone uses a nickname version of his (very common) name, even from people who barely know him.

—Went to a bar with us and other teams then spent the whole night lecturing everyone about how he doesn’t drink because he’s healthier and has more willpower.

—Proudly and conspicuously tattled on coworkers for bending the dress code when no clients were around, leading to a companywide memo.

TL;DR: Younger coworker keeps alienating our tight-knit team with tone-deaf behavior (know-it-all, minimizes complaints, lectures at socials, tattles). He seems unaware. Should I say something?

ANSWER: The only thing I could see doing is questioning his inappropriate behavior in the moment. Addressing his interrupting- making sure the person who was interrupted gets to finish their thought, questioning if he thinks an unhelpful suggestion is actually helpful etc

Calling out behavior that shouldn't be happening may make him see that it's unpleasant, or at least give everyone else the license to also call out his inappropriateness.

QUESTION: I [29F] have lost attraction to my [27NB] disabled partner and I'm at a loss for what to do.

My partner and I met and started dating 6 years ago. When we first met they didnt identify as non-binary, and we started our relationship as a lesbian relationship. I am a lesbian and I am not attracted to men. I have tried, many times, it just does not happen for me and I cannot force it. That being said they were the love of my life. We fell very very in love and I have never experienced the acceptance they showed me. The love they showed me was magic and I look back with very strong fondness at that time of my life.

They started to transition in earnest 3 years ago. They were very hesitant to do so initially. They knew I'm a lesbian and was not attracted to men. And they didnt want to transition for that reason. I encouraged them to do it wholeheartedly, because being trans is something you do for yourself, not for anyone else. I assured them that I wasn't considering leaving them over that,  and that it was men i wasnt attracted to not non-binary people. I told them that they had to do it for themselves. That it was crucial, even. And they did, they've been on T for quite a while and are much more masculine and in general pass as a man. They're non-binary, but yeah even so we get read as a straight couple and theyre often referred to as my boyfriend (a term they like). Over time though... its just not the same anymore. I struggle with intimacy with them, I am still deeply attracted to who they are. But their body has changed and their demeanor has changed and it's just no longer within what I'm attracted to. Its starting to hurt me to force myself through it. I want them to be happy but I am unsatisfied in several ways and have had a lot of feelings that I'm not voicing because I do not want to hurt them in any way.

They are also disabled and reliant on me for a lot of things. I rely on them for a lot too, as I am not always in the best mental state. Neither of us has a relationship with our families. We both experienced a lot of abuse growing up so we're mostly by ourselves. I can work and am working but they aren't as they have been going to therapy. They wouldn't have anywhere to go if our relationship ended. They don't have support to fall back on. And their mental health fluctuates and at somewhat routine times they are suicidal. I'm so scared of what would happen if I did decide to leave.

I don't really know what I'm looking for. Someone who has been in this situation I guess? I feel so much guilt and fear. I'm semi-sick today because of how anxious this whole thing is making me. I'm so scared of being alone too. They do provide emotional support to me, which has been very helpful for me at times. I just don't know what to do. I feel like no matter how I look at the situation I'm in the wrong. That I'd be throwing away the life weve built together and that its my fault.

TL;DR my partner transitioned and I'm losing attraction to them but they are disabled and we are very dependent and I have no idea what to do.

ANSWER: This is pretty common for partners of people who decide to transition. There's no shame or harm in deciding that you are not attracted to their new self (with absolute respect for your partner — I am saying this as a transgender woman!).

You're allowed to feel the way you're feeling. I know it hurts and feels awful and it does not at all reflect how you feel about your partner. But you need to do what is right for you — just like they did for themself (with your blessing).

Edited to add that I'm rooting for you both and wish you peace and light.

QUESTION: My boyfriend (27M) stays over almost every day but never helps with groceries or bills. How do I(25F) talk to him without sounding rude?

I(25F) need some advice because I feel stuck. My boyfriend(27M) and I have been together for a little over a year. He has his own place, but for the last few months he has been staying at my apartment almost every day. Sometimes he goes home only to pick up clothes or do some chores then he comes right back.

I love having him around. I really do. The problem is that my expenses have quietly doubled and I did not notice it at first. Groceries go way faster. The water and electricity bill are higher. I am the one cooking most nights because he is already here when I get home. He never does it on purpose, but he has slipped into the routine of treating my place like our place without the responsibilities that come with that.

Last week I realized I spent more on groceries than I usually do in an entire month. My rent and bills are manageable when it is just me, but not when I am basically hosting someone full time. I do not want to resent him, but I am already starting to feel irritated when I see the fridge emptying twice as fast.

The hard part is that he is not a bad person. If I asked directly, he would probably help. But I do not want to sound like I am charging him for staying with me. I also do not want him to think I am keeping score. I just want things to feel fair because right now it feels one sided.

How do I bring this up without making him feel attacked or unwelcome? Do I ask for a set amount each month? Do I tell him we should split groceries on the days he stays? I honestly do not know how to word it in a way that does not feel awkward.

I care about him a lot. I just want to find a healthy way to talk about this before it becomes a bigger problem. What is the best way to have this conversation?

TLDR: Boyfriend (27M) stays at my place almost every day and my expenses have increased a lot. He does not help with groceries or bills because we never talked about it. I (25F) want to ask him to contribute but I do not know how to bring it up without sounding rude or making him feel unwelcome.

ANSWER: If he is already there when you get home, why are YOU the one that has to cook? He could at least pull his weight by preparing meals for you if he is already there when you get home from work, like a decent partner would, even if you are paying for the food. I’d be pissed if I got home from work to find my partner had let themselves in, was using my water/power, eating me out of house and home, and still expected me to cook for them while not contributing anything financially or otherwise.

Do you want to live with him full-time? If so, it’s definitely time to have that conversation as he’s making himself very comfortable. Let him know that you care about him and enjoy his company, but if you are going to continue the relationship and build a future together, you need to have a conversation about splitting costs, division of labour and living arrangements. Show him copies of your bills before and after he started spending all his time at your place, and how much you are having to spend on food, and ask him to help you with the costs, because the increases are due to his presence. If you do want to live together, tell him that whatever you both will save in rent could be put towards the shared expenses.

If he is not willing to chip in, then you may want to reconsider this relationship, or at least start spending more time at his place so he can wear some costs. Why is he at your place so much? Do you live alone, and he has roommates or lives with family? Right now, he’s treating you like a free hotel with catering. What exactly is he contributing? He’s living his best life and probably saving himself a fortune by never being at his place or having to buy his own food. I’m guessing you also get stuck with cleaning up after him too?

QUESTION: My (36M) bf has made 0 friends or maintained 0 friendships since high school. I'm (31F) his only "friend" and it's wearing me down. What should I do?

As the title suggests, my boyfriend doesn't have any friends and relies on me for all social contact. He can also be really moody which makes it hard for me to know how I can help or respond to this.

For example, yesterday morning I got up for work. He was still asleep and I didn't want to wake him. I went out into the kitchen to start boiling the kettle and when I came back into the room his eyes were open and he was looking away from me and frowning. I smiled and said "oh! good morning! How did you sleep?" And he said "fine yeah" and still wouldn't look at me. I could already sense something was wrong and asked "is something wrong?" He said "why didn't you say good morning to me when you got up?"

I explained that I had thought he was asleep, and of course I would have said good morning if I knew he was awake but didn't want to wake him. He was angry and wouldn't speak to me, saying he couldn't believe I had ignored him when I got up. This turned into an argument and eventually I left to go for a morning walk.

I understand this is a really micro-level interaction, but it happens a lot and I'm getting so tired of this. The moodiness really gets to me. He also won't see a therapist even though he's been saying for almost a year that he will at some point. I see a therapist monthly and try really hard to keep on top of myself and my own emotions etc.

He doesn't have any friends, I mean actually zero friends. He never has had any friends since high school and this puts enormous pressure on me to be everything in his life (I'm 31, he's 36). And I try hard to keep my own friendships going, but it's gotten so hard since I started dating him 3 years ago. Every time I say I'm going out to see friends, he gets moody and gives the same reaction as above - he goes quiet, won't look at me and then says nothing is wrong, but then later on will blow up and say he doesn't understand why I'm seeing xyz, why I feel the need to go out etc. But equally when I ask him to join me, he either says no or goes further and asks why I don't just stay home or do something with him. Then whenever I try to broach the subject with him, he becomes incredibly moody or angry/sad.

I feel like I'm you crazy and I can't take it anymore. I'm feeling so isolated and just...sad. I don't know what to do. I want to leave but every time I say so he gets angry, then cries, then I end up deciding to stay. Meanwhile every time I do, he doesn't change anything and just continues with the moody behaviour. I don't want to be someone else's entire social life, whilst also missing out on my own social opportunities. But I'm scared of losing all the really good things about our relationship, and there are lots of them. I just can't imagine staying with him and getting married or having a kid (he really wants kids whereas I'm more on the fence) - I'd just rather be alone even though I know it'd be hard. Am I crazy? Help?

TL;DR I'm feeling responsible for my partner's emotions and entire social life, given he has no social circle and hasn't made any friends or maintained any friendships for the past 17 years. I have my own friends and social circles but am feeling like he doesn't want me to have friends. I don't know whether to leave or if I should  keep trying to work on the relationship. Any advice on what I can do?

ANSWER: There's a reason why he doesn't have any friends and it looks like you're finally seeing it.

Just because you've had a few good moments with him doesn't mean you have to stay with him forever.

QUESTION: My (29) boyfriend (30) is deeply enmeshed with his  parents (70 F, 72 M) and he’s an only child. It’s very difficult for me.

I (29F) am in a year relationship with someone (30M) who is very enmeshed with his narcissistic parents (70F, 72M). Our relationship is wonderful,  but it has been absolute hell with his parents, to the point I’ve had to hold boundaries and have gone no contact with his parents. He feels he can’t do this. He often says “they’re all I have” because he’s an only child.

He’s an only child and I’m his first really serious relationship where we live together, are planning a future, and we’re serious about getting married one day.

It’s like his parents have always hated me for this and have seen me as taking their son from them.

His parents financially abuse, verbally abuse, and heavily manipulate my partner… he’s basically like their servant.

They have made a series of poor financial decisions; overspending, luxury trips, clothes, spending over their means, expensive housing they can’t afford, etc…. They always tell us “we deserve to enjoy life”…..

They’re in a really bad spot now financially in their 70s and it’s really hard for my partner. His parents are desperate and basically in survival mode now. They’re guilt tripping him and being straight nasty about it all… basically telling him it’s his fault and guilt tripping him constantly to do things for them, financially support them, etc.

My partner already gave up the house he owns so they can live there for low cost, and I just feel they will always come first. We now pay $3200 in rent together, and while we can afford it, we keep having to make ourselves uncomfortable for his parents, or they throw a tantrum. We have a lot of financial goals we had to adjust now to accommodate for his parent’s poor life decisions.

It’s directly impacting me now, sometimes I feel it’s time to leave. His parents will always have a hold on our relationship as long as they’re alive and it’s just going to get worse as they age.

He’s starting to see how his parents are the more he interacts with my healthy family dynamic, and his parents resentment toward me has grown to the point I’ve had to cut them out of my life….. they try to put a wedge between us…..however, I know they’ll always impact our relationship as they are his parents even if I have no contact. Also….his programming runs deep of course over many years.

Any advice please?

TL;DR: my boyfriend’s parents are very difficult and use him for everything, but do not treat him or me well to the point I’ve cut them off completely. I feel it will never get better.

ANSWER: >(29F) am in a year relationship  
It’s been absolute hell,  
are planning a future, and we’re serious about getting married one day.

I cannot understand why you are planning a future with someone with whom it has been hell with and you've been dating for only a year.

QUESTION: My girlfriend (19F) cancelled my Thanksgiving flight during an argument, and now I’m unsure how to move forward. I’m (21M).

My girlfriend’s mother bought plane tickets for both of us to visit her family in Virginia for Thanksgiving. This would’ve been my first time meeting them, and I was genuinely excited.

A few days after the tickets were booked, my girlfriend and I had a disagreement about something related to her sorority process. She left my apartment upset and we didn’t speak for several hours. We made up the next day, but the following morning she told me she had cancelled my flight during the argument.

She didn’t pay for the ticket herself, and her family already knew I was supposed to come. She still hasn’t talked to her mom or anyone about what happened, so I don’t know if I’m still expected to come or if her family plans to rebook anything. I don’t want to pressure anyone or make assumptions, but the situation left me confused and disappointed.

I’m trying to approach this maturely, but I’m not sure how to communicate my feelings to her or how to move forward when the plans changed so suddenly.

How should I handle this conversation with her, and should I still go if the family decides to rebook the ticket?

TL;DR: My girlfriend cancelled my Thanksgiving flight that her mom bought during an argument, hasn’t talked to her family about it yet, and now I’m unsure how to move forward or whether I should still go.

ANSWER: Maybe next year. They won't be able to rebook for the same cost now, and honestly I would not want to meet her entire family with this hanging over your head.

QUESTION: 43/F Married 13 years. 46/M Husband betrayed me in multiple ways. I’m trying to figure out if people like him actually change or if I should walk.

Tl;dr
My husband lies to avoid conflict. How do I trust him to keep going thru this betrayal torture?

I’m using a throwaway because the details are embarrassing and honestly I don’t want anyone in my life connecting this to me.

My husband and I have been together 15 years, married 13. We have a 9-year-old son. Until recently, I thought we were solid. Not perfect, but solid. Turns out the foundation was rotting under my feet.

Here are the facts, and I’m trying to be fair about my part too. I want real feedback from people who have gone through things like this.

1. The strip club incident.

About six weeks ago, we went to a strip club together after sexy talk at dinner for his birthday. I’d never done anything like that with a partner, but he’s been venting about not frequent enough sex for a couple years so I thought this might spice it up and give us content to fantasize to after. We had a blast the first night though my feelings were a little hurt when he got too into her. He apologized and swore he’d stay sober and keep me emotionally safe next time. The next week, he went way over the line. The stripper touched him, he got “too aggressive,” and he orgasmed during a lap dance. This shattered me. He had just promised me emotional safety the week before. I felt stupid for trusting him.

2. His past and what he downplayed.

He worked in the club scene before we met. Always claimed it was “I worked in the office, just had a few dozen dances, nothing crazy.” Now I find out he’d been sucking strippers’ breasts and doing a lot more than he ever admitted. He has since estimated 50-100 dances over his lifetime when pressed. I’m sure that’s downplaying it too. I didn’t marry a saint, but I did expect the truth vs a picture of an innocent kid. He hid the real story for years. Yes I now know how naive this was of me. But he reassured me of the things that go on at the club when I asked before we went and I felt I’d be safe and he’d just be watching.

3. The money lies.

Twice he pulled money from a line of credit behind my back. The first time was 2022–2023 which almost led to us divorcing due to the risk, the amount, and the way he wouldn’t take ownership and said he was just “leaning into his business”. He promised he’d never do it again. Then he did it this year—$40k—for a sponsorship he couldn’t afford. Hid that too. Being in finance, I’m held to a high fiduciary standard, so it hits extra hard.

4. The porn and social media.

Hours a day. While I was drowning in work and parenting. He wasn’t cheating physically, but he was checked out. He deleted a few text messages with a woman he worked with (non-romantic from what he says, but hiding anything at this point hits hard). He has given multiple excuses.

5. The unnecessary lies.

This one killed me. Our son mentioned a conversation with us all together cuddling in bed about a conversation he had with his dad about my husband’s 4-5 ex-girlfriends. My husband instantly denied ever having the conversation gaslighting my son in the moment. Even when our kid said it happened last week. Was proud my kid held his ground and said “Dad you did say this.” It was such a low-stakes thing to lie about, and he still did it. I confronted him. He doubled down. When cornered, he backpedaled with “I didn’t think it was significant.”

6. Emotional stuff.

He often says he “doesn’t lie,” even when caught. His crying performative. Voice shakes, no tears. It’s hard to explain, but my gut screams he’s faking empathy instead of feeling it. He gets defensive instead of owning his choices. And when he does “own” something, it feels like he’s reading from a script.

Where I’m culpable:

I’m intense. I’m direct. I have a big career and a strong personality. I’m sure that has been intimidating for him. I’ve also been overwhelmed with work, parenting, and philanthropy. That said—none of this justifies lying or betraying someone.

Where I’m innocent:

I didn’t betray him. I didn’t lie. I didn’t do anything that required secrecy or cleanup. My “crime” is being successful and busy. His is breaking trust in every direction.

Therapy:

We’ve been in a therapy marathon for weeks. He journals now because his therapist told him to, not because he chose to. He says he wants to change, but his actions come in short spurts and fall apart fast. He has admitted he doesn’t know know how to show me empathy even after seeing all this pain. That was gutting.

My question:

Do people like this actually change?
Has anyone stayed and seen their partner do a full 180?
Or is this one of those “you already have your answer” situations?

I’ve read about people who are compulsive liars, people who can’t tolerate shame, people who crumble when confronted with their own behavior. I don’t want to raise my son in a home where his dad lies over small things and big things. But I also don’t want to blow up his world if there’s a real chance my husband can actually change.

If you’ve been the betrayed spouse or the betrayer who actually changed, I’d appreciate hearing your experience. What signs were real? What was fake progress? What should I be watching for?

I’m exhausted. I’m hurt. I don’t want to waste another year waiting for a miracle that won’t come.

Stay or go?
What do people like him actually do long-term?

ANSWER: Are you tired yet? I am just reading it. This dude lies at every single opportunity, how can you trust him about anything at all? And if you can't trust him, what's the point? Cut the weight and feel free and happier.

QUESTION: My husband (34M) has started talking down about my (27F) exercise habits, not sure how to approach the conversation

We've been together for 4 years and married almost a year. I was diagnosed with PCOS at 20 and spent my early 20s learning how to manage it. I take medication to manage insulin resistance and I do some form of exercise 5/6 days a week. Usually walking a mile, around 45mins/1 hour on my exercise bike, and I got really into squats this summer so they have been added in. I do the stairmaster when I'm able to physically go to the gym.

When we got together I had dropped around 80 pounds and was below my original goal weight. He was always very complimentary of this, saying it was impressive that I was able to stick with it and get the results I wanted. I easily maintained my weight the entire time we were dating, it does take time out of my day but I almost always got it done while he was at work so we could hang out. We tried to walk the mile together but he almost never felt like it and I preferred to get it out of the way earlier into the day anyway. My husband isn't massively overweight but he is definitely insecure about his weight, I think he looks great and am happy to support him wherever he's at.

Since we've married and moved in together he has slowly become less approving of my working out. It didn't happen at first but now it's like he views my very mild exercise as "excessive" and also done incorrectly apparently. He tells me I should do the bike for "15 minutes max, anything past that is not helping you", that my mile walk that takes me 20/30 minutes is "too long, you don't need that much", and finally to me proudly telling him how many squats I did was "You'll need to show me how you're doing it because I know you're definitely doing it wrong" (not even a "great job", also someone taught me years ago but he "doesn't believe it").

I've been getting annoyed about this new behavior but trying to push it aside for some reason. I finally got frustrated a few days ago because I was getting dressed to take my walk and he got very upset with me. Pouted and said "You don't need to do that, why don't you want to spend time with me?" We spend almost all of our free time together!!! Plus no one told him he couldn't walk with me, I just knew he was going to have an issue with it.

I've literally been gaining weight and his criticism is making it hard for me to stay motivated. I've always been so proud of getting on top of my health and I've felt so much better, but lately it feels like punishment. I'm not sure how to approach him, I think he feels unhappy with his body and habits and is pushing these things to me. I want to be kind but I also want to defend myself. My quality of life was so much worse before and I feel hurt and annoyed that it seems he would prefer I go back to that so it doesn't challenge him at all.

Tl;dr my husband suddenly dislikes my exercise habits and talks about how unnecessary or wrong I'm doing everything. I think it's unhappiness in himself and I want to be respectful to him, but he's not being very respectful to me so I'm not sure how to approach this chat.

ANSWER: My question is why are you pushing this to the side? This should be immediately addressed because he is getting the signal that this is okay. Your exercise habits predate him and are not for him to control. Have the discussion, he needs to stop.

QUESTION: Friend keeps messaging me  20–50 times a week and I don’t know how to handle it

TL;DR - Old friend messages me constantly despite my repeated attempts at boundaries. How do i stop this without being cruel?

\_\_

Hi all,

I (29F) have an old friend who I’m not very close with anymore (39M). We worked together for about a year when I was 18. We don’t hang out, I don’t really think about him day-to-day, and I usually reply maybe once every few weeks. But he sends me constant messages - mostly Facebook reels - literally every day. Sometimes it’s 10 a day, and recently I opened Messenger and saw 54 unread messages from him.

I haven’t replied in about 3 weeks. He keeps messaging anyway, and today he sent things like:  
“I don’t think you like me anymore haha you talk to me like once a month.”

He’s also asked if he could visit me while he’s in the area (I didn’t respond), and he keeps pushing past hints that I’m busy or not very active on Messenger.

For context, he has bipolar disorder and can be very intense and emotional. A few years ago when I tried to set boundaries, he told me he cried in the shower because he thought he was “losing me,” which made me feel horrible. I don’t want to hurt him or be cruel, but the constant messaging makes me uncomfortable and I don’t feel close enough to him to manage his emotional reactions.

I don’t want a big confrontation or to send a harsh message - but I also don’t want to reinforce this by replying and starting the cycle again. I've sent a couple of messages over the past year or so just saying 'Hey man, im not on facebook much" or other things along those lines. He just doesnt take the hint to stop messaging. Its relentless.

What’s the healthiest way to handle this?

Is it OK to just stop engaging at all? Should I send a short boundaries message? Mute him? Block him?

If you’ve dealt with something similar, what worked for you?

ANSWER: So dude has been overly attached to you since you were 18 and he was around 28. Without you encouraging it at any point by hanging out or entertaining himself outside of the workplace. And it's been 10 years and he's still going.

This is actually pretty damn creepy and scary. I agree with the longer comment advising you to get your ducks in order safety wise but I would also download or screenshot as much of your message history as you can in case you need to take the problem to law enforcement. Emphasize the very earliest interactions. The ones where you were 18 and he was nearly 30.

Be safe please!

QUESTION: My HUSBAND Always does STUPID experimental stuffs, how not to get ANGRY?

I am F(27) and my husband is M(28). Married for more than 2 years. My husband is a very clumsy person. He easily gets distracted. He says that he has ADHD, I also think that. But it is getting really stressful for me. He is not that careful with his spending. He tries to be careful, but the things he does ends up costing us more money. Recently, his mac was heating up when he worked on it, he saw from a yt video that suggested a small repair. So, to save money he ordered the kit for himself to fix it on his own. We are immigrants and every penny counts for us. I told him that even if it costs a little more he should go to a professional for these stuffs as he has no prior experience. He said yes i think you are right but ended up doing what he thought initially and damaged a more expensive sensitive part instead of fixing it. Now it might cost us 10-20 times more to repair that. This is just an example he keeps doing things like that and I am always stressed or anxious about him constantly about whatever he does. Even if I show anger because of that he did not listen to me he says that I am nagging and it is not right. If I can't say anything good in these typpa situation I might just stay quiet. His ADHD is increasing my anxiety and stress levels. What can I do to fix his these type of behaviours so that he takes more mature decisions and thinks maturely and logically before doing something. So that I no longer have panick attacks.

TL;DR My husband is always doing immature things and making immature decisions, I am getting hyper anxious day by day, what should I do?

ANSWER: 1. You're not having panic attacks. That is very different from being frequently angry with a spouse and having anxiety over money.

2. You can't "fix" him.

3. Your husband \may\ have ADHD -- has he actually been diagnosed? -- but "disregarding my partner's concerns" is not a symptom of ADHD. That's just a spouse being a jerk.

So the first thing I'd do is encourage your husband to actually get checked out for a formal diagnosis. If he has a problem that prevents him from being functional in certain ways that are very important to you, medication and teamwork to change how you divvy up tasks (like who is responsible for repairing a broken laptop) are things you can get from counselors who deal with people with these problems. I don't think it's helpful for you (or him) to pathologize all your relationship issues as being caused by a mental health disorder your husband may not even have. If he does, then HE has to do the work here, and YOU have modify your expectations and behaviors so that you find a dynamic that works for you.

As for the rest of it, when you say you're constantly stressed or anxious about what he does, that's a really bad mental state to be in. You can't parent a grown man. What are some practical things you can do to protect yourself from the impact of his impulsive decisions? (e.g. take over managing the household money) How about some emotional things you can do? (e.g. don't clean up his messes, leave the area and go someplace quiet away from him, etc.)

Does your husband CARE that you are having all these conflicts? And how did you resolve conflict before you got married? Surely this didn't just spring up out of nowhere.

QUESTION: Moved in with my boyfriend (23M) 3 months ago and I’m (22F) drained. Should I move out while he’s gone?

My boyfriend and I moved in together about three months ago, and ever since then I’ve felt completely overwhelmed. Before living together, things were great. But now I’m doing almost all the housework while working fully onsite, and he works hybrid and still barely handles his small chores unless I remind him multiple times. Whenever I bring up how stressed or frustrated I am, he says I’m “attacking” him or blowing things out of proportion.

Today I rushed out the door late for work and accidentally tipped over my sock drawer, and instead of being understanding, he texted me during lunch pointing it out in a passive aggressive way, even though I silently clean up after his messes every day. It made me realize how imbalanced things have become and how little accountability he takes. We’re going to be apart for a month starting Sunday, and I’m thinking about staying in an Airbnb until he leaves, then going back home when he’s gone and possibly moving out while he’s away so I can think clearly. I still care about him and would give the relationship another chance, but living together has brought out issues that are really draining me. Am I overreacting, or is this a sign we’re incompatible living together?

TL;DR: Since moving in with my boyfriend, I’ve ended up doing almost all the chores while he gets defensive whenever I bring it up. Today was my breaking point, and I’m considering moving out while he’s away for a month. Not sure if it’s dramatic or the right move. What should I do?

ANSWER: Get out now while you still have your fire, because it gets a lot harder to leave once you’ve forgiven him two or three or twenty times. It does not get better, seriously. This is supposed to be the honeymoon period of living together. It’s the best it will ever be, right now.

QUESTION: Bonding with parents feels impossible because I (28M) feel like I have to walk on eggshells.

I (28M) often find myself in this position where bonding with my dad (63M), I might say something conversational and it gets interpreted as me not having a good time.

For example, I come over so we can watch films together over dinner, and let's say we watch a movie and even though I liked the overall film, I might say, 'It was good. It kind of dragged at points but it was a great narrative.'

Somehow that gets translated into him profusely apologizing: "I'm so sorry I made you watch that. I liked it, I just thought you might, but I won't make you watch any more-"

As much as I try telling him that I did like it, he doesn't seem to hear me. It's like one wrong move, and suddenly, it's all over. My mom is pretty similar, but right now, I'm focusing more on my dad.

This has happened across several experiences throughout my life and unfortunately, we're not that close. I want to be closer, but I feel anxious about saying anything around him. Anyone experience anything similar?? How do you get around it??

TL;DR: I want to bond with my dad, but even small comments make him fret and over-apologize. I feel anxious speaking around him and don’t know how to communicate honestly without upsetting him.

ANSWER: How does he react if you just mention what you liked about it?

One of my colleagues wrote a book that was . . . okay, but not that great. But it did have a really strong sense of place, and when I said that I'd read the book, I pointed that out. He then said he was really happy to hear that, because he'd worked really hard on that, and it turned out that I didn't have to say anything else at all.

It sounds like your dad has some insecurities. Have you seen this show up in other ways, with other people in his life?

QUESTION: I (32f) am being made to choose between my ex con (34m) brother in law or the rest of my in laws by my mother in law (51f)

I really need advice here. Please help! Names in the story have been changed for anonymity.

I'm a 32f and have been married to my husband, Lucas (32m), for almost 7 years. We dated long before that, basically since we were both 18. I was a co-worker with his mom Bella(51f) when my husband and I were still dating, and so we've always been pretty close. My mother in law tends to keep my son(7m) with her over the weekends because she loves him and loves spending time with him doing fun things he'll enjoy. I've been accepted into Lucas's extended family with open arms and feel very welcomed by everyone. They may not always understand me and I may not always understand them, but we try and are always there for each other.

As a child, my brother in law, Tom (34m), hung out with the sorts of people that got involved with drugs and gang related activity. Lucas was then made to be the responsible one in the family in Tom's place and basically become a mini adult to help raise/care for his cousins and younger brother while his mom and the aunts worked on their careers. It was a turbulent household with an abusive man married to my mother in law, which had a big effect on the kids. Tom would basically do what and go wherever he wanted.

I've been told that Tom was doing drug deals, tried to pretend to be my husband when he'd gotten arrested one time, (thank God a family member was able to set that straight), broke into his mom's house when he wasn't supposed to be there, got shot in a drug deal gone wrong and has stolen someone's car. And those are just the things that I've been told about. There's most likely much more.

After the drug deal gone wrong, Tom was sent to prison for a few years. He got out, and within just a few months, he stole someone's car which broke his parole and was sent back to jail. So now he's been in jail for at least 5 years. (Sorry, I haven't been keeping track of exact dates.) Now he's out of jail again and has been since sometime in July of this year, I think. And that was when the initial issue started. Not with my brother-in-law but with my mother-in-law.

I believe that Bella truly does love her children, but I also feel like she has a large amount of guilt for how her son's life turned out. I think that she's trying her best to make up for lost time as quickly as possible. However, she's doing it in a way that's making others uncomfortable and is pushing other family members' boundaries.

Around when my brother-in-law got out of jail, my husband's entire extended family had been planning a trip to a water park together for an Aunt's birthday and everyone was looking forward to it for almost a year. However, Bella tried to insist that we invite Tom, too. Some of my husband's family are in law enforcement and have young children. They were not comfortable with that idea, especially with him so freshly out. My mother-in-law then tried to dig her heels in and say that if he couldn't come then she wouldn't come, and then the aunt that was putting on the entire trip for herself and the family almost canceled the whole thing over the drama! Luckily, my mother-in-law saw reason before we left, Tom didn't come and the trip stayed on.

Which brings us to the problem that I'm having now: Bella is trying to plan her own Thanksgiving away from the rest of the extended family because Tom isn't invited. And that would be an okay choice for her to make. However, my husband and I are now being made to choose sides. Either we support my mother-in-law and Tom, or we support the boundaries of the rest of the family. I don't really know what to do. Honestly, I don't like Tom. From what I've heard about him, and how I hear him talk to Bella, Lucas and my son (7m), I just don't like him as a person. Even without the crimes he's committed, he's rude and selfish. If he was not related to my husband, I would never be around him. But my mother-in-law is making this extremely personal. She insists that Lucas, my son, me, my other brother in law Dax(22m), Tom, his daughter (14f) and his daughter's mom Angel (??f) all forfeit going to the annual extended family Thanksgiving.

I don't believe that this is a fair choice, especially for my young son. Usually, at the big extended family Thanksgiving, all of the kids play together all night, watch holiday movies and then write out their Christmas lists to Santa. We all play family games like charades or trivia. All of the adults exchange white elephant slips to know who they're buying for that year. Then all of the adults plan on Black Friday shopping to try and knock out most of the lists. I don't see how making my son sit with a bunch of adults awkwardly all night it's supposed to help anything or show support.

And did I mention that I have my own family's Thanksgiving to attend? Every year it's a struggle to balance two separate Thanksgivings on the same day but we somehow manage. Now I have all of this added stress to the decision making and need to essentially choose to do three Thanksgivings or upset someone by not attending one of theirs.

I tried to appeal to my mother-in-law to ask if maybe we could get together with Tom on a different day, and tried to explain that the family just needs time to see whether or not he's changed and to rebuild trust with him. That he made a series of poor life decisions and that these are the consequences. I'm not saying that he shouldn't have a Thanksgiving with the family members that want to support him right now, I think that that's very good of Bella to want to do. I just think that she is letting her emotions cloud her judgment and that this could be the start of a rift between the family and unnecessary tension. My son cried today when he heard that we wouldn't be going to his cousin's house this year and it broke my heart. I think I'm leaning toward choosing to go to the extended family's Thanksgiving, now, instead.

How will future holidays go? Christmas? Easter? Birthdays? Anniversaries? Etc etc.

Not to mention that my mother-in-law is lashing out and has essentially said that she doesn't care what me and my son do, but that she expects my husband to attend her Thanksgiving because she would hope that all of her sons would want to spend the holidays with her. So now she's trying to keep my husband with her. How is that fair to my son and I!? I don't know what to do! I have so many past traumas, current mental health issues and people pleasing tendancies that this is really putting a strain on me. My husband is very non confrontational and hates that he's being forced into choosing.

Lucas has already tried to discuss this with her but she still insists on doing it this way. When my husband first told me about her plans, I expressed how upset that I was and how unfair it was for our son and he agreed. But he still wants to support his mom, even if he doesn't have a good relationship with his brother and isn't super close with his mom. He doesn't know what to do, and neither do I. I don't know what Lucas will choose to do.

Please, I'm begging for advice or people's perspectives! I really need help!

Tl;Dr:

My mother in law wants us to choose between her awful son or the extended family Thanksgiving tradition this year since he just got out of jail. Help!

ANSWER: I would choose not to spend my thanksgiving with an asshole or the woman trying to force me to do so. Your husband needs to step up, this is his family to deal with.

QUESTION: Married within a year, and now I’m seeing red flags I ignored before — how do I handle this? (27F/33M)

Hi, this is a long read. Bear with me. Im a 27/F. My husband is 33M and we’ve been married for a year. I’m looking for some advice on how to handle this situation. I feel like I have no one to talk to, and I really need to vent while also getting someone’s perspective.

My husband and I got engaged and married all within a year. Everything happened pretty fast, but we both deeply desired marriage. Now that we’re married, some of the subtle red flags I noticed before are starting to repeat themselves.

My husband is very paranoid. He often assumes I’m cheating or doing something shady when I never have and never would. We attend church, and he gets upset when I put effort into my appearance. He assumes I’m dressing up to seek attention — even though I keep to myself at church and rarely engage in conversation unless I have to.

A few weeks ago, he went on a brief trip. While he was away, I booked a hair appointment. He became upset, saying I must be getting my hair done to entertain another man while he was gone, and created a whole argument about it. The truth is, that was the only available appointment time.

When he returned from his trip, he inspected the entire house, looking for signs that I had company while he was gone. In the past, he has often asked to look through my phone — and I’ve allowed it because I have nothing to hide.

If a man at church looks my way, or if he sees me glance at someone, he interrogates me and asks if I know them or if I’m trying to get attention. He frequently asks about my whereabouts, even though he has my location and I’m always transparent about where I am and what I’m doing.

One particular incident stands out — I was on my way to a church meeting (I serve at church), and I left early because I like to be punctual. He called me and told me to come back, accusing me of leaving early to mingle and potentially meet other men.

These are just a few examples of many similar incidents that have occurred. He says he wants to change and asks me to give him time. I believe he’s genuine in that desire, and he truly does have amazing qualities. Every time he realizes he’s wrong, he apologizes. I understand that change takes time, but when these episodes happen, he becomes a different person — angry and loud. And it honestly scares me. He’s not physically abusive but I’ve become so anxious around him.

I don’t know if I should wait it out or leave. He plans to seek therapy, but hasn’t yet. He says he can fix the issue himself, he just has to be self aware. I want to give him a chance, but I also know this behavior could get worse once kids are involved. I’m torn and don’t know what to do.

TL;DR: My husband and I married quickly, and now his paranoia and constant accusations of cheating are becoming overwhelming. He says he’ll get therapy, but I’m torn between waiting it out or leaving.

ANSWER: Please leave if he doesn't treat his insecurities- he's being extremely controlling and  isolating you, the first steps towards more physical abuse.

QUESTION: After 4 years together still no proposal. How long do I continue to wait?

I’ve (39F) been with my BF (37M) for four years and we’ve been living together for over two. Before I gave up my apartment and moved into his house, I asked where he saw our relationship going and his timeline for commitment. He said if after a year of living together everything was going well, we’d get engaged. This matched with what I wanted, so I moved in.

A year passed and no proposal. I bring up the conversation we had before I moved in and he said he’s saving up for the ring. Then his friend asked us if we were going to get engaged, and my BF said yes, soon. So, I was reassured we were still on the same page.

Then we get to two years living together, and still no proposal. The type of rings I like are not expensive, and with his salary I know he would have saved up enough by then. Then his brother got engaged after only two years with his GF. I know all relationships have their own timelines, but the news made me reflect. So, I straight up asked my BF why he hadn’t proposed.

At first his excuse was that planning a wedding was such a hassle. This didn’t ring true, so I said I thought he wasn’t being honest. Then he confided some struggles with his mental health and fears that I would grow resentful of ways he couldn’t contribute to the relationship due to them. I was surprised because those things are not deal breakers for me, I’m not upset by them, and I don’t think I’ve ever expressed resentment.

He said he’d thought about returning to therapy to work on things and asked me to give him some time. I agreed, but he’s not forthcoming if/when his appointments are or what he’s working on – which I understand I have no right to know. He’s allowed to keep his therapy private if that’s what’s best for his therapeutic journey. But, I wish I had some insight to know my waiting will be worthwhile.

I don’t question his struggles, but I’m having a hard time believing he’s not just stalling. He’s expressed some reservations about me, mainly that I’m not social enough, especially with his family. I’m a super introvert, but I’ve really tried with his family. I once expressed a worry that his family mistook my shyness for disinterest, but he assured me they understood and liked me, so I don’t know what the problem is.

My other doubt is that he talks about doing things and often doesn’t follow through. Like, he’s been saying he was going to take me on a weekend trip since the first year together, but he’s never done it. During the same time he’s planned and gone on four trips with friends and family. I don’t doubt that he would enjoy a trip with me, he just doesn’t care enough to actually plan it.

Recently, we went to his friend’s wedding, and another of his friends asked if we’re getting engaged, and my BF again said soon. I just don’t believe it anymore. I don’t doubt his love for me. We do a lot of stuff together and he’s physically affectionate. But I can’t ignore this feeling he doesn’t want to marry me and never will. I don’t think he wants to break up, but he also doesn’t want to commit.

I get upset about this every other day and I’m just so tired. I’m nearing forty and just want to know he wants to be my life partner. I feel four years is plenty of time to know someone. I have been open and transparent about who I am and what I have to offer. I don’t know how much longer I can wait around for him to decide to commit.

Do I stick around and see if he ever proposes, or follow my gut and cut my losses?

TLDR: After four years BF has not proposed even after saying multiple times he was planning to. Explanations are weak and I'm questioning if he'll ever do it.

ANSWER: I think it's time you look for your own apartment and move out. He is just stringing you along. Just consider: there is no actual factual reason he can't propose to you - the only valid explanation is that he just doesn't want to. It's heartbreaking that he stole the four years from you that were vital if you wanted to have children - I really hope you don't, because that would make it so much sadder.

Anyway, he's telling you loud and clear that he is not going to marry you - time to accept that and move on. You will be much happier once you're free from his push/pull mindgames.

QUESTION: Fiancé (31M) threw me (29F) under the bus to our friends

My fiancé and I are thinking about going to this music festival in a few months. We’re planning for it now since tickets go on sale tomorrow. We both really want to go, but money is the issue. Not only are we planning our wedding, but we are going to be renovating soon. As well as I have some debt I keep trying to pay off. I can’t pay it off since things like this keep coming up and we don’t wanna miss out.

Anyways, today in our group chat with our 4 other best friends (who know about my money struggles and us needing to save) we were chatting about renting an RV vs tent camping and I mentioned that I wanted to do whatever was cheapest since we’re a little tight on cash right now. I also mentioned that if that wasn’t an issue, we would do the RV in a heartbeat and I wanted to compare costs. I will add; I’ve never been the friend to complain about costs. In fact, I’ve always been really down and that’s how I’ve found myself in some hot water with debt. I’m only being “stingy” because I haven’t been able to pay it off and we’re planning a wedding and such

My fiancé and I were texting separately about all of this and he even agreed with me- even stating this wasn’t even worth it, he’d rather go on a vacation, he doesn’t mind tent camping and we could bring all our own stuff etc. We ended up saying that we would chat more about it later when he got home so we were on the same page. BTW the cost difference with tent camping vs RV would be 400-500$ total.

Our group chat kept popping off about the RV and I sent a text saying “Fiancé and I are going to chat more about it tonight and get back to you guys”. My fiancé then messaged me separately saying “stop telling them about money problems, you’re making us sound poor”. I apologized and said I wouldn’t mention it again. He then proceeds to text in our group chat saying “oh yeah by the way we’re for sure doing the RV, that makes the most sense” and just completely threw me under the bus.

I got super pissed at him because wtf we literally were just chatting about it and he acted like he would have my back. I totally felt like I was the bad guy/the only one not 100% about the RV. It especially sucked because everyone else is like “what why wouldn’t we do the RV?” And are all gung ho about it. He told me that he didn’t want our girl best friend thinking we didn’t want to do it and he sensed she was upset we were on the fence about the RV so he said that… I literally was like so you’re putting her potential feelings over my feelings? I am the one struggling to pay off my debt and trying to be smart.

I’m so annoyed and frustrated with him. How do I approach this with him?

Tl;dr my fiancé threw me under the bus with our friends

ANSWER: The way he talks to you is problematic. He can convey his thoughts and feelings without cussing at you.

QUESTION: How can you really start to accept that people won't change? (Relationship with ADHD)

The relationship between me (28F) and my boyfriend (31M) is pretty decent overall. Our communication is good for the most part, we can be very honest with each other, we respect each other and act usually very supportive of the other. We've been together for 5 years now.

One thing I cannot get behind though is the fact that he has some traits and qualities I cannot change and which will, very likely, never change. Most of our arguments are about the same topics. Often times it's about his lacking degree of emotional regulation towards inconveniences or stress in general. He frequently uses me as an 'emotional dumpster' when he wants to vent about the world and whatever happened to him that upset him (note: not all of these things are really overblown and unreasonable as my wording might make it seem). Recently this happens a lot more frequently and it's exhausting.

He's already in therapy because of depression and ADHD (already medicated). I know that emotional regulation is especially hard for people with ADHD and this is what makes this so incredibly frustrating. I'm at a point where I don't wanna hear about all these same things anymore that bother him. He's just venting about it at me, not changing anything (e.g. talk to the person at work that actually upset him) or trying to work with his emotions to not always react this hard (which again, might not even be possible). To add some extra salt to the wound: He formed a new friendship with another person at work which is all fun and giggles all the time. So basically, he comes home, tells me how much fun he's had with this person and what cool stuff they've been doing this day, and then starts to vent. It feels like I'm being served all the negativity he's built up over the day, and this person is experiencing all the fluffy joy he has to offer instead (he's a very fun and goofy guy when he's not venting and marinating in his own misery). Yes, it's honestly the first time in perhaps 10+ years I felt some sort of jealousy.

I've voiced my wish for not being used as his private therapist all the time many, maaany times. He always apologizes and wants to better himself. Never does. We also get into other discussions about the same stuff over and over again, too. Also mostly related to his ADHD (cleaning, putting some effort into planning special days like anniversaries). In general, he's apologizing all the time and I believe him but at this point I can almost predict the words that come out of his mouth every time we're having this conversation.

A part of me feels like 'well, it's the ADHD, suck it up. If you like him, YOU have to find a way to deal with all this, not the other way round'. Another part, that has a lot of old childhood trauma mixed into this emotional response, screams at me that I cannot accept my boundaries not being heard. I don't want to go into details of my backstory, let's just summarize that I've had my fair share of therapy to work through this independently. I feel stable and pretty safe in that regard. But these two backgrounds—one person with ADHD, one with former PTSD—feel like a nightmare to mix.

Is anyone out there, perhaps with the same combination in their relationship, who can perhaps offer some advice? How can I not get triggered by making the experience of 'nothing will ever change, just swallow your anger and adjust your needs' over and over? It goes heavily against what I learned back then in therapy. All of this is really sucking the light out of our relationship. The fun times get less and less, all this 'drama' is leaving me so exhausted and depressed. One part of me is slowly giving up, since it all seems so hopeless to me. Please, offer some advice.

TL;DR: ADHD boyfriend (in therapy & medicated) constantly uses me as emotional dumpster + we have the same arguments over and over to no avail. Therefore getting depressed myself since I feel like I just cannot expect any change at all + this heavily triggers some of my former trauma memories of helplessness.

Edit: Adjusted TL;DR

ANSWER: By ending the relationship. I have severe ADHD and it's my job to manage/regulate my emotions and symptoms. I don't get a pass to shit on people who love me.

QUESTION: I (26F) need a reality check before I move cross country with my ex (29F).

Five years ago, I was married to a man while discovering my queer identity. He was supportive simply because he was a horny man and loved to imagine it, and encouraged me to explore. That is when I met Zoe through a queer dating app.

During the pandemic, our connection developed quickly and deeply. We had virtual cooking nights, painted together, planned creative dates, and all from opposite coasts. By the end of the year, we each separated our partners as we each wanted to do for years, and she moved across the country to be with me. For a week, it was magic. Then reality hit.

Despite sharing important values and perspectives, we were wildly different: our personalities, family dynamics, and ways of handling conflict clashed hard. I was going through a divorce and struggling in a conservative town where neither of us felt safe. Fights turned volatile, once even physical as she hit my throat when she was triggered as she thought I called her stupid during an argument. After nine chaotic months, we moved apart but kept talking.

Over the next couple of years, we tried to heal. Therapy helped me and she turned to secretive spiritual communities and meditation programs. That secrecy, along with our fundamental differences, always left me feeling confused, awkward, and divided (granted, I often feel that way as a person anyway).

In recent months, she asked me to be her girlfriend again. Things were calm and steady, though not romantic. No hand holding, no cuddling, separate rooms, but an awkward “dance” through our individual routines near each other each day. We’ve become great friends and roommates, sharing our lives but without intimacy. Still, I hoped our peace meant progress — and I was content as we had a great balance at home, and we each lived as our holistic, sober, celibate selves comfortably around one another.

Then, when prompted as I was in desperate need for clarity, she told me the truth: she doesn’t want a romantic partnership with me. She cares deeply, but she feels fear and sadness for me: for my small support system, my sensitivity as autistic person, my autoimmune conditions, and how we’ve impacted each other over time. It hurt, but I finally had clarity.

Now we are supposed to move to her hometown this spring, as we’ve planned for over a year, to care for her family that needs consistent care. On paper, it makes sense. We coexist well as friends and co-parents to our cats. But part of me knows I’d end up feeling alone and resentful while she’s surrounded by family.

I could instead move back to my home coast to be closer to the few family members I’m close with. It would mean living alone for the first time in my adulthood, which terrifies and excites me in equal measure. It feels like a real beginning. It feels like I finally would be able to be in my own orbit rather than someone else’s.

I think I already know the answer, but I can’t help second-guessing myself:

Would it be foolish or selfish to choose independence and move on my own instead of following her to support her, and care for her family?

—

TL;DR: My partner of five years and I planned to move to her hometown across the country to care for her family in the spring. She let me know that she is not interested in me romantically, but wants to remain as the good friends we are. Do I make the move I promised to make or move for myself for the first time in my adulthood?

ANSWER: > It feels like a real beginning. It feels like I finally would be able to be in my own orbit rather than someone else’s.

This sounds like an opportunity too good to pass up.

QUESTION: My fiance (M29) always eats things I leave for myself (F26)/or takes all of the food snacks

My partner and I have been fighting over food lately (or I've been fighting with him). He is always asking if im gonna finish what's on my plate as I'm eating. Or Ill buy snacks and they're all gone before I can have any. Or last week I had wings for lunch and didn't finish them, he just ate them before I got home from work and didn't feel bad at all.

It's frustrating. I tried to bring it up today and he tells me I must have a problem with food because it's weird that I'm upset about it and I shouldn't be upset about wings from a week ago. But I'm obviously not upset about that specific thing. I feel like for me, its just like he doesn't respect my boundary which is why I'm upset.

This feels like a stupid thing to fight over but I just can't stand that I food I want goes missing because I didn't tell him directly "don't eat my leftovers" or "hey save me some caramel bites because I'm gonna want some".

How do I fix this? I don't want to fight with my partner about food. But now he's in our bedroom and told me to leave him alone. Ugh.

TLDR - Fiance eats food I want to save for later every time or snacks in hoping to eat and told me I have a food problem because I'm upset about it.

ANSWER: It's not a stupid thing to fight over. You were looking forward to your little treats and he took them from you with zero consideration for your feelings. Partners shouldn't do that to one another.

Talk to him and tell him clearly: my leftovers are off limits to you unless I say you can eat it. You can share my snacks but it's rude to eat an entire bag of something I bought for myself and not immediately replace it. If he had a non romantic roommate he wouldn't be eating all their food without asking; it's the same thing here.

QUESTION: Is my (34F) husband’s (35m) terrible spending habits a deal breaker or is this salvageable?

My husband and I have been together 10+ years, married for 6, and recently I gave birth to our 2 month old baby. When I was pregnant I discovered that he accrued credit card debt among other things. His debt and loans amounted to $40k, he also spent $6k on a road bike and a mountain bike, spent unknown thousands on collectable cards (Pokémon, baseball), and had no personal savings. He makes great money ($150k+) so it’s extra shocking that he spent so much money to not have savings and end up with debt. He also hid it all from me because he was trying to fix it on his own without me finding out. In the past he also gambled some unknown amount and has also lost $14k by investing all his savings in one company’s stock. We had many fights about this and he has expressed remorse and that he is turning a new leaf. We cancelled all his credit cards and are gradually paying off the debt. Is this a deal breaker? Or is this relationship salvageable?

Here are some additional pros and cons for context: 
Pros:
- we generally enjoy spending time together 
- he contributes and is involved with the family and household 
- he is a good father

Cons: 
- bad with money 
- no physical intimacy 
- no sexual chemistry

Tldr- my husband is bad with money and hid his debt from me but said he has changed. Is this relationship salvageable or would most people walk?

ANSWER: Apart from the “list” of pro’s and con’s you failed to mention that you clearly have lost respect for him. Add to that the missing intimacy and missing chemistry - your frustration levels are only going to increase while your tolerance levels for putting up with “bad stuff” will only decrease. Once those lines intersect downwards you’ve crossed a threshold. You might already be there given your post. Even if you salvage his spending (and thats a big iff) how can you salvage no chemistry and a lack of intimacy???  This has “doom” written all over it. Ugh.

QUESTION: I (22M) have a very complicated relationship with my (24F) best friend

I've been pretty much best friends with a girl for over 5 years, and there has always been chemistry and tension between us. We tried dating once but she backed out because of her own stated commitment issues and life circumstances.

I'm the closest thing she's ever had to a boyfriend and the only guy to ever even take her on a date which is crazy because shes very traditionally attractive and could have any guy.

We hang out 1-on-1 constantly, travel to motor races together, stay in hotels, and have slept in the same bed platonically many times. She tells me I'm very attractive and a great guy, is very flirty with me, we know everything about each other, her friends and family even say we should date, and when anyone has asked her for reasons why she wouldn't, she said she couldn't think of one.

She even made a marriage pact with me (her idea) and wants to come to my work Christmas party saying we could joke that we aren't "dating" but getting married in 8 years. She once called me while drunk and said I'm the only guy she's ever felt really cared about her and that I might be the only guy she's actually loved. But whenever I talk to or date other girls, she acts like she doesn't care and just says she knows I'll "find someone," which hurts because I want it to be her.

The worst part is that she completely deflects and shuts down any time I try to have a serious talk about us. We're also core members of our friend group so I'm scared of ruining things - but the limbo is draining me. How would you recommend I approach this?

TL;DR there's clearly romantic tension between me and my best friend but she shuts down whenever I bring it up. How do I approach this?

ANSWER: Well, since she doesn't want to talk about it, it's time to stop flirting and acting like her BF. She doesn't get GF treatment if she doesn't want to be your GF.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My [24] boyfriend [25] of 3 and 1/2 years hasnt proposed and I'm starting to worry. I just want that promise.

The original link is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/50ihkx/my_24_boyfriend_25_of_3_and_12_years_hasnt/?utm_source=reddit-android)

I wanted to give an update on this post I wrote about 2 years ago. I got some great advice, I got a lot of tough love advice and some terrible advice. I know he was already committed by all of his actions and that I really needed to focus on college first before having to plan a wedding.

Well, it turned out my boyfriend at the time had been planning on proposing to me for a long time. He wanted to wait until I graduated college. A little after I graduated college, he took me on a hike. I knew this was a special hike because it was the same place we went for one of our earlier dates.

The first time we went on that date was magical. I always teased him that he never kissed me on the date. There was this perfect moment he was holding me in front of a beautiful picturesque lake as we were just enjoying each other's company in an embrace. I thought he was going to kiss me but he didn't.

I later kissed him first but always teased him that he didn't kiss me in that moment we had. He confessed he wasn't sure if I wanted to be kissed. He said he wanted to kiss me more than anything.

Well he took me back on the hike 4 years later, and when we got to that lake, he told me this is when he knew he was first in love with me. Then he got on one knee and proposed to me. I just kissed him and even forgot to say yes! So he asked, "Are you going to marry me or not?" And I said of course. We got married about a year later and we just celebrated our one year anniversary in October.

I've never been happier and I'm so excited to continue our life together!

Thank you for reading 😁

Edit: Grammar on TL DR

Edit: Wow! I did not expect this post to blow up like it did! Thank you all for the incredibly kind words. I'm sorry I can't respond to everyone but thank you. I'm glad I could brighten so many people's day! You all brightened mine :)

TL;DR UPDATE: My [24] boyfriend [25] of 3 and 1/2 years hadn't proposed and I was starting to worry. This is a two year update that my boyfriend at the time was planning on proposing all along. We have now been married for one year. I am so happy everything worked out the way it did.

ANSWER: When you said "my boyfriend at the time" my heart dropped. Great update and super glad you got it together and relaxed into your love and relationship!

QUESTION: Update: My(M26) wife(F26) is not happy

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hm1wdi/mym26_wifef26_isnt_happy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Thank you everyone for the advice from the original post. I just wanted to give the community an update. My wife finally got back yesterday from leaving to go see her sister. We talked for a little bit yesterday, but still came to the same thing she has been telling me. She doesn’t want to be with me because she doesn’t feel in love, emotionally connected, or intimate towards me. She views me as a friend. I told her she needed to choose either we work on this and go to counseling or it’s a divorce and we cut ties. She couldn’t decide and said to give her the weekend.

This morning I woke up early, made her breakfast and brought it to her in bed. Then took her out to eat for lunch and desert trying to just spark anything to see if she would agree to work on it. Well we sat down again after getting back and she said she wanted a divorce and she was 100% on that.

It was tough. A lot of crying, sadness, hurt, and all the emotions one would feel. I ended up just going to my room and she left for the night. I decided to get out and do something so I jogged and listed to some music for a bit. It helped.

I came to the realization that we all have such little time on earth and I don’t want to waste it moping around. I want to improve myself physically, emotionally, and mentally. I want to just enjoy life and find myself again. So I’m going to do that and one day I might meet someone who is perfect to continue the journey of life with me.

So I’m still sad and hurt, but all that to say I’m moving forward and trying to be positive. Thank you all for your support.

tl;dr Wife wants a divorce. I’m trying to stay positive and move one.

ANSWER: The end of a relationship is hard but it’s also such a great opportunity for growth, self compassion, and fun. The initial part of the separation is hard but just know that you will be okay, slowly things will get better. 
You’re still so young, you’re going to find someone that’s a better match for you. Just give yourself time to grieve and take care of yourself. When my bf and I broke up I listened to “Breakup Recover Podcast” by Barbara Stevens, she’s so calming and has a way of making you feel cared for and safe. There were days where I felt like shit but I would force myself to listen to it and I never regretted it. 
Hope you find happiness within yourself soon!

QUESTION: My(24f) dad (56m) committed suicide about 2 weeks ago and Im having a hard time grieving and being in school. I don't want to drop out. (UPDATE)

Hi everyone, my last post wasnt super popular or anything but I just thought I'd update you guys anyways!

About a month ago, I went back to school a week after my dad died, and obviously the last few weeks have been super hard. It took me awhile but I ended up getting back on my feet, ultimately school has become one of my biggest outlets as far as keeping myself busy goes. I ended up passing all my classes with all A's and B's and I'm on track to graduate this fall.

Thank you to everyone who believed in me and encouraged me to keep going. Its people like you that really helped me get through one of the hardest chapters of my life..

Life can be really fucking hard, so sometimes you just have to take the small victories where you can.

EDIT Wow never in a million years would I expect my post to blow up this much. I dont really know what else to say other than thank you. I try and find little signs from my dad and today I think it's all you guys, rootin for me. ❤️

ANSWER: I didn’t actually see your initial post but this struck a cord with me as my dad committed suicide last month and I too now have choices to make about school. I’m so sorry for your loss but well fucking done with those results! 💗 as the Kris Jenner meme says you’re doing amazing sweety

QUESTION: UPDATE : I (46F) have hurt my daughter (16F) by giving her friend(16F) a few books

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n7jcfj/i_46f_have_hurt_my_daughter_16f_by_giving_her/)  
I found the perspectives and guidance I received really helpful. I decided to just spend some time with her. She loves to bake and we baked together and we had some movie nights. her comments melted away and she became happier.

we were baking yesterday when she came out to me. I didn't make a big deal out of as I felt she didn't want me to. I just told her I loved her before continuing to bake as if nothing happened. We did have a conversation later on.

She told me that she and her friend had been together ( scary, how well kids can hide things.) Her girlfriend wanted to come out but she didn't and it had strained their relationship. It seems, they had a fight before we gave her the books to her (ex?) girlfriend and that had hurt her. Their relationship is in the limbo and she doesn't want to come out to the world right now. My husband ordered a small pride flag to keep in her room. The world is a bit crazy right now and we want her to have a space where she can be herself.

TL;DR : My daughter came out to me, her friend was actually her girlfriend and they had a fight.

ANSWER: I wish I had you as my mother. No I'm not gay but to take the time to learn from others on how to take care of your daughter lovingly is a really good trait and she is lucky that instead of you responding back in kind or from a place of negativity, you are responding with love.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I [26f] opened my husband's [32m] snapchat and it was a very explicit picture and caption from a girl. He's sitting not 20 feet from me & I don't know how to handle this.

Link to original post: https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4z9cgn/i_26f_opened_my_husbands_32m_snapchat_and_it_was/?ref=search_posts

Again, I am overwhelmed by the support and love I've received from everyone. It feels great to be comforted and cheered on by you all. Thank you so much.

So, husband cheated. He has been since "maybe two weeks before last Christmas", according to him.

I was very calm when confronting him and took the advice many of you gave me by telling him that he needs to explain to me who Roxy is and why she is his "best friend" on Snapchat. His face gave him away immediately but he still tried to lie to me at first.

He said that she works with his friend and they met when his friend invited her out to lunch with the two of them. At first, he claimed he only met her about two months ago. He said that they're "best friends" because he doesn't receive many snapchats from others and she is extremely active on the app. He said she just sends randoms and is really into fitness, so she sends a lot of "inspirational" snaps on being healthy and living a better life. He said that every once in a while, he'll send her something back, like a picture of a cheeseburger or something just to tease her about her level of health-consciousness.

First, I asked why he didn't just tell me about her. He said he didn't even think about it because she's just an acquaintance, not even a friend. Then I asked if he'd ever received anything even remotely inappropriate from her.

He answered with, "Not on purpose". I'm assuming he went with that because he knew I opened that snapchat and he probably knew it was a bad one.

I asked what "Not on purpose" means. He got very defensive. Started raising his voice and saying he doesn't need to explain what that means, that sometimes people accidentally send the wrong snapchats to the wrong people. Then he had the nerve to say something along the lines of, "I feel like I'm on trial here. People warned me that you'd get crazy when you're pregnant but I never thought it'd be this bad."

Now. As some of you mentioned in my last post, it seems amazing that I'm able to keep such a level-head. That is because I was raised by a mother who always told me that you never accomplish anything with anger. That you can be emotional, passionate, upset, etc. without ever raising your voice. Messages received quietly and concisely are just as loud and clear as messages received through yelling and screaming. That is how I have lived my life for 26 years, with the exception of just a few blow ups (I am human).

This moment was an exception. I didn't exactly yell and scream, but I became furious. For him to try to blame this on me being pregnant? How unoriginal and offensive. Long story short, he said he'd never seen me this crazy and I told him that I'd never seen a picture of another girl's pussy on my husband's snapchat before. He came back with that I shouldn't have looked at his snapchat. I came back with that it was an accident but even if it hadn't been, there shouldn't be any reason he's receiving snapchats like that for me to see- accidentally or not- in the first place. I told him that I may be pregnant but I'm also an intelligent person and I am his wife, so I knew he was lying and I deserved to know the truth. I asked if I could see his text messages to see if he's been texting Roxy. He said sure. No messages. Then I asked to see his Facebook messages. He looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He told me no. I asked why.

He finally broke and started to cry. Told me he couldn't let me see the messages because they would hurt me. Because they were inappropriate.

Then it all came out. They screwed in the backseat of her car the first night they met.

This is already long so I'll spare you all the details. But it's been an ongoing affair for months. No, they did not always use protection. Although I was recently screened for STIs, I'll be getting checked again in light of this information.

My uncle already assured me that if he was unfaithful, we would cream him in court. Really the only thing I'm willing to fight him tooth & nail for is our home; I put a lot of effort and money into making this home my dream space. I won't be seeking spousal support but I will seek child support.

I'm obviously heartbroken and told him to go stay in a hotel or with Roxy for all I cared (I confronted him last night). My mom & sister stayed with me last night and let me sob all over them for hours. Right now I'm sort of numb but I'm also thinking very clearly. I know what my next 10 moves are and I feel supported and secure in my decision to leave him and keep my baby.

A few things I just wanted to clarify: My husband is not a lawyer; his good friend is. There was some concern for my success in court if my husband is a lawyer. His friend is in environmental law so, while I'm sure he can provide some advice, he will not be my husband's divorce lawyer.

There were suggestions of me terminating my pregnancy. I fully support the right to choose and I would probably terminate the pregnancy if I was in a different financial position and lacked a support system. However, I work as a marketing manager for a large company. Not only does this allow me the privilege of working from home about 50% of the time, but it also grants me financial independence. I do not rely on my husband for money and I really never have. He works in tech so, while he makes a good salary, I will have no need for spousal support. I have a phenomenal support system; this baby will be loved so dearly by so many. Yes, I will have to deal with my husband for the rest of my life if I have this child and it will make future relationships for me more difficult, but it is worth it. I've wanted this baby since day one and I am her mother, which means that I am strong enough to raise her alone because I have to be strong enough.

Here's to hoping for a speedy divorce. I'm ready to be done with this marriage. Which is crazy because just a few days ago I thought my life was as close to perfect as you could get.

tl;dr Husband admitted to an affair. I will be proceeding with a divorce and will keep our baby. I'm numb but calm and feeling good about my decisions and how I handled the situation. I know there is a long road ahead of me and this will all probably really hit me soon. When it does, I'll mourn and grieve the end of what I had thought was a happy union. Right now I'm in self-preservation mode and much more focused on how to come out of this in the best position possible. Thank you so much for all the advice and support, Reddit!

Edit: Formatting

UPDATE: I know it has been only a short time since I posted this update but I need to tell you all how amazing all of you are. Wow, this much support is just... wow. I wish I could reply to all of your comments and messages but because of the volume, I'm just going to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to each and every one of you who read my posts, who commented, thought of me, wished my baby & me the best, messaged me, and anything else. I am currently at my parent's condo, sitting outside at their pool, sunbathing my little baby bump and reading each and every one of your amazing and empowering comments. I just want you all to have that image; that you have made me happy and content in a time when I am short on both. This is proof that love does exist, even if it doesn't within my, now over, relationship. And that is a powerful thing.

Love to you all.

Me again: I was going to post more details on what happened during the confrontation with my husband, etc., but then I decided against it. I should keep some details private; it's likely my husband has seen this post.

I will leave you with this:

My dad and I were up late talking last night and, as usual, he had the perfect thing to say to me. He told me that weak people are afraid of strong people. He told me to keep on terrifying the weak ones. That way, the only people who won't fear you are the bravest, strongest of people and those are the people who are worthy of you.

Then he said my husband is a spineless turd who couldn't kick it with the strongest woman in the world.

Just thought I'd leave you with that and encourage everyone to "be terrifying" by being strong and not standing for nonsense.

This is the last I will post on the matter. I have a lot ahead of me with everything and will probably go quiet on Reddit for a while. Time to get ready for court and to "be terrifying". :)

Thank you, thank you, thank you again. Love to all of you and best wishes.

Love,

ANSWER: I've been thinking of you since I saw the original post a few days ago. It broke my heart to hear this, you deserve a thousand times better than a man like him.
You've handled the entire thing with utter grace by the sounds of things, I for one could not keep my cool especially if I had pregnancy hormones whizzing around my body. I am flawed by your measured response and strength to leave someone who quite clearly doesn't deserve you. That is true strength. Your child is lucky to have such a strong mother and role model. All the best for the future, you deserve happiness x

QUESTION: [UPDATE] Me [31F] with my husband [35 M] married 2 years together for 10. He doesn't want his kids to be like me.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2i34pr/me_31_f_with_my_husband_35_m_married_2_years/

It took me 3 more years, but I finally left him last year.

This post helped me see how much was wrong in our relationship, but I was still so hesitant to leave.

We had pets and a beautiful home together and I loved his family and we had so many inside jokes and plans for the future.

But eventually it was all just too much for me to take any longer. The day after his parents' 50th anniversary party, I told him I wanted a divorce. I just couldn't see myself living like that for 50 years.

I moved from the suburbs to the city with a friend. I rekindled some old friendships from high school and made a bunch of new friends who I am so thankful for. He kept the dog, I took the cats.

I thought my life was ending but it was just beginning.

I told my (very religious) family and they were all understanding and supportive. I've maintained friendships with a good number of our mutual friends, friendships I was worried about losing.

I'm working on my masters degree and volunteering and experiencing life and love and art and beauty like I never thought was possible.

I met a guy at a friend's punk rock show and we hit it off, but we are taking things very slowly. He is wonderful and so kind to me.

If you are in an abusive relationship, please don't be afraid to leave.

It gets so much better. I still miss him from time to time. I feel guilty about getting divorced, guilty for wasting my parents money on a failed marriage. I miss his parents. I miss my dog.

But I am SO MUCH happier. My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.

Thank you so much to everyone who offered advice and sympathized and even had harsh words for me deciding to stay.

tl;dr: Left my abusive husband. Life is much better.

EDIT: for those saying it didn’t sound that bad or abusive, you should know it got worse. It did escalate to physical abuse, us sleeping separately/no intimacy for a year.

If you think you are too old or too much trouble or have too much baggage or are too much anything, please believe that it is possible to find love again. Both loving yourself and having someone else love you 💕

ANSWER: >My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.

Yes! I remember reading once that what human beings are scared of most is uncertainty. So in a way, staying with your abusive husband -- while awful and full of emotional abuse -- was the safe option because you knew what you were in for. Leaving him was an act of bravery and I hope your future is full of warmth and love.

QUESTION: [Update]I [30f] want to discuss moving in with boyfriend [34m] but we have a significant difference in income.

OP:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i\_30f\_want\_to\_discuss\_moving\_in\_with\_boyfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i_30f_want_to_discuss_moving_in_with_boyfriend/)

Thanks for all the advice, I ended up broaching the topic last week.

As mentioned in the first post both my boyfriend and I have been hinting around the topic but hadn't directly discussed it. I was still on the fence about bringing it up myself when my boyfriend made a comment about how he's excited for us to live together (one day). I just responded with, "Well did you want to? My lease is up in July." and he said that he did.

It was before work when it happened so we left it at that for the day and got together that evening to work out details. I expressed to him at that point that while I would love living with him that my concern was that I wouldn't be able to contribute equally and I didn't want him feeling taken advantage of. He in turn expressed that he'd never want to put me in a bad position financially and that we could easily figure out something that would be fair while still putting me in a better financial position.

We ended up deciding we'd go with a lump sum monthly that I'll pay to him to cover all the costs, rather than splitting bills. The monthly amount he offered at first I actually upped because I didn't think he was being fair to himself, and it was still less than what I pay now. He seemed happy with that and it definitely works for me!

He keeps mentioning how excited he is to move in together, and came to my apartment last week to help me clean for photos to show it! We're deciding together what we'll keep out of my furniture vs. his, what we'll get rid of and what we're going to store. He's also mentioned a couple renovations he wants to get done around the condo so we're going to go together to pick stuff out and make it a summer project. :)

TL;DR: Boyfriend gave me an opening to ask about moving in so I seized it. All went well and we'll be moving in together in June!

Edit: Wow... this really blew up! Thanks to everyone for the super kind words. To address the most common comment here; we did discuss splitting proportionally but ultimately decided to go with a lump sum. I definitely see benefits to proportional splitting but for where we are right now and my financial situation I prefer a lump sum. It's still significantly less than what I'm paying now, and it wont fluctuate as the weather changes so I can count on what I owe monthly not changing.

Many people have mentioned chores as well. My boyfriend and I tend to do chores together. I mean right now with two separate places we each have our things that are more our responsibility but when I've stayed with him for a stretch of time we've just balanced together. He doesn't know how to cook but wants to learn so we cook meals together and then clean up together. We will each have our own washroom at his place (I've already taken over the main washroom and he uses the en suite). He volunteers at a local animal shelter once a week so those days I clean and cook if I'm around. But generally speaking we just treat doing chores as an opportunity to spend time together and be productive. :)

ANSWER: Aw, this is adorable! You guys sound like you communicate well and really care for each other, good luck!

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (30F) caught my husband (31M) in an affair and I don’t know how to move forward.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i7wkqu/i_30f_caught_my_husband_31m_in_an_affair_and_i/

First of all, I just want to thank everyone here for the support I received following my first post back in August. At the time, it truly felt like my world was ending. It was important to me to make this update because I need to tell anyone who’s currently going through the same thing—IT GETS BETTER. You will get so much better.

I had one conversation with my husband since everything happened—by his choice. It lasted maybe five minutes and was like talking to a robot. I know from others that he cries to people about how he ruined his life, but I have never once gotten an apology or the same show of regret. At this point, I don’t care. I know him and the other woman are still seeing each other and frankly, they deserve each other. Good for them.

While I still feel angry occasionally, I no longer mourn what I once had. Instead, I’m so excited for the life I now get to live. I moved to a small walkable city and gave myself my dream apartment. It makes me so happy to see how I’ve decorated it and to just live in a cozy place instead of our old dreary house.  I was the breadwinner in our marriage, and he would make me feel awful about wanting to pay for nice meals or do fun things. Since moving here, I’ve done a ton of foodie fun stuff and don’t feel guilty. It’s so refreshing.

I have dipped my toe into the dating pool again and had plenty of mediocre dates from dating apps. Recently, I found someone who I’ve really clicked with and am enjoying how appreciated and desired he’s made me feel.  It’s definitely early and we’re moving slow, but overall, dating has made me realize that I’m a catch who doesn’t have to settle.

Therapy has done wonders and I’m so happy I immediately dove into it. My therapist is proud of me. I’m proud of me. I’ve stopped looking at being divorced as a failure. He failed—not me. I’m genuinely happy and excited to wake up each morning and no longer feel like this terrible weight is sitting on my chest. The holidays were surprisingly easy and I found myself so happy to spend time with my family without having to compromise anything.

So all in all, life is good and there’s so much of it ahead. Looking back, I can’t believe I wasted so much time thinking about how I could get him to come home. I’ve made my own home and my own happiness and that is worth so so much more.

TLDR; Husband left me for another woman. He sucks, but things get better.

ANSWER: Thank you. I forgot to mention above, but I also got a new job offer and am happily busy with fulfilling work again as well!

QUESTION: Update to the pettiest question ever

Update to this petty thing: [https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3hi08p/stupidest\_question\_ever\_is\_there\_any\_polite\_way/](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3hi08p/stupidest_question_ever_is_there_any_polite_way/)

It  took 5 years and a marriage and he curled his eyelashes last week. He found my eyelash curler and asked what it was for and I told him how to test it on himself. He said he didn't notice any difference but his eyes sparkled for the first time.

He's not going to keep doing it but at least I know what his pupils look like now lol

TL;DR: I didn't ask him, he asked me.

ANSWER: Thank god, I've been on the edge of my seat for the last 5 years. Glad you guys got married and things are OK.

Give us another update in 5 years when you've got a house and a couple kids?

QUESTION: [UPDATE] I'm [28F] unsure if it's time to draw boundaries with my boyfriend [28M] and his coworker [late 20sF] who he got close to very quickly

Original post is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9cx874/im\_28f\_unsure\_if\_its\_time\_to\_draw\_boundaries\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9cx874/im_28f_unsure_if_its_time_to_draw_boundaries_with/)

TLDR of original: My boyfriend has become fast friends with a female coworker. She and her fiancé are now moving into our apartment building, and my boyfriend is seeing and talking to her more and more. I don't know if it's time to set boundaries or if I'm getting ahead of myself.

&#x200B;

A lot has happened since my last post, and I got some good advice there, so I wanted to post an update!

After I made the last post I came home from the trip with my family a couple of days later. I told my boyfriend that I wanted to talk to him about something and I brought up his friendship with Liz. I basically brought up all of my concerns from the post. I told him that I didn't want to discourage him from having a friend, but I also felt like they were talking quite a lot and spending a lot of time together, and that it was starting to make me feel uncomfortable.

My boyfriend took it really well! He immediately reassured me that he only saw her as a friend, and that he hadn't even realized how it could look to me. When I brought up how I felt like he wasn't being forthcoming with information (like how he didn't mention the phone call from her), he said that was 100% unintentional. He then immediately asked what he could do going forward to make me feel more comfortable. He offered to stop carpooling with her and to cut down on contact with her except for work-related stuff. I told him I didn't have a problem with the carpooling because financially it does make sense (he spends a lot of money on gas), but maybe he could try to text and call her outside of work a little bit less. I also told him I would really love to meet her and her fiance, and he enthusiastically agreed.

He set up a hang out for the following weekend - the two of us and Liz and her fiance all went out for drinks at a bar by our building (they'e moved in by now). It was actually really fun! It turns out we all have a ton in common. Liz and I do very similar work, and we all have common nerdy interests. It was a little awkward at first as meeting new people often is, but once we all got comfortable we had a blast. From there, we have all become fast friends, and Liz and I have developed our own separate friendship too. We text often, go over to each other's places for dinner sometimes, and hang out on weekends. I can honestly say I really like Liz (and her fiance) as a person and trust her 100%. I no longer have a problem with her friendship with my boyfriend at all. They do still carpool sometimes, but they've never hung out alone outside of work - it's always the four of us. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Finally, I have a separate - but slightly related - update: my boyfriend is now my FIANCE! Less than a month after I made my last post, he took me out for a really beautiful and romantic dinner. When we came home, our apartment was covered in roses and candles. I was so shocked I could barely move as he got down on one knee and proposed. I said YES and then cried for about two hours as we called all of our friends and family. It was absolutely perfect and we are getting married next year!

It turns out that Liz actually helped him plan the proposal and that was part of why they were talking a lot too! Since she lives in our building now, he had all of the flowers, candles, champagne, and accessories shipped to her and kept at her place until he was ready for them. He even had her hold onto the ring the week before he did it. After he proposed she came upstairs and took photos for us and cried with us. That was the moment I realized what a great friend she is to both of us.

So communication saves the day again! We're all great friends now, and Liz and I have regular girls nights to plan our weddings together :)

TL;DR: I talked to my boyfriend and he introduced me to Liz and her fiance right away. We're all great friends now and I'm no longer uncomfortable - but I am engaged!

EDIT: Wow, wow, wow!!!! I know this is stereotypical, but I never expected my post to blow up like this. I started reading the comments last night and planned to reply to some but then I got busy, and then this just got out of control! So let me just say here, thank you all SO MUCH for the support, advice, and well-wishes! You guys rule 😭 And thank you for the platinum, gold, and silver?! I’ve never gotten any of that before and now I’m a little sad that this is a throwaway and not my main, haha. I’ll pay it forward and gild someone today :)

ANSWER: Awww this is the kinda stuff I’m here for! I’m so glad the situation was resolved healthily and congrats on the engagement! 🤗☺️

QUESTION: UPDATE: Me [36 M] married to my Wife [36 F] 11 years, and I can't stop thinking about a girl I dated for 1 month 16 years ago.

Original Post 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lqpshq/me_36_m_married_to_my_wife_36_f_11_years_and_i/

So I mentioned to my wife vaguely that I was having a bit of a midlife crisis and ruminating on my past a bit too much. That I miss how I was physically at my peak in college.

She said she is also having a bit of a crisis, worried about longterm health and missing the shape she was in before kids.

We made a commitment to each other to get into shape and have changed our eating habits and bought a treadmill. I have been working out daily and my rumination issues have really dwindled. We also planned a nice vacation, and a few get togethers with frends in the next few months.

---
tl;dr: Told wife I was having a crisis without much detail. We are making strides to better ourselves and each other.

ANSWER: That’s a great update. I can promise you that the one month relationship would have never worked out, because it didn’t. And how it ended suggests that it never had staying power.

I hope that getting into shape helps you both. I think the pandemic also makes relationships tough because you’re likely no longer getting out and doing the things that brought you together (or, simply having time apart and separate interests). At least that’s been the case with my marriage! I think that would make it tempting to fantasize about some other reality that “could have” been (but really, it could have never been).

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My (28F) colleague (30F) didn't invite me to her wedding, and it's completely unravelled our friendship

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bctq5b/my_28f_colleague_30f_didnt_invite_me_to_her/)

So it took me a few days to decide the best way to approach this, but yesterday I had lunch with her again and had the conversation.

I started by saying: "So you've sent all your invitations out now, haven't you?"

She looked immediately panicked by my question and I knew right away that she didn't want me to go down this road.

When she said she had sent them all, I asked if that meant she could show me her venue now.

She showed me the website of it, including the photo gallery, and talked me through all about where everything was going to happen, all the flowers and decorations she was going to add etc. It's a nice enough country hotel with some pretty gardens, but I'm not sure what all the secrecy was for.

I probed a little more, asking who she's invited from work (the list didn't include me), said I was looking forward to seeing the photos so I could see how everything looked (she didn't correct me that I would see it on the day) and then I was completely sure that my lack of invitation wasn't an accident. She looked so relieved when I switched subject and asked if she's excited about her honeymoon and having a rest from all the wedding stress.

So I'm definitely not invited. I thought it over carefully and I have decided not to ask why, for three reasons:

1) The reason is already fairly obvious. She clearly doesn't think we're anything more than colleagues and I've misread the situation. (There were some other theories suggested e.g. jealous husband-to-be, associating me with her past grief, but considering everything I know about her and our history I'm sure it's not that.) I'm not sure why she didn't cool it on the wedding talk with someone she had no intention of inviting, or even just bring it up with me and explain why I'm not invited, but never mind.  
2) Having an awkward relationship at work is the last thing I want. I'm worried that if I push this and turn it into an "issue" that I'll look pathetic and needy, or it will just be unprofessional. I also run the risk of her badmouthing me to colleagues and mutual friends, and I will find it much easier and less messy to handle my own feelings quietly.   
3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down.

And you know, I'm fine with not going. It was never really about getting invited to a wedding, it was more having to face the fact that I'd been naive and taken for granted, and I felt silly that I'd invested way too much in this relationship. That's not all on her, because she was never obligated to be my friend.

Talking it through on my previous post actually really helped me work through my feelings. When I went back to work on Monday I felt much calmer and more detached from it emotionally.

I have looked back on our whole relationship and honestly she's always been self involved, entitled and narcissistic. Being a bride has just made it more obvious, but it's always been there. She's also never given back to me (besides helping me get my job, which of course I'm grateful for), in that she's never been willing to talk me through any problems I've had, and although I help her happily with her work, she says no if I ask her for help in return.

She has a few office enemies and even though I saw her negative traits that caused her to be disliked by some people, I overlooked them and defended her anyway. Now I have put a little distance there it's quite apparent that she's not a very nice person, and I'm genuinely OK with just moving on.

She hasn't really noticed the distance between us so far (or she has noticed and doesn't care/is relieved that I'm giving her space), so I intend to just continue with doing that. If she eventually asks why, or I get the sense that she's trying to rekindle our friendship, then it will be time to clear the air with how I've been feeling. If she doesn't and we just continue drifting, then that's probably for the best.

It's sad to lose a friend, and it will probably take me some time to get over it and to become comfortable with the change in our relationship, but I have other genuine friendships, and plenty of colleagues who are lovely people who I can get to know better now.

The main thing I really took from my original post, and I'm so glad I did post because I needed some tough love on this, is that my fear of confrontation really needs dealing with.

If I can learn how to better speak my mind as things are happening, that will stop things from building and building until I have to have a Serious Conversation and it makes what should have been a molehill into a mountain.

I also need to figure out how to have difficult conversations without having an anxiety attack, which not only weakens my message but is extremely distressing and puts me off dealing with things and being honest with people.

I had a couple of books on assertiveness recommended to me, so I've bought them to start me off. I'm also looking into going to a coach, or maybe a couple of therapy sessions at least, to try and better myself. I don't want to hurt other people by doing this, so this has become top priority for me.

Thank you so much everyone who pointed that out to me. I was aware of it but I didn't think it was a problem and figured I'd just be that way all my life. Now I know better. Thank you for being so honest with me.

Also thank you to those who talked me through the one-sided friendship issue. I'm a good listener and have always attracted people who need to vent, but I only ever noticed the one-off conversations, and didn't think I was being taken advantage of as a long term listening ear.

I have been examining my other friendships in the last few days, to see if anyone else is using me in the same way, or if I've even been doing this to others and not had the self awareness to realise. There are a couple of changes I need to make, including a friendship that I need to set some boundaries in, and another one where I've not been giving back to the other person as much I should have. I have learned a really valuable lesson from this about maintaining healthy relationships, and I'm very grateful for that.

&#x200B;

TL;DR So I'm definitely not invited, our friendship is likely over (but that's actually OK) and I'm going to work on my assertiveness so I can handle things like this better next time. I'm also going to move forward having learned a good lesson about friendships being two-way.

Edit: A few people have been asking about the books I was recommended:
Nonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg
When I Say No I Feel Guilty by Manuel J Smith
Why Men Love Bitches by Sherry Argov

ANSWER: > 3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down.

Jesus christ kudos for having that kind of outlook on things.

QUESTION: update to: Husband and I are having our longest fight ever and I don't know what to do

link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/abayxw/husband\_and\_i\_are\_having\_our\_longest\_fight\_ever/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/abayxw/husband_and_i_are_having_our_longest_fight_ever/)

Soon after I made the post, my husband called me. He was babbling and I couldn't understand him, so I kept asking him to slow down. Then he started screaming (not yelling, literally just screaming). I freaked out because I thought he was being murdered or something. I tracked his phone to a park in town and called 911.

Turns out he had a complete mental breakdown. He's in the process of being diagnosed with a mental illness that usually shows up in people's 20s but for some reason manifested later in him. He's currently in an inpatient mental health program and already doing a lot better.

Thank you all again for the responses and advice on my original post.

&#x200B;

ANSWER: The onset of mental illness posts are the ones that I hate the most.

Often nobody is really at fault, but its likely the start of a long and difficult road for all involved.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (26F) want to propose to my boyfriend (25M) but just found out he plans to propose as well

Link to my original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/exp0i0/i_26f_want_to_propose_to_my_boyfriend_25m_but/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So yesterday he took me to run errands but he "randomly" decided to we should just have fun instead. He took me around the city, we tried all kinds of food, had honestly the most fun I've had since I was a kid, made memories off of little moments, I didn't think that much of it. I realized that the whole day had basically been an all day-date, I knew it had to be coming and I had the ring with me and I was going to try and propose at the same time (someone suggested this in my original post and I thought it would be cute)

He opened my door, walked me down a beautiful pathway and just looked me in the eyes and I said yes. He laughed and dropped down to one knee and I started crying and forgot that I was supposed to be proposing too. I don't even remember what he said, he was on his knee for a while saying what I'm sure were the sweetest things, but I was too busy crying. I'd already said yes before he even got down on one knee so he put the ring on my finger.

We went home and and I realized I didn't propose, he wanted to shower and we sometimes shower together so I proposed to him in there. He smiled and said “I wonder if when our first kid is born will it top this moment” then because I was on my knees in the shower he had to make a sex joke 😂

After we got out he held me while we called his parents (I'd already called my whole family in car ride home)

Yesterday was amazing and now I'm laying next to him while he plays video games and he's talking about our engagement to his friends and I couldn't be happier and I don't know how to contain all this and just ugh! I love you Nathan!❤️

Edit: Thank you to everyone congratulating us! I appreciate it very much 😊

TL;DR: He took me on a romantic all day date and popped the question. I was supposed to propose at the same time but was too busy crying form happiness, I proposed to him in the shower when we got home😂 I'm overjoyed right now!

ANSWER: I needed this positivity. This may sound weird coming from a random stranger, but I'm happy for you. Wish you all the best and your SO as well.

QUESTION: My (30F) husband (32M) impulse bought a dog. [update]

Update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cmu75w/my_30f_husband_32m_impulse_bought_a_dog/

Thank you all for the thorough responses. I read every comment you guys sent.

A few months ago I read a post where a woman sat down with her husband and outlined everything she takes care of at home in a list format. Like, kitchen: trash, dishes, wipe counters down. Etc. That way of communicating really stuck with me and when we went to see our therapist, I used the same format to express how much I do for the dog.

My husband told me that owning a dog was a joint effort and since I’m home all day it shouldn’t be a problem.

Which is when I realized that has been his excuse for everything. Cooking, chores, cleaning. I’m not sure how I became blind to it. I don’t know when I started bending over backwards to accommodate him.

We used to be a solid couple who helped each other out. I remember when I was still in school he’d come over to my apartment and clean the whole thing for me during finals. Or he took care of my elderly cat when I was away for a week and a half. He used to help me dry the dishes and it was always fun. We used to have so much fun and laugh all the time. At some point it all stopped.

I started crying right there in the middle of a sentence and he got concerned. I’m not a cryer the only time he’s ever seen me cry was when I had to put my beloved cat down a few years ago. But he held me for the first time in what felt like months and we had a serious heart to heart about how he made me feel. Not only with the dog but how stressed I’ve been with my job, how lonely I am, I don’t feel important and how we don’t feel like a team anymore, that I’m worried about us.

I guess it clicked for him because he really stepped up taking care of the dog. He started going into work earlier so he can come home early and hang out and make me dinner. It happened slowly over the course of the last few weeks and the routine suits us a lot better. We hired a trainer to make sure we can understand the dog’s boundaries together and the dog sleeps in a dog bed. Our bedroom life has slowly gotten back to where it was when we got married. We’re watching our favorite shows again and going out more. I’ve been putting my foot down more about my feelings and he has been receptive. We are still going to therapy for now.

As for the dog, we’re going to keep him. Is he a No List dog? Yes. But is he a good puppy with a big heart? Yes. We have the money to afford him and he took off after training. It’s nice having a dog again.

TL;DR: husband and I went to therapy, we talked through our problems, we are giving our marriage the time and attention it needs to mend. We’re keeping the dog.

ANSWER: Good job on the communication. Things can sneak up on people and unfair routines can creep in. I'm glad that you two seem to be correcting course for your relationship and it's a big positive that he's putting in a lot more effort now.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] I [29F] am traveling overseas to meet my online "boyfriend" [38M] in a week. He just said he had to cancel

So many through comments and PMs requested an update from my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9vlueu/i_29f_am_traveling_overseas_to_meet_my_online/) and so I thought I'd do one!

After my post I FaceTimed him to say my what I wanted to say and end things. He tried to get me to post-pone my trip and even tried to give me money to make me less mad at him. I told him whatever we had was over as I could no longer trust him. He cried which made me feel weird. I wished him and his ex the best and ended the call.

I went on my trip and had a top class time. The Reddit community really astounds me sometimes. I received a lot of PMs of suggestions of things to do and see and the trip to Ireland became a trip of a lifetime. In Dublin I did meet up with a very kind Redditor who showed me around the city and came with me to a bunch of museums during my stay. I saw amazing sights, met a bunch of really cool people through my travels, and met a few really cute Irish boys. (;

I learned a lot about myself on my first solo trip abroad. I am pretty self reliant and I did a lot of self reflection. This "relationship" was my first "serious" one after my ex and I split up. I think in my desire for closeness with someone I ignored a lot of red flags and downplayed my self worth. I am now focusing on making real connections with people I meet in real life and have decided to stay away from anything long distance indefinitely.

My first night in Belfast I did message him after I had had a what was probably too many beers (damn you delicious Irish beers!) and he said he was sorry but it was what it had to be. It didn't really seem sincere and it extinguished any romantic notions I had.

Thank you to everyone who commented and PM'd me. It really made me excited for my trip and it was the best time!

TLDR; Online BF backed out but after some logistical rearranging I still went on my trip and had the best time ever. Glad I cancelled the bf and not the trip.

ANSWER: > Glad I cancelled the bf and not the trip.

I love this, lol! I'm glad I caught the update post, and am so happy that you went through with the trip! Wishing you oodles of happiness and success in the future, OP. ♥

QUESTION: Update: My wife [28F] found out that my mother [59F] and I [28M] have been lying to her about our (me and my wife's) baby [0M] for months

Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/az648p/my\_wife\_28f\_found\_out\_that\_my\_mother\_59f\_and\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/az648p/my_wife_28f_found_out_that_my_mother_59f_and_i/)

Don't think anyone would particularly care about an update but I all appreciated the insight anyways. So here's an update:

After I wrote the original post, my mom took my son to stay overnight with my wife's sister so that the two of us could have the house to ourselves.

We pretty much just talked for an hour while constantly reaffirming that we love each other a lot and want to sort this out. I apologized and explained why I did what I did. She said that feeling like she was there for our son's milestones was really just a band-aid solution that didn't actually convince her she was present. She said that if she actually had been using the milestones to feel like she was present, this would probably have felt worse for her. But since she wasn't, in her words, "deluding herself into thinking she's actually home", her main issue was that I lied which hurt her feelings. I apologized and explained that I honestly thought that she would prefer the lying if given the choice. She said she understood where I was coming from and that she felt betrayed when she realized, but she sees that I was doing it because I love her and she thinks we'll probably laugh about it with our grandkids one day (yes, I am very aware I don't deserve my wife).

Some things came out on my end that I wasn't going to tell her and didn't mention in my last post- namely, that I'm scared she's going to become suicidal. My uncle committed suicide when I was a child, in part from working in a high-stress job where he made a huge and costly mistake. One of my wife's colleagues attempted suicide while she was on mat leave. Being a working mom is bad enough, being a resident in this program is bad enough, both combined are a recipe for trouble. Since our son was born and the incident with her colleague happened, I've been afraid that if her home life wasn't perfect, it would push her over the edge. Anyways, she reassured me that that's not happening and I think saying it out loud also made me realize it's a pretty irrational, groundless fear.

We ordered takeout and sat together watching the real videos I have of all our son's firsts. I also have a special folder of pictures/videos of my son with my wife, so we went through that after. She almost choked from laughing so hard when I tentatively revealed the beanbag trick. I am the laughing stock of her friend-group chat. So I guess we're already at the stage where we're laughing about it.

Thank you to those who responded to the last post! The stereotype of someone in [r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships) advocating divorce every time anything happens is true.

tl;dr: marriage is work. I am stupid. We moved past it.

ANSWER: I've always heard that NO firsts ever happen in daycare. Until Mom sees it happening, it didn't happen. Many grandparents feel the same way.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (34F) feel unattractive and my husband (41M) of 5 years has low libido

I posted last summer about [struggles with my husband of 5 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/), our longest dry spell being 9 months.

I felt unattractive and undesirable, and wanted to have sex more often, but he was happy to never have sex again (aside from how that would affect me). I wanted to feel like a sex Goddess again. Reddit advised me all kinds of things, from checking testosterone, to therapy, and even that there was no hope and if I wanted to feel like a Goddess again, I'd have to leave him. The [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/estjlke?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that hit me hardest was jimmyjrdanceparty's who pointed out that I was allowed to feel the way I did.

Well, I feel like a Goddess again, everyone! :D

What happened? I decided to go to individual therapy, and focus on myself, work on myself. My physical self-image was a symptom of a larger problem. Troubles at work, troubles at home, a storm inside. During counselling, I opened the door to a cellar where I had been keeping my true self locked in the dark - ashamed of her. I was bullied as a kid, and I had no idea I had accumulated so much self-loathing since then. Releasing that was amazing and so freeing!

And so, by the time I said goodbye to my counsellor, I was stronger and more self-assured. I realised I had been sacrificing so much of myself for the sake of others (especially the important men in my life - my husband, my boss, my father, my manager, etc). I was constantly seeking approval, trying to please them. My relationships had gotten completely out of balance.

Things started to get complicated. I developed a crush on a colleague, and because I am demisexual, my attraction to my husband started to diminish. The more time passed the more I felt like I just didn't care anymore what he thought of me.

At a low point, I said to my husband: "You know, you always keep your thoughts to yourself. I used to find it mysterious and interesting - like a puzzle I could unwrap. But now I realise that there's actually no mystery to unravel. There's just nothing. And the silence is boring." It was hurtful and unkind. I'm not proud of it. Something changed after that. Both for him, and for me.

Over the course of the next few months I gave less, and I took more. I went to conferences, I left the kids with my husband, I took time off work, I stopped making up for the mistakes of my superiors at work and let them deal with the consequences of their actions. I felt like I was coming home to my true self - my no nonsense kickass self.

One night my husband and I were watching Alien, and he confessed that ever since he'd seen the original as a boy, he'd really liked Ripley. She was the kind of woman he had wanted to marry. And so he married me. You should've seen my face, the tears wouldn't stop. I felt like he had finally told me what I needed to hear the most.

I got rid of my attraction to my colleague. It's actually not that hard as a demi, I just focused on everything I didn't like about them, and within a week or two the crush was totally gone. I find them a total turn-off now.

Do you remember I mention I wasn't able to initiate sex? That's because it was a huge turn-off for my husband. One evening we discussed why, and you know what? He felt too much pressure if I initiated, because he thought he'd have to perform. Once he realised that he can safely turn me down if he's not in the mood - and also that's it's OK for us to kiss and cuddle without it leading to something more - he's been OK with me initiating. You'd think you wouldn't get to age 40 without having figured that out, but hey... I guess people never cease to throw surprises!? Haha!

Our sex life improved a lot. I no longer needed his praise to sooth my self-loathing, so I was less needy about it. He initiated a bit more often. But more importantly, with greater enthusiasm and quality! He chooses what I wear sometimes - and I feel so beautiful when he looks at me like I am the only being that matters. And he compliments me! We even got into a bit of light D/s, which has spiced things up a lot!

Even though I had fallen out of love with him for a while, I have fallen back in love with my husband stronger and harder than ever before!! I couldn't be happier, I love myself, and I love him so SO much!! He's just the best partner I could ever wish for! <3

Thank you reddit for helping me through one of the hardest lows in my life, and thank you especially jimmyjrdanceparty for your advice and encouragement.

TLDR: I felt unattractive and my husband didn't want sex. I went to a counsellor. I stopped self-loathing. Husband and I fell back in love again & have great sex.

Update: OMG thank you thank you thank you for all the comments and awards! I have no words! I thought maybe 5 people would care about the update, not this amazing amount of encouragement! Thank you so much, so glad to have been on this journey with you. <3

ANSWER: This is the best post I have ever read on here. You changed your thoughts about yourself, which is the secret to life (IMO). Congrats and thank you for this empowering and amazing story!

QUESTION: UPDATE: My [24 F] boyfriend [26 M] of 6 months told me that I need to "unlove" the men from my past before I can love him.

Link to original post [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ccl1gt/my\_24\_f\_boyfriend\_26\_m\_of\_6\_months\_told\_me\_that\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ccl1gt/my_24_f_boyfriend_26_m_of_6_months_told_me_that_i/)

Figured I'd update my post from about a month ago. Unfortunately, there wasn't a happy ending, but I am very grateful for a lot of the advice I received here. Thank you, reddit, for helping me keep my head on straight!

After I made my first post, I read all the comments and thought about everything for a few days. A lot of people mentioned that they would not be comfortable with the frequency of my communication with my ex. I thought that was very fair. People also mentioned that Mark's behavior was pretty controlling and not ok. I also thought that was fair.

I went to talk to Mark and told him that I understood if he was uncomfortable with me being in touch with Eli weekly, and that I would be totally willing to cut that down. I also reiterated again that I was not currently in love with Eli and hadn't been for a while. Mark was understanding this time and seemed happy with the fact that I offered to cut down my contact with Eli.

But then I told Mark that although I was willing to do this, I wasn't happy with how he approached the issue and that I found his behavior controlling. I basically told him that I want him to approach issues in a more rational way and I would appreciate if he opened a dialogue rather than just telling me what to do, and that I wouldn't put up with him trying to "command" me to do something (especially something so ridiculous). I said everything in the same tone as I used for the first half of the conversation - I wasn't yelling at him or admonishing him, just trying to let him know where my boundaries are.

You guys - Mark. Flew. Off. The. Handle. He started SCREAMING at me. I obviously wasn't having it, so I got up to leave. He started throwing dishes and random kitchen items at me, and grabbed me and slammed my head into the door jam. I ended up with a nasty black eye and a busted lip. Luckily for me, a neighbor heard the commotion and called the cops. Mark was arrested and I was taken to the hospital. Yes, I'm pressing charges and filed for a restraining order.

Overall, it was a horrible incident but I'm glad this happened earlier in the relationship rather than later. And I am forever grateful for the neighbor who called the cops. Im also grateful to (most of) you guys for telling me that I wasn't being insane in my first post and for pointing out the early warning signs. It wasn't the best ending, but I'm ok and I'm just glad it's over. Take this as a cautionary tale, I guess!

TLDR: tried to have a rational conversation with Mark, he gave me a black eye and busted lip, it's over (thank God).

EDIT: I've gotten a lot of concerned messages (which I appreciate!) telling me to watch out for Mark now and that abusers are often at their most dangerous right after a breakup. Just to ease everyone's mind: I'm staying with a classmate (who Mark does not know) for the time being, so I'm well-protected! Thanks everyone!

ANSWER: Him: WOULD A CONTROLLING PSYCHO DO THIS?!

Him: (Smashes dishes and your head)

All of us: ...yes?

I’m really glad you got out of there. I hope you heal quickly.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My best friend (20M) asked me (20M) out. I said yes. I didn't know it was a date.

The original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9du198/my_best_friend_20m_asked_me_20m_out_i_said_yes_i/

First of all, I wanted to thank people for responding. I was majorly panicking when I wrote the post, and the comments I got helped a ton to get me to relax before talking to Noah. I wasn't expecting such a huge response at the time and I was amazed, but looking back now I can see why it got so much attention. It was a pretty weird situation.

Next, I want to say we are both men (apparently this makes a big difference for some people in terms of advice). Some of the people who assumed I was a woman also made some weird comments and sent me some pretty gross messages. If you did this, please stop. That's not cool.

I gave a bit of an update as an edit to the original post, but now since it's been 3 months I thought I'd give you all an update about how things have been going since then, since it seems like there's been a bit of interest, and I'm still really thankful to all of you for helping me out.

Noah is doing really well. I could tell he was still a bit embarrassed for the first couple weeks, but after that he told me again that he was still happy he asked me because now he knew how I felt and he could get over it. He also thanked me for taking it so well, which is definitely thanks to what a lot of you said, so I guess I'm sort of passing his thanks on to you :P

One of the commenters said I should be careful not to do anything that seemed like flirting with him, so I tried keep that in check (we used to hug a lot, sit really close together, and tell each other flirty jokes, you get the idea, but I toned those all down a lot to give him space and not mess with his feelings). I honestly think I see now why he thought I might be into him, because my relationship with him was very affectionate. It's been a lesson for me on how to be more aware of how other people are interpreting my signals.

About a month after he asked me out, he asked me if I wanted to go to a gay bar with him. He made it super clear that it wasn't a date, but he did it in a really sarcastic way, which was a little embarrassing for me but also I think it was good that he could joke about it. So we went to a local gay bar together and we had a really good time. He's a bit introverted, so I played the wingman, and he ended up flirting with this really cute guy and he just seemed really happy.

That was like two months ago and we've gone to the same bar a couple more times since then. He's been getting a bit more comfortable putting himself out there which is really cool to see, and he's just been more open and happy for the last two months, always smiling and eager to go do stuff. Not sure how it's related but it's a noticeable change from before he asked me out.

I'm doing great too. I'm just really happy that I didn't hurt our relationship and that he's so happy. I also learned some important things from this whole situation about communication and being aware of how I present myself. Important lessons. I actually think I feel more confident now too, since he asked me out. Getting asked out feels good man.

It sounds kind of weird, but I think it made us closer. We've started talking about relationships more, which isn't something we really talked about before. He's gone on a few dates and he tells me about them, and the most recent guy he went out with he was really excited about, and I think he might be headed for his first serious relationship, which is amazing! That's actually what made me think of this post and decide to give you all an update.

TL;DR: So yeah, our relationship wasn't ruined and I still have my best friend. He's doing really well and I love seeing him so happy.

Thanks again for the help!

ANSWER: What a lovely happy update - and I had to go back and check your ages because the maturity and self awareness you have both shown is pretty impressive. Big smile from this mom 🙂 Happy holidays!

QUESTION: (Update) How do I (28f) break up with someone when I’m their (31m) everything?

[Link to original post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aab0wm/how_do_i_28f_break_up_with_someone_when_im_their/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Straight to it: I broke up with him a day after I made my original post a few months ago. I was emboldened by the support and, strangely enough, even some of the negative comments. I came home from work and blurted it out, straight and to the point. I told him that I wasn’t happy, I hadn’t been for a while, and that we would be separating. We agreed that he could stay in the extra bedroom for a few months while we got everything sorted but when the lease was up we would be going our separate ways.

The last few months have been hard. He went into full blown panic mode, promised to change in the ways I had waited years for, and had several actual melt downs begging me to stay. It was painful, but my resolve to live my own life never wavered.

I just signed a new lease (by myself) and have begun to casually date someone in the same field as me. Life has an excitement to it that I haven’t felt in years, it’s like I’ve taken my first deep breath in a long time.

So, if you’re on the fence about leaving someone but your lives are so enmeshed that you don’t see how it is possible: put yourself first, there is always a way out. Thank you!

TLDR: I broke up with my codependent boyfriend and am the happiest I have been in years.

ANSWER: Amen.

Leases, shared bills, mutual enjoyment of GOTs or Survivor while everything else is terrible is no reason to stay together.

I’ve told my sons. Keep an emergency fund that you NEVER touch. Don’t bail on relationships, but NEVER stay in a relationship because you don’t have first months/last months rent and security deposit.

EDIT - thanks for the gold!! Just trying to share some hard-earned wisdom.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My [27F] boyfriend's [27M] old crush returning after a few years away. I was worried he would leave me for her, sadly I was right.

Old post - https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xgz9v/my_25f_boyfriend_25m_had_a_crush_on_a_girl_25f/

He ended up breaking up with me about a month after she came back and got back with her. It's been two years since this all happened and I heard through the grapevine they got engaged last weekend. I've moved on and it's alright, but my heart breaks when I think of how insecure and self-conscious I felt when all this went down. I know I'll eventually find a guy who I won't have any worries about, until then I'm chilling.

TL;DR: I was right to be worried.

ANSWER: I get you. I was supposed to be getting engaged and married to a guy who I thought loved me. Come to find he was cheating on me. They have since gotten married and had a family.

The biggest thing that stung wasnt the fact that he cheated, but the thought that I wasn't good enough for him but she was. I had to realize that I was good enough for a good man.

You are good enough. You are worthy of love and affection. You are 100% worth it and there is someone out there who will see that. I promise you.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] Me [32/F] with my husband [39 M] 6-years, our sex life disappeared; he swears he's attracted to me and I'm not sure what to believe or do.

[Here is the original post.  It is from over two years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40tuc7/me_32f_with_my_husband_39_m_6years_our_sex_life/)

I know my original post is so old, but the biggest update only recently happened.  My therapist suggested I post about it here to help sort out how I feel right now and also as a warning to other people.  I feel like I have grown so much in the last few years and maybe I'm a bit less naive (or a bit more bitter... however you'd like to put it).

Through interacting with the comments, I came up with an ultimatum I would give my husband.

1.  He needed to get his medical stuff tested.

2.  He see someone psychologically.

3.  Couple's counseling.

I decided ahead of time that he'd have to do the legwork for this already.  I had already done so much legwork for this relationship and I wanted to make sure I didn't hold his hand through this either.

He took it surprisingly well for what the conversation was.  There were tears on both sides but he agreed that yes, he would be willing to do these things for the sake of the relationship.

And then days passed.  And a week past.  I finally brought it up again and it caused a minor fight where he told me he needed to do this sort of stuff on his own time.

A few more weeks past.  I realized that he did not care enough to do something about this.  It was a hard thing to realize, but it was clear as day.

I headed over a friend's house to talk things out, clear my head, and come up with a plan for divorce.

I drove home and a few minutes before I arrived, he got a phone call that his sister was in a coma and dying.  I booked him tickets to go see her.  She passed away a few hours after he saw her.

She left behind two late-teenage girls.  Who we were now partially responsible for.

So I pushed my pain down and decided to be the best aunt I can to these two girls.  I also got myself a dog (best decision ever in this situation) to keep my own spirits up.

I worked really hard at this and felt like my husband and I were getting closer in the process.

More recently, I started realizing that everything we were doing for the girls was initiated through me--not him.  So I started paying more attention.  He was getting annoyed at me making a big deal over surprise care packages their school suggested we send in and other things like that.  I was starting to resent that he wasn't caring for his nieces in the same way as I was.

On the youngest niece's graduation day, I asked him if he thought the other parents there would be getting flowers for the graduates and if that's something we should do.  This is when he totally lost it at me.  It was a string that started with him yelling about how I get too concerned about these sorts of things and ended with a rant about how I buy too many crackers when company comes over for dinner.  This started changing the lens I was looking at him through again.  Also, at this point, I felt like my nieces had launched into the world with lives of their own.

I started re-seeing the eyerolls when I talked.  The cutting remarks about my intelligence.  Oh, and the utter lack of sex.

So I started talking to people.  I started seeing a therapist.  And together, we all came up with a plan to discuss everything with him--probably ending in divorce (though I never took that as a definite).

I decided we had a different view of what a relationship and marriage should be.  My plan was to present that to him calmly and let him give his opinion of how he sees things.

I had a work trip so I took the time to recoup.  I went on a long hike, and even though I'm not really religious, I prayed the whole damn time about this.

So when I got home, in the calmest and most even way I could, I explained the situation as I saw it and asked for his feedback.  My friends and I rehearsed what would happen if he cried and begged for a chance to change--or what to do (or rather, where to go) if he got really angry.

But nothing prepared me for his reaction.  He agreed with me.  He said that everything felt "forced" to him and that this wasn't a natural relationship.  That he married me because that was the path he was on, and since he wasn't planning on having kids, it's not like that mattered all that much.  In fact, he prefers being alone generally.

He then finished by asking if I thought we should get couple's counseling.  I calmly said that given what he just said, I didn't think that was an option.  He immediately started trying to talk next steps, who gets what, etc.  He brought up that he could probably technically fight for alimony but that he wouldn't.  And said he wouldn't fight for my dog if I don't fight to go after his seperate finances.

I think this was the most painful in the moment reaction I could have had from him.  I told him I would give him some space that night, so I drove to my friend's house and cried my eyes out.  Him not fighting it is ultimately better for the long run, but it's really hard to realize that your husband of 5 years (and partner for 8) never really loved or cared for you.

I should have listened to my gut all along.

We had that talk last night.  I'm currently sitting in a coffee shop, typing this all out.  I'm a relatively attractive person and I channeled my frustrations over the last few years into lifting and working out almost every day.  So I'm hopeful when it comes to love in the future.

I don't really know what my next step is.  I might drive to my brother's.  I might look for a storage facility.  It's a bit overwhelming to think about.

Overall, I'm so grateful this is happening now and that I won't be looking back at my life when I'm 85 years old, disappointed that it never really started.  I have my life in front of me and it's a big scary place.  But after I finish crying my eyes out, it's one step in front of the other.

And thank you everyone for all your help.

tl/dr:  Put off divorce due to spouse's sister dying and despite everything we worked on together, found out he never really loved me.

ANSWER: I am so sorry..

I wanted to come here to say, specifically, thank you so much for being an amazing aunt to those girls. I lost my mom when I was 15 and my aunts were hands-down the biggest blessing during that time. I don’t know if I would have chosen to continue living if it hadn’t been for their support. So thank you for being so incredibly selfless and supportive for your nieces.

QUESTION: UPDATE: recently found out that I (17M) got into my brother's (19M) former dream university which he did not get accepted to last year, feeling guilty about really wanting to go now

Update to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95s4ri/recently_found_out_that_i_17m_got_into_my/)

On Saturday I was able to speak to my brother and tell him that I got into the university. He was really happy for me, like a lot of people said he would be. When I told him I got in he gave me a huge hug and was really excited. It was such a huge relief.

He asked me if it was my top choice, since he didn't know I had applied. I told him it was and he said that we have to celebrate then. He told me I didnt seem excited enough and I should be really proud of myself, and he asked if it was the shock of just finding out.

When I told him I find out a few days ago and he was the only one that knew he asked me whats going on, because I wasnt reacting to the great news like it was great news. I admitted that I worried about telling him because I didnt want him to be mad.

We talked about it and he basically said what everyone in the comments said, that he's proud of me and happy for me. I mentioned that I got into a different program than his and my requirements were lower, and he told me to not downplay my success and to stop worrying about him being mad because he wasn't. He told me that when I told out parents he wanted me to be more confident and proud of myself, because I did something great.

Yesterday while we were hanging out at his buddy's house he told me I should tell them the news, when I didnt want to because I hate talking about myself he asked if could tell them, which I told him was OK. they were all happy for me too. Honestly, he's reaction was better than I even hoped for, but looking back I should have expected it from him because that's always been the type of brother he is.

TL;DR told my brother I got into the university and he incredibly supportive and happy for me. He told me not limit my success to make other people more comfortable, and that he was proud of me (which meant a lot to hear).

ANSWER: Respect to the brother for being 19 but behaving like a real adult here. Setting a great example for little bro.

QUESTION: Update: My [25f] boyfriend [26m] of 10 months is best friends with his ex [20s?f]. She refuses to meet me and it's getting weird

Link to OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6mql7n/my_25f_boyfriend_26m_of_10_months_is_best_friends/

I wrote my previous post over a year ago, and a lot has happened since then. I wanted to give everyone an update, since the advice on this sub was really helpful at the time.

For a few months after I wrote my OP, nothing much happened. Jeff and I continued dating, and he continued being friends/partners with Jenna. I never met her, but everything else in our relationship seemed to be going so well that I decided I'd try to deal with it.

Things got really hard, however, when I had to take a work contract 12 hours away from home for three months. I hardly saw Jeff the whole time, and I looked at Jenna's instagram almost every day to see if she'd posted more photos of them together. More often than not, she had. Since I wasn't physically present, I felt like Jenna was his real girlfriend. I felt completely worthless and constantly stressed out, knowing my boyfriend was spending all his time with another woman who I already had suspicions about.

While I was away for work, I decided to break up with Jeff. I broke up with as soon as I came back, and I made it very clear that his relationship with Jenna was intolerable for me. I told him he was going to have a hard time dating anyone who wasn't her as long as she was still in his life. He kept saying he didn't understand why it was such a problem. He told me he couldn't control her behaviour, but he promised me he hadn't cheated on me. I explained to him that by allowing their friendship to continue, he was condoning her behaviour. I told him I didn't really even care if he'd physically cheated or not, since he'd already shown disrespect for me and our relationship.

I didn't speak to him for a few months and I went on with my life. I took another contract out of town and even considered moving permanently to another city. One night, though, Jeff called me and apologized. He said he had been thinking about our relationship a lot and realized he had been in the wrong. He said his relationship with Jenna was beginning to feel toxic to him, and he'd made arrangements to dissolve their business partnership. After that, I decided to meet up with him (not necessarily give him another chance) and discuss the situation further. When we met up, he promised to stop talking to Jenna and unfollowed her on all social media.

As of now, he has not spoken to her in six months, and we've gotten back together. We actually ran into her at a concert a few weeks ago, and they didn't even say hi to each other. I feel much more respected and confident in my relationship now.

TLDR: I broke up with my boyfriend. He ended his friendship/partnership with his ex and we have gotten back together.

ANSWER: Wow. Good for both of you that the communication ended up working and you're happy together now. Congrats and hope it works out.

QUESTION: Update 2: I (30F) caught my husband (31M) in an affair and don’t know how to move forward.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/vfJzYwOX6V

Update 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/uMVTyBbusT

Wow. I can’t believe this happened over five years ago now. In some ways, it feels like it happened to me in a different life. I still get messages asking about this and figured I could add some insight into how life can look a few years down the line after everything gets completely and utterly wrecked. Good news—If you put in the work, it looks pretty fucking great.

First of all—where is my ex husband now? I haven’t had contact with him since September of 2020 and largely don’t keep track of things but I can see that this man still follows me on Instagram and watches all of my stories. I considered blocking him, but just let it be. I think it’s the petty part of me who’s living a full life that’s fine with rubbing it in a bit.

He and the affair partner did get married after a whoopsie kid and I’m pretty sure they had another. But they also both lost their jobs as teachers (he got her a job at his school, so she was working with an entire staff that knew they had an affair) and had to move to the middle of nowhere. Last I heard of them, the affair partner had been texting his former best friend unhinged rants about not including them in get togethers or allowing my ex-husband to be a groomsman in his wedding.

But enough about them, because they already took up way too many pages in my story.  When we last left off, I think I had just moved to a new city (shoutout to Richmond, VA!) and was largely just finding myself again. I think the change of scenery was the best thing that I did for myself. I was never meant to live in the suburbs and moving to a beautiful little city where I can walk to coffee shops, bakeries and bookstores honestly helped my mental health as much as the therapy. I bought a house here a couple years ago and have really settled in.

Then I got my puppy, a corgi named Bilbo Baggins who really is the true love of my life. He is the greasiest thing to happen to me and is just such a fantastic chonky guy. We go to a local dog park with a bar all the time and he even has his own lil’ dog social group. Kids aren’t something I plan on, so he is basically my son.

It hasn’t all been perfect. My dad died, my best friend moved across the country, and I largely haven’t really been dating much the past couple of years.  Dating hasn’t been a huge priority for me and my friends say that I’m probably too picky. I say that I know what it’s like to be in a marriage with someone who might love you but doesn’t like you and it’s worth not settling.

But while I may be single, I am fulfilled and busy. My birthday is Saturday and I’ll be spending it in Paris at a Lady Gaga concert. I saw Sabrina Carpenter in Amsterdam, Taylor Swift in Lyon, Springsteen in Edinburgh, Noah Kahan at Fenway Park. Earlier this year I was able to visit Katmai National Park and see the brown bears in the falls. I have a DnD group and a really amazing village of people I love.

I would not be in this headspace if I didn’t go to therapy and work out the why of me settling for this man in the first place. True story: When planning our honeymoon in New Zealand, I, of course, had to plan the entire thing despite him picking the location. He refused to do any driving, so we had to do a guided tour that left on specific dates. He pretended to not be able to get a day off of work when we needed to leave until I started crying and begging him to just ask his boss for it because literally no other flights worked. That’s when he said he actually always had the day off but wanted to make sure I was actually working hard enough to choose good flights.

Anyway, I chose to marry… that and it was a lot to unpack in therapy.  But I’m glad I did because without it I don’t think I’d have built this life for myself. At the end of the day, what happened set me up to live a happier life than what I was living so in some ways, I’m thankful for the experience, shitty as it was.

If you’re in the middle of something terrible, unfair, and world-shattering to you, just know that it’s not forever. While this experience has made me a bit of a believer in karma, I also know that there was a lot of work to get myself out of that big black mental hole. Sometimes it seemed that I would slide back in it but by looking forward and figuring myself out, I eventually clawed my way out. I think you can too—and that you’re worth fighting for.

TLDR: Got therapy, life is good, ex-husband stalks me on Instagram, and maybe we should all get dogs for our mental health.

ANSWER: I feel like following this story and you having this be your current chapter is the best thing I've heard this year.

I'm so happy for you!

Never settle, know your worth. And give the Sir some skritches!

Also, Richmond is a beautiful city. I grew up as a teenager there.

QUESTION: I (22F) just found out my boyfriend (38M) lied about his age for a year—what do I do?

I (22F) recently found out my boyfriend (38M) lied about his age for a year. We met at work, got along, and became official 6 months ago. This is my first relationship, and now I feel completely broken.

He claimed to be 31 years old the first time we met. I was unsure about the age gap, but after seeing how well we connected, I decided to give it a chance.

This morning, we went to do some legal paperwork where I needed his ID. At the office, he kept handing his ID upside down to the staff and refused to let me see it after asking nicely, claiming privacy. By then I had my doubts, though I wasn’t exactly sure what he was hiding.

I finally confronted him saying that I needed to see his ID or I wouldn't be able to trust him anymore. It escalated to, "What are you hiding from me?" He never answered directly. Back home, after much insistence, he gave up and told me the truth:

He lied about his age because he felt bad about being old and wanted to feel younger. He said he knew I wouldn’t accept being with him if I knew his real age, and that he “was planning on telling me” eventually because his guilt was getting hard to manage. He admitted that what he did was wrong, then tried to reassure me that it wasn’t my fault, that I was an excellent girlfriend and person, and that everything we shared was real. I closed the door in his face after telling him I needed to process everything.

This feels like a nightmare. And hurts like shit.

I trusted him, shared my life and my love, and even planned a future together—moving abroad, traveling, building a new life. Now I feel so betrayed, angry, and heartbroken.

I can't believe I was lied to for so long, something so fundamental. I don’t know what to do next. Should I try to salvage this, or just walk away?

Edit: About the “legal paperwork” part, I think I worded it wrong. It’s nothing that really binds me to him in any way. Nothing I can’t undo. He just helped me with some documents that I needed to show for my residence certificate.

TL;DR: My first boyfriend (38M/22F) lied about his age for over a year. I just found out he’s 38, not 31. I feel betrayed and don’t know if I can trust him again.

ANSWER: He wanted you to move out of country before telling you the truth.

That would terrify any reasonable person.

QUESTION: Bf left after seeing ex's engagement post

Okay so, I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (30M) for a little over two years now. We just moved in together a few months ago. Last night we were doomscrolling on insta reels and his ex's post popped up abt her getting engaged

I don't rly know much about their relationship in detail other than her cheating on my bf with her current fiance while she was engaged to my bf (they were together for 5 yrs and it's been 3.5 yrs since they broke up), so ik that it didn't end well with them and it's just a sour topic so i never rly bring it up. I don’t follow her but she's kind of famous on insta as she is a food vlogger and I watch a lot of that content that's y she popped up.

Anyways when he saw it he like froze and became tense i asked him if everything was ok and he said yeah but i asked if that he looked tense because of the post he just brushed it off and rolled over to go to sleep and then thing is we didn't even rly cuddle when we cuddle like almost every night when going to sleep.

I woke up around 2 a.m. and he was gone. Like, completely gone.  he was nowhere in our house. I called him, like, 10 ,15 times. No answer ,Phone was switched off. I even called one of his friends, and they had no clue where he was. I was thinking of calling his mom but ik she would have blown his phone up so i decided to wait and call my frnd she also suggested to wait a few hours so i did

Then around 3:30 ish  he finally calls me back,i ask him wtf is he doing And he just says I'm fine pls don't call me rn ill explain later and he hangs up b4 i could say anything properly

I tried calling again obviously bcoz what does that even mean like I don't get why he would even be upset about that post seeing they broke up so long ago I can't imagine leaving your gf over this at night. He didn't explicitly say anything abt the reason he went off but I'm pretty sure it's bcoz of the post. I stopped calling him after a few times as hes not going to pick up i rly don't know what to do.

Things have been good with us until now this is the first time i have ever felt like I'm being betrayed by him. I don't even know where he is . Should I leave him alone and give him space I just feel sick abt this situation.

Tldr- bf left in middle of night after finding his ex got engaged and is not responding to me

Update-
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/BBZhLPoYPW

Posting again bcoz previous update post got removed for some reason.

Hey guys,
First of all, thank you to everyone who commented , I didn’t expect so many people to respond, and honestly, reading through your messages kept me from spiraling even more.

I tried to go back to sleep after the post. He did come back around 6 am .he looked like shit cuz ig he hadn't slept. He had just been driving around according to him. I didn't even know what to say to him luckily he was the one who talked first. He apologized a lot of times for running away and for ignoring my calls. I obv asked him wtf happened and why he would ditch me like that and abt his ex. He told me he had a panic attack and he didn't want me to witness it so he went to his car and after that he drove off . He explained that it wasn't bcoz he wasn't over her and that he never wanted her back(i asked him if he was still in love w her). He said it just happened after seeing that pic of them together and happy, he said he depressed after everything went down w his ex but he thought he was fine when he started dating me and that he has been rly happy.

But he panicked bcoz it hit him that she was actually happy and their break up hasn't affected her like it has him seeing she was with the guy she cheated on my bf with and he started overthinking that what if he could never be happy like that when  getting engaged again and getting married to me.

I was honestly a bit shocked at first bcoz we had talked abt how he would love to marry me someday and I didn't rly understand how to comprehend this info but we talked for like 2 hours and he was genuinely sry and he doesn't seem like he's not over her.

He did say he wants to find that kind of happiness with me and he wants that future with me and he apologized again for being an asshole. I made it clear to him if he ever runs off like that we r done and he agreed and honestly we were both kind of crying by the end of our Convo and i also blocked his ex on my insta (he already had her blocked b4 anyone speculates)

I think i could forgive him. Thank you again for all your help the comments helped a lot. We might try therapy.

Tldr- he came back and we talked abt how he had a panick attack thinking if could be as happy as her and we resolved it out.

ANSWER: i dont understand why people are attacking you in these comments. if i had made it to the stage of moving in with someone and one night they left out of nowhere, id be concerned too, no matter what happened the day before. and while yes he probably just needs time to process the engagement, it wouldve been easy to tell you that. he didnt even have to say it in person or on the phone, he could leave and then send a quick text right after to let you know that he just needed some time alone and that he was alright. you're valid to be upset about this

i understand his distress but it's been 3 and a half years. the least he can do is give you the courtesy of telling you he was leaving to be on his own for a bit instead of letting you wake up alone in the middle of the night and leaving you to panic

QUESTION: UPDATE- Married within a year, and now I’m seeing red flags I ignored before — how do I handle this?(27F/33M)

Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/t08KmdcFxt

Update:

27F/33M

I had a conversation with my husband yesterday and gave him an ultimatum. I brought up therapy again, something I’ve suggested in the past, but he said he can’t do it right now because he’s looking for a job and wants to be financially stable first, which I can understand. However, he also said that even after getting a job, he would only consider therapy, then went on a rant about how therapy is useless.

I told him that if he’s not open to therapy, he could at least speak with a pastor or counselor at our church since that is free. He refused again, saying he has too much on his plate. I even suggested having just one conversation and not committing to anything long-term, but he said he’s tired of me bringing it up.

At this point, I’ve decided to leave. I’m currently looking for a job and hoping things fall into place so I can get my own place soon. I feel scared and heartbroken, but I know it’s necessary. I wish I hadn’t ignored the red flags, but I’m choosing to give myself grace. It’s a terrible feeling, but I know I’ll be okay.

Thank you to everyone who commented on my original post. Your words gave me clarity and courage.

TL;DR: He refused therapy or help, so I’ve decided to leave and start over.

ANSWER: It seemed very clear from the post that he didn't actually want to change, someone who recognised their own insecurities and wanted to change would stop making it yours manage and go to therapy, he's done neither. You've made the right choice.

It sounds like neither of you are currently working, I don't know how you sustained that situation but do you have family or friends you can go stay with so you can leave immediately? Even if that involves moving, it's not like you have a job tying you to your current area - which obviously isn't great financially but freeing in terms of leaving and starting afresh.

QUESTION: My (35f) mil (60f) only wants provide childcare for our daughter(3 months f) not our son (3m) and my wife (33f) and I are not on the same page as how to handle this.

Hi everyone,

My mother-in-law initially offered to help with childcare one day a week and seemed enthusiastic. However, after our daughter was born, she made it clear she only wants to care for her. She claims it’s “fair” because she didn’t help with our son when he was a baby and my mother did.

For context, we did offer before our son was born and my mother offered, but when we asked, my mil reacted like a deer in headlights, so we dropped it. We’ve had multiple discussions since, explaining that we don’t agree with her only wanting one child, and she seemed to understand—but a week later, she goes back to only wanting to care for our daughter and pretending we agreed to that.

We’re unsure why this is happening. It might be because we’re a lesbian couple and she only wants to bond with the child she is biologically related to, or maybe she wasn’t ready before but is now. Either way, she has said multiple times that she doesn’t want to take care of our son. She has said this in front of our son.

I feel like the weekly childcare arrangement is off because I don’t trust her to care for both children equally. My wife feels that we haven’t explicitly said she must take both children or none, and that we should give her a chance.

This argument is devolving in my wife saying I'm trying to isolate her from her parents and I'm treating her like she is a bad person. I just want to protect our kids. I don't know what to do anymore. Should I truly offer her another chance?

tl;dr my wife and I heavily disagree how we should handle my mil wanting to play favourites with childcare

ANSWER: Why do I feel like because your wife gave birth to your daughter and you gave birth to your son, your MIL thinks daughter is her grandchild while son is NOT?

Have you ever asked your wife, what would she tell your son when he asks “Why Grammy never let me stay” or “Why Grammy doesn’t like me” or “Why Grammy always prioritize little sister”?

This is something you should clear with your wife first, because she is enabling her mom’s favoritism and her way of not counting your son as family. What if she escalates? What if she tries to exclude your son in family activities? What if resentment builds between your children due to Grammy?

QUESTION: My boyfriend (33M) keeps saying “Have fun on your date” whenever I (32F) leave the house — how do I get him to stop?

Almost every time I leave the house, my boyfriend says something like “Have fun on your date.” Sometimes he’ll even text it to me after I’ve gone.

There’s absolutely no reason for him to think I’d be seeing anyone else. Nothing’s ever happened that would make him suspicious — he just says these things out of nowhere. I find it really disrespectful and gross. I’ve never cheated, never given him a reason to doubt me, and I don’t even have anyone else in my life I could “go on a date” with.

We’ve lived together almost the entire year we’ve been dating. He didn’t used to say things like this, but now he’s constantly making passive-aggressive comments if I’m on my phone, like:

“If you want to talk to someone else, just do it.”
“You don’t have to hide that you’re talking to another guy.”

I’ve told him many times how offensive and damaging these comments are, but he doesn’t care — he seems to truly believe that what he is doing is somehow harmless.   I feel my respect for him slipping every time he does it. I’m honestly at the point where, if we didn’t live together, I’d already have broken up with him. Unfortunately, it is not going to be easy to separate from him at this point or for awhile due to financial reasons.

How should I handle this behavior when he refuses to take it seriously?

Also, how can I articulate the reason why this feels so gross ? I am struggling to find the words.

⸻

TL;DR:
My boyfriend keeps making sarcastic comments like “Have fun on your date” whenever I leave the house, even though I’ve never given him any reason to distrust me. I’ve told him it’s disrespectful, but he doesn’t stop. What should I do?

ANSWER: “If we didn’t live together I’d already have broken up with him”

You answered your own question about what to do next. It just requires the additional step of also moving out.

QUESTION: My mom found out about my private life and says she’ll never forgive me. I don’t know what to do.

I (27F) come from a conservative religious background.  I live abroad now, but recently something happened that completely broke my relationship with my mom (55F).

I gave her my old phone because hers stopped working. Before giving it away, I deleted WhatsApp, thinking all my private conversations were gone. Unfortunately, when she reinstalled it, all my old chats were restored — including some very personal messages and “flirty” conversations.

When she saw them, she was devastated and furious. She said I had brought shame, that I was no longer her daughter, and that she regretted giving birth to me. She blocked me, then unblocked me just to say hurtful things like calling me names. She even told me not to tell my relatives that we don't talk anymore, or she'd show them everything so they'd know the truth about me.

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. She had warned me that if it happened again, she would cut me off — and this time, she did.

I feel destroyed inside. I keep blaming myself, but at the same time, I feel like her reaction is too extreme. I know what I did isn’t acceptable in her eyes, but it hurts to lose my mom like this.
I’m far from home, I feel ashamed and empty, and I don’t know how to move forward.

Has anyone else gone through something like this — especially in a strict religious family? How did you cope with losing your parent emotionally, even if they’re still alive?

EDIT : For context, these messages were related to my active sexual life, so she's hurting for knowing that I'm sexually active.

TL;DR: My mom (55F) found out about parts of my private life that go against our religious background, feels deeply betrayed, and refuses to forgive me. I (27F) love her but don’t know if I should try to contact her again or let her go.

ANSWER: >I keep blaming myself,

The worst choice here is to blame yourself for living your own life.

Your mom is hateful and willing to drop her own daughter because she sent flirty messages. Someone willing to do that is a shameful, awful person.

To move forward, you have to understand exactly this, that your mother is not a good person and that you may be better off without her, even though it hurts now.

QUESTION: My, 40F, husband, 45M,been living with my dad for work. I think he’s cheating.

I, 40F, have been with my husband Brian (fake name), 45M, for almost two decades. We have four kids. A few years ago, we moved from our hometown, a major city, to a smaller, quiet town about three hours away in another state. At the time, we only had our two oldest children, and childcare wasn’t an issue.

Brian was able to find employment fairly quickly when we moved, and I worked from home full-time, which gave me the opportunity to care for our kids, the home, and our marriage. Things were great until I became pregnant with our now third child and developed some health issues.

Because Brian had to call out frequently due to my hospitalizations during the pregnancy, he was eventually forced to resign from his job due to attendance and performance. During delivery, there was an accident and my baby and I almost didn’t survive. The baby was in the NICU for months recovering. She is now a happy and mostly healthy baby. After she came home, Brian worked odd jobs to bring in money, but his primary concern was making sure the kids and I were okay.

A few days before our youngest turned 1, we found out that we were having our fourth and last child. That pregnancy was tough as well, but things went relatively okay until delivery. During the delivery, I was injured by my surgeon, which prevented me from caring for my newborn and our other kids. I was on bed rest for a few months recovering from the C-section and the injury.

Brian waited on me hand and foot and worked reduced hours. We lived off savings and my disability checks from my employer. My father also sent money to help us out. Once I recovered, I returned to work full-time, but Brian wasn’t able to find steady employment. We made things work for a while, but unexpected expenses in the home and with our taxes drove up our costs.

Eventually, Brian found a full-time job back in our home city; great pay, benefits, and room for overtime. My father offered to let him live with him so he wouldn’t have to commute six hours a day or pay any bills while there. Brian was hesitant to leave because I’d still been dealing with health issues since our last child, but I assured him I’d be fine.

At first, things were great. When he moved in with my dad, Brian would call and text frequently; during his breaks, lunches, and in the evenings. We’d video chat for hours while he talked to me and the kids. On Fridays, he’d come home and visit until early Monday mornings. I’d drive him to work with our two youngest kids, then drive back home. Sometimes, the kids and I would go up Friday afternoon to visit him and my dad and drive back Sunday so he wouldn’t be burnt out.

But then the calls started to slow down. I figured he was busy or tired. One night, because we share locations, I checked the app around 10 p.m. and saw he was at a bar. I texted him, asking what was up. He responded around 3 a.m., saying he’d gone out with friends after work. I felt uncomfortable but told myself not to be insecure. I told myself that Brian deserved to unwind after everything he’d done for me and the kids.

The late nights at bars and restaurants continued for a few weeks. The money in our joint account started depleting from his outings to the point where I had to remind him we needed the money for bills. He stopped coming home on weekends, and when I visited, he seemed distant and glued to his phone.

I asked if everything was okay with him and with us. He said it was. I asked about his new friends, but his answers were vague.

One weekend at my dad’s house, Brian was in another room when his phone rang. The name “V” popped up with no picture. I’d never heard that name before. A few minutes later, my dad’s phone rang. I heard him briefly say something to the person on the phone, then tell Brian to “check his phone when he gets a chance.” Brian picked it up, sent a text, looked at me, and set the phone down face-first. I asked who it was. He just said, “A friend.”

My insecurities got the best of me, so I looked through Brian’s Facebook. He doesn’t post much, but suddenly, all his profile pictures had new “likes” from someone who had me blocked. Using my old unused account (under my maiden name), I found that person. It was a woman named Vanessa, 33F.

On her public page, I saw photos of her and Brian at bars, restaurants, and, heartbreakingly, in my father’s living room and building lobby. In every photo, Vanessa was hugged up on Brian or wrapped around his arm. His wedding ring was off. She tagged him in the photos, but the tags didn’t appear on his profile.

I was devastated. Instead of confronting him right away, I packed up the kids and went home. Brian didn’t protest and seemed clueless. My dad asked if I was okay; I said I didn’t feel well and wanted to leave. Brian quietly helped me pack.

I took screenshots of everything. That was three weeks ago.

Since then, I haven’t talked to Brian much. When he calls, I hand the phone to whichever kid is closest, even the one-year-old. I’ve focused on work and the kids, but I keep checking Vanessa’s page and taking more screenshots as she posts more pictures.

Last night, Brian texted asking why I’d been distant. Furious, I sent him all the screenshots. For about ten minutes, I saw the typing bubble appear and disappear. Then he finally replied: “She’s just a coworker.”

I asked him how he’d feel if I were constantly out with a coworker, hugged up in photos. No reply. I asked why he brought this coworker to my father’s house. He said, “Just to introduce them.” I asked why he hadn’t introduced any other coworkers. Silence.

It’s been about nine hours and I haven’t heard from him since. I’m heartbroken. I don’t want to be a divorced single mom, but I refuse to live in with this kind of disrespect.

Advice needed: What should my next steps be?

TL;DR:
My husband (45M) and I (40F) have been together nearly 20 years and have 4 kids. He took a good job back in our hometown and moved in with my dad to avoid a long commute. At first he called and visited often, but then he got distant, started going out drinking, and stopped coming home. I found Facebook photos of him with a younger woman (33F) out at bars, restaurants, and even at my dad’s house, with his wedding ring off. When I confronted him, he said she’s “just a coworker” and hasn’t spoken to me since. I’m heartbroken and unsure what to do next.

ANSWER: Idk what’s worse about this story. Everything he’s doing or the fact that not only did the dad cover for him the whole time, he is also communicating with this woman on behalf of your husband, and right in front of you.  Im sorry, that’s fucked up and I hope you find your way through it. You should not let yourself be treated like that no matter if it makes you a single divorced person.

QUESTION: Found my partner’s old divorce case online — don’t know what to believe now

I (27F) have been seeing a man (35M) for about four months. He’s divorced and has a young daughter. He told me that his marriage ended because of his ex’s accusations and that she was a narcissist.

I just found their divorce case online. It matches what he told me but with details that shocked me: ICU stay, which I knew about, but it mentions seizure from alcohol use, bottles hidden around the house, and his ex claiming he wasn’t safe around their kid.

He told me those things were exaggerated and that the judge ruled in his favor for 50/50 custody, which is true. But now I’m stuck between believing that he’s genuinely recovering and worrying that he still drinks or minimizes it. We smoke weed together sometimes, and he seems totally functional—steady job, great dad, responsible—but I can’t shake the fear that I’m missing something.

I don’t want to judge him unfairly, but I also don’t want to ignore red flags. What’s a fair, healthy way to ask about this without sounding accusatory or controlling?

Tl;dr: found the court case for the guy I'm dating. It mentions that he's an alcoholic to a dangerous level. He's told me that his ex accused him of different things to get full custody, but I'm now concerned.

ANSWER: I say trust your gut. Like, easy as that, trust your gut, girl. Think about it since you’re having to ask reddit.

I once met a guy who seemed okay, but then he got kinda stalkerish and I tried to brush it off because he was very good friends with my friend group. It wasn’t getting better and I looked him up; turns out he was on probation and parole for breaking a girl’s jaw after she broke up with him (and breaking that no contact order). That was shocking, but the biggest shock was that my other friends knew not only how uncomfortable he made me, but they knew about that incident and never told me. Stopped all contact with all of them immediately and called his parole officer.

QUESTION: My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) live together: I found out how he sees the world, now I don’t know if I should stay.

(Re-upload with edits: my previous post was removed for formatting.)

My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been together for two years. I live at his house and don’t pay rent (it’s one of his parents’ properties).

Over the last six months our relationship has been slowly deteriorating. I’ve had multiple conversations with him about how his communication style hurts me and others, and how little effort he puts into understanding me.

A few examples:
1 Once, I mentioned seeing a male friend and he spent the dinner spiraling into topics like calling himself (grandparents immigrated from Italy to Aus) as “ethnic” as my Asian/Middle Eastern best friend, saying “no one should be friends with Germans, we’ve moved on too fast from the Holocaust,” and “old people don’t deserve respect.” It was bizarre and uncomfortable.

2 When we need to solve small domestic issues (like fixing a drain), he often derails the conversation into his own feelings rather than focusing on the task, getting visibly upset at me.

3 When I’m overwhelmed and trying to self-regulate by being quiet or still, he panics and asks what he did wrong, which forces me to comfort him instead of calming myself.

4 I’m autistic, and my tone can be flat. He often misreads it as hostility, especially around practical or “adult” topics.

5 The other night, he made fun of the way I walked and looked, even doing a hurtful impression. I said “that’s not a nice thing to do to your girlfriend,” and he exploded into, “what about thank you for cooking dinner? Why is it never thank you?”

The breaking point came this week when we took our puppy to be de-sexed. I filled out the vet consent form while he watched. Because I’d be at work during the procedure, I made sure the clinic knew to call him first. I signed my own name at the bottom (as the form requires) and added his details below. Later that day, I discovered a private ChatGPT thread where he described the whole event with anger and resentment, accusing me of being controlling and writing my phone number in its required section (above his) to “belittle” him. Reading that was shattering. It showed me how warped his perception of me has become.

That’s been our pattern: I act from practicality or care, he interprets it as attack or disrespect.

I wouldn’t call our relationship abusive. Most days are neutral, some are lovely, and about 10–20% of the time things get really painful. He’s affectionate and loving, and I truly love him and the life we’ve built: our home, our routines, our puppy. But when anything serious happens, he becomes reactive, defensive, or mean, and I end up feeling small and unseen.

Logistically, leaving is hard. I work part-time (four days a week) and study at university. If I rent, I’ll have around $400 a week to live on. That means shared custody of the dog, major financial stress, and losing the most comfortable home I’ve ever had. But staying means continuing to feel unheard and distorted.

My question: How do I decide whether to stay or leave when the relationship isn’t entirely bad but feels fundamentally incompatible? What concrete steps can I take to make the right decision?

TL;DR: My boyfriend believes I am antagonising him when I’m taking care of logistics or myself. He’s great most of the time and I love the life we share beyond these issues, but I’m worried I’ll never see him the same. I’d appreciate advice on how to move forward and protect my peace.

ANSWER: Your boyfriend is mentally unwell OP.  Take the dog and find a place of your own. There are reg flags all over the place with your BF.

QUESTION: Husband recycled a proposal from the previous relationship.

tl;dr husband proposed in the same exact way, word for word, location etc as he did with his previous relationship. How do I get over this?

I '33F' just found out that my husband '35M' of 7 years, proposed to me in the same exact way as he proposed to his ex wife. 
Same day, Xmas eve, same exact location and used the same shpiel. Thankfully he didn't use the same damn ring too.....

It's not a situation where he wasn't over the ex. I truly think it's just pure lack of originality or imagination. 
Idk if I'm being dramatic but I am hurt and sick over this. I've cried non stop. Can't look at him or even talk to him. I gave him the ring back and told him to do it over and make it special. I wanted my own. But honestly, if he does, idk if that would make me feel better. How do I move passed this? 
This isn't something I would leave him over but it is something that has definitely hurt our relationship. 
Any suggestions on how to work through this?

ANSWER: He lacks originality.  I found out my husband took his second wife on a honeymoon on the same vacation that was the only out of the region vacation the two of us ever went to.  While he was having an affair with her, he was introducing him to the same restaurants I had introduced him to in this city, and my favorite restaurant became "their place."  I would not really move past that myself, to be honest with you.  In fact, he's married to his third wife, and they own a hobby shop based on the only hobby I ever had when married to him, a hobby he used to make fun of me doing.

QUESTION: How do I tell my husband I’m uncomfortable with him staying with a female colleague on work trips?

I was going to post this on AITAH but since I’m 95% sure I’m not the asshole, I guess I’m looking for relationship advice instead. Soooo… would I be the asshole if I \[38f\] told my husband \[40m\] I don’t want him to stay with a colleague \[45F, single\] when they travel together for work?

My husband and Colleague are part of a dozen independently contracted people within a professional creative group, which manages projects with clients. Husband and Colleague find their work to be complimentary, so they’re hoping to work on more projects together. Husband and I live in City A, we’re from City B (where both sets of parents live), and City C is where Professional Group and Colleague are based.

Last time Husband was working in City C he stayed on Colleague’s couch. Fine, whatever, not a big deal for a one-off thing. Then he had a job in City B last week that she worked with him on, and they stayed at his parents house together Tues-Saturday. To clarify: City B is my hometown, where my family also lives. I didn’t know about this until he was on the way out the door Tuesday. If he had mentioned it I probably would have said “oh, wouldn’t everyone be more comfortable if she was put up in a hotel?” Granted, budget was a consideration, but my feeling is that if the group, client, or husband can’t afford an assistant on a project, then it can’t be a requisite for the job. And this isn’t a one time scenario, he plans to keep working with her, so this will definitely come up again in some iteration.

Relationship background: Husband and I have been together for 4 years, married for 6 months. We were actually together for a while 15 years ago but our paths diverged. In a crazy full circle way we were brought back together and I’m happier than I’ve ever been in a partnership. Our relationship is based on mutual respect and admiration, and he is extremely loyal when it comes to friends, family, and me. I want to make it clear that I trust him 100%. This isn’t about infidelity, it’s about boundaries and respect and how he shows that he cares about my feelings.

All week I’ve been dealing with icks and ughs about this. It’s been occupying a huge portion of my thoughts. I was by myself while they were working together every day, sharing meals, presumably hanging out until bedtime? And then of course there are my irrational, neurotic thoughts like “did he make coffee for her every morning? Did she use my MIL’s shampoo? Does he think she’s cooler than me? Is he going to run off to City C because it’s way more rewarding than our life together??” I hate that I’m this insecure and jealous and prone to ruminating on this stuff. Yes, I have a therapist, yes, we talk about this sort of thing.  It might be different if I had met Colleague or knew ANY details about her at all. All I know about her is that they have a lot in common and she’s apparently comfortable with this level of familiarity with a married colleague.

I’m already prepared for how it will go if I bring this up. His reaction at best is going to be invalidating my feelings in the guise of reassurance (“you’re being silly! That’s ridiculous, what are you worried about?”) or defensive (“why are you admonishing me when I’ve done nothing wrong?”) He bristles when it comes to personal critique, which makes it hard to express my feelings sometimes. He’s not one to conform to the conventions of society, so me saying “this is objectively inappropriate” or “this simply isn’t done” would not be useful arguments. He usually means well, but can be really blind to how his actions affect me. I’m really hoping that me saying I’m uncomfortable is enough for him to agree to the very reasonable request of getting Colleague a damn hotel room next time.

Ok, so here’s a part I was on the fence about adding in, because all of the above is enough for being upset, but it’s important in the context of my emotional needs not being prioritized (and it definitely adds to my sensitive emotional state). My mom died 3 months ago, so I drove up to City B on Friday to prep for my mom’s Sunday memorial celebration. I thought Husband was going to join me at my parent’s house across town Friday night, but I guess there was a miscommunication and he had to do a bit more work on this project Saturday. We talked about this on the phone Thursday and he told me he was probably going to stay with his parents Saturday night too, so Colleague wouldn’t be uncomfortable at the house without him there. I basically told him no, I needed him with me. I honestly can’t even believe he entertained the idea of prioritizing her comfort over my need for his support during a huge emotional life event. A few days before the memorial.

I love this person. I trust him, but I’m frustrated and sad. Why is he such a dummy when it comes to all this shit?? The big work job is done, and we got through the memorial. Now I guess I’m looking for some communication advice, some validation, and maybe personal experience. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this.

tl;dr: Husband is overfamiliar with a female colleague. He doesn’t think it’s a problem, but the real issue is that he's oblivious to how this makes me feel. I’m not sure how to raise it without him getting defensive.

ANSWER: Okay so this

> Our relationship is based on mutual respect and admiration, and he is extremely loyal when it comes to friends, family, and me. I want to make it clear that I trust him 100%. This isn’t about infidelity, it’s about boundaries and respect and how he shows that he cares about my feelings.

Does not jive with this

I’m already prepared for how it will go if I bring this up. His reaction at best is going to be invalidating my feelings in the guise of reassurance (“you’re being silly! That’s ridiculous, what are you worried about?”) or defensive (“why are you admonishing me when I’ve done nothing wrong?”)

There’s some cognitive dissonance going on here and tbh I think this perfect marriage full of admiration and respect is a story you’re telling yourself. Because I’m not seeing much respect coming from his side. And I think you’re being naive to say there’s definitely no infidelity going on. He’s having this woman stay at his parents’ house, that’s so far beyond the boundaries of a work relationship it borders on hilarity.

And now he’s trying to abandon you in your time of need to make her more comfortable? At best this is an emotional affair. At worst it’s already turned physical.

QUESTION: My bf (M23) stood me (F22) up on Halloween and doesn’t know why

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years, and he’s always been amazing, but on Halloween, he stood me up and can't explain why. I want to forgive him, but I am still so upset.

We both had different events to go to first, but we agreed that we’d meet up later at a club, which is something we had discussed all week. I knew he was with friends, so I told him he could invite them, but that regardless of what his friends where doing we were going to go out. I texted around 9 PM that I was ready, and he replied saying he was picking up his friends and would meet me at the club. I told him it was a 20-minute walk for me, so he should let me know when he was heading out.

I didn’t hear back from him until 11:40 PM when he texted saying he was finally on his way. By then, I would’ve gotten there around midnight, and I wasn’t comfortable walking through downtown that late. Plus, he and his friends ended up not even going in because the lines were too long. So, basically, I spent hours doing intricate makeup and dressing up all so that I could be stood up by my own bf.

What made it even worse was that the next day was Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead/ celebrate the dead), which was really important to me as I’m Latina, and I just lost my grandpa. My boyfriend was supposed to help me set up my grandpa’s shrine and make food, but he completely forgot.

He came over with gifts to apologize, but his only explanation was, “I’m sorry, I don’t know what happened.” When I asked if he thought it was okay for a woman to walk alone downtown that late, he lied and said he would’ve gotten me an Uber, but nowhere in his messages did he mention that. He also tried to play it off as “miscommunication,” when it was really just a lack of communication on his part. I told him I needed space and sent him home.

Later, when he apologized again, he kept saying that thinking about what he did makes him upset and sick. Normally I appreciate when he expresses his feelings, but I told him that in this case, I truly didn’t care how he felt because I was the one who was wronged and upset. I don’t know if that was too harsh, but I genuinely don’t understand how him being nauseous was supposed to help me feel any better.

The next day, after some pushing, he said he’s been emotionally checked out because of how stressful his doctorate program has been and that he forgets things easily when they’re not “in front of him.” I don’t really know what to make of that.

He’s always been supportive and kind before this, especially when my grandpa passed. I don’t think he’s cheating, which I know is always possible, but cheating is one of his biggest fears, so I doubt this is the case. This whole situation isn’t typical for him, but his explanation feels weak, and I’m not sure how to move forward. I want to forgive him, but I also feel really hurt and disappointed.

How would you handle something like this? Should I try to talk to him again, or just give him more space?

ANSWER: He was out enjoying himself with his friends and totally ‘forgot’ he was supposed to be meeting up with you. He doesn’t want to admit that, so his ‘I don’t know what happened’ isn’t true, and is flimsy at best. And the fact he thought it would be okay for you to walk to a club at that time is absolutely ridiculous plus, and I’m just guessing, he was too hungover to help you the following day when you really needed his support. All in all, he hasn’t exactly covered himself in boyfriend glory, has he? Updateme!

QUESTION: I want to divorce my husband. But he wants another chance. Am I being heartless?

Hi reddit. Like the title says, I (f31) want to divorce my husband (m32), but i'm afraid I may be acting too quickly? For context, we've been together for 12 years, married for 3. He's always had a strong temper and frankly, my parents never fully approved of our relationship because of it. I'm the complete opposite, shy, eternally optomistic, a little too nice (husband says I'm a pushover). Anyway, while we dated he would often be rude to me but his excuse was that he was stressed out from college or he was tired, or he had something else going on. And I believed him.

Fast forward to our first year of marriage, and I found out the hard way that it wasn't college or any of that. It was just his actual personality. He hates talking about, well, anything. We never talk about money which is outrageous to me because we're married, I can't talk to him about family drama because it annoys him, can't talk about my feelings because he'll get mad, insult me and walk away. He's not only rude to me now but to my parents too. Despite the fact that they've given us a house, a piece of land, helped us get out of a debt, etc. And I could not be more embarassed.

Mostly, I feel stupid. My parents warned me again and again. My dad especially, because he noticed early on how different we were. But my husband always said opposites attract (sounds kind of stupid now). And he wasn't as mean then as he is now, in fact, he got along great with my parents back then. He even got them gifts and things. Now, he's moody all the time but even moreso when we go over to their house. He won't even engage in conversation, all he does is look down at him phone the entire time. It honestly feels like he doesn't care about being part of the family. Whenever someone tries to give him adive, he doesn't take it well, like he's smarter than everyone else and there's nothing you can say to him that he doesn't already know. The few times we do talk, we end up arguing because everything I say is always wrong and "i don't know what I'm talking about" or "I'm ignorant". Mind you, we both have college degrees. All in all, I'm just so disapointed and embarrased by the kind of person he is. Btw, he's not like that around his friends.

I brought up the possibility of getting a divorce during an argument and he's been nicer to me ever since. But I've seen this side of him before. He's promised to change in the past and has said that he can't live without me. This is the only time I've truly seen him so remorseful though.

TD;LR: Am I being too rash in suggesting to my husband that we divorce because of how he treats me? Should I give him another chance?

ANSWER: No, you're not being too rash to divorce someone who is not nice to you or your family and has never been, who insults you and who you can't communicate with. In fact, I have no idea why you've stayed with him this long.

QUESTION: How can I (21M) make my Chinese dad (61M) get a life?

The title might sound a bit harsh, but I honestly don’t know how else to phrase it.

There’s a lot to unpack here, but here I go (TL;DR at the bottom):

My dad is a Chinese immigrant who moved to California in the early 2000s. To this day, he hasn’t learned much English, which has really limited his ability to explore new things — even simple stuff like trying non-Chinese restaurants. Over time, that’s made him more closed off and unwilling to try anything new.

He’s naturally introverted, and with his difficult personality and years of working tirelessly since coming here, he’s struggled to make friends. As a result, he doesn’t have many hobbies or much of a social life.

Now that he finally has more free time, I’ve been trying to get him to enjoy life a bit more — to go out, meet people, or pick up a hobby. But whenever I suggest something, he just says things like “There’s nothing to do here in America” or “Nothing interests me.” I know those are excuses — I think it’s hard for him because he can’t read or speak English, so everything outside his comfort zone feels impossible. Still, it’s tough watching him just… fade into routine.

I’d love to know if anyone has gone through something similar or has advice on how to help a parent like this.

Some background that might be helpful:  
My dad doesn’t have the best relationship with our family (my mom, sister, and me). He wasn’t really a great husband or father figure when I was growing up. He and my mom fought a lot, mostly because he’d spend so much time at the casino playing poker — which he insists “isn’t gambling” because it “takes skill” and “helps him relieve stress.” But back then, we were struggling financially, living in affordable housing, so it only made things worse.

He also had a lot of anger issues and poor communication skills. He couldn’t empathize or see things from my mom’s point of view, which led to constant fighting. My sister ended up developing lasting trauma from it, and I’ve always had a hard time talking to him too.

That said, something changed earlier this year. We visited some old family friends — people who somehow have stuck by him despite knowing his flaws — and they had yet another intervention with him. This time, it seemed to click. Around the same time, I broke down in front of him and told him how all of this affected me. I think that really got through to him, because since then, he’s been trying to change, little by little.

Honestly, I’m still conflicted. Writing this all out makes me realize how complicated it is. My dad isn’t the best person, but he’s still my dad — and I know he did what he could with what he had. I just want to help him find a way to live more meaningfully instead of wasting away.

TL;DR:  
My dad isn’t perfect, but he’s still my dad. He doesn’t have many friends or hobbies, and I want to help him find some so he can live a fuller, happier life. Any advice or similar experiences would really mean a lot.

ANSWER: Your best bet is probably to find out where other senior Chinese guys hang out and take him there. He'll be able to communicate and feel a lot more comfortable. Maybe he'll make friends.

QUESTION: M55 How direct can you be to ask relatives to invite you for the holidays?

I (M55) am suddenly without immediate family: no spouse, no kids and nobody at home with me.

I am dreading the holidays.

I have (1) an aunt, uncle and cousins in one city a few hours away and (2) a brother and his family in another city a few hours away.

I’ve usually just waited for invitations and if they didn’t come, I’d spend holidays with immediate family at my home, but immediate family is now gone.

My sister-in-law has said “we’ve got to get you to come out sometime” and I said, “sure!”, but I don’t know if that was just a general statement or if it was supposed to be an invitation.  My aunt said, “we need to stay in touch” but it would be kind of weird to invite myself to their house.

How do I get an invitation for Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas dinner?

That’s all I need; I can stay in a hotel.

TL;DR: how direct can you be in asking family members for an invitation for the holidays if you’re all alone?

ANSWER: My brother reached out for a thanksgiving one year, he hadn’t been to family events in years. He just said “hey sis, I really wanted to spend the holiday with family, do you have anything going on that I could come to?” damn near broke my fucking heart that I didn’t make it clear enough to him that he’s ALWAYS invited, I didn’t ever think I needed to invite him to these things.

I’m really glad he asked, because now I always invite him.

QUESTION: My (23F) BF (23M) said he’d consider breaking up with me if I changed my appearance and now I can’t look at him the same.

TL;DR:
My BF hates all forms of body modification and has made it clear he doesn’t like when I change my appearance. When I mentioned tattooing over a fading mole, he sternly told me not to “Do that to my face.” When I asked if he’d break up with me over something a bodily change I made he didn’t like, he said yes. He apologized afterward, but I can’t shake how disrespected I feel or how hard it is to be affectionate again.

I (23F) have been dating my BF (23M) “Andre” for a little over 2 years. It’s both our first relationship. Andre has always hated any kind of bodily change: tattoos, piercings, dye, even getting a hand stamp at the bar. He scrubs it off the second we get home.

I’m the opposite. I love tattoos (I have 3), I’ve dyed my hair ginger (naturally blonde), and I have a few piercings. Since we started dating, though, I’ve only added one ear piercing and changed my hair tint slightly. Whenever I bring up wanting something new (like tattoos or piercings), he gets visibly uncomfortable. His voice goes high, eyebrows raise, and he starts asking, “How much of a change are you thinking?”

His facial expressions alone have always felt like a subtle threat to our relationship. if I go too far, he’ll stop being attracted to me or even consider leaving. That’s honestly a big part of why I’ve stopped changing my appearance at all.

Earlier this week, I mentioned that a small mole on my nose is starting to lose pigment, and I brought up maybe tattooing over it with brown ink kind of like a freckle tattoo or microblading. His response was instant and firm: “Do not do that to your face.”
That hit me hard. He didn’t even ask why I wanted to do it or how I felt about it just completely shut it down and told me what to do.

Later that night, I texted him and asked, “If I did something to my appearance that you didn’t like, would you break up with me?”
His reply: “Yes, I could see it playing a factor.”
My stomach dropped. I called two of my friends to make sure I wasn’t losing my mind and they both said that was insane. I ignored him for a bit, and when he called back, I ended up yelling at him for almost an hour (which is unlike me). That’s when it seemed to finally hit him how serious this was. He started crying, apologized, and admitted he was being inconsiderate and disrespectful. The next night, he told me he realized how entitled it was to act like he has any say over my body, and that he needs to work on his reactions. He said he understands I’m my own person and that my choices have nothing to do with him.
I told him straight up that he needs to always speak to me like an equal, and that just because he gets to see my body doesn’t mean he gets to control it. I made it very clear if he ever does this again, I’m gone.

I also told him I’m not applying to jobs in his area anymore. Someone who would consider breaking up with me over a freckle doesn’t deserve me moving states for them.
We’re still together, but now I feel… icked out. I don’t want to be affectionate or sweet toward him. even though he’s apologized and seems to be reflecting. I feel like he doesn’t deserve that from me right now, but I also feel mean with giving him nothing to work with.

How do I forgive him? Will that natural affection come back with time? Is it harder because we live far apart? I get forgive but don’t forget, but how?

ANSWER: Relationship aside, please be careful about tattooing over your mole. You want to be able to monitor moles for changes and tattooing over it could get in the way of that.

QUESTION: How do I (26F) break up with my fiancé (28M) of 7 yrs without destroying him? The timing feels cruel.

See my last post about why…

TL;DR:
I love my fiancé but know the relationship needs to end. He lives with me in my family’s home, is struggling in school, and has a birthday/holidays coming up. Ending things now feels cruel, but pretending until the end of the year also feels wrong. How do I break up in a way that causes the least damage?

I (late 20s F) am at the point where I know I need to end things with my fiancé (late 20s M). I love him, but after reading the feedback on my last post and really sitting with the things I didn’t want to admit, I know I can’t continue this relationship.

The problem is… the timing feels awful.

He currently lives with me in my old family home. It’s not technically either of our places—my parents don’t live here, but two of my adult sisters do. Asking him to leave feels like kicking him out to nowhere, even though he does have family he could go to. I just know it’ll shake his sense of stability.

He’s also really struggling in school. I don’t want to pile this on while he’s barely hanging on academically. College is rough, I’ve been there and completely understand. I’ve told him multiple times that I’m unhappy, but I know this will still blindside him.

Part of me wants to end things now because living like this—acting like I’m not completely torn—feels emotionally draining and dishonest. But the other part of me wants to wait until the semester is over… except then it’s his birthday in mid-December, and then Christmas. It feels cruel no matter what.

I’m torn between doing what’s healthiest for me vs. trying to protect him from more stress.
Do I need to end it now, or should I let him have the end of the year without adding this pain?
Any advice on how to do this in the least damaging way is appreciated. Honestly I’m not sure if I’m mentally prepared for it now - please give me your honest advice I’ve never had to break up like this before

ANSWER: The only reason to delay ANYTHING about this would be to give him a chance to get his bearings and find a better living situation.

Which would sorta mean breaking up with him and then giving him a week or two or more to sort of figure out his next living situation.

There's no point in delaying through Christmas just to wait until the ball drops on New Year to shout "Surprise, we're breaking up! Pack your shit!"

Also... you need to brace yourself for being the "bad guy" here. There is only so much you can do here to soften this landing. You are about to wreck this dude's whooole existence. The odds of getting a handshake and a thanks for the memories card is... low.

QUESTION: My gf (F23) is trying to move in with me (M31) way too soon

I (M31) started dating his new person (F23) back in July. Things were going great and we decided to make our relationship official after a vacation a few weeks ago.

The problem happened as soon as we got back from vacation. She lives with her mom and apparently when she got back home, she got into this big fight with her mom's bum ass boyfriend. Now she refuses to go back home until homeboy moves out. I'm trying to be a good boyfriend and let her stay with me for a while, but "a while" is starting to feel permanent. Her mom's boyfriend doesnt even have a job and theres no sign of him moving out any time soon. It doesn't help that my apartment is tiny and I hate not having space to myself.

A couple days ago she asked me if we could get a place together when my lease ends in February, and since she's already living with me, that would mean she permanently moved in 2 days after becoming my girlfriend. Thats way too fast for me and tbh it feels like shes taking advantage of my kindness and resources. I genuinely don't know what to do because I don't want to kick her out with no place to go but I also don't feel comfortable with her moving in on such short notice. How can we resolve this problem?

TL;DR girlfriend of 2 days is trying to live in my tiny apartment now

ANSWER: Well, first of all, if you date a woman eight years younger than you she’s gonna be in a different place in life and have different expectations. That should be a no-brainer. You want a grownup, date a grownup.

That said, you’re going to have to have a conversation with her and however you put it, she will feel rejected and upset. Just be prepared to remain calm and kind. Explain that you’re not ready to live with someone. That you need her to have a plan for her living arrangements that isn’t just live with you.

QUESTION: Update: How do I (27 M) get my gf (24 F) to understand that I can’t do it all on my own. Is this the end?

My last post on this [(can be found here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ok0qa9/how_do_i_27_m_get_my_gf_24_f_to_understand_that_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) got a lot of responses so I wanted to give a recent update.

A couple days after that post, on November 1st my family had a Halloween party. We attended as we have been staying with my parents. It was fun, it was going good. I allowed myself to just relax, had a few drinks which I don’t often. I “let loose”. This all came crumbling down though when my gf made a comment/joke about getting married. She asked “Do you want to marry me?” I said “Yes!” She asked “so when are we getting married?” I said “When we get married!” she responded “So you don’t want to marry me” I responded “That’s not what I’m saying” and then it got quiet. Now mind you, this was a few hours into the party, after we had a good bit to drink. So it wasn’t really the time or place to have a serious conversation about our future marriage.

Later we are in our room, to escape the party for a bit. She says sorry. I tell her thank you. She says something about how it was just joke. I tell her that the joke isn’t really funny given we’ve had all of these conversations regarding issues we’ve been having, how before we even really think about getting married I’d like for us to be out of my parents house again. She says she wishes joking about marriage wasn’t a stressor. I said that it isn’t just about the marriage, it’s about the accusation that I don’t want to. When I’ve been trying so hard to get us to a point where we have our own place, where I can afford a ring, where we have finances to plan a wedding. And know we are having a good foundation for our shared future. And the fact I reassure her nearly every week. I do so many things to show her I love her, care about her, and want a future. So when she says things like that, I feel unheard in how much I am struggle to carry all of this by myself.

The rest of the convo is a bit of a blur (alcohol and it being late doesn’t help), but it turns into a fight. It went on for about 2 hours. Which really sucks, because I’ve said time and time again I’m really uncomfortable having these conversations while we’ve had drinks and when it’s late. But nonetheless there we are.

I tell her that I don’t want to get married until I feel like I can depend on her. She says that I can, that she listens to me when I talk about work. I tell her that I mean like seriously depend on her, like what if I lose my job? What if I get deathly ill? I want to feel like we aren’t totally fucked, because she will be able to be there for us. I tell her about how we were supposed to have a check-in mid-October, to discuss her progress on things we had talked about fixing in July to keep the relationship going. That we never had that check-in, and it is past that but she hasn’t done these things. I told her I was glad that our conflicts had become less, but that these things were still not being met. She immediately got defensive and said “so how long were you going to wait to talk to me about this if I didn’t joke about marriage?” I said “not long at all, I was getting my thoughts together, and deciding when we should sit down and talk. October just ended.” She ends up telling me about how she has looked into a program at our old university and how she has had two phone calls with them that led nowhere. I was aware of one of these. I asked if she had ordered her transcript and applied to FAFSA like we talked about. She said no. She said it’s all confusing and she doesn’t know what to do. That it’s “hard.” I tell her “You can ask for help when you starting do it and I’ll help. you know when I was looking at going for my masters recently, I applied to both FAFSA and got my transcript in one day. It isn’t hard too hard.” she then brings up us having different capacities.

It some how derails and we are talking about the past. It’s hard to remember all that was said or how we got there. But I do remember telling her how it’s hard to trust her, because she hasn’t done these things, and because right before her psychosis this year, she admitted to me, that early in our relationship she had been posting nudes on a secret Snapchat to try and sell them, browsed Tinder, and apparently had her coworkers thinking I was abusive, that we were in an open relationship, etc. She justified the nudes by saying she was trying to make us money (which we didn't need to do, as I had a teaching job at this time. Also I don't have an issue with some posting nudes online, it's that we had talked about it early on, as she used to do it, and I told her I just didn't want the one's she sent me to be the same one's she posted, because I wanted to feel special, and then SHE decided she didn't want to do it anymore), and that she only did it like once a month, and didn’t do it for that long. And also that it never came up. As if I was supposed to know and ask?? She didn’t respond to the Tinder thing. She also said she didn’t know why her coworkers thought that of me, that she always told them how great I was. She said she speculates it’s because they thought it was odd she had a job and needed to work while I had a teaching job. I told her that, the point is she kept that all from me, while I took my first “grown up job” to try and start building our future, and she was doing all of that, and kept it from me for years. She said she was super supportive of me during that time.

We end up back to the original topic of what we had agreed she would do. I said something about how she has had 3 and a half months to make real progress and figure these things out, and she has done less than what I managed to do in a single morning. She got upset and she said very angrily “so what you want me to get my transcript, apply for FAFSA, and start applying??” I said “well yeah, that’s what we agreed to. It was either that or find another job.” She was upset that I didn’t see her having a phone call with a university about a program as enough. She said she needed me to see that as a good step. I said it was a good step, but it isn’t what we agreed to by this point. She was upset and said something about “so the conflict being less isn’t good? Because I haven’t done this?” I said “No I’ve said the conflict being less is good, it’s just that this was an important part of what we agreed to.” I had said several times in the conversation I was happy about that. I also around this point reminded her what I said last time we had these talks, which is that if she didn't want to go back to school or get a better job, that it was fine, we would just be wanting different things in life, and I wouldn't hate her for that, I would still love her, we would just not be compatible which happens sometimes. She stated multiple times this is what she wants, this is what she wants to do.

Honestly, this whole thing for me is in fragments. I remember points at which she kept trying to change why we almost broke up in the past. She tried to say she is worried to talk to me because I’ll just “break up” with her. And I had to tell her the reason we have almost broke up, was the first time, it was because I told her I got tremors and heart rate spikes when I felt like we were going to have conflict and she belittled me for it. The second time it was because she continuously ran over my boundaries, and had a whole meltdown that started from her tripping and falling when hanging out with family and being embarrassed. Which then went from me supporting her for being embarrassed and trying to make her feel better, to somehow being accusations that I didn’t love her, and she spiraled for like 4 hours, until nearly 5 AM, threatened to not go to my nephews birthday party with me the next day because I told her I think it’d be best if we continued talking about it in the morning, since we were both tired and have had a few drinks. Which she refused to do, and she blew up my phone and criticized my therapy for “changing me.” These weren’t light hearted moments for me, these weren’t just any conversation leading me to think it may be best for us to part ways. This is the second time she has tried to reframe these scenarios as me casually wanting to leave. Instead of what they truly were, which was her pushing me as far as I could go. She also said it’s my fault she has the job she has. That I “made her take it.” Because I’m the one who found it, and told her to apply to there, to get out of the other job that was making her absolutely miserable. Like that job made her seriously depressed. And that we had agreed it was something she could do while she figured something more long term out. But I never made her take it, I suggested it because the other job made me very worried for her and her mental health.

I had 5 heart rate notifications from my Apple Watch from the stress of this conversation. By the end things had settled, she apologized for not doing more, and asked me to promise I wouldn’t break up with her the next day, the next week, and this year. The party was over and everyone had gone to bed, so I missed out on seeing my aunts for longer as they left before we even woke up the next day.

Since then, I’ve just been feeling very confused. I feel sad, angry, confused, and kind of numb. I feel like I don’t remember everything, so if it seems like it doesn’t make sense, I’m sorry.

I just don’t really know what to think. Part of me really feels like this is the end. I just felt like all of our issues are not being dealt with, and that every issue we’ve had, I have to fight against her rewriting what happened. It’s just so confusing. I love her, I really do, so my heart hurts, but I just feel like things shouldn't be this hard. She's been extremely kind since this conversation, and she submitted to get her transcript. But yeah I just don't know. I am really just exhausted of things being like this, and I really wish we didn't have to have an argument for something to happen.

TLDR: Update from my last post. We had a chat, under not good circumstances. I feel very confused and lost. I think maybe it’s just time to throw in the towel. Is this something that can be fixed? Am I being reasonable?

ANSWER: Hon, she is never going to grow while you’re taking care of (frankly enabling) her. She needs to be on her own to figure shit out, and you deserve better than this. Break up, make it a CLEAN break, no contact, and recover. Once you are outside of the situation, you’re gonna realize how unhealthy it is.

QUESTION: My (30F) boyfriend (28M) doesnt have a job and just got kicked out. Im concerned about him staying at mine. What should I do?

Hey humans, I need perspective. Help a friend out. I (30F) have been dating a guy (28M) for two years.

At the beginning of our relationship I was struck by the depth of our conversations, his (verbal) support of my painting, and how he turned his life around (gave up drugs and alcohol 3 years ago). He took practical steps to show up for me—changed the litter box for my cats, took the recycling out, took my car to get the tires rotated. In the past I dated guys who talked a big game, but never did anything, so I felt so hopeful.

(For extra context, both of my parents are mentally ill drug addicts so there’s lots of pain there and kinda… hope for care? Which I know I need therapy for).

Anyway, while we’ve been together I squared away my first year of a social work masters program and it was the hardest thing Ive ever done. In the meantime, he lost his job 8 months ago and has been playing music on the weekends to scrape by. I told him the high risk of that (lack of savings, etc) was making me nervous. He also really wasnt scraping by bc he didnt have enough money for food… so I started paying. Now I buy almost all of our groceries, and Ive been pleading with him to get a more secure job in addition to music… just a bookstore or something 2 days a week! (or something).

Anyway he wont. He is working really hard to make enough money with music, but he wont get another job. And yesterday he got asked to leave his living situation so… He needs somewhere to land. He’s not from this town, so there aren’t a ton of options. I want to be a good partner and show up, but my nervous system is terrified.

More context: He was asked to leave bc his landlord wanted to move his daughter & her fam into the property. He never missed a rent payment.

He did say he may have found something for work this week, and with losing his housing maybe he’ll be more open to change?

When I question him about the situation I feel like our conversation always ends up with my “trauma.” ie: clearly Im having a big reaction bc I have trauma and it’s not fair to him bc Im not seeing all he does for me.

On top of all of it the uncertainty and anxiety makes me heartbroken bc Im yearning for a “forever home” with someone.

Extra context: before he was asked to leave his place, he was spending most nights at mine anyways. But, it feels different if he were to not have a place of his own.

My question is: If I were a friend, what would you advise me to do? Is it amoral to tell him he cant stay with me? (or maybe to stay with not just me? me part time and his moms part time?) If he does stay here, is there anything I can do to stay sane? (make a chore chart, or something? and have a timeline?). If Im telling him he cant move in… what should I tell him yo do? Im open to the thoughts

TL;DR My (30F) boyfriend (28M) doesnt have a job and just got kicked out. Im concerned about him staying at mine. What should I do?

ANSWER: I think that your gut is telling you something and you should take some time to listen to it. It's not a moral to see that someone isn't willing to really put in the work and effort to build a life and be a partner and want to keep some distance and safety. The fact that you are expressing these concerns and he's chalking them up to "trauma" is really manipulative

QUESTION: How can I help my husband understand that appreciation in marriage should go both ways?

I (29F) and my husband (29M) have been together for 10 years and married for 1. Lately, we’ve been arguing about household responsibilities — but for me, it’s less about chores and more about feeling appreciated.

He often tells me that I should be grateful he helps around the house because he’s the “breadwinner.” I do appreciate everything he does, but I also work full time — 10 to 12 hour shifts, 5 days a week, as a pet groomer. I handle most of the cooking, cleaning, dishes, and general organizing at home. He handles laundry more often, manages the yard and finances, and does most of the grocery shopping.

The grocery part has mostly fallen to him because we’ve been sharing one car. We moved from Philadelphia about two years ago, and until recently, I didn’t have my driver’s license (I used to be really anxious about driving). I finally got my license last week and am now looking for my own car, which will let me help more with errands and take some things off his plate.

Still, when I try to explain that while I’m thankful for what he does, I also deserve gratitude for working and keeping up with the home, it turns into an argument. He takes it as me being ungrateful or trying to “one-up” him, which isn’t what I mean at all. I just want mutual appreciation — not a scoreboard.

How can I bring this up in a way that helps him see that appreciation should go both ways, without it turning into another fight?

TL;DR:
29F married to 29M for 1 year (together 10). My husband says I should be grateful that he helps around the house since he’s the main earner, but I also work full time and handle most housework. I just want him to understand that gratitude should go both ways — how can I communicate that without starting another argument?

ANSWER: You're explaining your reasoning extremely clearly here, and it's a totally reasonable ask - so if he's not "getting" it, it's likely because he doesn't want to. There are a few reasons why that may be, unfortunately none of them are great.

QUESTION: My (21F) partner (21M) just came out as transgender, and I feel confused.

Me (21F) and my partner (21M) have been dating for three years, right before we graduated high school, when she identified as a male. Yesterday, she called me for a serious talk, and told me that she was transgender.

Of course, I want to be by her side and help her with her transition. However, I don’t know what to do, as I see myself only being attracted to men. I don’t want to hurt her because of my sexuality.

I am still so in love with her, and I don’t want to end our relationship, but I see myself as straight. As of now, I can’t see a future with a woman. I don’t know what to do, and I need advice. Should I stay? Should I break up with her? What do I do? The last thing I want to do is hurt her.

TL;DR - My partner just came out as transgender, and I don’t know if I should stay or leave the relationship, as I identify as straight, even though I’m still in love with her.

ANSWER: check out r/mypartneristrans

if you’re not attracted to women, it’s okay to break up - you can support her without being in a romantic relationship

QUESTION: My husband (37M) blames me (35F) for our child being on the autism spectrum

In the pre diagnosis phase he started to shut me out and drink more. She is now officially diagnosed and is a beautiful and happy 3 year old who lives life in her own way. She is minimally verbal and requires a lot of extra support (we are level 2 for those familiar with the level stuffs).

I tried to bring this up. He rejects the notion but isn’t himself. He was my rock and best friend. But I went through a period of time that I couldn’t trust him to take care of her. He let her elope multiple times while I was at work and had to have a home visit from CPS.

I think he is drinking too much and putting us in financial trouble with his drinking and reckless spending. I don’t think divorce is something I want but don’t know how to fix this. How do we move through this? Please do not just say therapy because I have tried.

TL;DR!

We have been friends/ dated since high school. He is a reliable and good person. When I unexpectedly got pregnant with our son (now 8 years old) it was the logical thing to get married and build a life together but now all of that is in jeopardy.

ANSWER: I think the better question is it safe for your child to be in the current environment rather than do you want a divorce. If he is an unsafe person, then you have your answer.

QUESTION: We were ALMOST perfect for six years, bought a house together... then everything fell apart. (Me 25M.. Her 25F)

So me and her been together for 6 years! Everything was great! Even perfect! In my head she was the woman I was going to live my whole life with. We just bought a house and it’s been 2 months we have it. I recently had a harder past 2 months. All my friends were moving some place far so I felt a certain way like I was losing them. So I was a bit more distant, in a mini depression, wanted to do nothing all the time and was always refusing her (let’s say for small activities like walks, etc). I was in my head a lot and was more distant from her and did not really talk about it to her. So she was a bit disconnecting from me.

She, 1 month ago, started to game with a work colleague that she discovered liked playing WOW. They started playing every night and me, not naturally jealous, started to feel things were strange… like she was just watching movies with him online and you know doing stuff she normally would never do.

At a certain point, 2 weeks ago, I asked her if everything was great between us and she then said that she was loving me less. I asked her, shocked and a bit hurt, if she is in love maybe with him or maybe she’s having some feelings for him and she then said yes. My heart shattered… my heart EXPLODED…

We then came to the conclusion where she would stop contacting him. She told him and they stopped talking. The day after she came home and I saw that she was distant. I asked her if she was doubting us and if she still wanted to try working on stuff. She said no, so then we broke up. She moved to her parents’ place...

A week after that she decided that she loved me and wanted to work on us. She came back, I left her as much space as she needed. The first night she spent it on the couch and then the second night she gave me a hug and touched my arm a bit, nothing too serious, and then slept in the same bed with me asking me for a kiss before going to sleep.

The third night I unloaded my bag so I let her know that I feel the guilt, like I fucked up everything by being closed off and being stupid to leave her and not being as much present as I used to be. She after this came in my chest and cuddled me “sensually” and kissed me deeply.

The day after, she came back from work and I saw in her that she was different, a bit weird, bizarre, like she was hiding something. I then asked her if she had something she would like to tell me. She then sat down and told me that she’s not loving me anymore and that she has difficulty trying to work on our relationship and seeing me giving my 2000% for her and she could not give that much to me. She also told me that the whole week she was giving me love not because she wanted to but because she knew I wanted it.

We then had a big conversation, a rough one, and concluded that it’s maybe too early to take the big decision to completely cut off the bridges. The night after I exploded, my heart is destroyed, I don’t know what to think or do anymore, so I go for a car ride alone. She then started texting me a lot. She started asking me where I am and if I want to watch a movie with her. I said yes. We watched the movie, she asked for my hand, I gave her. We then went to bed, she asked me “can I cuddle with you? I need reassurance.” I said yes. We then did some adult stuff...

And now we are 2 days after the movie night. She didn’t tell me I love you or cuddled me since... but this morning before leaving to work she came in the room and kissed me goodbye and said I love you. I love her so much. I have no idea what to do anymore. What to think... I’m lost... I’m hurt... and I want some advice and some exterior advice on my situation.

TL;DR: Been with my girlfriend for 6 years, just bought a house. I went through a rough couple of months and got distant. She started gaming and connecting with a coworker, developed feelings for him, and said she loves me less. We broke up, then she came back saying she wanted to try again, but now she’s unsure and says she doesn’t love me anymore. I’m heartbroken, confused, and don’t know what to do.

ANSWER: Could 2 months of you withdrawing cause this much damage to a 6 year relationship that you describe as great and perfect?

I wonder if she saw it as great and perfect the way that you did.

QUESTION: [UPDATE - 7 years later] For years, my [35F] husband [37M] said that if I want stability in our life, I have to make it happen. I did. And now things are worse than ever. Help?

I was recently cleaning out my bookmarks and [found this old throwaway](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9tdkqa/for_years_my_35f_husband_37m_said_that_if_i_want/), and obviously the two posts I made with it. I'm not sure why now, but I feel compelled to write a followup. Maybe it'll give people the bravery to change or at least an example of how sticking with what you know isn't always the best choice.

An obviously very long story short, with the help of those posts and a lot of long nights of thinking, I left my husband. In fact, it took him going away for a long weekend to realize how much happier and at peace I felt without him around... At first the split was amicable, but looking back I think he was just waiting for me to come rushing back to him once I "realized my mistake." When that didn't happen and he could see I was actually serious about building a new life for myself, a switch flipped. We only spoke when he needed something from me and eventually that stopped too. Enough about him.

I'm now 42, happier and healthier and more satisfied than I've been my whole life. I picked me and that was the best choice I could've ever made. I lived alone for the first time and my god, the peace of having my own space... unrivaled. I ended up staying in that apartment for 5 years, not a moving box in sight. I put art on the walls, I knew my neighbors. I made a home. I grew my career and went back to school. Made friends, built a little community.

I've done a ton of therapy and realized that the abusive patterns my parents created in childhood were just repeating with my ex. I fell in love, a real love, a supportive love that encourages growth and security. I'm doing new work, work that helps people and is so much more than just chasing money. All of those things have created a life that's more rewarding than I ever thought possible for myself.

I've gone through some really shitty times too, illness, cancer scares, deaths, loss... but I have no idea how I would've come out the other side without the community I'd built around me. Even something as simple as people at your local coffee shop recognizing you is a comfort after feeling adrift and alone for so long. Anyway, if I were to respond to myself from 7 years ago, this is what I would say.

>Leave the loser. He doesn't care about you, never did. He only cares about what you can do for him and now that you aren't serving him... well. Just go. You are capable of doing difficult things, and you are worthy of the work it takes to accomplish them. Trust your abilities, trust your gut - it's been screaming at you for years now, honey. Life can be so much more than you've experienced, but you have to make it happen for yourself.

TL;DR: Left my husband, happier than ever.

EDIT: I'm surprised but happy this found so many people! I genuinely thought I was going to bookend this story and have it disappear into the ether. But whatever urge I had to write it, and whatever brought you to reading it... who knows? Maybe it was meant to. Thank you for all the messages and comments, I feel so grateful to have this perspective and experience.

ANSWER: It's really ridiculous the mount [edit: amount] of women I know who leave marriages and blossom, thrive, are so much happier for it. You don't see that much talked about in the outside world. It's really remarkable.

QUESTION: I am considering leaving my husband over keeping a lock on on of our doors and refusing to open it

Hi everyone. Very sad to be posting this but I F29 am considering separating from my husband M33 of 5 years over a big issue we just had a couple of days ago. My husband has always cared about his things, and he puts all his valuables in his office where he works remotely 3 days a week. He put a lock on the outside of the office door 6 months ago to supposedly keep his things safe from our destructive toddler. I let it go, but found it a bit odd since the key is usually no where to be found.

Anyways, I recently went in the office to get our bird's perch out the room, and he was hovering acting really suspicious. He defensively said what do you need in there? And I said the bird's perch...but then instantly felt he was hiding something from me. I also noticed he locked the door after that. After we put our toddler to sleep, I told him I needed to go in the room to change the sheets on our guest mattress because we have visitors soon. He was acting defensive again and said he would do it another time. That is when I said what are you hiding in there? You are getting really defensive, and its weird that I am locked out of a space in my own home and have to ask permission to enter. He got more defensive until I eventually said you need to unlock the door and let me see what is in there because you are hiding something.

Long story short, he admitted to hiding weed in the room and playing video games when I go to sleep. But he REFUSED to open the door. I told him i'm going to sit by the door until he unlocks it because I think he is hiding something worse since those things aren't that big of a deal. You guys, he literally refused. I tried begging, I tried getting the lock open, I tried everything I could think of. Not only would he not unlock the door, but he was gaslighting me the entire time telling me i'm crazy and it must be my pregnancy hormones thinking there was something else in there? He said that if he opens the door, he would be giving in to my pushiness. He also kept touching my leg and telling me he was sorry i'm going through this like I was making all of this up in my head.

Unfortunately, I got too tired around 2am (keep in mine i'm pregnant having to deal with this) and told him i'm going to sleep and whatever he is hiding in there he can get rid of in the morning, but i'm done. In the morning, the room was perfectly staged with his little weed pen out and switch game. He has changed the lock on the door to a normal one that only locks when someone is in the room, but still seems to see no problem with what he has done. He is still adamant that it is perfectly normal to lock a door from the outside if you have important things in there. He also said there was nothing else in there and he just couldn't for the life of him let me in after I said we needed to go through his stuff. He said that was controlling behavior and giving in would be saying that was okay.

I guess what i'm asking is...is it normal to put a lock on an office door even on the outside? Would a separation by the best next steps? I have a toddler and a baby coming, and really don't want to have to do this alone if I don't need to.

ANSWER: Yeah he was hiding something in there. If you’re lucky it’s something he’s just embarrassed by that he doesn’t want to share. But if it’s not that, I’d guess hard drugs or a porn habit that’s borderline cheating, since apparently he needs somewhere private to indulge. You could try asking him for a drug test to see how he responds.

QUESTION: My boyfriend turned me into a baby and I don’t feel like myself anymore

I (30F) used to be a very independent person. For example, I’ve travelled to over 30 countries all by myself by age 25. I knew how to survive anywhere in the world. My parents were abusive, so I escaped home and lived on my own as soon as I became an adult. I enjoyed living by myself and doing everything by myself.

Then I met my boyfriend (27M) a few years ago. Despite being younger than me, he treats me like a baby and started doing everything for me. He always takes me to work and picks me up after work since I don’t have a car. Without him, I would’ve walked or taken public transport. I’ve always been grateful to him for doing this. Not only that, but he also does all the housework. He does most of grocery shopping and cooking and cleaning and laundry. When we go on a trip, he plans everything.

Life with him was so convenient that I got used to doing nothing by myself in a few years. All my friends say they are jealous that I have such a good boyfriend who does everything for me. I thought so, too. But suddenly I realised that I can’t do anything by myself anymore? When he goes on a business trip and leaves me alone for a week, I find it so stressful and exhausting to do house chores like cooking and cleaning, which I always did by myself before meeting him.

I became much less independent than I was 10 years ago and I don’t feel like myself anymore. On the other hand, I feel like I’m finally receiving the love and treatment I didn’t receive from my parents and it’s compensating my miserable childhood. He says I need to be treated like a baby now because I didn’t have the chance in my childhood.

I’m aware that this isn’t healthy in the long term. What should I change?

TL;DR: I used to be an independent person, but my boyfriend treats me like a baby and does everything for me and now I can’t do things like house chores by myself. I lost the independent person I was and turned into a baby.

ANSWER: Girl you got a guy like this. Start picking up the efforts and put in 50% rather than him doing 90%, and you both are SET. If he continues doing all this, he's gonna be burnt out sooner or later.

QUESTION: Bf (19m) and I (17f) were mugged. He ran away and left me alone with the mugger. I can't see him in the same light anymore

Yesterday I was hanging out with my bf and we were in a not so great part of our city. Suddenly a guy approached us to ask for indications and asked us to help him get there and we helped him (stupid i know). After getting there he pulled out a knife and asked for all our money.

Bf ran away and left me alone with the mugger. Lucklily he just wanted my money so i gave him all the money i had and then he went away.

After that i went inside a bar and called my parents. My parents were furious with bf and tried to call him but he did not pick up. We then went to the police and then returned home and after maybe 2 hours i received a call from bf asking me where i was and telling me he alerted the police. I exploded on him and he did not even apologized but kept telling me he did the best he could.

My question is: is there any way to recover from this? My image of him is shattered

TL;DR: boyfriend left me during a mugging. I can't see him in the same light anymore

ANSWER: >>  is there any way to recover from this?

I personally do not think so. I am so sorry this happened to you.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (26F) think my boyfriend (30M) is exaggerating or faking his illness

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jefjhu/help\_i\_26f\_think\_my\_boyfriend\_30m\_is\_exaggerating/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jefjhu/help_i_26f_think_my_boyfriend_30m_is_exaggerating/)

Thank you to everyone who responded to my post and was so compassionate and kind. It was incredible to hear from so many people who actively battle chronic pain/illness and those with loved ones who do. I hope to continue deepening my empathy towards anyone who is struggling with an invisible illness.

On to my update. Armed with some fresh perspectives (and some fresh frustrations, lol) I talked to my boyfriend and told him that he needs to see a doctor or I will no longer be able to support him financially and stand by while he remains unemployed and unmotivated to get the help he needs. I also addressed the idea of managing/balancing his energy levels differently so that we're able to share household responsibilities more effectively, spend quality time together, and keep him doing the things he loves with his friends.

His response was...really bad. He told me that if I'm not willing to "step up and clean around the house" (something I'm already doing) that there's no use living together and that my efforts to clean are the bare minimum and not good enough for his standards anyway. He was also really mad that I haven't taken initiative to take care of yard projects and car repairs. He sat there and spouted off a whole list of things I'm not noticing and cleaning. And, once again, he was focused on this idea that I don't like his friends/am jealous of them and want him spending less time with them, which isn't true at all.

This really stung. He basically brushed over everything I said and focused on my perceived faults. This told me everything I need to know and I told him I was leaving. He was just...mad. Not sad or hurt at all. I'm still crying excessively over his whole reaction. I still don't know how real or unreal his chronic pain is, but I guess it doesn't matter anymore.

Thank you again, everyone, for your support and kindness. I'm truly at a loss.

TLDR: My (26F) boyfriend (30M) of almost two years and I have separated over his inability to address his chronic pain.

ANSWER: OP, I remember your first post. I know you’re very sad right now, and you have a right to be. But don’t let grief overstay its welcome — you are so much better off and he just lost his bang maid, expect him to come crawling back when he realizes you’re serious. Don’t believe anything he says.

This internet stranger is proud of you. You deserve someone who can be your partner regardless of whether they have an illness — that doesn’t mean they’re critical or cruel.

QUESTION: My Husband Told Me He’s Filing For Divorce Today

My Husband (34M) told me (32F) that he’s fed up and going to file for divorce.  We’ve been married for 1 year, together for 4 years. He is very angry, and I feel depleted and numb.

Backstory: 
My husband suffers from a type of OCD called Relationship OCD otherwise known as Retroactive Jealousy. It is where he fixates on my past sexual relationships, particularly on one person, a person who I have not even spoken to in over 8 years.

He can get triggered anytime, anywhere. We could be watching TV and a character will have the same name and he will get triggered. Last weekend, we were at a concert celebrating our one year wedding anniversary and someone came on stage wearing a jersey that is for the same sport this person used to play. He wanted to leave the concert immediately, we ended up fighting and our anniversary was ruined.

Anytime he is triggered, his energy completely shifts from warm, goofy and loving to ice cold and bothered and he shuts me out. It is a very sad, confusing, frustrating and isolating experience for me and for him, it’s mental turmoil.

Pretty much every single fight we have had in our relationship has stemmed from his retroactive jealousy. Other than that, we’ve been extremely happy. Unfortunately, every time he gets triggered it chips away at my happiness. I walk on eggshells and feel anxiety sometimes because I never know when he will get triggered next.

I thought he might get better with time / after marriage because he would finally see that I want him and only him forever, I was wrong.

Ever since he was triggered on our anniversary last weekend and we fought, things have never been worse. Something feels different about this time, like I finally realized this isn’t going away or I’ve hit my breaking point. We’ve been cordial to each other all week and sleeping in the same bed but no sex.

Yesterday, he asked me if “I’m ready to go back to being loving again”. I told him my concerns and how he needs to seek support / medication for this RJ. I also thanked him for giving me space (which literally just meant not initiating sex) and he got an attitude and say “yea well I was upset too”.

It felt clear to me in this moment that he wasn’t really listening to me and to be fair, I sometimes have a difficult time seeing things from his side as well. Sometimes his aggressive approach and victim mindset in conversation makes me automatically defensive.

He ended up storming out of the room and slept in the guest room (where he always sleeps when he’s upset or for his everyday naps) and has been slamming every door he walks through ever since.

At this point, there is so much tension that I told him I will move his things from the master bedroom to the guest room so that we both can have space to process what we’re feeling.

He left for the day to go golfing, a new hobby he picked up that he has trashed for the last 4 years.. While he was away I moved his stuff. I did not move it to upset him, I truly feel broken and anxious when I’m around him now and just need a little space to process everything.

He came home from golf and was livid. He said he wasn’t interested in being roommates and this was no way to live. I told him once again that I need space to process everything and he said rudely “you’ve had enough space, you’ve had a week of space. Instead of moving my belongings all day you could have instead come up with a way to communicate.” I told him I did try communicating with him yesterday and he got upset. I told him that the way he is currently speaking to me is with an aggressive tone to which he replied “Because I’m angry! This is ridiculous. I won’t be married to someone who can’t resolve simple issues, I won’t have kids with that person, I’m filing for divorce.”

I responded that I don’t want a divorce all I am asking for is a little space for us to work through this. I don’t remember what he responded but he didn’t care that I said that and I think again he just repeated he was filing for divorce.

After he said that he left the house. The crazy part is I still don’t feel much? I don’t feel angry or sad, just numb. Perhaps I’m over it or it could be some kind of coping mechanism to protect myself.

I’ve never spoken to friends or family about his RJ because I love him and didn’t want them to think negatively about him. I think it’s finally time I open up to my mother about it. I feel very alone.

I’m not sure what to do or where to go from here. I’ve never been more in love with anyone in my life. He was caring, made me laugh, bought me flowers, supported me when I was laid off from my job, etc. but I am just not sure I can be in this relationship anymore now with how he’s acting. Not taking accountability, being rude to me and instead of giving me the space I need, threatening to divorce instead.

REDDIT: It would help to hear from you (an outside perspective) on this. I am too in it to think clearly at the moment. Even if no one responds, it felt nice to be able to type this out.

TL;DR: Husband has ROCD (retroactive jealousy) that causes most of our fights. After a bad trigger on our anniversary, he’s now threatening divorce because I asked for space, claiming I am incapable of solving issues. I feel numb and don’t know if this relationship is salvageable.

____________________

UPDATE: I am blown away at the amount of support this post has gotten. Thank you to everyone who has responded and to the mod of this post for giving me a great book recommendation. As many of you guessed, his threat of divorce was not real.

For the first time in 4 years I truly put my foot down and told my husband that I will no longer put up with this treatment. I told him that if he continues to choose not to seek help and instead continue to hurt me, then I’m not staying (and he knows I mean it). I told him I love him, but I love me and my mental health more.

Since this long conversation he has set up an immediate plan:

Daily plan: 
 Morning reflection / meditation
 Medicine / Vitamins: Fluoxetine, magnesium, omega 3
 Workout

Weekly plan:
 Meet with therapist / start ERP (first session is scheduled for this weekend)
 Read 50 pages of self help books: 
     The Art of Letting Go - read by 10/1
     The Happiness Trap - read by 10/1
     Overcoming Retroactive Jealousy - read by 10/15
     Brain Lock: Overcoming OCD -  read by 10/30

I told him that I support him, but that he needs to do deep reflection and work on himself before we can start rebuilding our relationship. I plan on leaving town this week to spend some time with my mother and will be working on an exit plan to have just in case the day comes.

I have found a lot of strength and growth within myself throughout this process,  and am very proud of myself.

I can’t describe how it felt going from feeling so isolated and alone to feeling like I have a community who supports me through this post. So if you’re scrolling and see someone who needs help, just know that your comment can make a big difference. <3

ANSWER: This divorce would be a gift, honestly.

I don't know if this is genuine, but its absolutely wild.

QUESTION: UPDATE:  My boyfriend [M24] and I [F24] have too much sex and I can´t handle it anymore. How do I explain it to him that it exhausts me and how do I negotiate new intimacy with him?

Original post: [My boyfriend \[M24\] and I \[F24\] have too much sex and I can´t handle it anymore. How do I explain it to him that it exhausts me and how do I negotiate new intimacy with him? : r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ge7l3a/my_boyfriend_m24_and_i_f24_have_too_much_sex_and/)

I spend a lot of time reading through everyone's replies and looking inwards about how I feel. I gathered my thoughts and spend a few days making a list of what I wanted to say when we have the big conversation. On a weekend when we had planned to spend the day together I sat him down and told him the following points:

I love him to the moon and back and want to show him that I love him, make him feel desired, loved and appreciated

BUT

Having so much sex with such frequency is physically exhausting to me which causes me to avoid sex and even sex acts I enjoy because I don´t have enough energy and motivation to do it. This also causes me to orgasm not as often anymore. I also need time to physically recover before it may even start to become painful. I feel like sex has become the single defining aspect of our relationship and many other parts like doing activities together, romantic dates, just talking and cuddling have taken a backseat. I also feel exhausted emotionally and underappreciated from giving as much as I can (which I gladly do for the people I love) while little comes back from the other side of the relationship.

I then proceeded to explain the things I like during sex and what makes me go wild, hoping to show him that I still want to have sex with him. I also made a few more compliments just to keep the vibe positive and because I meant it.

He reacted pretty well all things considered. He listened and let me finish, but asked for a little time to think about it. Obviously I gladly agreed. We spend the rest of the day together without him initiating once. At the end of the day he said that he wants me to enjoy sex just as much as he does and that he loves me.

I was really hopeful for the next week and a half. We spend our time together like usual and he asked for sex about one half as often as before our talk. We even had days without sex at all. He also started to ask "Do you want to have sex with me?" instead of physically initiating like he did before, like touching me somewhere, hugging me from behind and similar things. He also stopped asking for pictures of me and when he did it were just selfies. I was so happy that I even took the initiative once and he seemingly loved it when I asked for sex.

Then one day he sat me down with a stern look and said that he hated what this relationship has turned into. To him it feels like we are now just roommates or platonic friends instead of lovers. He told me that the one time I initiated after he was overjoyed to finally "fuck me again" his heart was broken because I suddenly wasn´t as submissive as usually (I asked to be eaten out and was on top with some more dominant dirty talk) and that all of that is not what he signed up for. He doesn´t want to walk on eggshells waiting for when I am finally in the mood, but have what he deserves in the relationship.

Basically he gave me an ultimatum: either we return to how it was before the talk starting right now or he leaves me. Guess who doesn´t have a boyfriend anymore?

I spend the last few days bawling my eyes out and eating lots of ice cream and watching some shitty shows. What he said hurt me a lot and I do not love him anymore, but still the feeling of loss and sadness is all too real.    He was my first relationship and for the past two years he was my entire world. No I have to gather up the broken shards he left behind.

TL;DR: I took your advice and talked with him about my feelings. He pretended to be ok with it for a while and then left me after demanding more sex again.

ANSWER: Yeesh I'm sorry, but I'm so glad you stood up for yourself, because the way he reacted exposed even more red flags.

Do not take him back if he asks, he may try to manipulate you with the breakup so that you're more submissive next time.

QUESTION: I don’t want to relocate to India with my husband

Tldr: I, European 26, f doesn’t want ro relocate to India with my husband Punjabi 29, m due to cultural differences and lifestyle changes being too much for me to handle.

My husband is a Punjabi and I am a European NZ. We have been married for three years and he has been living in New Zealand for 10 years. I have been to India many times for three months at a time each go.

My husband has decided he wants to relocate us to India permanently, I really don’t want to. I would never force him to distance himself from his roots but I honestly don’t think I could cope with India for atleast 6 - 8 months a year, he said we could visit NZ yearly apparently. I made a compromise with him that I visit India for three months  a year and he can stay 6-8 months a year. He says life in India would be better for us because we would have more money and he has more connections in business there etc. My husband didn’t agree to this and said where ever and whatever the husband says the wife should follow. He said he Weill buy me a car in India and I can get a job teaching English to pre schoolers. I can only speak the basics on Punjabi and no one in Punjab but his parents and a few of his relatives who don’t speak English anyway.

I am really conflicted and cry about this often because I feel like I’m going to be giving up my freedom and individuality.

The times I have stayed in India have been hard at some points as my husbands house is rural and I can’t leave or go anywhere without him. I don’t get to wear what I like and to be honest if I say I don’t want to eat or drink something that is culturally Punjabi I found his family judged me so much. His parents also told me to stop watching English tv shows in the house. I followed their instructions and turned it off but felt super sad after wards.

I think that maybe I am being selfish for not wanting to live in India but I don’t want to be trapped with no where to go. I think I will go mad. Any insight on my situation would be appreciated. Sorry my paragraphs and words are all over the place, my thoughts in my head and just a mess at the moment.

ANSWER: “Whatever the husband says, the wife should do.” He’s telling you who he is. Just wait until you are isolated and surrounded by this belief/culture.

QUESTION: UPDATE: Boyfriend slept with someone else while we were on a break

Origional post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Z9RsQy6S1Y

Firstly, thank you for all the useful advice I was given on my original post. I was unable to reply because it was locked but thank you all.

Since I found out my (39F) boyfriend (40M) of 14 years slept with someone else, I broke up with him. He stayed living in my flat for 2 months (on a tight deadline) so he could find a home as he is jobless. He didn't. He is now homeless.

His mum pressured me to have him for longer as there is a cold snap here and he's on the streets but I said no. His mum can take him in if she is so worried.

I found out it was the lady he has been spending time with at the gym. I think he wanted to try that to see if it was better.

That is all. I now live alone (with dog).

TLDR: I chucked him out. He's homeless.

ANSWER: If he knew he was going to be homeless that far in advance and didn't sort out any income then that's on him. Who would want to have anything to do with someone who behaves like that.

QUESTION: My husband (63M) goes cycling way too much leaving me, his (60F) wife alone. How do I help him understand he's losing me?

Good people, I need some help.

My husband (63M) and I (60F) have been happily married 30+ years. Five or so years ago he started cycling. He loved it and I was happy he found something he enjoyed and was good for him although I felt he was spending too much money on bikes, tools, supplies, rides in races and weekend trips.

The last few years have been bad with the time he spends riding. It’s getting unbearable for me. He’s gone all the time. He takes two cycling classes a week at the gym, he rides there when he’s not taking classes and he’s out on the road or a path 4-6 days a week for 4-6 or 7 hours at a time coming home after 10 at night on weeknights. Oh, and works a full-time job on top of this.

Last month we went to Florida for three days to visit my family and of course he had to rent a bike and ride. In the last 5 months he’s left me alone to ride on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, Easter and Mother’s Day. He probably went riding on Valentines Day too, I don’t remember. As I post this, he’s in Chillicothe Ohio on a weekend ride and visit with friends.

This is not a communication issue as I have joked, talked, complained, yelled and cried and cried all many many times. I love my husband dearly and don’t want a divorce. But I can’t take being alone anymore. I'd rather be separated and alone than married and alone. But if I leave him, I feel I’d be letting our kids and grandkids down. I’m so lost and don’t know what to do. Nothing I do or say makes a difference to him.

I'm hoping a few people are willing to comment so I can show him this and maybe we can both learn something, or I can gain some insight. Thanks ahead for your helpful comments.

TLDR, My husband rides his bike and leaves me, his wife alone way too much and I have no idea what to do. Can you please offer some advice?

ANSWER: I'd sit down and talk about this and focus ENTIRELY on you and what you need. Do not say the words "you are cycling too much" or it will become an argument about whether he is cycling too much. Instead, say 'I need to spend more time with you" or "I need to know that you'll be physically present on holidays and vacations" and ask him how he's going to make that happen.

QUESTION: Wife is a whole new person after giving birth. I’m scared i’m going to lose her.

My wife [30F] gave birth to our daughter 4 months ago. She doesnt work so she is a sahm. She is NOT the same person she was before the baby. Before birth we got into a serious argument maybe once every few months, now it's almost every weekend for almost no reason. Monday we were supposed to have a date night (drinking wine, watching movies, playing games, ends with sexual relations usually I'm (32M) holding her while we're watching a movie and she randomly blew up on me for no reason. Said she's sick of me and doesnt ever want to have sex again then storms out and locks herself in the bedroom. I prioritize her wellbeing. Make sure she's fed, hydrated, doing well mentally when she's with our daughter. She doesn't even seem happy to see me anymore when I'm home from work. Past fights recently have been about how she's not happy with me anymore after i snapped back one time about her nitpicking everything ive been doing recently (she has never once mentioned this before the baby), she's snapped on me because the baby was crying and I couldn't get her to sleep fast enough, also screamed at me because i ran a yellow light with her in the car. When we fight it's really hurtful things being said to me and I'm always saying sorry trying to defuse. I've done maybe 95% of the feedings at night so she can get about 7/8 hours of sleep consecutively and take baby from the moment i return from work so she can get alone time. I also do a lot of the household chores for her and it seems to land on deaf ears. She refuses counseling and won't talk to me about it and doesn't think it's a big deal. It seems like our marriage is close to an end and I'm scared. I care so much about her I hate seeing her like this. Can anyone relate?

TL;DR: wife gave birth 4 months ago and now randomly hates my very existence.

ANSWER: It could be postpartum depression or anxiety.

Four months post birth is a difficult time regardless, she may also be struggling to adapt to her new life. I remember there were moments where I felt like I hated my husband, especially in the early days.

I would try and get her to speak to a doctor.

QUESTION: Update: I told my boyfriend I loved him right after we had sex. How badly did I mess up?

Sl I (33f) made a post the other night (which can be found here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/TvHzNz4WpV) about how I’m with my first ever boyfriend (37m) and told him right after we had sex that I loved him and he didn’t immediately say it back so I freaked out and tried to backtrack before shutting him down and saying I wanted to move on. I left shortly after and just shut myself out from him for most of the next day. This morning I got a text message from him that said he misses me and was really loved to go out tonight, so I figured what the hell and we went out. While we were out, there was a moment during dinner that I reached over and held his hand and told him I was sorry I ignored him and told him about my abandonment issues and how self-destructive I can be when I’m scared people will leave me. I’m sure it’ll come as absolutely no shock to anyone that he was lovely and patient with me. We went back to his place and were snuggling and I was starting to fade away to sleep…

…then he said “love you, beautiful” (“beautiful” is his pet name for me. Corny but he says it’s very fitting lol). I stopped and then looked over at him, and then he said “you don’t have to say it back.” I said “but what if I wanna say it back?” and he told me to go ahead and I said “I love you too.” I rolled over on him and gave him a nice long kiss and then put my forehead on his before I started crying a little bit. I cannot tell you how badly I’ve wanted to say that to someone since I was 14 and it doesn’t even feel real. Feels like some dream I had that was nice but didn’t happen.

Riding this emotional high I can’t sleep so I’m writing this while he’s sleeping next to me. I have to get up in four hours to have enough time to go back home and get ready for work, but I don’t care. One bad day of crap sleep is forgettable, I’m gonna remember this night for the rest of my life. It’s way too soon for this, but I’m already getting giddy about putting my name in front of his last name.

So yeah. I’m in love you guys <3

tl;dr: follow up to the situation with me telling my boyfriend I loved him. He forgave me for shutting me out and later told me he loved me too.

ANSWER: If we're talking about silly crap we did after only two months... I had a psychotic episode and ran down the highway trying to get away from a guy I met on tinder screaming he was trying to kill me.

We've been together 4 years.

QUESTION: I (43F) read my fiancee's (56M) journals and don't know if I can marry him now

I (43F) am using a throwaway for obvious reasons here. Before I start YES I know I am a huge jerk for snooping in his (56M) email and I definitely found trouble, I accept that. I was working on his computer and his gmail was open and I saw my name so I opened it and it was a Word doc that he journaled. Curious of course I searched his inbox with my name and saw his entries and read them. Some of what he said has devastated me and shaken me to the core. We have been together almost 3 years, the first year on and off and was rocky. We have been living together since the summer. He is not home and I have not brought this up yet. I think I might faint and need some space. Should I get some distance and go to a hotel for the weekend? I thought we were in a great place. Over the past 10 months these are some of the things he's written about me: For reference i put \\\\ in place of my name.

"There are moments, in my dark thoughts, where I feel like being with her is a compromise for me, like this somehow diminishes me and that I am settling for her because I have ruined all of my other prospects and I’m too old to find someone else."

"At times, I wish she had stayed out of my life.  I wonder if I had stayed on my own if someone better would have come into my orbit.  There is so much to deal with, so many bad feelings and darkness.  I find that I am thinking about Lauren a lot but who’s to say that she would be any better.  The reality is that I met her on tour and fucked her a day later.  What kind of woman is that? I feel like I have pissed my life away and this is all that I am entitled to.  I have pissed away all of the good things in my life."

"Someone like \\\\ would never have been able to get to me. When I was younger, I had many opportunities to be with women like her but declined. I am uncertain about whether this is a good thought pattern to have."

"My mind wanders to places, like what it would have been like if someone like Lauren could have been in my life instead of \\\\.  Lauren has the advantage of existing in my mind as an ideal.  We never really got the chance to know each other outside of two nights and a week of texting and talking on the phone.  I know that she had a drug past but has been sober for over a decade.  I don’t think she was promiscuous; most guys that I know that knew her in the old days indicated that she didn’t have a lot of men in her life.  That’s not to say that there hasn’t been a lot of darkness in her life. It would have been easier to be with her.  There weren’t all of these men in her orbit like \\\\.  She was never married, so there was no divorce.  She’s not as emotionally damaged as \\\\.  In some ways, I feel like being with \\\\ is some sort of karmic thing, like this is what I deserve for being non-committal for most of my life.  I have my own damage.  Everyone likes to think that they are a good person but there are moments when I am not so sure about myself."

TL:DR I am not sure if I can go forward with this relationship after reading this.

ANSWER: One: if he could get with Lauren, he'd soon be finding fault with her, too.

Two: run as fast as you can. He doesn't even like you, at all. Don't be a placeholder. You're not even second best here.

I'm sorry for how you feel atm, but it's good that you know so you can make your own decisions.

QUESTION: Update: husband has a new chosen family he prioritizes and sees every week, I’m jealous and frustrated

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/JwBnrT9EL9

It’s been a while since- our little boy is 2.5 now. Thank you to everyone who commented - it was the kick in the butt I needed to lay down the law. Esp the folks that rightly pointed out I was a passive doormat without self respect — that stung but was true.

After my post, I had a big sit down with John on my the things I was upset about. My husband was traveling to be a groomsman for a good friend — I told him to stay out there for an additional week and decide: 
1. if he wanted to stay married and wanted to be a family
2. If he wanted the above, think about what needed to change on his part (not just Pam but other stuff too), how he was going to be a good husband/father going forward
3. Arrange to go over it with me and our marriage counselor on his return

Alternatively, if he didn’t do the above then when he got back we’d start logistics on separation and co-parenting.

And surprisingly, he did all the above. Apparently he reflected a lot at the wedding (his friend and his wife are such an in love couple) and thought a lot about us and our relationship and what he wanted.

He came back and proposed changes (immediate break from Pam/company and stop to their hobby — he’d play some dnd / mtg online but that was it), he’d take over remaining baby prep (nursery, logistics), and   promised to lay out a post-partum care plan for me and baby. He stuck to his word and also worked hard to regain my trust.

Then we had our son and my husband was over the moon in love. He and baby have been inseparable ever since and have an amazing adventure filled life with all the hobbies (baby/toddler swim, gym, soccer, co-op, and a great local parent community). After our kiddo was born Pam lost interest in my husband anyway (she doesn’t like kids) and shortly thereafter cheated on her poly relationship. Kevin and John have actually become good friends since then, but John is straight so I have no worries there.  And as I’ve reflected — I think I also just actually hated Pam — she’s everything I don’t like relying on men for affirmation, no job/life ambition, frivolous and stupid. And apparently (according to Kevin) the feeling was mutual - she thought I was a controlling, stuck up, robotic ivy league workaholic who didn’t appreciate or support my husbands hobbies/quirks. I was also a lot more emotiobal during pregnancy than normal. My husband- upon reflection liked being needed and admired

We had a lot to work through with us, but two years later we’re in a great spot (I also had a weird shift in hormones post-partum which made my sex drive really really high which for us helped a lot with our relationship). Didn’t want this to be too long, but there were a lot of changes we implemented to get back to a loving place. John feels a lot of purpose in being a dad and supported me as my career has taken off. Sometimes things are still hard (my job is really high stress, toddlers are a lot of work, etc).

But we’re pretty happy. We spent this morning snuggling in bed with our toddler and dog pretending we were on a boat, making hair dryer sounds, and giving hugs. We live a pretty boring suburban kind of life - but it works for us.

Thanks everyone for the push for me to stand up for what I wanted and needed.

ANSWER: What a great update. I'm so glad your husband honestly reflected and chose you and the baby. Hope it stays that way!

QUESTION: Friend's [34M] Girlfriend [33F] Called Me [36F] A Pick-Me And Now My Friends Want Me To Apologize?

Hi everyone, I need some advice. I (36F) have a group of five friends. We hang out together a lot, playing video games, going to Friday Night Magic, watching movies, D&D, and just generally being nerdy. One of the friend group \[34M\], Bruce, has recently gotten a new girlfriend and we've tried to include her in our get togethers. The girlfriend \[33F\], I'll call her Silver, really seems to hate me, and I'm not sure what to do. I didn't notice it at first, if I'm honest. She came along to our May the 4th/Return of the 5th party/sleepover, one friend Peter \[35M\] helped her make a paladin to join in on a D&D one-shot when she said she wanted to learn, she's come along to FNM multiple times, etc.

However, the other night, while I was having a passionate debate with another friend, Steve \[36M\] about the atrocity that was Hush 2 from DC Comics, Silver absolutely lost it at me. She started yelling about how I was a 'Pick-Me' and how I was mad that she was in the group and that I wanted to sleep with all the boys \[?!?!?!\] but especially Peter. She yelled for like five minutes, while I just sat there like a deer in headlights, because I didn't know what to say? She accused me of making my Warlock sexy in D&D to make the boys want me, that I picked a "Pretty girl card" for my deck in Magic, that I tried to "dress sexy" for May the 4th. \[I wore an Ahsoka sleeveless tank top, no straps, just sleeveless.\]

I tried to tell her I have no interest in sleeping with Bruce, or any of my guy friends, and she just burst into tears. Peter said that maybe I should go, for now, because she was upset, so I did.

Now, on Discord, a bunch of them \[Peter, Bruce, Steve and Michael (33M) have all said I should apologize to her, with only Clark \[35M\] saying I have nothing to apologize for. There's been a lot of talk about 'keeping the peace,' but I'm not sure what I should apologize for? I didn't make a move on anyone. I haven't slept with or tried to sleep with any of my friends.

I'm not sure what I should do, or what I can do. I don't know what to apologize for and I feel like my friends are siding with her.

TL;DR: Friend's girlfriend called me a pick-me and went on a rant about how I'm trying to sleep with everyone and now my friends want me to apologize to her.

ANSWER: Sounds like she has major insecurity issues and sees you as a threat without really knowing you.  I would hold my ground and hopefully your friends come around since it seems like you are a decent person.

QUESTION: UPDATE 6 years later: I (F26) am in love with my best friend (M26) but he thinks a relationship is doomed to fail

Original post can be found  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dzdykr/i_f26_am_in_love_with_my_best_friend_m26_but_he/)

6 years ago I was here lamenting the feelings I caught for my fwb turned best friend (let’s call him Franky).

After the initial pain of rejection, we both agreed to stay best friends. We moved in together with 3 of our other friends, and lived as platonic roommates. We confided in each other all our dating woes, cooked together most nights, and continued having fun nights out. During that time I grew equally close to my other roommates, and had a casual Covid lockdown fling with one who is now one of my closest friends (shocker).

After 3 years of living together, I had finally (mostly) gotten over my feelings for Franky. We were both casually dating other people and in a good place. I had spent many holidays with his extended family as his best friend, and was content knowing that I had a life long friend. Then he had a big health scare. It ended up not being anything major, but at the time put a lot of things into perspective for the both of us.

The night Franky returned from the hospital we had a heart to heart. I cried as I told him how scared I was during the emergency and it ended with us both deciding to try dating seriously.

We moved out of the group house with our friends to a small condo together. It took some time to change from an awkward platonic relationship to a truly romantic one, but we allowed the relationship to take its own time and course.

It’s been 3 years together now. He is currently cradling our shared cat as we plan a romantic weekend get away to New York. He was right, after the one year mark we sat and had a big talk. We talked about what each of us needed to work on to continue the relationship. Instead of it being a relationship death sentence, it lead to both of us getting therapy, making positive changes, and brought us even closer.

We now have such open communication that even after 3 years we have not had a fight. I could not be happier to have my person, as well as the wonderful family that I now get to be a part of.

TLDR; after 3 years of remaining besties, a mortality check pushed us together. Celebrating 3 years of bliss and hopefully more to come :)

ANSWER: Love this for u both. also a good reminder that love doesn’t have an expiry date, it can come back around when both ppl are actually ready.

QUESTION: My (21f) bf (25m) is going on a week long trip to Italy. How do I not resent him?

So my bf of 2 years along with 7 of his coworkers got invited by his work to go on a one week trip to Italy. Everything is completely paid for. Meals, flights, excursions, they are renting a private yacht, they’re staying on a mansion on the beach. Literally a trip of a lifetime and he didn’t have to pay a dime

When he first told me I was honestly I was anxious because 7 months ago he had previously did something to break my trust and we were trying to build back. Come about a week away from his trip to Italy I found out that he had an option to bring a +1, expenses all completely paid for as well. literally all their other guys who were going invited their gf/wife. I was the only one left out.

That completely changed how I felt. It wasn’t just a work trip anymore. It felt very personal and left me wondering why he didn’t want to invite me while all the other men had no problem bringing girlfriend along?

When I brought it up he said “he didn’t know it would mean that much to me” and he views it as a “networking and making connections trip and doesn’t want to have to worry about keeping me entertained while he is busy networking and building connections”. Or something along those lines.

He told me I would basically just be sitting in our room the whole time which at least id be sitting in our room in a huge mansion on the beach and private yacht getting fed pasta every night. Instead I’m just sitting at the house.

I feel so hurt and excluded and now he is living his life across the world with him and a bunch of other happy couples while I’m at home trying not to spiral.

I honestly feel a lot of resentment building. He knew I was anxious of him going because of him previously breaking my trust and he knew he had the option to invite me but didn’t. He said he “never considered how id feel and was thinking of it from a different perspective.” Outside of him breaking my trust we have an incredible relationship. We never fight, he pays for my all school/bills, anything I want. Most importantly he is my best friend. And I don’t want to destroy what we have.

My question is am I being over emotional or is this a real red flag? How do I process this and not let it turn into long term resentment?

TL;DR: My bf of two years is going on a two week work trip to Italy along with 7 of his coworkers. All of who brought their gf/wife. I was the only one left out. Now I feel hurt, excluded, and unsure how not to resent him

ANSWER: Come on. He had the option to bring you and chose to spend the week in Italy without even asking you. That’s not someone who wants to spend time with you. Without knowing the details of breaking trust it sounds like Simone who wants to spend his vacation with another woman or at least keep his options open.

QUESTION: Dad (60m) is giving all his money to a 21-year-old he met while driving Uber. I’m at a loss.

My dad (60m) met a 21-year-old while driving for Uber and now I’m watching what looks like a slow-motion trainwreck.

She told him she was homeless, so he started paying for her hotel, got her a job, bought her a car, and in total has given her around $20k… in just two months. The worst part? He doesn’t have that kind of money. He’s borrowed some from me under false pretenses (which I now know went straight to her), and his credit score is in the 300s.

People have tried to warn him. Her friend called him saying she’s still with her ex and using him. Her ex’s mom said the same thing. Every time, she tells my dad they’re just jealous or dislike her.

It’s beyond surreal. He looks like Danny DeVito (no offense to the man), has nothing in savings, and yet thinks this 21-year-old is with him for love. They’ve known each other two months and he already tattooed her name on him. He’s even had the police recover the car he bought her multiple times—until the last time, when she got him to sign it over to her officially.

He swears she never asks for anything, but somehow he’s hemorrhaged $20k since meeting her. I don’t know how to make him see it. I’m torn between trying to intervene or stepping back until he crashes and then helping pick up the pieces… but it’s getting worse fast.

TL;DR: my dad gave 20k to a girl he met in 2 months and thinks she loves him, idk how to get him to realize she's 99% likely using him

ANSWER: Sometimes there's just nothing you can do. Don't give him your money, but on some level the attention this woman is giving him is worth the money to him.

QUESTION: My husband (33M) just asked me to quit my hobby and say goodbye to my hobby friends. I really don't want to say yes to that. What should I do?

Deleted

ANSWER: Are you currently being actively treated for your depression? That’s the root of the problems here. I don’t know if your husband is making your mental state worse, but I have a strong suspicion that your dynamic is.

But no, don’t let your husband isolate you from the only social outlet you have left. Isolation will make you feel even worse.

QUESTION: [Update] I [27F] don’t know how to deal with insecurities from dating bf [28M] who is much more attractive (7 years later)

Ok, a brief, mostly sad update. Previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bbvhkg/i_27f_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_insecurities/)

We got engaged a year ago, which felt like one of the best days of my life. The universe decided no, and earlier this year I found out my fiance cheated on me in the first months of our relationship and slept with his ex model fling a few times even though he had denied there was anything other than friendship between them. Found out because she still shares mutual friends with him and is in the same field, we were all at an event and she made a snide comment about it after a friend heard about our engagement and congratulated me.

I can't really put into words how betrayed I felt, our entire relationship built on lies and years of insecurity being validated after I finally put them to rest. We tried working through it, but I decided to break things off because I don't think I'll ever be able to trust him again. He made sounds about how it was an early mistake and that I'd be throwing away 5 years of our relationship, but tbh I felt like they never became a thing because she wasn't interested in more, not him. So yeah, I wish I could say all of the "but he picked you" comments were correct, but clearly it was too good to be true.

\\tl;dr\\ Starting over at 34 after finding out my fiance actually did cheat on me with his ex fling at the beginning of our relationship

ANSWER: > So yeah, I wish I could say all of the "but he picked you" comments were correct, but clearly it was too good to be true.

Just want to mention that him cheating has absolutely nothing to do with him being "more attractive" than you or even his ex being "more attractive" than you. Men cheat on beautiful women all the time, often with less attractive women and often when they themselves are unattractive.

Cheating is a character flaw. He would likely have cheated on the model too if they'd gotten together for real and will probably cheat on his next partner. I hope in all this you don't internalize that you were right to think he was too good-looking for you because that's absolutely not the problem.

QUESTION: (UPDATE) How do I (47M) tell my boyfriend (35M) that I'm a virgin?

Original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Rrnwj7gcmp

Hey everyone. I'm really greatful for all the advice and support I got on my original post. I posted another updates on the comments of the original.

Summary, I (47M) have been with my boyfriend (35M) for a little under a year. He wants to get physical, and I haven't told him that I've never had sex, because of my history of abuse. After getting advice in the comments, I ended up writing him a letter explaining that I'm a virgin, and touching on some details of my abuse.

I left the letter on the nightstand before I left for work. (My boyfriend works from home) when I got home, his daughter (2F) ran up to me for a hug like she always does. I scooped her up in a hug, and pretended to eat her little fingers.

We had dinner and put her to bed like usual, then my boyfriend asked me to sit on the couch. My stomach tied up in knots, and part of me just wanted to run out the front door.

I have to admit, you were all right. He immediately held my hand and told me he's not disappointed at all. He asked me a bit about my past and the abuse I suffered from my mother. I don't feel comfortable going into detail here, but I barely scratched the surface and I ended up crying in his arms. I never want to be without those arms in my life. His hands rubbing my back, resting my head on his chest to listen to his heartbeat, the smell of his cologne. It's the safest I've ever felt in my entire life.

Once I calmed down, we started looking for therapists near me, then the night went on like normal. Watching our favorite shows while cuddling on the couch, doomscrolling social media and showing each other funny posts. Then we went to bed.

I feel like a weight has lifted off my shoulders. I don't have to hide this about myself anymore. I don't have to live with the fear of my amazing boyfriend seeing me as a lesser man. I won't lie, I'm still anxious about not being able to satisfy him in bed, but we'll work on it together.

I have a therapy appointment for later this month. So things are going good!

Tl;Dr, I wrote my boyfriend a letter, we talked, and now I'm gonna go to therapy.

ANSWER: This literally made me tear up. I’m so glad you found someone who is empathetic and very understanding of your situation. Dealing with trauma in your past, does not invalidate you! You are more than just a body. You’re a living human being, who has gone through so much and deserves the world! Thank you for sharing this, and I’m glad to hear you will be going to therapy. Hopefully that helps you with your mental state, and overall well being. 🫶

QUESTION: Should I [F30] warn my coworker [M24] that he is alienating himself socially?

I [F30] work in a project-based profession. The projects take anywhere from six months to several years and you’re typically working with the same small group for the entire duration.

As a natural consequence of working closely with the same few people, friendships usually form, and we’ll all take lunch together sometimes or go for drinks after work, that kind of thing.

We have an especially copacetic group on my current project. We’ve been working together six months and we go out socially, we talk and joke around during the day. We’re not “friends” but it’s a tight knit group as coworkers go.

We have one coworker [M24] who is alienating himself from the group and I feel awful because he doesn’t seem to be aware of it.

He’s losing the good faith and camaraderie of everyone in the office and he doesn’t seem to understand why it’s happening. I can see that it’s upsetting to him and it’s unpleasant for too.

That being said, I don’t know him well at all, and I feel uncomfortable approaching him about the issue. He’s an overall nice guy and has some excellent qualities but they’re overshadowed by his tone deaf conduct.

The result is the entire team is spending less time together because we wouldn’t host an event with everyone except him, but most people also can’t stand to be around him more than they have to.

Should I say something to him and if so, what should I say?

His behaviors include but aren’t limited to:

—Acts like he’s the most experienced despite being one of the least; constantly interrupts or gives unsolicited advice to other specialties.

—Minimizes coworkers’ complaints; e.g., when someone said “the client keeps calling me on weekends,” he replied “maybe work harder so they won’t need to.”

—Gets angry if anyone uses a nickname version of his (very common) name, even from people who barely know him.

—Went to a bar with us and other teams then spent the whole night lecturing everyone about how he doesn’t drink because he’s healthier and has more willpower.

—Proudly and conspicuously tattled on coworkers for bending the dress code when no clients were around, leading to a companywide memo.

TL;DR: Younger coworker keeps alienating our tight-knit team with tone-deaf behavior (know-it-all, minimizes complaints, lectures at socials, tattles). He seems unaware. Should I say something?

ANSWER: The only thing I could see doing is questioning his inappropriate behavior in the moment. Addressing his interrupting- making sure the person who was interrupted gets to finish their thought, questioning if he thinks an unhelpful suggestion is actually helpful etc

Calling out behavior that shouldn't be happening may make him see that it's unpleasant, or at least give everyone else the license to also call out his inappropriateness.

QUESTION: I [29F] have lost attraction to my [27NB] disabled partner and I'm at a loss for what to do.

My partner and I met and started dating 6 years ago. When we first met they didnt identify as non-binary, and we started our relationship as a lesbian relationship. I am a lesbian and I am not attracted to men. I have tried, many times, it just does not happen for me and I cannot force it. That being said they were the love of my life. We fell very very in love and I have never experienced the acceptance they showed me. The love they showed me was magic and I look back with very strong fondness at that time of my life.

They started to transition in earnest 3 years ago. They were very hesitant to do so initially. They knew I'm a lesbian and was not attracted to men. And they didnt want to transition for that reason. I encouraged them to do it wholeheartedly, because being trans is something you do for yourself, not for anyone else. I assured them that I wasn't considering leaving them over that,  and that it was men i wasnt attracted to not non-binary people. I told them that they had to do it for themselves. That it was crucial, even. And they did, they've been on T for quite a while and are much more masculine and in general pass as a man. They're non-binary, but yeah even so we get read as a straight couple and theyre often referred to as my boyfriend (a term they like). Over time though... its just not the same anymore. I struggle with intimacy with them, I am still deeply attracted to who they are. But their body has changed and their demeanor has changed and it's just no longer within what I'm attracted to. Its starting to hurt me to force myself through it. I want them to be happy but I am unsatisfied in several ways and have had a lot of feelings that I'm not voicing because I do not want to hurt them in any way.

They are also disabled and reliant on me for a lot of things. I rely on them for a lot too, as I am not always in the best mental state. Neither of us has a relationship with our families. We both experienced a lot of abuse growing up so we're mostly by ourselves. I can work and am working but they aren't as they have been going to therapy. They wouldn't have anywhere to go if our relationship ended. They don't have support to fall back on. And their mental health fluctuates and at somewhat routine times they are suicidal. I'm so scared of what would happen if I did decide to leave.

I don't really know what I'm looking for. Someone who has been in this situation I guess? I feel so much guilt and fear. I'm semi-sick today because of how anxious this whole thing is making me. I'm so scared of being alone too. They do provide emotional support to me, which has been very helpful for me at times. I just don't know what to do. I feel like no matter how I look at the situation I'm in the wrong. That I'd be throwing away the life weve built together and that its my fault.

TL;DR my partner transitioned and I'm losing attraction to them but they are disabled and we are very dependent and I have no idea what to do.

ANSWER: This is pretty common for partners of people who decide to transition. There's no shame or harm in deciding that you are not attracted to their new self (with absolute respect for your partner — I am saying this as a transgender woman!).

You're allowed to feel the way you're feeling. I know it hurts and feels awful and it does not at all reflect how you feel about your partner. But you need to do what is right for you — just like they did for themself (with your blessing).

Edited to add that I'm rooting for you both and wish you peace and light.

QUESTION: My boyfriend (27M) stays over almost every day but never helps with groceries or bills. How do I(25F) talk to him without sounding rude?

I(25F) need some advice because I feel stuck. My boyfriend(27M) and I have been together for a little over a year. He has his own place, but for the last few months he has been staying at my apartment almost every day. Sometimes he goes home only to pick up clothes or do some chores then he comes right back.

I love having him around. I really do. The problem is that my expenses have quietly doubled and I did not notice it at first. Groceries go way faster. The water and electricity bill are higher. I am the one cooking most nights because he is already here when I get home. He never does it on purpose, but he has slipped into the routine of treating my place like our place without the responsibilities that come with that.

Last week I realized I spent more on groceries than I usually do in an entire month. My rent and bills are manageable when it is just me, but not when I am basically hosting someone full time. I do not want to resent him, but I am already starting to feel irritated when I see the fridge emptying twice as fast.

The hard part is that he is not a bad person. If I asked directly, he would probably help. But I do not want to sound like I am charging him for staying with me. I also do not want him to think I am keeping score. I just want things to feel fair because right now it feels one sided.

How do I bring this up without making him feel attacked or unwelcome? Do I ask for a set amount each month? Do I tell him we should split groceries on the days he stays? I honestly do not know how to word it in a way that does not feel awkward.

I care about him a lot. I just want to find a healthy way to talk about this before it becomes a bigger problem. What is the best way to have this conversation?

TLDR: Boyfriend (27M) stays at my place almost every day and my expenses have increased a lot. He does not help with groceries or bills because we never talked about it. I (25F) want to ask him to contribute but I do not know how to bring it up without sounding rude or making him feel unwelcome.

ANSWER: If he is already there when you get home, why are YOU the one that has to cook? He could at least pull his weight by preparing meals for you if he is already there when you get home from work, like a decent partner would, even if you are paying for the food. I’d be pissed if I got home from work to find my partner had let themselves in, was using my water/power, eating me out of house and home, and still expected me to cook for them while not contributing anything financially or otherwise.

Do you want to live with him full-time? If so, it’s definitely time to have that conversation as he’s making himself very comfortable. Let him know that you care about him and enjoy his company, but if you are going to continue the relationship and build a future together, you need to have a conversation about splitting costs, division of labour and living arrangements. Show him copies of your bills before and after he started spending all his time at your place, and how much you are having to spend on food, and ask him to help you with the costs, because the increases are due to his presence. If you do want to live together, tell him that whatever you both will save in rent could be put towards the shared expenses.

If he is not willing to chip in, then you may want to reconsider this relationship, or at least start spending more time at his place so he can wear some costs. Why is he at your place so much? Do you live alone, and he has roommates or lives with family? Right now, he’s treating you like a free hotel with catering. What exactly is he contributing? He’s living his best life and probably saving himself a fortune by never being at his place or having to buy his own food. I’m guessing you also get stuck with cleaning up after him too?

QUESTION: My (36M) bf has made 0 friends or maintained 0 friendships since high school. I'm (31F) his only "friend" and it's wearing me down. What should I do?

As the title suggests, my boyfriend doesn't have any friends and relies on me for all social contact. He can also be really moody which makes it hard for me to know how I can help or respond to this.

For example, yesterday morning I got up for work. He was still asleep and I didn't want to wake him. I went out into the kitchen to start boiling the kettle and when I came back into the room his eyes were open and he was looking away from me and frowning. I smiled and said "oh! good morning! How did you sleep?" And he said "fine yeah" and still wouldn't look at me. I could already sense something was wrong and asked "is something wrong?" He said "why didn't you say good morning to me when you got up?"

I explained that I had thought he was asleep, and of course I would have said good morning if I knew he was awake but didn't want to wake him. He was angry and wouldn't speak to me, saying he couldn't believe I had ignored him when I got up. This turned into an argument and eventually I left to go for a morning walk.

I understand this is a really micro-level interaction, but it happens a lot and I'm getting so tired of this. The moodiness really gets to me. He also won't see a therapist even though he's been saying for almost a year that he will at some point. I see a therapist monthly and try really hard to keep on top of myself and my own emotions etc.

He doesn't have any friends, I mean actually zero friends. He never has had any friends since high school and this puts enormous pressure on me to be everything in his life (I'm 31, he's 36). And I try hard to keep my own friendships going, but it's gotten so hard since I started dating him 3 years ago. Every time I say I'm going out to see friends, he gets moody and gives the same reaction as above - he goes quiet, won't look at me and then says nothing is wrong, but then later on will blow up and say he doesn't understand why I'm seeing xyz, why I feel the need to go out etc. But equally when I ask him to join me, he either says no or goes further and asks why I don't just stay home or do something with him. Then whenever I try to broach the subject with him, he becomes incredibly moody or angry/sad.

I feel like I'm you crazy and I can't take it anymore. I'm feeling so isolated and just...sad. I don't know what to do. I want to leave but every time I say so he gets angry, then cries, then I end up deciding to stay. Meanwhile every time I do, he doesn't change anything and just continues with the moody behaviour. I don't want to be someone else's entire social life, whilst also missing out on my own social opportunities. But I'm scared of losing all the really good things about our relationship, and there are lots of them. I just can't imagine staying with him and getting married or having a kid (he really wants kids whereas I'm more on the fence) - I'd just rather be alone even though I know it'd be hard. Am I crazy? Help?

TL;DR I'm feeling responsible for my partner's emotions and entire social life, given he has no social circle and hasn't made any friends or maintained any friendships for the past 17 years. I have my own friends and social circles but am feeling like he doesn't want me to have friends. I don't know whether to leave or if I should  keep trying to work on the relationship. Any advice on what I can do?

ANSWER: There's a reason why he doesn't have any friends and it looks like you're finally seeing it.

Just because you've had a few good moments with him doesn't mean you have to stay with him forever.

QUESTION: My (29) boyfriend (30) is deeply enmeshed with his  parents (70 F, 72 M) and he’s an only child. It’s very difficult for me.

I (29F) am in a year relationship with someone (30M) who is very enmeshed with his narcissistic parents (70F, 72M). Our relationship is wonderful,  but it has been absolute hell with his parents, to the point I’ve had to hold boundaries and have gone no contact with his parents. He feels he can’t do this. He often says “they’re all I have” because he’s an only child.

He’s an only child and I’m his first really serious relationship where we live together, are planning a future, and we’re serious about getting married one day.

It’s like his parents have always hated me for this and have seen me as taking their son from them.

His parents financially abuse, verbally abuse, and heavily manipulate my partner… he’s basically like their servant.

They have made a series of poor financial decisions; overspending, luxury trips, clothes, spending over their means, expensive housing they can’t afford, etc…. They always tell us “we deserve to enjoy life”…..

They’re in a really bad spot now financially in their 70s and it’s really hard for my partner. His parents are desperate and basically in survival mode now. They’re guilt tripping him and being straight nasty about it all… basically telling him it’s his fault and guilt tripping him constantly to do things for them, financially support them, etc.

My partner already gave up the house he owns so they can live there for low cost, and I just feel they will always come first. We now pay $3200 in rent together, and while we can afford it, we keep having to make ourselves uncomfortable for his parents, or they throw a tantrum. We have a lot of financial goals we had to adjust now to accommodate for his parent’s poor life decisions.

It’s directly impacting me now, sometimes I feel it’s time to leave. His parents will always have a hold on our relationship as long as they’re alive and it’s just going to get worse as they age.

He’s starting to see how his parents are the more he interacts with my healthy family dynamic, and his parents resentment toward me has grown to the point I’ve had to cut them out of my life….. they try to put a wedge between us…..however, I know they’ll always impact our relationship as they are his parents even if I have no contact. Also….his programming runs deep of course over many years.

Any advice please?

TL;DR: my boyfriend’s parents are very difficult and use him for everything, but do not treat him or me well to the point I’ve cut them off completely. I feel it will never get better.

ANSWER: >(29F) am in a year relationship  
It’s been absolute hell,  
are planning a future, and we’re serious about getting married one day.

I cannot understand why you are planning a future with someone with whom it has been hell with and you've been dating for only a year.

QUESTION: My girlfriend (19F) cancelled my Thanksgiving flight during an argument, and now I’m unsure how to move forward. I’m (21M).

My girlfriend’s mother bought plane tickets for both of us to visit her family in Virginia for Thanksgiving. This would’ve been my first time meeting them, and I was genuinely excited.

A few days after the tickets were booked, my girlfriend and I had a disagreement about something related to her sorority process. She left my apartment upset and we didn’t speak for several hours. We made up the next day, but the following morning she told me she had cancelled my flight during the argument.

She didn’t pay for the ticket herself, and her family already knew I was supposed to come. She still hasn’t talked to her mom or anyone about what happened, so I don’t know if I’m still expected to come or if her family plans to rebook anything. I don’t want to pressure anyone or make assumptions, but the situation left me confused and disappointed.

I’m trying to approach this maturely, but I’m not sure how to communicate my feelings to her or how to move forward when the plans changed so suddenly.

How should I handle this conversation with her, and should I still go if the family decides to rebook the ticket?

TL;DR: My girlfriend cancelled my Thanksgiving flight that her mom bought during an argument, hasn’t talked to her family about it yet, and now I’m unsure how to move forward or whether I should still go.

ANSWER: Maybe next year. They won't be able to rebook for the same cost now, and honestly I would not want to meet her entire family with this hanging over your head.

QUESTION: 43/F Married 13 years. 46/M Husband betrayed me in multiple ways. I’m trying to figure out if people like him actually change or if I should walk.

Tl;dr
My husband lies to avoid conflict. How do I trust him to keep going thru this betrayal torture?

I’m using a throwaway because the details are embarrassing and honestly I don’t want anyone in my life connecting this to me.

My husband and I have been together 15 years, married 13. We have a 9-year-old son. Until recently, I thought we were solid. Not perfect, but solid. Turns out the foundation was rotting under my feet.

Here are the facts, and I’m trying to be fair about my part too. I want real feedback from people who have gone through things like this.

1. The strip club incident.

About six weeks ago, we went to a strip club together after sexy talk at dinner for his birthday. I’d never done anything like that with a partner, but he’s been venting about not frequent enough sex for a couple years so I thought this might spice it up and give us content to fantasize to after. We had a blast the first night though my feelings were a little hurt when he got too into her. He apologized and swore he’d stay sober and keep me emotionally safe next time. The next week, he went way over the line. The stripper touched him, he got “too aggressive,” and he orgasmed during a lap dance. This shattered me. He had just promised me emotional safety the week before. I felt stupid for trusting him.

2. His past and what he downplayed.

He worked in the club scene before we met. Always claimed it was “I worked in the office, just had a few dozen dances, nothing crazy.” Now I find out he’d been sucking strippers’ breasts and doing a lot more than he ever admitted. He has since estimated 50-100 dances over his lifetime when pressed. I’m sure that’s downplaying it too. I didn’t marry a saint, but I did expect the truth vs a picture of an innocent kid. He hid the real story for years. Yes I now know how naive this was of me. But he reassured me of the things that go on at the club when I asked before we went and I felt I’d be safe and he’d just be watching.

3. The money lies.

Twice he pulled money from a line of credit behind my back. The first time was 2022–2023 which almost led to us divorcing due to the risk, the amount, and the way he wouldn’t take ownership and said he was just “leaning into his business”. He promised he’d never do it again. Then he did it this year—$40k—for a sponsorship he couldn’t afford. Hid that too. Being in finance, I’m held to a high fiduciary standard, so it hits extra hard.

4. The porn and social media.

Hours a day. While I was drowning in work and parenting. He wasn’t cheating physically, but he was checked out. He deleted a few text messages with a woman he worked with (non-romantic from what he says, but hiding anything at this point hits hard). He has given multiple excuses.

5. The unnecessary lies.

This one killed me. Our son mentioned a conversation with us all together cuddling in bed about a conversation he had with his dad about my husband’s 4-5 ex-girlfriends. My husband instantly denied ever having the conversation gaslighting my son in the moment. Even when our kid said it happened last week. Was proud my kid held his ground and said “Dad you did say this.” It was such a low-stakes thing to lie about, and he still did it. I confronted him. He doubled down. When cornered, he backpedaled with “I didn’t think it was significant.”

6. Emotional stuff.

He often says he “doesn’t lie,” even when caught. His crying performative. Voice shakes, no tears. It’s hard to explain, but my gut screams he’s faking empathy instead of feeling it. He gets defensive instead of owning his choices. And when he does “own” something, it feels like he’s reading from a script.

Where I’m culpable:

I’m intense. I’m direct. I have a big career and a strong personality. I’m sure that has been intimidating for him. I’ve also been overwhelmed with work, parenting, and philanthropy. That said—none of this justifies lying or betraying someone.

Where I’m innocent:

I didn’t betray him. I didn’t lie. I didn’t do anything that required secrecy or cleanup. My “crime” is being successful and busy. His is breaking trust in every direction.

Therapy:

We’ve been in a therapy marathon for weeks. He journals now because his therapist told him to, not because he chose to. He says he wants to change, but his actions come in short spurts and fall apart fast. He has admitted he doesn’t know know how to show me empathy even after seeing all this pain. That was gutting.

My question:

Do people like this actually change?
Has anyone stayed and seen their partner do a full 180?
Or is this one of those “you already have your answer” situations?

I’ve read about people who are compulsive liars, people who can’t tolerate shame, people who crumble when confronted with their own behavior. I don’t want to raise my son in a home where his dad lies over small things and big things. But I also don’t want to blow up his world if there’s a real chance my husband can actually change.

If you’ve been the betrayed spouse or the betrayer who actually changed, I’d appreciate hearing your experience. What signs were real? What was fake progress? What should I be watching for?

I’m exhausted. I’m hurt. I don’t want to waste another year waiting for a miracle that won’t come.

Stay or go?
What do people like him actually do long-term?

ANSWER: Are you tired yet? I am just reading it. This dude lies at every single opportunity, how can you trust him about anything at all? And if you can't trust him, what's the point? Cut the weight and feel free and happier.

QUESTION: My husband (34M) has started talking down about my (27F) exercise habits, not sure how to approach the conversation

We've been together for 4 years and married almost a year. I was diagnosed with PCOS at 20 and spent my early 20s learning how to manage it. I take medication to manage insulin resistance and I do some form of exercise 5/6 days a week. Usually walking a mile, around 45mins/1 hour on my exercise bike, and I got really into squats this summer so they have been added in. I do the stairmaster when I'm able to physically go to the gym.

When we got together I had dropped around 80 pounds and was below my original goal weight. He was always very complimentary of this, saying it was impressive that I was able to stick with it and get the results I wanted. I easily maintained my weight the entire time we were dating, it does take time out of my day but I almost always got it done while he was at work so we could hang out. We tried to walk the mile together but he almost never felt like it and I preferred to get it out of the way earlier into the day anyway. My husband isn't massively overweight but he is definitely insecure about his weight, I think he looks great and am happy to support him wherever he's at.

Since we've married and moved in together he has slowly become less approving of my working out. It didn't happen at first but now it's like he views my very mild exercise as "excessive" and also done incorrectly apparently. He tells me I should do the bike for "15 minutes max, anything past that is not helping you", that my mile walk that takes me 20/30 minutes is "too long, you don't need that much", and finally to me proudly telling him how many squats I did was "You'll need to show me how you're doing it because I know you're definitely doing it wrong" (not even a "great job", also someone taught me years ago but he "doesn't believe it").

I've been getting annoyed about this new behavior but trying to push it aside for some reason. I finally got frustrated a few days ago because I was getting dressed to take my walk and he got very upset with me. Pouted and said "You don't need to do that, why don't you want to spend time with me?" We spend almost all of our free time together!!! Plus no one told him he couldn't walk with me, I just knew he was going to have an issue with it.

I've literally been gaining weight and his criticism is making it hard for me to stay motivated. I've always been so proud of getting on top of my health and I've felt so much better, but lately it feels like punishment. I'm not sure how to approach him, I think he feels unhappy with his body and habits and is pushing these things to me. I want to be kind but I also want to defend myself. My quality of life was so much worse before and I feel hurt and annoyed that it seems he would prefer I go back to that so it doesn't challenge him at all.

Tl;dr my husband suddenly dislikes my exercise habits and talks about how unnecessary or wrong I'm doing everything. I think it's unhappiness in himself and I want to be respectful to him, but he's not being very respectful to me so I'm not sure how to approach this chat.

ANSWER: My question is why are you pushing this to the side? This should be immediately addressed because he is getting the signal that this is okay. Your exercise habits predate him and are not for him to control. Have the discussion, he needs to stop.

QUESTION: Friend keeps messaging me  20–50 times a week and I don’t know how to handle it

TL;DR - Old friend messages me constantly despite my repeated attempts at boundaries. How do i stop this without being cruel?

\_\_

Hi all,

I (29F) have an old friend who I’m not very close with anymore (39M). We worked together for about a year when I was 18. We don’t hang out, I don’t really think about him day-to-day, and I usually reply maybe once every few weeks. But he sends me constant messages - mostly Facebook reels - literally every day. Sometimes it’s 10 a day, and recently I opened Messenger and saw 54 unread messages from him.

I haven’t replied in about 3 weeks. He keeps messaging anyway, and today he sent things like:  
“I don’t think you like me anymore haha you talk to me like once a month.”

He’s also asked if he could visit me while he’s in the area (I didn’t respond), and he keeps pushing past hints that I’m busy or not very active on Messenger.

For context, he has bipolar disorder and can be very intense and emotional. A few years ago when I tried to set boundaries, he told me he cried in the shower because he thought he was “losing me,” which made me feel horrible. I don’t want to hurt him or be cruel, but the constant messaging makes me uncomfortable and I don’t feel close enough to him to manage his emotional reactions.

I don’t want a big confrontation or to send a harsh message - but I also don’t want to reinforce this by replying and starting the cycle again. I've sent a couple of messages over the past year or so just saying 'Hey man, im not on facebook much" or other things along those lines. He just doesnt take the hint to stop messaging. Its relentless.

What’s the healthiest way to handle this?

Is it OK to just stop engaging at all? Should I send a short boundaries message? Mute him? Block him?

If you’ve dealt with something similar, what worked for you?

ANSWER: So dude has been overly attached to you since you were 18 and he was around 28. Without you encouraging it at any point by hanging out or entertaining himself outside of the workplace. And it's been 10 years and he's still going.

This is actually pretty damn creepy and scary. I agree with the longer comment advising you to get your ducks in order safety wise but I would also download or screenshot as much of your message history as you can in case you need to take the problem to law enforcement. Emphasize the very earliest interactions. The ones where you were 18 and he was nearly 30.

Be safe please!

QUESTION: My HUSBAND Always does STUPID experimental stuffs, how not to get ANGRY?

I am F(27) and my husband is M(28). Married for more than 2 years. My husband is a very clumsy person. He easily gets distracted. He says that he has ADHD, I also think that. But it is getting really stressful for me. He is not that careful with his spending. He tries to be careful, but the things he does ends up costing us more money. Recently, his mac was heating up when he worked on it, he saw from a yt video that suggested a small repair. So, to save money he ordered the kit for himself to fix it on his own. We are immigrants and every penny counts for us. I told him that even if it costs a little more he should go to a professional for these stuffs as he has no prior experience. He said yes i think you are right but ended up doing what he thought initially and damaged a more expensive sensitive part instead of fixing it. Now it might cost us 10-20 times more to repair that. This is just an example he keeps doing things like that and I am always stressed or anxious about him constantly about whatever he does. Even if I show anger because of that he did not listen to me he says that I am nagging and it is not right. If I can't say anything good in these typpa situation I might just stay quiet. His ADHD is increasing my anxiety and stress levels. What can I do to fix his these type of behaviours so that he takes more mature decisions and thinks maturely and logically before doing something. So that I no longer have panick attacks.

TL;DR My husband is always doing immature things and making immature decisions, I am getting hyper anxious day by day, what should I do?

ANSWER: 1. You're not having panic attacks. That is very different from being frequently angry with a spouse and having anxiety over money.

2. You can't "fix" him.

3. Your husband \may\ have ADHD -- has he actually been diagnosed? -- but "disregarding my partner's concerns" is not a symptom of ADHD. That's just a spouse being a jerk.

So the first thing I'd do is encourage your husband to actually get checked out for a formal diagnosis. If he has a problem that prevents him from being functional in certain ways that are very important to you, medication and teamwork to change how you divvy up tasks (like who is responsible for repairing a broken laptop) are things you can get from counselors who deal with people with these problems. I don't think it's helpful for you (or him) to pathologize all your relationship issues as being caused by a mental health disorder your husband may not even have. If he does, then HE has to do the work here, and YOU have modify your expectations and behaviors so that you find a dynamic that works for you.

As for the rest of it, when you say you're constantly stressed or anxious about what he does, that's a really bad mental state to be in. You can't parent a grown man. What are some practical things you can do to protect yourself from the impact of his impulsive decisions? (e.g. take over managing the household money) How about some emotional things you can do? (e.g. don't clean up his messes, leave the area and go someplace quiet away from him, etc.)

Does your husband CARE that you are having all these conflicts? And how did you resolve conflict before you got married? Surely this didn't just spring up out of nowhere.

QUESTION: Moved in with my boyfriend (23M) 3 months ago and I’m (22F) drained. Should I move out while he’s gone?

My boyfriend and I moved in together about three months ago, and ever since then I’ve felt completely overwhelmed. Before living together, things were great. But now I’m doing almost all the housework while working fully onsite, and he works hybrid and still barely handles his small chores unless I remind him multiple times. Whenever I bring up how stressed or frustrated I am, he says I’m “attacking” him or blowing things out of proportion.

Today I rushed out the door late for work and accidentally tipped over my sock drawer, and instead of being understanding, he texted me during lunch pointing it out in a passive aggressive way, even though I silently clean up after his messes every day. It made me realize how imbalanced things have become and how little accountability he takes. We’re going to be apart for a month starting Sunday, and I’m thinking about staying in an Airbnb until he leaves, then going back home when he’s gone and possibly moving out while he’s away so I can think clearly. I still care about him and would give the relationship another chance, but living together has brought out issues that are really draining me. Am I overreacting, or is this a sign we’re incompatible living together?

TL;DR: Since moving in with my boyfriend, I’ve ended up doing almost all the chores while he gets defensive whenever I bring it up. Today was my breaking point, and I’m considering moving out while he’s away for a month. Not sure if it’s dramatic or the right move. What should I do?

ANSWER: Get out now while you still have your fire, because it gets a lot harder to leave once you’ve forgiven him two or three or twenty times. It does not get better, seriously. This is supposed to be the honeymoon period of living together. It’s the best it will ever be, right now.

QUESTION: Bonding with parents feels impossible because I (28M) feel like I have to walk on eggshells.

I (28M) often find myself in this position where bonding with my dad (63M), I might say something conversational and it gets interpreted as me not having a good time.

For example, I come over so we can watch films together over dinner, and let's say we watch a movie and even though I liked the overall film, I might say, 'It was good. It kind of dragged at points but it was a great narrative.'

Somehow that gets translated into him profusely apologizing: "I'm so sorry I made you watch that. I liked it, I just thought you might, but I won't make you watch any more-"

As much as I try telling him that I did like it, he doesn't seem to hear me. It's like one wrong move, and suddenly, it's all over. My mom is pretty similar, but right now, I'm focusing more on my dad.

This has happened across several experiences throughout my life and unfortunately, we're not that close. I want to be closer, but I feel anxious about saying anything around him. Anyone experience anything similar?? How do you get around it??

TL;DR: I want to bond with my dad, but even small comments make him fret and over-apologize. I feel anxious speaking around him and don’t know how to communicate honestly without upsetting him.

ANSWER: How does he react if you just mention what you liked about it?

One of my colleagues wrote a book that was . . . okay, but not that great. But it did have a really strong sense of place, and when I said that I'd read the book, I pointed that out. He then said he was really happy to hear that, because he'd worked really hard on that, and it turned out that I didn't have to say anything else at all.

It sounds like your dad has some insecurities. Have you seen this show up in other ways, with other people in his life?

QUESTION: I (32f) am being made to choose between my ex con (34m) brother in law or the rest of my in laws by my mother in law (51f)

I really need advice here. Please help! Names in the story have been changed for anonymity.

I'm a 32f and have been married to my husband, Lucas (32m), for almost 7 years. We dated long before that, basically since we were both 18. I was a co-worker with his mom Bella(51f) when my husband and I were still dating, and so we've always been pretty close. My mother in law tends to keep my son(7m) with her over the weekends because she loves him and loves spending time with him doing fun things he'll enjoy. I've been accepted into Lucas's extended family with open arms and feel very welcomed by everyone. They may not always understand me and I may not always understand them, but we try and are always there for each other.

As a child, my brother in law, Tom (34m), hung out with the sorts of people that got involved with drugs and gang related activity. Lucas was then made to be the responsible one in the family in Tom's place and basically become a mini adult to help raise/care for his cousins and younger brother while his mom and the aunts worked on their careers. It was a turbulent household with an abusive man married to my mother in law, which had a big effect on the kids. Tom would basically do what and go wherever he wanted.

I've been told that Tom was doing drug deals, tried to pretend to be my husband when he'd gotten arrested one time, (thank God a family member was able to set that straight), broke into his mom's house when he wasn't supposed to be there, got shot in a drug deal gone wrong and has stolen someone's car. And those are just the things that I've been told about. There's most likely much more.

After the drug deal gone wrong, Tom was sent to prison for a few years. He got out, and within just a few months, he stole someone's car which broke his parole and was sent back to jail. So now he's been in jail for at least 5 years. (Sorry, I haven't been keeping track of exact dates.) Now he's out of jail again and has been since sometime in July of this year, I think. And that was when the initial issue started. Not with my brother-in-law but with my mother-in-law.

I believe that Bella truly does love her children, but I also feel like she has a large amount of guilt for how her son's life turned out. I think that she's trying her best to make up for lost time as quickly as possible. However, she's doing it in a way that's making others uncomfortable and is pushing other family members' boundaries.

Around when my brother-in-law got out of jail, my husband's entire extended family had been planning a trip to a water park together for an Aunt's birthday and everyone was looking forward to it for almost a year. However, Bella tried to insist that we invite Tom, too. Some of my husband's family are in law enforcement and have young children. They were not comfortable with that idea, especially with him so freshly out. My mother-in-law then tried to dig her heels in and say that if he couldn't come then she wouldn't come, and then the aunt that was putting on the entire trip for herself and the family almost canceled the whole thing over the drama! Luckily, my mother-in-law saw reason before we left, Tom didn't come and the trip stayed on.

Which brings us to the problem that I'm having now: Bella is trying to plan her own Thanksgiving away from the rest of the extended family because Tom isn't invited. And that would be an okay choice for her to make. However, my husband and I are now being made to choose sides. Either we support my mother-in-law and Tom, or we support the boundaries of the rest of the family. I don't really know what to do. Honestly, I don't like Tom. From what I've heard about him, and how I hear him talk to Bella, Lucas and my son (7m), I just don't like him as a person. Even without the crimes he's committed, he's rude and selfish. If he was not related to my husband, I would never be around him. But my mother-in-law is making this extremely personal. She insists that Lucas, my son, me, my other brother in law Dax(22m), Tom, his daughter (14f) and his daughter's mom Angel (??f) all forfeit going to the annual extended family Thanksgiving.

I don't believe that this is a fair choice, especially for my young son. Usually, at the big extended family Thanksgiving, all of the kids play together all night, watch holiday movies and then write out their Christmas lists to Santa. We all play family games like charades or trivia. All of the adults exchange white elephant slips to know who they're buying for that year. Then all of the adults plan on Black Friday shopping to try and knock out most of the lists. I don't see how making my son sit with a bunch of adults awkwardly all night it's supposed to help anything or show support.

And did I mention that I have my own family's Thanksgiving to attend? Every year it's a struggle to balance two separate Thanksgivings on the same day but we somehow manage. Now I have all of this added stress to the decision making and need to essentially choose to do three Thanksgivings or upset someone by not attending one of theirs.

I tried to appeal to my mother-in-law to ask if maybe we could get together with Tom on a different day, and tried to explain that the family just needs time to see whether or not he's changed and to rebuild trust with him. That he made a series of poor life decisions and that these are the consequences. I'm not saying that he shouldn't have a Thanksgiving with the family members that want to support him right now, I think that that's very good of Bella to want to do. I just think that she is letting her emotions cloud her judgment and that this could be the start of a rift between the family and unnecessary tension. My son cried today when he heard that we wouldn't be going to his cousin's house this year and it broke my heart. I think I'm leaning toward choosing to go to the extended family's Thanksgiving, now, instead.

How will future holidays go? Christmas? Easter? Birthdays? Anniversaries? Etc etc.

Not to mention that my mother-in-law is lashing out and has essentially said that she doesn't care what me and my son do, but that she expects my husband to attend her Thanksgiving because she would hope that all of her sons would want to spend the holidays with her. So now she's trying to keep my husband with her. How is that fair to my son and I!? I don't know what to do! I have so many past traumas, current mental health issues and people pleasing tendancies that this is really putting a strain on me. My husband is very non confrontational and hates that he's being forced into choosing.

Lucas has already tried to discuss this with her but she still insists on doing it this way. When my husband first told me about her plans, I expressed how upset that I was and how unfair it was for our son and he agreed. But he still wants to support his mom, even if he doesn't have a good relationship with his brother and isn't super close with his mom. He doesn't know what to do, and neither do I. I don't know what Lucas will choose to do.

Please, I'm begging for advice or people's perspectives! I really need help!

Tl;Dr:

My mother in law wants us to choose between her awful son or the extended family Thanksgiving tradition this year since he just got out of jail. Help!

ANSWER: I would choose not to spend my thanksgiving with an asshole or the woman trying to force me to do so. Your husband needs to step up, this is his family to deal with.

QUESTION: Married within a year, and now I’m seeing red flags I ignored before — how do I handle this? (27F/33M)

Hi, this is a long read. Bear with me. Im a 27/F. My husband is 33M and we’ve been married for a year. I’m looking for some advice on how to handle this situation. I feel like I have no one to talk to, and I really need to vent while also getting someone’s perspective.

My husband and I got engaged and married all within a year. Everything happened pretty fast, but we both deeply desired marriage. Now that we’re married, some of the subtle red flags I noticed before are starting to repeat themselves.

My husband is very paranoid. He often assumes I’m cheating or doing something shady when I never have and never would. We attend church, and he gets upset when I put effort into my appearance. He assumes I’m dressing up to seek attention — even though I keep to myself at church and rarely engage in conversation unless I have to.

A few weeks ago, he went on a brief trip. While he was away, I booked a hair appointment. He became upset, saying I must be getting my hair done to entertain another man while he was gone, and created a whole argument about it. The truth is, that was the only available appointment time.

When he returned from his trip, he inspected the entire house, looking for signs that I had company while he was gone. In the past, he has often asked to look through my phone — and I’ve allowed it because I have nothing to hide.

If a man at church looks my way, or if he sees me glance at someone, he interrogates me and asks if I know them or if I’m trying to get attention. He frequently asks about my whereabouts, even though he has my location and I’m always transparent about where I am and what I’m doing.

One particular incident stands out — I was on my way to a church meeting (I serve at church), and I left early because I like to be punctual. He called me and told me to come back, accusing me of leaving early to mingle and potentially meet other men.

These are just a few examples of many similar incidents that have occurred. He says he wants to change and asks me to give him time. I believe he’s genuine in that desire, and he truly does have amazing qualities. Every time he realizes he’s wrong, he apologizes. I understand that change takes time, but when these episodes happen, he becomes a different person — angry and loud. And it honestly scares me. He’s not physically abusive but I’ve become so anxious around him.

I don’t know if I should wait it out or leave. He plans to seek therapy, but hasn’t yet. He says he can fix the issue himself, he just has to be self aware. I want to give him a chance, but I also know this behavior could get worse once kids are involved. I’m torn and don’t know what to do.

TL;DR: My husband and I married quickly, and now his paranoia and constant accusations of cheating are becoming overwhelming. He says he’ll get therapy, but I’m torn between waiting it out or leaving.

ANSWER: Please leave if he doesn't treat his insecurities- he's being extremely controlling and  isolating you, the first steps towards more physical abuse.

QUESTION: After 4 years together still no proposal. How long do I continue to wait?

I’ve (39F) been with my BF (37M) for four years and we’ve been living together for over two. Before I gave up my apartment and moved into his house, I asked where he saw our relationship going and his timeline for commitment. He said if after a year of living together everything was going well, we’d get engaged. This matched with what I wanted, so I moved in.

A year passed and no proposal. I bring up the conversation we had before I moved in and he said he’s saving up for the ring. Then his friend asked us if we were going to get engaged, and my BF said yes, soon. So, I was reassured we were still on the same page.

Then we get to two years living together, and still no proposal. The type of rings I like are not expensive, and with his salary I know he would have saved up enough by then. Then his brother got engaged after only two years with his GF. I know all relationships have their own timelines, but the news made me reflect. So, I straight up asked my BF why he hadn’t proposed.

At first his excuse was that planning a wedding was such a hassle. This didn’t ring true, so I said I thought he wasn’t being honest. Then he confided some struggles with his mental health and fears that I would grow resentful of ways he couldn’t contribute to the relationship due to them. I was surprised because those things are not deal breakers for me, I’m not upset by them, and I don’t think I’ve ever expressed resentment.

He said he’d thought about returning to therapy to work on things and asked me to give him some time. I agreed, but he’s not forthcoming if/when his appointments are or what he’s working on – which I understand I have no right to know. He’s allowed to keep his therapy private if that’s what’s best for his therapeutic journey. But, I wish I had some insight to know my waiting will be worthwhile.

I don’t question his struggles, but I’m having a hard time believing he’s not just stalling. He’s expressed some reservations about me, mainly that I’m not social enough, especially with his family. I’m a super introvert, but I’ve really tried with his family. I once expressed a worry that his family mistook my shyness for disinterest, but he assured me they understood and liked me, so I don’t know what the problem is.

My other doubt is that he talks about doing things and often doesn’t follow through. Like, he’s been saying he was going to take me on a weekend trip since the first year together, but he’s never done it. During the same time he’s planned and gone on four trips with friends and family. I don’t doubt that he would enjoy a trip with me, he just doesn’t care enough to actually plan it.

Recently, we went to his friend’s wedding, and another of his friends asked if we’re getting engaged, and my BF again said soon. I just don’t believe it anymore. I don’t doubt his love for me. We do a lot of stuff together and he’s physically affectionate. But I can’t ignore this feeling he doesn’t want to marry me and never will. I don’t think he wants to break up, but he also doesn’t want to commit.

I get upset about this every other day and I’m just so tired. I’m nearing forty and just want to know he wants to be my life partner. I feel four years is plenty of time to know someone. I have been open and transparent about who I am and what I have to offer. I don’t know how much longer I can wait around for him to decide to commit.

Do I stick around and see if he ever proposes, or follow my gut and cut my losses?

TLDR: After four years BF has not proposed even after saying multiple times he was planning to. Explanations are weak and I'm questioning if he'll ever do it.

ANSWER: I think it's time you look for your own apartment and move out. He is just stringing you along. Just consider: there is no actual factual reason he can't propose to you - the only valid explanation is that he just doesn't want to. It's heartbreaking that he stole the four years from you that were vital if you wanted to have children - I really hope you don't, because that would make it so much sadder.

Anyway, he's telling you loud and clear that he is not going to marry you - time to accept that and move on. You will be much happier once you're free from his push/pull mindgames.

QUESTION: Fiancé (31M) threw me (29F) under the bus to our friends

My fiancé and I are thinking about going to this music festival in a few months. We’re planning for it now since tickets go on sale tomorrow. We both really want to go, but money is the issue. Not only are we planning our wedding, but we are going to be renovating soon. As well as I have some debt I keep trying to pay off. I can’t pay it off since things like this keep coming up and we don’t wanna miss out.

Anyways, today in our group chat with our 4 other best friends (who know about my money struggles and us needing to save) we were chatting about renting an RV vs tent camping and I mentioned that I wanted to do whatever was cheapest since we’re a little tight on cash right now. I also mentioned that if that wasn’t an issue, we would do the RV in a heartbeat and I wanted to compare costs. I will add; I’ve never been the friend to complain about costs. In fact, I’ve always been really down and that’s how I’ve found myself in some hot water with debt. I’m only being “stingy” because I haven’t been able to pay it off and we’re planning a wedding and such

My fiancé and I were texting separately about all of this and he even agreed with me- even stating this wasn’t even worth it, he’d rather go on a vacation, he doesn’t mind tent camping and we could bring all our own stuff etc. We ended up saying that we would chat more about it later when he got home so we were on the same page. BTW the cost difference with tent camping vs RV would be 400-500$ total.

Our group chat kept popping off about the RV and I sent a text saying “Fiancé and I are going to chat more about it tonight and get back to you guys”. My fiancé then messaged me separately saying “stop telling them about money problems, you’re making us sound poor”. I apologized and said I wouldn’t mention it again. He then proceeds to text in our group chat saying “oh yeah by the way we’re for sure doing the RV, that makes the most sense” and just completely threw me under the bus.

I got super pissed at him because wtf we literally were just chatting about it and he acted like he would have my back. I totally felt like I was the bad guy/the only one not 100% about the RV. It especially sucked because everyone else is like “what why wouldn’t we do the RV?” And are all gung ho about it. He told me that he didn’t want our girl best friend thinking we didn’t want to do it and he sensed she was upset we were on the fence about the RV so he said that… I literally was like so you’re putting her potential feelings over my feelings? I am the one struggling to pay off my debt and trying to be smart.

I’m so annoyed and frustrated with him. How do I approach this with him?

Tl;dr my fiancé threw me under the bus with our friends

ANSWER: The way he talks to you is problematic. He can convey his thoughts and feelings without cussing at you.

QUESTION: How can you really start to accept that people won't change? (Relationship with ADHD)

The relationship between me (28F) and my boyfriend (31M) is pretty decent overall. Our communication is good for the most part, we can be very honest with each other, we respect each other and act usually very supportive of the other. We've been together for 5 years now.

One thing I cannot get behind though is the fact that he has some traits and qualities I cannot change and which will, very likely, never change. Most of our arguments are about the same topics. Often times it's about his lacking degree of emotional regulation towards inconveniences or stress in general. He frequently uses me as an 'emotional dumpster' when he wants to vent about the world and whatever happened to him that upset him (note: not all of these things are really overblown and unreasonable as my wording might make it seem). Recently this happens a lot more frequently and it's exhausting.

He's already in therapy because of depression and ADHD (already medicated). I know that emotional regulation is especially hard for people with ADHD and this is what makes this so incredibly frustrating. I'm at a point where I don't wanna hear about all these same things anymore that bother him. He's just venting about it at me, not changing anything (e.g. talk to the person at work that actually upset him) or trying to work with his emotions to not always react this hard (which again, might not even be possible). To add some extra salt to the wound: He formed a new friendship with another person at work which is all fun and giggles all the time. So basically, he comes home, tells me how much fun he's had with this person and what cool stuff they've been doing this day, and then starts to vent. It feels like I'm being served all the negativity he's built up over the day, and this person is experiencing all the fluffy joy he has to offer instead (he's a very fun and goofy guy when he's not venting and marinating in his own misery). Yes, it's honestly the first time in perhaps 10+ years I felt some sort of jealousy.

I've voiced my wish for not being used as his private therapist all the time many, maaany times. He always apologizes and wants to better himself. Never does. We also get into other discussions about the same stuff over and over again, too. Also mostly related to his ADHD (cleaning, putting some effort into planning special days like anniversaries). In general, he's apologizing all the time and I believe him but at this point I can almost predict the words that come out of his mouth every time we're having this conversation.

A part of me feels like 'well, it's the ADHD, suck it up. If you like him, YOU have to find a way to deal with all this, not the other way round'. Another part, that has a lot of old childhood trauma mixed into this emotional response, screams at me that I cannot accept my boundaries not being heard. I don't want to go into details of my backstory, let's just summarize that I've had my fair share of therapy to work through this independently. I feel stable and pretty safe in that regard. But these two backgrounds—one person with ADHD, one with former PTSD—feel like a nightmare to mix.

Is anyone out there, perhaps with the same combination in their relationship, who can perhaps offer some advice? How can I not get triggered by making the experience of 'nothing will ever change, just swallow your anger and adjust your needs' over and over? It goes heavily against what I learned back then in therapy. All of this is really sucking the light out of our relationship. The fun times get less and less, all this 'drama' is leaving me so exhausted and depressed. One part of me is slowly giving up, since it all seems so hopeless to me. Please, offer some advice.

TL;DR: ADHD boyfriend (in therapy & medicated) constantly uses me as emotional dumpster + we have the same arguments over and over to no avail. Therefore getting depressed myself since I feel like I just cannot expect any change at all + this heavily triggers some of my former trauma memories of helplessness.

Edit: Adjusted TL;DR

ANSWER: By ending the relationship. I have severe ADHD and it's my job to manage/regulate my emotions and symptoms. I don't get a pass to shit on people who love me.

QUESTION: I (26F) need a reality check before I move cross country with my ex (29F).

Five years ago, I was married to a man while discovering my queer identity. He was supportive simply because he was a horny man and loved to imagine it, and encouraged me to explore. That is when I met Zoe through a queer dating app.

During the pandemic, our connection developed quickly and deeply. We had virtual cooking nights, painted together, planned creative dates, and all from opposite coasts. By the end of the year, we each separated our partners as we each wanted to do for years, and she moved across the country to be with me. For a week, it was magic. Then reality hit.

Despite sharing important values and perspectives, we were wildly different: our personalities, family dynamics, and ways of handling conflict clashed hard. I was going through a divorce and struggling in a conservative town where neither of us felt safe. Fights turned volatile, once even physical as she hit my throat when she was triggered as she thought I called her stupid during an argument. After nine chaotic months, we moved apart but kept talking.

Over the next couple of years, we tried to heal. Therapy helped me and she turned to secretive spiritual communities and meditation programs. That secrecy, along with our fundamental differences, always left me feeling confused, awkward, and divided (granted, I often feel that way as a person anyway).

In recent months, she asked me to be her girlfriend again. Things were calm and steady, though not romantic. No hand holding, no cuddling, separate rooms, but an awkward “dance” through our individual routines near each other each day. We’ve become great friends and roommates, sharing our lives but without intimacy. Still, I hoped our peace meant progress — and I was content as we had a great balance at home, and we each lived as our holistic, sober, celibate selves comfortably around one another.

Then, when prompted as I was in desperate need for clarity, she told me the truth: she doesn’t want a romantic partnership with me. She cares deeply, but she feels fear and sadness for me: for my small support system, my sensitivity as autistic person, my autoimmune conditions, and how we’ve impacted each other over time. It hurt, but I finally had clarity.

Now we are supposed to move to her hometown this spring, as we’ve planned for over a year, to care for her family that needs consistent care. On paper, it makes sense. We coexist well as friends and co-parents to our cats. But part of me knows I’d end up feeling alone and resentful while she’s surrounded by family.

I could instead move back to my home coast to be closer to the few family members I’m close with. It would mean living alone for the first time in my adulthood, which terrifies and excites me in equal measure. It feels like a real beginning. It feels like I finally would be able to be in my own orbit rather than someone else’s.

I think I already know the answer, but I can’t help second-guessing myself:

Would it be foolish or selfish to choose independence and move on my own instead of following her to support her, and care for her family?

—

TL;DR: My partner of five years and I planned to move to her hometown across the country to care for her family in the spring. She let me know that she is not interested in me romantically, but wants to remain as the good friends we are. Do I make the move I promised to make or move for myself for the first time in my adulthood?

ANSWER: > It feels like a real beginning. It feels like I finally would be able to be in my own orbit rather than someone else’s.

This sounds like an opportunity too good to pass up.

QUESTION: My fiance (M29) always eats things I leave for myself (F26)/or takes all of the food snacks

My partner and I have been fighting over food lately (or I've been fighting with him). He is always asking if im gonna finish what's on my plate as I'm eating. Or Ill buy snacks and they're all gone before I can have any. Or last week I had wings for lunch and didn't finish them, he just ate them before I got home from work and didn't feel bad at all.

It's frustrating. I tried to bring it up today and he tells me I must have a problem with food because it's weird that I'm upset about it and I shouldn't be upset about wings from a week ago. But I'm obviously not upset about that specific thing. I feel like for me, its just like he doesn't respect my boundary which is why I'm upset.

This feels like a stupid thing to fight over but I just can't stand that I food I want goes missing because I didn't tell him directly "don't eat my leftovers" or "hey save me some caramel bites because I'm gonna want some".

How do I fix this? I don't want to fight with my partner about food. But now he's in our bedroom and told me to leave him alone. Ugh.

TLDR - Fiance eats food I want to save for later every time or snacks in hoping to eat and told me I have a food problem because I'm upset about it.

ANSWER: It's not a stupid thing to fight over. You were looking forward to your little treats and he took them from you with zero consideration for your feelings. Partners shouldn't do that to one another.

Talk to him and tell him clearly: my leftovers are off limits to you unless I say you can eat it. You can share my snacks but it's rude to eat an entire bag of something I bought for myself and not immediately replace it. If he had a non romantic roommate he wouldn't be eating all their food without asking; it's the same thing here.

QUESTION: Is my (34F) husband’s (35m) terrible spending habits a deal breaker or is this salvageable?

My husband and I have been together 10+ years, married for 6, and recently I gave birth to our 2 month old baby. When I was pregnant I discovered that he accrued credit card debt among other things. His debt and loans amounted to $40k, he also spent $6k on a road bike and a mountain bike, spent unknown thousands on collectable cards (Pokémon, baseball), and had no personal savings. He makes great money ($150k+) so it’s extra shocking that he spent so much money to not have savings and end up with debt. He also hid it all from me because he was trying to fix it on his own without me finding out. In the past he also gambled some unknown amount and has also lost $14k by investing all his savings in one company’s stock. We had many fights about this and he has expressed remorse and that he is turning a new leaf. We cancelled all his credit cards and are gradually paying off the debt. Is this a deal breaker? Or is this relationship salvageable?

Here are some additional pros and cons for context: 
Pros:
- we generally enjoy spending time together 
- he contributes and is involved with the family and household 
- he is a good father

Cons: 
- bad with money 
- no physical intimacy 
- no sexual chemistry

Tldr- my husband is bad with money and hid his debt from me but said he has changed. Is this relationship salvageable or would most people walk?

ANSWER: Apart from the “list” of pro’s and con’s you failed to mention that you clearly have lost respect for him. Add to that the missing intimacy and missing chemistry - your frustration levels are only going to increase while your tolerance levels for putting up with “bad stuff” will only decrease. Once those lines intersect downwards you’ve crossed a threshold. You might already be there given your post. Even if you salvage his spending (and thats a big iff) how can you salvage no chemistry and a lack of intimacy???  This has “doom” written all over it. Ugh.

QUESTION: I (22M) have a very complicated relationship with my (24F) best friend

I've been pretty much best friends with a girl for over 5 years, and there has always been chemistry and tension between us. We tried dating once but she backed out because of her own stated commitment issues and life circumstances.

I'm the closest thing she's ever had to a boyfriend and the only guy to ever even take her on a date which is crazy because shes very traditionally attractive and could have any guy.

We hang out 1-on-1 constantly, travel to motor races together, stay in hotels, and have slept in the same bed platonically many times. She tells me I'm very attractive and a great guy, is very flirty with me, we know everything about each other, her friends and family even say we should date, and when anyone has asked her for reasons why she wouldn't, she said she couldn't think of one.

She even made a marriage pact with me (her idea) and wants to come to my work Christmas party saying we could joke that we aren't "dating" but getting married in 8 years. She once called me while drunk and said I'm the only guy she's ever felt really cared about her and that I might be the only guy she's actually loved. But whenever I talk to or date other girls, she acts like she doesn't care and just says she knows I'll "find someone," which hurts because I want it to be her.

The worst part is that she completely deflects and shuts down any time I try to have a serious talk about us. We're also core members of our friend group so I'm scared of ruining things - but the limbo is draining me. How would you recommend I approach this?

TL;DR there's clearly romantic tension between me and my best friend but she shuts down whenever I bring it up. How do I approach this?

ANSWER: Well, since she doesn't want to talk about it, it's time to stop flirting and acting like her BF. She doesn't get GF treatment if she doesn't want to be your GF.

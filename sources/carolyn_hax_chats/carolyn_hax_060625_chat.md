So now she wants to be friends?
Guest Jun 6, 11:05 a.m.
QUESTION: Years and years ago, my friend Evie called and said that her long-term boyfriend had just broken up with her and moved out. She was distraught. I told her I'd put the kids to bed and be right over. I didn't make it over there for 36hrs because my husband had a freak accident that ended up in the ER and the next 24hrs were touch and go - there was a chance I'd be raising my kids solo. Half-way through the ordeal, I called and left a message explaining what had happened. A day and a half later, once I was home and kids settled, I called her and she said she saw no reason for us to be friends. I had failed her. We had been close friends for over a decade. I was sad to lose the friendship but I had just been through hell - I didn't intentionally fail her! We are now in our early 60's. Her daughter found me on social media and sent me a message that her mom's health isn't great and she'd like if it I stopped by. The daughter says that her mom wants to see me but won't reach out herself because she is too ashamed. I don't know what to do with this information. If Evie really wanted to see me, wouldn't she reach out directly? And if Evie is so ashamed that she can't reach out herself, then how is it going to go sitting face to face? I am a kind person. If seeing me will help Evie in some way, I'll go but I don't want to be in a position where she expects me to apologize. Am I thinking about this all wrong?

ANSWER: For someone to have been as wrong and stupid as Evie was years ago doesn't come out of nowhere. You knew the context from the decade of close friendship, so I'm guessing you weren't completely blindsided when she did that to you?

So, it makes total sense to me at least that that Evie would be ashamed for years over her own behavior, and would not be able to reach out to you herself, even on her deathbed (if that in fact is her health situation). That seems to be the level of stuntedness Evie demonstrated all those years ago.

What you do with this info is up to you. I'm just saying, Evie was showily dysfunctional then and apparently isn't a whole lot more functional now. If you want to see her, then see her, but I'm not sure it's productive to think of Evie as having ulterior motives. You're in the position of strength, if you want to look at it that way -- if for no other reason than your ability to deal with people directly as a matter of course.

Am I entitled?
Guest Jun 6, 11:25 a.m.
QUESTION: I'm pretty sure my mom would have chosen to be child-free, if that concept existed in the 1970s when she had me. Instead, as a school teacher, she faced a lot of social and professional pressure to be a mom herself. Now that I am the ages she was when she raised me, I understand my childhood a lot better. She hated every part of raising me. She gave up a lot of personal freedom, financial security, and much-needed introvert time (another concept that didn't exist back then) to raise me, and as someone who became child-free myself (no surprise why), I actually get it and feel a lot of sympathy for her.

I already temper so many of my emotional expectations of her because of her circumstances. She doesn't tell me she loves me, she doesn't express any sort of parental pride, she doesn't talk nostalgically about our departed family members or family memories, she doesn't have any photos on display at home, etc.

My husband and I buy her birthday and Christmas presents, pay for brunch on Mother's Day, invite her over for weekly dinners and a movie, help her with her taxes and repairs around her house, but she doesn't reciprocate any of this. She doesn't even call me on my birthday, though I usually call her that week and she works a Happy Birthday in then.

But there was one thing she was doing for us that mattered a lot to us: she would watch our pets while we went out of town on vacation or to visit my husband's family, about four times per year. Now she is refusing to help anymore, because she says it's too disruptive to her life. It's not a matter of age - she's in extraordinary health. I think at its core she thinks our trips out of town are frivolous, and our pets don't bring her any personal pleasure so she can't see the point in doing it anymore. I've offered countless compromises to see if she'd keep helping us, all of which directly addressed her descriptions of the inconvenience it was causing, but she just wants to stop outright.

We can totally afford to board our animals. That's definitely what we'll do now. But this was the ONE THING she was doing that seemed....generous? Caring? Above and beyond what acquaintances do for each other? I have to be honest - I am devastated by this. I already let her off the hook for so many things. I want to pull away, stop the presents and dinners, and just give up on calling this a mother-daughter relationship entirely. Am I wrong to make this the final straw?

ANSWER: If you're going to frame it that way, then, yes. Because, as written, you've created the impression that this isn't so much a dialogue with your mother as a monologue where you're performing your part and your mom's. And so you're kind of getting mad at yourself and leaving.

But please let me answer a bigger question? I think giving up on "calling this a mother-daughter relationship entirely" is a great idea for both of you, dead on, so don't limit its tone and emotional possibilities with a connection to the petsitting.

I hope you see what I mean -- I feel like I'm not explaining it well.

If you say, "You stopped petsitting for us, so I'm punitively withdrawing the last few gestures that acknowledge you as my mother," then it's a tit-for-tat door-slam. I think the emotional complexity of this situation and the incredible generosity you have shown your mother deserve better. I think you and your mom both deserve better than pinning this to an artificially adopted symbol.

Free yourself of the societal-role expectations just because. Because they're merely smaller versions of what entrapped your mom in the 1970s, because they're no less arbitrary, because they're not working for either of you. (Well, maybe your mom likes the tax help and movie night, I shouldn't assume. But her big stand against petsitting looks like her way of saying she wants out of these rituals, too.)

The way I'm thinking about it, all the stuff you do for your mom gets another look, this time from forest perspective vs. tree. Do you buy her holiday gifts and do the Mother's Day dance, etc., because she wants and expects it, or have you been doing what you think you're supposed to? Or doing what you think you need, to tend to the injury of your childhood circumstances?

You make no mention of therapy, so I'll do it. You're dealing with a lot here. You've let more of it go, forgiven more, than I'm guessing most people would have been able to in your position, so I hope you don't take any of this as criticism. Anything I suggest is to help you along on the process you started.

I liken "temper so many of my emotional expectations" to anger. It's laudable progress for people to be able to feel their anger come on and then choose not to act on it. But it's a whole other step to heal the source of the anger so they simply get angry less often. Your next step is past tempering, and releasing yourself and your mom of mom-expectations entirely.

Then? You decide.

It is okay, though, to "redirect" more forcefully. Once you've hit the "good Lord drop it already" point: "If you're trying to say something, please say it." Or, "Your point being?" Or one-worders in the indeed, noted, thanks family, all of which cork the bottle effectively.

The kids always come first, right?
Guest Jun 6, 11:53 a.m.
QUESTION: We’ve been together 5 years and I moved in last summer. He has 2 kids from a previous marriage and we have them 3 weekends a month. On a typical weekend he makes plans for the 3 of them that don’t include me but we will usually have a meal or watch a movie together at some point. I do my own thing or make plans with friends. I have invited them to join me many times but the kids usually aren’t interested in what I’m doing even when it’s kid friendly (e.g. theme parks) or my boyfriend doesn’t want to change their plans.
Once or twice a year I ask him to switch weekends with his ex so he can attend certain events with me. Otherwise, I do most things without him because he’s with the kids. Recently, I asked him in Feb if he’d switch for an event in May and he agreed, happily even. I reminded him every few weeks to talk to his ex about the switch. When the time came he’d never talked to her and said he’d go with me “if” he didn’t have the kids. He made the arrangements only because I got upset (not the first time something like this has happened) despite my telling him not to at that point. As we drove by his ex’s neighborhood on the way to the event he said, “That's where my kids are.” Clearly he just wanted to be with them.
He genuinely seems to want to include me in the bigger things but once there, I’m all but ignored. On a yearly trip with his family I decided to include myself by joining him and the kids in the pool. I tried joining in and asked if they wanted to play any pool games, etc. and was flat out ignored. When we got home I told him how hurt I was by that and he had no idea I’d even gotten in the pool. His brother and SIL paid more attention to me on that trip than he did. We also go on a yearly trip with my family and he decided not to bring the kids this year. He said, “I’ll spend time with you this year since my kids won’t be there.”
We’ve been doing date night once a week and we have our one weekend a month. I guess that’s enough for him but we could have continued that without me moving in. Maybe I kind of thought moving in would automatically make us a family but the 3 of them are still in their bubble. I know it must be hard not to see your kids every day and I’m sympathetic to that. But I’m not asking him to spend less time with them, I just want to be included more. Is this just how it is when one partner has kids? Am I asking too much?

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: "Is this just how it is when one partner has kids?" There's no universal "how it is." This is how it is in *your* relationship. That is what matters, and whether you're okay with it.

You're clearly not, so it's time to accept that and decide your next move.

The next move includes your stating to him clearly, "I just want to be included more," because you apparently "kind of thought" it would happen "automatically," which I do not recommend.

I almost didn't bother recommending this step because it seems like you're saying it many different ways, especially by inviting everyone to join you, but that's the thing -- not saying it explicitly leaves all kinds of room for misunderstanding. He may actually think you want to do your own thing, and that you were only hurt that one time because he ignored you, not because you were left out of the bubble. You need to be clear, clear, clear about what you want.

Because that's the only way to find out whether he's willing to do the work to include you. Of course the kids will do their own thing around you, if that's what they're used to. He is going to have to incorporate you now, gradually and thoughtfully, to let the kids get to know you and get comfortable.

That is, assuming he wants you involved. If he likes it this way because it's easier for him, then you have a decision to make whether that's acceptable to you.

Again -- you have to communicate what you want so you can get to this point where you can see whether getting it is or isn't possible. It can't be asking too much if you haven't expressly asked.

You can, of course, read the whole situation as-is and decide you've seen enough; you're being ignored to a degree I wouldn't encourage anyone to rationalize. But you also seem like two people who don't communicate, so this is a chance for you, at least, to work on that.

QUESTION: I think you’ve been holding on to the pet sitting as proof that your mom loves you, in the absence of other proof. I understand why it’s so hard to have that taken away, and I know it’s not about the pet sitting. It sucks that you have to deal with a Mother who can’t express affection. Counseling helped me draw boundaries in my relationship with my own mother.

For am I entitled -
Guest Jun 6, 11:59 a.m.
QUESTION: I’d underline, too, that in addition to releasing you and your mother from “mom-expectations,”as Carolyn puts it, you can, with this process, also release yourself from your *own* “daughter-expectations,” as Carolyn also suggests when she asks why you have been keeping up with Mother’s Day and other holiday traditions. Yes, your mother may have been imprisoned, in a way, by the weight of societal or even internal expectations of what a “good” mother is or should be, but you may have constructed your own cage, based on internal or societal expectations of what a “good” daughter is or should be. Your mother’s refusal to pet-sit may just be the impetus for you, at least, to open the cage doors wide and see what freedom might feel like.

re: Evie
Guest Jun 6, 12:02 p.m.
QUESTION: People who are deeply ashamed of themselves are often far more able to deal with something once it is passed the point of no return in dealing with it. In other words, once you are there, in her presence, in her "face" so to speak, it is a very different set of circumstances and calculus than the one which involves actively reaching out to stir a pot that hasn't been stirred in decades.

But also think about it from this standpoint: What's the worst that happens if you don't go? What's the worst that happens if you do? Which one are you more comfortable living with?

path forward?
Guest Jun 6, 12:14 p.m.
QUESTION: I have a very close friend of many decades. We met one another even before we met and married our spouses. Once we married and had families, we would occasionally spend time with each others families. Everyone liked one another but the primary relationship was still between friend and I. Awhile back, friend and spouse began having marital difficulties. Friend confided in me a lot and mostly I was there to listen and support. Friend's spouse reached out to me during this period to ask me to get involved in fixing the marriage. I politely declined to do so. It didn't seem like a wise move (I'm certainly not qualified as a therapist.) I said I didn't want to get involved but left the conversation with no hard feelings. I subsequently learned through friend that spouse no longer wants to associate with me as I abandoned them in their time of need. I reached out to friends' spouse suggesting that we clear the air and gotten the cold shoulder. Help me understand what happened here. Was I wrong?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: No, you made a principled choice.

It's certainly Spouse's prerogative to take it badly and torch the relationship over it, but that only underscores the wisdom of your decision not to get involved. Yikes.

I hope Spouse's emotional immaturity (or, I could say, friend's poor taste in spouses) doesn't cost you your friend, but there isn't much you can do except settle in on the high ground you staked out. The moment to do so has passed, but if the word "abandoned" ever comes up again, you can assert that your support is unflagging -- you simply draw the line at involvement in anyone's marriage but your own.

Guest Jun 6, 12:21 p.m.
QUESTION: Just a note, from personal experience: it *can* come out of nowhere. I was close friends for at least a decade with a colleague. We shared bean soup (saying this just in case she sees this), stroller walks, & many years of life changes, until one day she announced that she was sick of being my friend. Absolutely out of the blue; just the week before she had been talking about how much fun we always had together. I was so concerned about the possibility of a serious mental health issue that I called a friend of hers. I never heard from her (or the friend) again.

A former Evie
Guest Jun 6, 12:26 p.m.
QUESTION: I used to avoid people like the plague when I made a mistake - especially a big one. I grew up in a house of both emotional neglect and perfectionism. This meant, if I made any kind of mistake, especially a big one, I could not emotionally handle what I did, and I couldn't face hearing a high level of disdain for another person.

While I've done a lot of work on myself over the years and I am MUCH better since I have the tools to manage these situations, there are some situations that I'm not proud of - people have every right to have a negative view of me due to past actions.

As a former Evie, I'll say this: She was in the wrong 100%. She should have reached out to you earlier to apologize. Much earlier. There are so many reasons she may not have that don't have anything to do with you. I wish that during those times, I had the hard conversation with the other person, even if I was scared to have it. I could have salvaged a few of those connections.

With that being said, you also don't owe her anything. If you think that you will benefit from seeing her in some way, then go for it. If it all feels like a big disruption, you can send a note wishing her well, or respond to the daughter saying that you will not be able to see her. People don't have their epiphanies on their deathbed, they talk about them more since the opportunity for long-term consequences are done.

Setting boundaries
Guest Jun 6, 12:30 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi! I was diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year and am still undergoing treatment. FYI if you have dense breast tissue that mammograms can’t see through ask your doctor if you qualify for extra screening methods! It might save you from having a much bigger problem (like me). Okay, so it’s been a roller coaster for months and I kept my circle small. Just my family and close friends but in the process I came to the realization that my MIL isn’t in “my corner” and never will be. After 26 years of relationship that has been at times really challenging and hurtful (went to therapy for it 15 years ago), I really feel so much better with essentially keeping her away from me. Cancer helped me set boundaries with her. My question, and I’m embarrassed I still don’t know how to do it, how can I keep a friendly but somewhat distanced space from her? I am a people pleaser so this is really hard. She keeps trying to connect - she misses my attention.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I am so sorry you are going through this, a really taxing experience without the emotional weight of a difficult relationship. There is absolutely no need to throw embarrassment on the pile. Managing a difficult relationship is not a one-size-fits-all thing we are all supposed to know how to do by x time or y age.

Anyway. Your spouse really needs to step in here and tell your MIL that you are taking more time to rest/for yourself, or you are communicating less, or however you two decide to phrase it, and so your spouse is to be her primary contact hereafter. Period. And your spouse eats the fallout for this. Period.

That is the path to the distanced space while you undergo treatment and heal.

If you and/or spouse are unwilling to take a step this drastic, then I am going to be a noodge and ask you to think about that for a bit. Because you deserve and need this space and support. So who is not giving it to you and why? Who is treating your needs as less important than hers?

If that is too big to take on right now, then, fair. I will back off. And suggest this:

Pick a form or topic of communication with her that is easy, and live there. Errands, recipes, your spouse, a TV show, a team, books, her garden/dog/job -- by text only, or one call a week, or one narrowly defined help request per week, etc. Set it and forget it.

I know this is emotional work just to figure out, which is why it is my second option. But once it's in place, it can be magic for containment.

Take care.

Grief
Guest Jun 6, 12:49 p.m.
QUESTION: Sibling and I just past the 2nd anniversary of our mom’s death, and are quickly approaching the two year mark on the incredibly difficult job of clearing out and selling her house. Sibling and I have had an up and down relationship over the past 30 or so years.
My relationship with mom was strong when her relationship with sibling was tenuous, but became fraught as she pulled closer to sibling after the first grandkid was born. In recent years she almost seemed to try and pick fights with me when we’d see each other and criticized many things about how I parent my own kids.
How do I grieve the mom I was close to when I’m not all that sorry to no longer have to juggle a volatile relationship with random landmines?
Thanks

ANSWER: Best advice I have is to relieve yourself of the burden of having the right kind of grief. You can miss one version of Mom and not the other in the same thought. Have all the complicated thoughts and feelings and don't bother feeling guilty.

The classic saying -- if you don't like New England weather, wait a few minutes -- works pretty well for grief like you describe, especially when you're digging through box after box of memory triggers. Try just letting it all roll by. See if that helps.

Friend going through a split
Guest Jun 6, 1:03 p.m.
QUESTION: A close friend is going through a divorce, and has taken a dive into a new relationship before even moving out of the house and legal proceedings haven't started yet. They say they are in love, but I am struggling with watching this. I think the move to start the relationship so soon is a) not fair to their spouse, and b) ripe with risk for going supremely badly since it's such a tender time. They've asked my opinion about everything else split-related except for this. Do I say anything? It has nothing to do with me except for concerns about their judgement and a dread that I'll be asked to support them through another messy split at some point. But again, no one has asked me for my thoughts. We rarely keep things from one another.

QUESTION: No crisis here, just a repeated effort to talk myself down from resentment I’m not sure is justified, and you have such a way of bringing insight when people feel stuck. 2.5 years ago after my FIL passed we moved 80’s non-driving MIL into independent living about 20 minutes away, and since my husband still works full time while I volunteer part time now, it made sense that I take her to her appointments and bring her supplies. The thing is, I’m from a southern-ish area and am used to a certain kind of considerate treatment from friends etc, and my husband is also quite considerate. However, she’s NYC born and isn’t mean, just rarely thinks to say things like please and thank you, and is the only person in my life that would ever just tell me what to do vs asking. I just feel disrespected, especially when she’s anxious and it comes out in talking to me in a way I would never tolerate from anyone else. But I don’t think it’s anything she is even aware of, and I’m rather conflict averse. Is the problem me, and I should learn to be less sensitive and more compassionate? Or is there any way to address the dynamic that won’t likely do more harm than good?

ANSWER: Thanks for the kind words.

I'm sorry, too, that you're the designated driver for exactly what torments you in a person. Very "No Exit," if you're up for a little Sartre.

But you have gone 99 percent of the way to solving your own problem, so I hope you will take me up on the easier suggestion to push the last 1 percent. You are not being "disrespected," any more than you would be if your MIL spoke English as a second language and used an insulting word inadvertently as a consequence.

The formula for disrespect includes intent. From your description, your MIL is not only deeply imprinted in her mannerisms, but also the same with you as with anyone, yes? -- though let's take away the geographic markers; they're not relevant. (They may dictate manner and accent, but to suggest region determines thoughtfulness vs. self-absorption is a nonstarter.)

So there's nothing to internalize or address. You're carrying a passenger who doesn't speak your language, and you don't understand hers. The fact that she goes deeper into "her" language when anxious or upset really tracks.

The thing for you to learn, then, is more like retraining, to see your differences as stemming from communication vs. intent. Nothing hurtful there.

Couples therapy
Guest Jun 6, 1:29 p.m.
QUESTION: My wife is has been seriously depressed for a couple months, more so than in the 25 years we've been together. In the past few couples therapy sessions, she declined to explain why when I (at the therapist's suggestion, though I had asked before too) invited her to do so. She then said part of the reason she couldn't is that I would then get upset, which would shift the focus from her to me. The therapist supported her position.

In other words, it is my fault that she won't explain why she is upset to me. (Narrator: He knows why she is depressed. It is because she doesn't like sex, he is hurting as a result, she knows she will never change but is unwilling to say so clearly, and we both realize there is no good solution. But his saying so would be speculating about her internal mental state which he's learned is a no-no in couples therapy; it is important only to talk about one's own feelings.)

Is this rational? Is this abuse? Is this therapist playing favorites?

ANSWER: What do those questions have to do with anything.

Your wife doesn't like sex. Are you ready to accept this and move on to whatever is next for you -- as a couple or not as a couple anymore?

Or is it your intention to try to talk about this to some better outcome for you, when you seem to be saying you already know there isn't one?

If it's the former, then you say what upsets you is limbo and not knowing the truth, and you are prepared to accept your reality, even one you don't want, because then you at least know where you stand. Because it's not about blame it's about living honestly. (Isn't it?)

If it's the latter, then you don't belong in couples counseling, because your wife is not safe to speak freely -- because you may try to use her honesty to get something you want from her.

Re: friend split
Guest Jun 6, 1:31 p.m.
QUESTION: My best friend recently moved in with her 2nd ex-husband. Their actual marriage was volatile. They’ve had several rounds of semi-reunifications, friends with benefits, and barely speaking. It was chaotic for a few years. I used to feel the same way every time she told me there were back together. One day it hit me: their relationship isn’t my business. I’m here for her, and if she is ok with what she’s doing, that’s good enough for me. I don’t have to fix it and don’t have to prepare for the next break-up. That has nothing to do with me.

Mother in Laws ans Mothers

ANSWER: Lovely. Thank you.

Oh -- not to tarnish the loveliness, but I have been meaning to mention Molly Jong-Fast's memoir about her absentee mother for "Am I entitled?" I have read only the reviews so far, but if it isn't on point then at least it will be a great read.
Review | Molly Jong-Fast’s memoir about her famous mom is sad, dishy and relatable

QUESTION: You noted this, Carolyn, but I just wanted to state very clearly that being raised in NYC (or anywhere else for that matter) does not make one rude. I was born in da Bronx and spent the first 25 years of my life there surrounded and taught by caring, courteous, polite people who treated other with respect and love. Thank you very much.

Re: kids always come first
Guest Jun 6, 1:43 p.m.
QUESTION: You don’t mention how old the kids are, but they are presumably still pretty young. You can NEVER force kids who went through a divorce to accept you, and are just building the wall higher if you force it. They have their own issues with their parents split, which you can’t ever understand from their perspective. It may be hard to deal with, but it’s nothing you can do anything about.

ANSWER: Right, absolutely true, but this is separate from civil integration of a family unit. Conducting a father-and-children bubbled family within a home where his partner is treated as if she doesn't exist is not okay.

Insights on the very public feud that Trump and Musk are conducting with personal spite?
Guest Jun 6, 1:45 p.m.
QUESTION: I hope nobody is surprised by this. It’s a long established pattern. It would have been shocking if it didn’t happen. People continuing to behave as they have always behaved is pretty normal.

ANSWER: Exactly. The number of Scaramuccis they lasted is the only surprise I'm witnessing.

The capacity for deception, on the other hand, self- and otherwise, shocks the hell out of me. So there's that.

Spouse hasn't spoken to me in five days.
Guest Jun 6, 1:55 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn. Late last week, my husband and I got into a big fight over a misunderstanding (that I don't even know what prompted it) which escalated to the point of me angrily telling him to go to his parents' place, which he did. He stayed there for three days, before I went down and convinced him to come back home with me. But he is still angry. I know it was wrong to ask him to leave and have since tried to apologize sincerely multiple times. But he stays sequestered in our second bedroom and I have now not seen him for five days, nor heard from him, though I know he is there. He is eating by himself and only doing his own laundry. Any attempts to engage with him are met with either silence or angry words about how he doesn't want to talk to me or look at me. I'm at a loss and I don't know what to do. I'm trying to wait patiently, but his anger doesn't seem to have dissipated in the slightest, and I'm breaking down being stonewalled in our home. Any advice?

ANSWER: I think it goes without saying, this is outside the bounds of healthy adult anger management. Do you have access to counseling -- through work maybe, an EAP? Through your health insurance? This would be for you of course to start. The direction would be toward emotional education for both of you, which would be what brings him along, but that's a goal down the road. Right now you're doing what you can do and assessing your options, with credentialed support.

If you ever feel unsafe, 1-800-799-SAFE. To cross that T.

How do I get over myself?
Guest Jun 6, 2:03 p.m.
QUESTION: I got laid off and recently have been hired by former colleagues as a consultant, but I've never been a consultant before and I'm really struggling to get started. I helped develop the scope of my work, so I actually do know what is needed, but I seem to be in a paralysis and can't seem to get started. Huge amounts of imposter syndrome happening here. How can I get over this so I don't lose this opportunity?

ANSWER: Can you pick something? You developed the scope of your work, you say -- so what's the first thing? Type it and send it in. And if you want, also say why you aren't doing it, because there's a reason you aren't doing it.

If it's a good reason, then do the second thing.

Imposter syndrome is real, I know that, but it's also BS and here's why: It affects regular healthy people who know what they don't know, while all the "I alone can fix it!!" Dunning-Krugerite yahoos rush in and screw it all up because they don't know what they don't know.

So just do a thing. Once you start, you'll have it.

Re: How do I get over myself?

QUESTION: Another thing you can do, especially since you already know your former colleagues, is straightforwardly say to them "So, as you know, I've never been a consultant before, and I'm used to interacting with you all as colleagues. So I'm learning as I go on things like [whatever's different about being a consultant], so don't hesitate to let me know if I miss the mark and I'll adjust." Then, as things come up, you can ask them "Do you prefer if I [A] or [B]"?

Re: How do I get over myself
Guest Jun 6, 2:13 p.m.
QUESTION: I worked on a consultant basis for decades. At first I always felt like you do: "What am I doing here? Why did they even hire me? I don't know what I'm doing! I'm going to screw this up and never be able to work again ... " Etc., etc. After a couple of experiences like this, I realized that I ALWAYS felt like this for the first week or two on a contract -- and it wasn't because I was ignorant, it was because I genuinely did not know at first what the problems were and what I was going to do to solve them. I was being a good listener and figuring out what the client actually needed, rather than coming in with a canned solution that might not fit their situation at all. So I learned to relax and be a sponge for the first couple of weeks, maybe (as CH suggests) produce a bit of work to show the client that I was listening ... and then kick into problem-solving mode once I felt surer what the problem was. Your reaction is perfectly normal, so don't worry about it.

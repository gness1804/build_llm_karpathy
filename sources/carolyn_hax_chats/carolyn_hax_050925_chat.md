Don't want belly rubs from a cheater
Guest May 9, 11:06 a.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,

In February, my partner started cheating on me. I found out in March and immediately ended the relationship. He was upset about getting caught, but not deeply remorseful, and the woman he cheated with is still in his life and in his phone (though I don't think they are going to get together).

A week after breaking up with him and blocking his number, I found out that I was pregnant. This was not exactly planned but it was also not UNplanned. I am 36 and we pulled the goalie a while ago, feeling some time pressure. Our thinking was that we would get married soon regardless, sooner if I happened to get pregnant.

I contacted him to tell him that I'm pregnant. He asked if I want to get back together, which I considered, but the answer is no. The trust is gone. Then he asked if I want to end the pregnancy, and the answer is absolutely no. I am 17 weeks now and so attached to this baby.

My ex-partner is very upset, because he wanted to be a father and wants to be involved. I shared ultrasound photos with him, but then he was upset because I didn't invite him to the appointment. He has called, crying, to ask if he can come over and rub my belly (he swears this is all he wants). I do not want to be touched by him because I'm too angry, but I can't decide whether this is unfair.

We will co-parent in some way (we have set up counseling to start planning for it), but do I have to involve him in the pregnancy too? It has turned out to be a much more tender and vulnerable experience than I had expected, and I wanted to share that with him but not under these circumstances.

ANSWER: This is an unusually intimate heartbreak, I am so sorry.

I am sorry specifically that he made such a needy and clueless ask of you. I mean. No! Okay? No. Talk about a forfeited right. It's time for him to help *you* feel better, not the other way around.

I think he needs to hear this. That having broken it, he might consider thinking how to fix it -- instead of coming to you and expecting you, the person he just devastated and is now trying to handle her own pain, to take on his pain and make it all better, too.

Plus: You are going to be partners in raising this child, and you are going to have to find ways to get along, and that is going to require levels of forgiveness you never knew you had in you -- and that might be true even if there were no cheating involved! parenting is like that -- but tender-sweet-vulnerable access to your body is something to put way down on the access list right now. If it ever makes the list again.

So to answer your specific question: Your body is the one going through so much physically and emotionally, the latter of which he's responsible for, so you can decide, without being "unfair," what lines you don't want him to cross. You just can.

If you ever eventually want to give him some access to the experience of the pregnancy, as your anger recedes, or as something you decide will be better for the child and their bond, or because you believe you might regret your hard line later (just offering these, not endorsing any of them) -- then here's a way to think about it.

First, decide on your terms, not in answer to tears.

Second, think what is about you and what is about the baby. For example: Most incremental OB appointments are about your health, so, nope. If there's an ultrasound scheduled later on to measure fetal growth, then (quietly) keep an open mind about letting him be there for that.

You've got counseling coming. It's okay just to say no now and decide to decide later. "I have a lot of anger yet to process, pressuring me on top of that is not okay."

(Plus a 17-week belly is kind of just a belly. But that's beside all the points.)

Congrats on the baby and good luck through the extensive deep breathing process ahead.

So much advice
Guest May 9, 11:27 a.m.
QUESTION: My husband and I are the parents of two teens, who are generally sensible kids who share their lives pretty freely with us. In the past year, my husband started seizing on every opportunity to advise them about whatever subject the kids mentioned. It’s to the point where the kids can’t mention anything without being talked at for ten minutes by their dad. The kids zone out, exchange looks with one another and have also said (to my husband) that they feel condescended to and sometimes they’re just venting. I know my husband feels the inevitable, and normal, drift as the kids grow independent and he’s trying to be superdad in these last daily opportunities to parent. I’ve said as much to him and said I get his instinct to parent more but we need to back off and let the kids heed their own judgment before we jump in. My husband got very angry and accused me of “shirking” my duty as a parent and said the kids will get his advice as long as he’s alive (he’s perfectly healthy) and he owes them his “wisdom.” It was out of character and bizarre. I tried to raise it again weeks later and he took the same angry stance. The kids now avoid him as much as possible so they don’t constantly hear about what they “should” do or have done.. What can I do?

ANSWER: Ironic, isn't it. He's living proof that advice is pointless when people don't want to hear it.

I'll just assume he won't appreciate it if you put it to him that way -- unless you know how to disarm him, or catch him at a particularly receptive moment.

Once you're dealing with someone so dug in as to be angry-reactive upon approach, questions and generalized concern are often a better entry point: "You okay?" Maybe a long walk, too, away from the kids. This is oddly specific, but there are reasons for that: A literal change of secenery from the source of stress is helpful to clarity of thought. Also helpful, physical activity. Movement can jar our deeper, scarier thoughts loose from their embedded places. Walking in particular, if we're able, has this power. Also, when people are facing forward, vs facing each other, they often find it easier to talk about difficult things (why cars can be such a great place for kids to unburden).

So, you have a partner who clearly is knotted up over some stuff and acting out. And not only is the path he's taking unproductive, but it's also directly undermining his own started purpose. He's pushing his kids away and they're tuning him out on contact.

This is something you might, might be able to point out to him eventually. If he does start talking a bit about this anxiety he's feeling, no doubt about the passage of time, about the kids' futures, about his own relevance -- then you can be supportive and sympathetic. The timing is pretty typical for a parent to go through a lecturing spasm.

But ideally he won't need you to point it out, because once someone gets to the point of admitting this stuff out loud, it's often self-correcting. Just saying it can reduce the anxiety dramatically. Then: "So I just need to shut up and trust that I've already shared whatever wisdom I have, and it's up to them to ask me or figure out how to use it."

Maybe way too optimistic. But keeping it in your mind as an anxiety response and dealing with him accordingly might get you there.

And the occasional: "My duty as a parent is also to recognize when something isn't working -- and if they're pushing me away, then I need to adjust my approach."

This is all Part 1. Part 2 is for your husband to talk to someone, about the anxiety and anger, if he is completely inflexible. (Or you do, if he's inflexible on that.)

Credit card fraud?
Guest May 9, 11:38 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,
I'm writing on behalf of my husband with his knowledge. His best friend's wife recently called him asking for a loan. Apparently she has a history of poor financial management, took out a credit card in her husband's name (how?) and maxed out the card. She called my husband asking for money to pay the company. Even worse, her intentions is not to pay right away and make a deal with the company for a lower amount. My husband is ducking her calls. I told him he must confront her, tell her if she doesn't come clean to her husband, he'll have to tell his best friend himself. She has put my husband in a terrible place: keep a secret from his best friend (unacceptable )which could ruin the poor guy's credit or blow up a marriage. Any advise to me, the advisor?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: If this were my friend's spouse calling me for the loan, then I would go straight to my friend with this information. Meaning, I would not apply the usual, "You have 24 hours to tell my friend the truth or I will tell," here. Here's why:

I already know I can't trust the spouse (fraud), and there's room for plenty more damage in those 24 hours. So I tip my friend off asap. And I give my friend the info for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. And the name of a good lawyer, if I know of one.

Any damage to the friend's credit or marriage already falls squarely on the shoulders of the spouse.

If there is damage to my friendship for doing this, then I will own that. A fair risk for doing what's right for my friend.

My advice to you, the advisor, is decide whether you agree with that hypothetical, and counsel your husband accordingly.

Update from Wedding Mom
Guest May 9, 11:43 a.m.
QUESTION: I talked to my daughter and we came up with a list of priorities/compromises. I offered to work on the flowers since I'm a landscape architect and my daughter loved that idea. I thought we could go for local/native flowers but my daughter wants something more traditional and formal so that's what we'll do. It's also very important to her that I have an escort for the wedding so I talked to my boyfriend and even though it's not his kind of scene he promised to show. Lastly she asked me not to show up "dressed like Mrs Maisel" but I pushed back on that since I've being wearing vintage since she was born. In other words, we're getting there

Guest May 9, 11:52 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,
In December I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Fortunately it was caught early, is highly treatable and my prognosis is excellent. Understandably (I hope) during this time sex has been a low priority. There has been the emotional uncertainty before I knew everything I knew now, batteries of tests, and most recently surgery and radiation. About six weeks ago, when looking for one of my own medications, I accidentally discovered that my husband had a prescription for 20 mg of Cialis, with the specification that they be used one hour before sexual activity (i.e. they are the daily use ones). At the time, I just could not deal with what this likely means -- I had just had surgery, and so I didn't say anything. Since my "discovery" five pills have been used (but we have not been sexually active). There's no other plausible explanation, right? My daughter (his step daughter) is getting married in June and I don't want any drama, but eventually I have to have this conversation. Our finances are separate, but if I am to leave, what else should I be doing before having this conversation.

ANSWER: Take heart: When this nightmare is behind you, you will know exactly how much crap you have the strength to get through.

Whoo.

The "what else should I be doing" question is for a lawyer. So that's my advice, find yourself a good one and have a talk. If you want a steady source of confidential emotional support, then line up a therapist, too.

The generosity you are showing your daughter is lovely, I just want to acknowledge that.

SIL blocked me
Guest May 9, 12:13 p.m.
QUESTION: My brother has been married for 33 years to “Lynn”. In those years, she built a wall between him and his family. She has held grudges and has never tried to get to know his family. She once accused me of trying to steal their tent I borrowed because my brother wouldn’t make plans to meet so I could return it. When our mother died, my brother didn’t come to the funeral because she refused to come. I recently discovered that my SIL has been blocking me on social media. I don’t know what I did to upset her, but it makes me sad that I am missing out on my brother’s life, my nephew’s life, and my SIL’s life, and I will never know why or if there is anything I can do to change it.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm sorry. This is mostly a brother problem. Lynn is the source, but he is the one who could have said this level of control and division was not okay, and instead he chose to go along with it. Who knows whether marrying her was part of his decision to separate from his family, or if the estrangement was an unintended consequence of being with her. It's a known phenomenon, though, for people who want some emotional separation (for whatever reason) but lack the strength to follow through, to find a partner who does the dirty work for them. If that's the case with your brother, then there really is very little you can do.

Either way, whether this was his choice or a slow-motion accident, all you have to counteract the distance between you is consistent, non-obnoxious effort to stay in touch -- with him, with her, with them. However you can manage it, in good faith, with as much patience as you can muster.

That may sound awful and self-erasing, but the alternative is to give up. Because that's the only one she has left you.

Her blocking you on social media is a sad thing and does cut you off from the feed of their news, but it really is just the last superficial tie. You are "missing out on my brother’s life, my nephew’s life, and my SIL’s life" already if you are not involved in it. So, focus on that -- in what ways are you still able to be involved? And try to get the most out of those.

Response to sister’s concerns!
Guest May 9, 12:15 p.m.
QUESTION: My sister is going down a rabbit hole about her 4 year old’s health. He has some eczema issues and she has started banning all sorts of food and products with certain chemicals in an attempt to solve the problem. I’m a child of the 80s where we ate and played with anything and everything so it’s hard for me to understand this level of anxiety. I obviously want to validate her feelings and be supportive. Are there any generic statements that I can make, even though I don’t fully understand or even agree with?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: The first thing you can do is not equate your sister's parenting experience with your 1980s childhood. That's basically saying it's her fault for being a headcase, instead of recognizing she has to work with too many different variables to count.

I mean -- do you know for sure her child isn't reacting to a food additive? Even the word "anxiety" comes with judgment attached.

I'm from Planet 80s, too, so I get where you're coming from. But that cred didn't make, say, my kids' reactions to scented laundry products any more real. Some products and exposures are just different now from 40 or 50 years ago.

The best thing you can do for your sister is "fully understand" that, as much as humans don't fundamentally change from generation to generation, the conditions parents have to deal with can change a lot. Just the exposure to information is an enormous change. My older sisters got their parenting advice from other people, TV, radio, print. Just the 10 year gap means I started to get mine from email and online, and socials by the end. Another 10 years and parents are saturated with so much information, misinformation and disinformation that the ones who aren't anxious might be the outliers.

So maybe commit to not judging her, understand what you don't understand, know it's not your place to "agree" unless you're a stakeholder in possession of all the relevant information, and ask if there's anything you can do to help.

Auntie Smaug and the Necklace
Guest May 9, 12:21 p.m.
QUESTION: Re: Tuesday's column, I'm OP. The wedding went great! I did invite the aunt (not worth the drama). She's always been a peach and would've reacted very poorly to being called out. I wrote the letter, tore it up, and moved on. My maid of honor was on high alert for bad behavior the day of, but thankfully all went well.

The ring was my paternal (step)grandfather's - aunt's biological dad - and all the siblings received a piece of the reformed jewelry, as agreed between them. Mom gave it to me with my dad's blessing. I'm not sure what her claim to ownership of my dad's portion was, but I don't much care anymore.

My dad and I walked down the aisle to the same music my mother did, and I wore that gift from her proudly.

RE: Tell it to me straight
Guest May 9, 12:29 p.m.
QUESTION: I agree that the circumstantial evidence doesn't look good for your husband. But in the spirit of acknowledging the burdens of caregivers, I have to wonder whether there might be a more compassionate explanation. It seems plausible to me that he might be freaking out about your diagnosis in his own way, and keeping it secret in order to conceal the burden from you -- and also because of his own guilt and shame. Obviously you may not have the energy to help manage his fear, but you should at least encourage him to get some kind of support -- if not necessarily the support you fear he's choosing. If he is otherwise a good and loving husband, and a compassionate caregiver, then it's essential to talk to him about it. There are a lot of missing details here, and you might be surprised by what you might learn -- and what you can forgive. By all means, talk to a lawyer and prepare for the worst -- but don't assume the worst until you can confirm it with him. Good luck.

So Much advice- here's just a little more (sorry)
Guest May 9, 12:35 p.m.
QUESTION: Maybe this will help enlighten your husband- what he's doing is very counterproductive. Teenagers live in the same world we do. They know about the bad stuff, and they probably know more about how it plays out in their own personal corners of the universe than you or your husband ever will. Yes, they are impulsive and emotional compared to adults, and they aren't always great at calculating risk. But what helps them is to have an adult they can reach out to, without fear of judgment or harm, who will meet them where they are when they have a problem. This is the opposite of what your husband is doing. Yes, we venerate the image of the family patriarch imparting wisdom to their children (ideally at a hardwood table or under a tree), but... that doesn't mean that lectures actually help kids. Right now your kids know that if they have problems, find someone other than dad to talk with about them.

Doesn't everyone deserve a second chance?
Guest May 9, 12:55 p.m.
QUESTION: I had some set-backs (a break-up which left me homeless combined with job loss) that were a wake-up call for me. I deserved all of it because I cheated on my boyfriend who was supporting me and had gotten me a job with his family’s company. After a lot of therapy, I came to realize that I had coasted through my 20s taking advantage of various people. I intend to change my life for the better and so I took a new job that pays much less but one I am qualified for. My brother and SiL were nice enough to rent me a room in their house which is very close to work. That's important because the only car I can afford is not very reliable.
In the past I was snarky and judgmental about my SiL for superficial reasons and she knew it so our relationship is strained. As part of my new life I’m trying to mend fences so I’ve apologized and tried to befriend my SiL. She blew me off, saying that I’m only trying to “make nice” now that I need her and to forget it. My brother accepted my apology and we’ve become close again but he takes his wife side in this so whenever she is around her animosity makes things difficult. Do I just accept this is how it’s going to be while I’m living here? I wish she’d give me another chance, I know she doesn’t owe me that but her cold shoulder is really wearing on me. Should I try again to explain myself or am I just going to have to live with this until I can save up enough money to move out?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I don't think explaining yourself is the way to go. You have already explained, and SIL didn't buy it.

Instead I suggest saying to SIL that you can see why she didn't buy it. For example:

"You have every reason not to believe my apology is sincere. I spent the last [number] years taking whatever I wanted from people and not caring about how I treated them. I also wasn't kind to you. If I were you, then I wouldn't believe me, either."

I mean, would you believe you? Be honest.

Your brother probably did because he's your brother. He either wants to believe you, or he's better at reading you, so he has more than your word to go on.

After you say this to your SIL, then say: "I am grateful you are letting me stay here, even though you don't believe me. I hope time will let me prove to you that I mean it. I created this mess, so it's on me to clean it up."

Then don't try to "befriend" your SIL. Be an excellent tenant, helper, guest, sibling and general citizen. That's how you live down past mistakes.

Can’t make anyone feel
Guest May 9, 1:25 p.m.
QUESTION: I’ve heard this- you don’t have control over anyone’s feelings. Okay, makes sense. But is the reserve true- that you are not accountable to anyone’s feelings? So if I tell someone “you are making me feel sad” is this wrong? Isn’t there some accountability for affecting people’s feelings? I may have been talking to someone else who misinterpreted this. I just want some clarity.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Well ... as manipulators across time have always understood, there's a lot we can do to control other people's feelings.

What you're getting at is where the lines of reponsibility go. It's a really good concept to have down, because it's what differentiates healthy relationships from unhealthy ones.

Each of us is responsible for what we choose to do. That includes taking into account its possible effect on others.

But that doesn't mean anything I do that hurts someone else is wrong. I don't have to make plans with someone I don't like, for example, just because saying no would hurt them. My time is my responsibility, not theirs.

If instead I did something hurtful just to hurt, like ... I broke something of theirs out of spite, then their hard feelings would totally be my fault.

So to take your example, "You are making me feel sad." It depends on the context, but in general, it's okay to tell someone when you are feeling sad in response to their actions toward you. "When you say these things to me, I feel really sad." Even if it's not something they're doing to you, it's okay. Like if someone moves away: "I'm sad we don't see each other anymore."

But that doesn't translate into another person's responsibility to make you un-sad. You hope the person will stop saying the things to you -- but if they don't, then it's up to you to do what you need to protect yourself from that person.

I'm taking forever on this, explaining it through examples. In any situation, though, you can reason it out by tracing the baseline responsibility. Whose choice it is, whose business it is, whose time it is, who has the last word. When you're trying to get other people to make you feel better, or trying to manipulate how others feel for your own advantage, then you're crossing lines.

Rub her belly???
Guest May 9, 1:29 p.m.
QUESTION: The request by the cheating ex to rub her belly (!!!) made my jaw drop. It is so creepy. Accompanied by the unsolicited reassurances that "this is all he wants," my "yikes" alarms went off. This guy has major boundary issues. Keep your lines right where they are, LW. The fact that the LW is even asking if it is "fair" to say no to such a gross request suggests that there may have been some conditioning/manipulation going on during their relationship. LW, are there other ways this guy has twisted things to make you worry your boundaries are unfair? Make sure solo counseling for you is in the mix as you navigate this. The ex's attitude of being sorry he got caught but not sorry for lying and cheating is another red flag here. Stay militantly on your own side and on your baby's side against boundary pushing and line blurring. And thank stars you got out, as crappy as the wakeup call had to be.

How do I talk about separating?
Guest May 9, 1:34 p.m.
QUESTION: How do I start a conversation about separating with my partner? We've tried multiple therapists for multiple years, and I don't have the energy to keep working. The straw that broke the camels back was during therapy, when the therapist said to my partner: "Your partner [me] is looking at you lovingly." And I thought to myself "I don't feel that. I'm not feeling love for this person and I don't know how to get that feeling back."
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You start telling the truth in therapy. That is what you are there for.

It sounds as if you kept your thought to yourself?

I realize that's a brutal one. But you're there, and it's time for your partner to hear it.

Or how about this, and you don't wait for the next session: "We've tried multiple therapists for multiple years, and I don't have the energy to keep working. I would like to separate."

Often saying it is the tallest obstacle.

belly rub vs. cheater
Guest May 9, 1:35 p.m.
QUESTION: I know you're a dog person, but I'll use my cat as an example. Sometimes she seems like she is dying for a belly rub. Other times she instantly attacks if you even come close, despite her apparent pose for one. The point is, the person wanting to give the belly rub is NEVER the one to decide if it's OK.

In this situation I would be all extended claws and teeth. Don't give in to his manipulation.

RE Response to sister’s concerns!
Guest May 9, 1:36 p.m.
QUESTION: As the parent of two kids with eczema, I would like to point out that what your sister is doing (banning certain chemicals and additive) is pretty standard advice that all dermatologists have recommended. It's definitely not a rabbit hole!!
Also, severe eczema untreated can lead to bacterial infection (my kids have had them because they were scratching themselves), so anything you can do to proactively manage it really makes a big difference.

I, unfortunately, have to go. No marathon today -- and I know I leave you severely under-Nedded. But I will be back at it next week. Have a great weekend, and thanks for stopping by.

QUESTION: Update 2: I (30F) caught my husband (31M) in an affair and don’t know how to move forward.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/vfJzYwOX6V

Update 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/uMVTyBbusT

Wow. I can’t believe this happened over five years ago now. In some ways, it feels like it happened to me in a different life. I still get messages asking about this and figured I could add some insight into how life can look a few years down the line after everything gets completely and utterly wrecked. Good news—If you put in the work, it looks pretty fucking great.

First of all—where is my ex husband now? I haven’t had contact with him since September of 2020 and largely don’t keep track of things but I can see that this man still follows me on Instagram and watches all of my stories. I considered blocking him, but just let it be. I think it’s the petty part of me who’s living a full life that’s fine with rubbing it in a bit.

He and the affair partner did get married after a whoopsie kid and I’m pretty sure they had another. But they also both lost their jobs as teachers (he got her a job at his school, so she was working with an entire staff that knew they had an affair) and had to move to the middle of nowhere. Last I heard of them, the affair partner had been texting his former best friend unhinged rants about not including them in get togethers or allowing my ex-husband to be a groomsman in his wedding.

But enough about them, because they already took up way too many pages in my story.  When we last left off, I think I had just moved to a new city (shoutout to Richmond, VA!) and was largely just finding myself again. I think the change of scenery was the best thing that I did for myself. I was never meant to live in the suburbs and moving to a beautiful little city where I can walk to coffee shops, bakeries and bookstores honestly helped my mental health as much as the therapy. I bought a house here a couple years ago and have really settled in.

Then I got my puppy, a corgi named Bilbo Baggins who really is the true love of my life. He is the greasiest thing to happen to me and is just such a fantastic chonky guy. We go to a local dog park with a bar all the time and he even has his own lil’ dog social group. Kids aren’t something I plan on, so he is basically my son.

It hasn’t all been perfect. My dad died, my best friend moved across the country, and I largely haven’t really been dating much the past couple of years.  Dating hasn’t been a huge priority for me and my friends say that I’m probably too picky. I say that I know what it’s like to be in a marriage with someone who might love you but doesn’t like you and it’s worth not settling.

But while I may be single, I am fulfilled and busy. My birthday is Saturday and I’ll be spending it in Paris at a Lady Gaga concert. I saw Sabrina Carpenter in Amsterdam, Taylor Swift in Lyon, Springsteen in Edinburgh, Noah Kahan at Fenway Park. Earlier this year I was able to visit Katmai National Park and see the brown bears in the falls. I have a DnD group and a really amazing village of people I love.

I would not be in this headspace if I didn’t go to therapy and work out the why of me settling for this man in the first place. True story: When planning our honeymoon in New Zealand, I, of course, had to plan the entire thing despite him picking the location. He refused to do any driving, so we had to do a guided tour that left on specific dates. He pretended to not be able to get a day off of work when we needed to leave until I started crying and begging him to just ask his boss for it because literally no other flights worked. That’s when he said he actually always had the day off but wanted to make sure I was actually working hard enough to choose good flights.

Anyway, I chose to marry… that and it was a lot to unpack in therapy.  But I’m glad I did because without it I don’t think I’d have built this life for myself. At the end of the day, what happened set me up to live a happier life than what I was living so in some ways, I’m thankful for the experience, shitty as it was.

If you’re in the middle of something terrible, unfair, and world-shattering to you, just know that it’s not forever. While this experience has made me a bit of a believer in karma, I also know that there was a lot of work to get myself out of that big black mental hole. Sometimes it seemed that I would slide back in it but by looking forward and figuring myself out, I eventually clawed my way out. I think you can too—and that you’re worth fighting for.

TLDR: Got therapy, life is good, ex-husband stalks me on Instagram, and maybe we should all get dogs for our mental health.

ANSWER: I feel like following this story and you having this be your current chapter is the best thing I've heard this year. 

I'm so happy for you! 

Never settle, know your worth. And give the Sir some skritches!

Also, Richmond is a beautiful city. I grew up as a teenager there.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (22F) just found out my boyfriend (38M) lied about his age for a year—what do I do?

I (22F) recently found out my boyfriend (38M) lied about his age for a year. We met at work, got along, and became official 6 months ago. This is my first relationship, and now I feel completely broken.

He claimed to be 31 years old the first time we met. I was unsure about the age gap, but after seeing how well we connected, I decided to give it a chance.

This morning, we went to do some legal paperwork where I needed his ID. At the office, he kept handing his ID upside down to the staff and refused to let me see it after asking nicely, claiming privacy. By then I had my doubts, though I wasn’t exactly sure what he was hiding.

I finally confronted him saying that I needed to see his ID or I wouldn't be able to trust him anymore. It escalated to, "What are you hiding from me?" He never answered directly. Back home, after much insistence, he gave up and told me the truth:

He lied about his age because he felt bad about being old and wanted to feel younger. He said he knew I wouldn’t accept being with him if I knew his real age, and that he “was planning on telling me” eventually because his guilt was getting hard to manage. He admitted that what he did was wrong, then tried to reassure me that it wasn’t my fault, that I was an excellent girlfriend and person, and that everything we shared was real. I closed the door in his face after telling him I needed to process everything.

This feels like a nightmare. And hurts like shit.

I trusted him, shared my life and my love, and even planned a future together—moving abroad, traveling, building a new life. Now I feel so betrayed, angry, and heartbroken.

I can't believe I was lied to for so long, something so fundamental. I don’t know what to do next. Should I try to salvage this, or just walk away?



Edit: About the “legal paperwork” part, I think I worded it wrong. It’s nothing that really binds me to him in any way. Nothing I can’t undo. He just helped me with some documents that I needed to show for my residence certificate.



TL;DR: My first boyfriend (38M/22F) lied about his age for over a year. I just found out he’s 38, not 31. I feel betrayed and don’t know if I can trust him again.

ANSWER: He wanted you to move out of country before telling you the truth. 

That would terrify any reasonable person.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Bf left after seeing ex's engagement post

Okay so, I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (30M) for a little over two years now. We just moved in together a few months ago. Last night we were doomscrolling on insta reels and his ex's post popped up abt her getting engaged

I don't rly know much about their relationship in detail other than her cheating on my bf with her current fiance while she was engaged to my bf (they were together for 5 yrs and it's been 3.5 yrs since they broke up), so ik that it didn't end well with them and it's just a sour topic so i never rly bring it up. I don’t follow her but she's kind of famous on insta as she is a food vlogger and I watch a lot of that content that's y she popped up.

Anyways when he saw it he like froze and became tense i asked him if everything was ok and he said yeah but i asked if that he looked tense because of the post he just brushed it off and rolled over to go to sleep and then thing is we didn't even rly cuddle when we cuddle like almost every night when going to sleep.

I woke up around 2 a.m. and he was gone. Like, completely gone.  he was nowhere in our house. I called him, like, 10 ,15 times. No answer ,Phone was switched off. I even called one of his friends, and they had no clue where he was. I was thinking of calling his mom but ik she would have blown his phone up so i decided to wait and call my frnd she also suggested to wait a few hours so i did

Then around 3:30 ish  he finally calls me back,i ask him wtf is he doing And he just says I'm fine pls don't call me rn ill explain later and he hangs up b4 i could say anything properly

I tried calling again obviously bcoz what does that even mean like I don't get why he would even be upset about that post seeing they broke up so long ago I can't imagine leaving your gf over this at night. He didn't explicitly say anything abt the reason he went off but I'm pretty sure it's bcoz of the post. I stopped calling him after a few times as hes not going to pick up i rly don't know what to do.

Things have been good with us until now this is the first time i have ever felt like I'm being betrayed by him. I don't even know where he is . Should I leave him alone and give him space I just feel sick abt this situation.

Tldr- bf left in middle of night after finding his ex got engaged and is not responding to me

Update-

Posting again bcoz previous update post got removed for some reason.


Hey guys,
First of all, thank you to everyone who commented , I didn’t expect so many people to respond, and honestly, reading through your messages kept me from spiraling even more.

I tried to go back to sleep after the post. He did come back around 6 am .he looked like shit cuz ig he hadn't slept. He had just been driving around according to him. I didn't even know what to say to him luckily he was the one who talked first. He apologized a lot of times for running away and for ignoring my calls. I obv asked him wtf happened and why he would ditch me like that and abt his ex. He told me he had a panic attack and he didn't want me to witness it so he went to his car and after that he drove off . He explained that it wasn't bcoz he wasn't over her and that he never wanted her back(i asked him if he was still in love w her). He said it just happened after seeing that pic of them together and happy, he said he depressed after everything went down w his ex but he thought he was fine when he started dating me and that he has been rly happy.

But he panicked bcoz it hit him that she was actually happy and their break up hasn't affected her like it has him seeing she was with the guy she cheated on my bf with and he started overthinking that what if he could never be happy like that when  getting engaged again and getting married to me.

I was honestly a bit shocked at first bcoz we had talked abt how he would love to marry me someday and I didn't rly understand how to comprehend this info but we talked for like 2 hours and he was genuinely sry and he doesn't seem like he's not over her. 

He did say he wants to find that kind of happiness with me and he wants that future with me and he apologized again for being an asshole. I made it clear to him if he ever runs off like that we r done and he agreed and honestly we were both kind of crying by the end of our Convo and i also blocked his ex on my insta (he already had her blocked b4 anyone speculates)

I think i could forgive him. Thank you again for all your help the comments helped a lot. We might try therapy.

Tldr- he came back and we talked abt how he had a panick attack thinking if could be as happy as her and we resolved it out.

ANSWER: i dont understand why people are attacking you in these comments. if i had made it to the stage of moving in with someone and one night they left out of nowhere, id be concerned too, no matter what happened the day before. and while yes he probably just needs time to process the engagement, it wouldve been easy to tell you that. he didnt even have to say it in person or on the phone, he could leave and then send a quick text right after to let you know that he just needed some time alone and that he was alright. you're valid to be upset about this

i understand his distress but it's been 3 and a half years. the least he can do is give you the courtesy of telling you he was leaving to be on his own for a bit instead of letting you wake up alone in the middle of the night and leaving you to panic

QUESTION: UPDATE- Married within a year, and now I’m seeing red flags I ignored before — how do I handle this?(27F/33M)

Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/t08KmdcFxt

Update:

27F/33M

I had a conversation with my husband yesterday and gave him an ultimatum. I brought up therapy again, something I’ve suggested in the past, but he said he can’t do it right now because he’s looking for a job and wants to be financially stable first, which I can understand. However, he also said that even after getting a job, he would only consider therapy, then went on a rant about how therapy is useless.

I told him that if he’s not open to therapy, he could at least speak with a pastor or counselor at our church since that is free. He refused again, saying he has too much on his plate. I even suggested having just one conversation and not committing to anything long-term, but he said he’s tired of me bringing it up.

At this point, I’ve decided to leave. I’m currently looking for a job and hoping things fall into place so I can get my own place soon. I feel scared and heartbroken, but I know it’s necessary. I wish I hadn’t ignored the red flags, but I’m choosing to give myself grace. It’s a terrible feeling, but I know I’ll be okay.

Thank you to everyone who commented on my original post. Your words gave me clarity and courage.

TL;DR: He refused therapy or help, so I’ve decided to leave and start over.

ANSWER: It seemed very clear from the post that he didn't actually want to change, someone who recognised their own insecurities and wanted to change would stop making it yours manage and go to therapy, he's done neither. You've made the right choice.

It sounds like neither of you are currently working, I don't know how you sustained that situation but do you have family or friends you can go stay with so you can leave immediately? Even if that involves moving, it's not like you have a job tying you to your current area - which obviously isn't great financially but freeing in terms of leaving and starting afresh.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (35f) mil (60f) only wants provide childcare for our daughter(3 months f) not our son (3m) and my wife (33f) and I are not on the same page as how to handle this.

Hi everyone,

My mother-in-law initially offered to help with childcare one day a week and seemed enthusiastic. However, after our daughter was born, she made it clear she only wants to care for her. She claims it’s “fair” because she didn’t help with our son when he was a baby and my mother did. 

For context, we did offer before our son was born and my mother offered, but when we asked, my mil reacted like a deer in headlights, so we dropped it. We’ve had multiple discussions since, explaining that we don’t agree with her only wanting one child, and she seemed to understand—but a week later, she goes back to only wanting to care for our daughter and pretending we agreed to that. 

We’re unsure why this is happening. It might be because we’re a lesbian couple and she only wants to bond with the child she is biologically related to, or maybe she wasn’t ready before but is now. Either way, she has said multiple times that she doesn’t want to take care of our son. She has said this in front of our son. 

I feel like the weekly childcare arrangement is off because I don’t trust her to care for both children equally. My wife feels that we haven’t explicitly said she must take both children or none, and that we should give her a chance. 

This argument is devolving in my wife saying I'm trying to isolate her from her parents and I'm treating her like she is a bad person. I just want to protect our kids. I don't know what to do anymore. Should I truly offer her another chance?

tl;dr my wife and I heavily disagree how we should handle my mil wanting to play favourites with childcare

ANSWER: Why do I feel like because your wife gave birth to your daughter and you gave birth to your son, your MIL thinks daughter is her grandchild while son is NOT? 

Have you ever asked your wife, what would she tell your son when he asks “Why Grammy never let me stay” or “Why Grammy doesn’t like me” or “Why Grammy always prioritize little sister”? 

This is something you should clear with your wife first, because she is enabling her mom’s favoritism and her way of not counting your son as family. What if she escalates? What if she tries to exclude your son in family activities? What if resentment builds between your children due to Grammy?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend (33M) keeps saying “Have fun on your date” whenever I (32F) leave the house — how do I get him to stop?

Almost every time I leave the house, my boyfriend says something like “Have fun on your date.” Sometimes he’ll even text it to me after I’ve gone.

There’s absolutely no reason for him to think I’d be seeing anyone else. Nothing’s ever happened that would make him suspicious — he just says these things out of nowhere. I find it really disrespectful and gross. I’ve never cheated, never given him a reason to doubt me, and I don’t even have anyone else in my life I could “go on a date” with.

We’ve lived together almost the entire year we’ve been dating. He didn’t used to say things like this, but now he’s constantly making passive-aggressive comments if I’m on my phone, like:

“If you want to talk to someone else, just do it.”
“You don’t have to hide that you’re talking to another guy.”

I’ve told him many times how offensive and damaging these comments are, but he doesn’t care — he seems to truly believe that what he is doing is somehow harmless.   I feel my respect for him slipping every time he does it. I’m honestly at the point where, if we didn’t live together, I’d already have broken up with him. Unfortunately, it is not going to be easy to separate from him at this point or for awhile due to financial reasons.

How should I handle this behavior when he refuses to take it seriously?

Also, how can I articulate the reason why this feels so gross ? I am struggling to find the words. 

⸻

TL;DR:
My boyfriend keeps making sarcastic comments like “Have fun on your date” whenever I leave the house, even though I’ve never given him any reason to distrust me. I’ve told him it’s disrespectful, but he doesn’t stop. What should I do?

ANSWER: “If we didn’t live together I’d already have broken up with him”

You answered your own question about what to do next. It just requires the additional step of also moving out.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My mom found out about my private life and says she’ll never forgive me. I don’t know what to do.

I (27F) come from a conservative religious background.  I live abroad now, but recently something happened that completely broke my relationship with my mom (55F).

I gave her my old phone because hers stopped working. Before giving it away, I deleted WhatsApp, thinking all my private conversations were gone. Unfortunately, when she reinstalled it, all my old chats were restored — including some very personal messages and “flirty” conversations.

When she saw them, she was devastated and furious. She said I had brought shame, that I was no longer her daughter, and that she regretted giving birth to me. She blocked me, then unblocked me just to say hurtful things like calling me names. She even told me not to tell my relatives that we don't talk anymore, or she'd show them everything so they'd know the truth about me. 

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. She had warned me that if it happened again, she would cut me off — and this time, she did.

I feel destroyed inside. I keep blaming myself, but at the same time, I feel like her reaction is too extreme. I know what I did isn’t acceptable in her eyes, but it hurts to lose my mom like this.
I’m far from home, I feel ashamed and empty, and I don’t know how to move forward.

Has anyone else gone through something like this — especially in a strict religious family? How did you cope with losing your parent emotionally, even if they’re still alive?

EDIT : For context, these messages were related to my active sexual life, so she's hurting for knowing that I'm sexually active.

TL;DR: My mom (55F) found out about parts of my private life that go against our religious background, feels deeply betrayed, and refuses to forgive me. I (27F) love her but don’t know if I should try to contact her again or let her go.

ANSWER: >I keep blaming myself,

The worst choice here is to blame yourself for living your own life. 

Your mom is hateful and willing to drop her own daughter because she sent flirty messages. Someone willing to do that is a shameful, awful person.

To move forward, you have to understand exactly this, that your mother is not a good person and that you may be better off without her, even though it hurts now.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My, 40F, husband, 45M,been living with my dad for work. I think he’s cheating.

I, 40F, have been with my husband Brian (fake name), 45M, for almost two decades. We have four kids. A few years ago, we moved from our hometown, a major city, to a smaller, quiet town about three hours away in another state. At the time, we only had our two oldest children, and childcare wasn’t an issue.

Brian was able to find employment fairly quickly when we moved, and I worked from home full-time, which gave me the opportunity to care for our kids, the home, and our marriage. Things were great until I became pregnant with our now third child and developed some health issues.

Because Brian had to call out frequently due to my hospitalizations during the pregnancy, he was eventually forced to resign from his job due to attendance and performance. During delivery, there was an accident and my baby and I almost didn’t survive. The baby was in the NICU for months recovering. She is now a happy and mostly healthy baby. After she came home, Brian worked odd jobs to bring in money, but his primary concern was making sure the kids and I were okay.

A few days before our youngest turned 1, we found out that we were having our fourth and last child. That pregnancy was tough as well, but things went relatively okay until delivery. During the delivery, I was injured by my surgeon, which prevented me from caring for my newborn and our other kids. I was on bed rest for a few months recovering from the C-section and the injury.

Brian waited on me hand and foot and worked reduced hours. We lived off savings and my disability checks from my employer. My father also sent money to help us out. Once I recovered, I returned to work full-time, but Brian wasn’t able to find steady employment. We made things work for a while, but unexpected expenses in the home and with our taxes drove up our costs.

Eventually, Brian found a full-time job back in our home city; great pay, benefits, and room for overtime. My father offered to let him live with him so he wouldn’t have to commute six hours a day or pay any bills while there. Brian was hesitant to leave because I’d still been dealing with health issues since our last child, but I assured him I’d be fine.

At first, things were great. When he moved in with my dad, Brian would call and text frequently; during his breaks, lunches, and in the evenings. We’d video chat for hours while he talked to me and the kids. On Fridays, he’d come home and visit until early Monday mornings. I’d drive him to work with our two youngest kids, then drive back home. Sometimes, the kids and I would go up Friday afternoon to visit him and my dad and drive back Sunday so he wouldn’t be burnt out.

But then the calls started to slow down. I figured he was busy or tired. One night, because we share locations, I checked the app around 10 p.m. and saw he was at a bar. I texted him, asking what was up. He responded around 3 a.m., saying he’d gone out with friends after work. I felt uncomfortable but told myself not to be insecure. I told myself that Brian deserved to unwind after everything he’d done for me and the kids.

The late nights at bars and restaurants continued for a few weeks. The money in our joint account started depleting from his outings to the point where I had to remind him we needed the money for bills. He stopped coming home on weekends, and when I visited, he seemed distant and glued to his phone.

I asked if everything was okay with him and with us. He said it was. I asked about his new friends, but his answers were vague.

One weekend at my dad’s house, Brian was in another room when his phone rang. The name “V” popped up with no picture. I’d never heard that name before. A few minutes later, my dad’s phone rang. I heard him briefly say something to the person on the phone, then tell Brian to “check his phone when he gets a chance.” Brian picked it up, sent a text, looked at me, and set the phone down face-first. I asked who it was. He just said, “A friend.”

My insecurities got the best of me, so I looked through Brian’s Facebook. He doesn’t post much, but suddenly, all his profile pictures had new “likes” from someone who had me blocked. Using my old unused account (under my maiden name), I found that person. It was a woman named Vanessa, 33F.

On her public page, I saw photos of her and Brian at bars, restaurants, and, heartbreakingly, in my father’s living room and building lobby. In every photo, Vanessa was hugged up on Brian or wrapped around his arm. His wedding ring was off. She tagged him in the photos, but the tags didn’t appear on his profile.

I was devastated. Instead of confronting him right away, I packed up the kids and went home. Brian didn’t protest and seemed clueless. My dad asked if I was okay; I said I didn’t feel well and wanted to leave. Brian quietly helped me pack.

I took screenshots of everything. That was three weeks ago.

Since then, I haven’t talked to Brian much. When he calls, I hand the phone to whichever kid is closest, even the one-year-old. I’ve focused on work and the kids, but I keep checking Vanessa’s page and taking more screenshots as she posts more pictures.

Last night, Brian texted asking why I’d been distant. Furious, I sent him all the screenshots. For about ten minutes, I saw the typing bubble appear and disappear. Then he finally replied: “She’s just a coworker.”

I asked him how he’d feel if I were constantly out with a coworker, hugged up in photos. No reply. I asked why he brought this coworker to my father’s house. He said, “Just to introduce them.” I asked why he hadn’t introduced any other coworkers. Silence.

It’s been about nine hours and I haven’t heard from him since. I’m heartbroken. I don’t want to be a divorced single mom, but I refuse to live in with this kind of disrespect.

Advice needed: What should my next steps be?

TL;DR:
My husband (45M) and I (40F) have been together nearly 20 years and have 4 kids. He took a good job back in our hometown and moved in with my dad to avoid a long commute. At first he called and visited often, but then he got distant, started going out drinking, and stopped coming home. I found Facebook photos of him with a younger woman (33F) out at bars, restaurants, and even at my dad’s house, with his wedding ring off. When I confronted him, he said she’s “just a coworker” and hasn’t spoken to me since. I’m heartbroken and unsure what to do next.

ANSWER: Idk what’s worse about this story. Everything he’s doing or the fact that not only did the dad cover for him the whole time, he is also communicating with this woman on behalf of your husband, and right in front of you.  Im sorry, that’s fucked up and I hope you find your way through it. You should not let yourself be treated like that no matter if it makes you a single divorced person.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Found my partner’s old divorce case online — don’t know what to believe now






I (27F) have been seeing a man (35M) for about four months. He’s divorced and has a young daughter. He told me that his marriage ended because of his ex’s accusations and that she was a narcissist.

I just found their divorce case online. It matches what he told me but with details that shocked me: ICU stay, which I knew about, but it mentions seizure from alcohol use, bottles hidden around the house, and his ex claiming he wasn’t safe around their kid.

He told me those things were exaggerated and that the judge ruled in his favor for 50/50 custody, which is true. But now I’m stuck between believing that he’s genuinely recovering and worrying that he still drinks or minimizes it. We smoke weed together sometimes, and he seems totally functional—steady job, great dad, responsible—but I can’t shake the fear that I’m missing something.

I don’t want to judge him unfairly, but I also don’t want to ignore red flags. What’s a fair, healthy way to ask about this without sounding accusatory or controlling?

Tl;dr: found the court case for the guy I'm dating. It mentions that he's an alcoholic to a dangerous level. He's told me that his ex accused him of different things to get full custody, but I'm now concerned.

ANSWER: I say trust your gut. Like, easy as that, trust your gut, girl. Think about it since you’re having to ask reddit.

I once met a guy who seemed okay, but then he got kinda stalkerish and I tried to brush it off because he was very good friends with my friend group. It wasn’t getting better and I looked him up; turns out he was on probation and parole for breaking a girl’s jaw after she broke up with him (and breaking that no contact order). That was shocking, but the biggest shock was that my other friends knew not only how uncomfortable he made me, but they knew about that incident and never told me. Stopped all contact with all of them immediately and called his parole officer.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) live together: I found out how he sees the world, now I don’t know if I should stay.

(Re-upload with edits: my previous post was removed for formatting.)

My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been together for two years. I live at his house and don’t pay rent (it’s one of his parents’ properties).

Over the last six months our relationship has been slowly deteriorating. I’ve had multiple conversations with him about how his communication style hurts me and others, and how little effort he puts into understanding me.

A few examples:
1 Once, I mentioned seeing a male friend and he spent the dinner spiraling into topics like calling himself (grandparents immigrated from Italy to Aus) as “ethnic” as my Asian/Middle Eastern best friend, saying “no one should be friends with Germans, we’ve moved on too fast from the Holocaust,” and “old people don’t deserve respect.” It was bizarre and uncomfortable.

2 When we need to solve small domestic issues (like fixing a drain), he often derails the conversation into his own feelings rather than focusing on the task, getting visibly upset at me.

3 When I’m overwhelmed and trying to self-regulate by being quiet or still, he panics and asks what he did wrong, which forces me to comfort him instead of calming myself.

4 I’m autistic, and my tone can be flat. He often misreads it as hostility, especially around practical or “adult” topics.

5 The other night, he made fun of the way I walked and looked, even doing a hurtful impression. I said “that’s not a nice thing to do to your girlfriend,” and he exploded into, “what about thank you for cooking dinner? Why is it never thank you?”

The breaking point came this week when we took our puppy to be de-sexed. I filled out the vet consent form while he watched. Because I’d be at work during the procedure, I made sure the clinic knew to call him first. I signed my own name at the bottom (as the form requires) and added his details below. Later that day, I discovered a private ChatGPT thread where he described the whole event with anger and resentment, accusing me of being controlling and writing my phone number in its required section (above his) to “belittle” him. Reading that was shattering. It showed me how warped his perception of me has become.

That’s been our pattern: I act from practicality or care, he interprets it as attack or disrespect.

I wouldn’t call our relationship abusive. Most days are neutral, some are lovely, and about 10–20% of the time things get really painful. He’s affectionate and loving, and I truly love him and the life we’ve built: our home, our routines, our puppy. But when anything serious happens, he becomes reactive, defensive, or mean, and I end up feeling small and unseen.

Logistically, leaving is hard. I work part-time (four days a week) and study at university. If I rent, I’ll have around $400 a week to live on. That means shared custody of the dog, major financial stress, and losing the most comfortable home I’ve ever had. But staying means continuing to feel unheard and distorted.

My question: How do I decide whether to stay or leave when the relationship isn’t entirely bad but feels fundamentally incompatible? What concrete steps can I take to make the right decision?

TL;DR: My boyfriend believes I am antagonising him when I’m taking care of logistics or myself. He’s great most of the time and I love the life we share beyond these issues, but I’m worried I’ll never see him the same. I’d appreciate advice on how to move forward and protect my peace.

ANSWER: Your boyfriend is mentally unwell OP.  Take the dog and find a place of your own. There are reg flags all over the place with your BF.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Husband recycled a proposal from the previous relationship.

tl;dr husband proposed in the same exact way, word for word, location etc as he did with his previous relationship. How do I get over this? 


I '33F' just found out that my husband '35M' of 7 years, proposed to me in the same exact way as he proposed to his ex wife. 
Same day, Xmas eve, same exact location and used the same shpiel. Thankfully he didn't use the same damn ring too..... 


It's not a situation where he wasn't over the ex. I truly think it's just pure lack of originality or imagination. 
Idk if I'm being dramatic but I am hurt and sick over this. I've cried non stop. Can't look at him or even talk to him. I gave him the ring back and told him to do it over and make it special. I wanted my own. But honestly, if he does, idk if that would make me feel better. How do I move passed this? 
This isn't something I would leave him over but it is something that has definitely hurt our relationship. 
Any suggestions on how to work through this?

ANSWER: He lacks originality.  I found out my husband took his second wife on a honeymoon on the same vacation that was the only out of the region vacation the two of us ever went to.  While he was having an affair with her, he was introducing him to the same restaurants I had introduced him to in this city, and my favorite restaurant became "their place."  I would not really move past that myself, to be honest with you.  In fact, he's married to his third wife, and they own a hobby shop based on the only hobby I ever had when married to him, a hobby he used to make fun of me doing.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I tell my husband I’m uncomfortable with him staying with a female colleague on work trips?

I was going to post this on AITAH but since I’m 95% sure I’m not the asshole, I guess I’m looking for relationship advice instead. Soooo… would I be the asshole if I \[38f\] told my husband \[40m\] I don’t want him to stay with a colleague \[45F, single\] when they travel together for work?

My husband and Colleague are part of a dozen independently contracted people within a professional creative group, which manages projects with clients. Husband and Colleague find their work to be complimentary, so they’re hoping to work on more projects together. Husband and I live in City A, we’re from City B (where both sets of parents live), and City C is where Professional Group and Colleague are based.

Last time Husband was working in City C he stayed on Colleague’s couch. Fine, whatever, not a big deal for a one-off thing. Then he had a job in City B last week that she worked with him on, and they stayed at his parents house together Tues-Saturday. To clarify: City B is my hometown, where my family also lives. I didn’t know about this until he was on the way out the door Tuesday. If he had mentioned it I probably would have said “oh, wouldn’t everyone be more comfortable if she was put up in a hotel?” Granted, budget was a consideration, but my feeling is that if the group, client, or husband can’t afford an assistant on a project, then it can’t be a requisite for the job. And this isn’t a one time scenario, he plans to keep working with her, so this will definitely come up again in some iteration.

Relationship background: Husband and I have been together for 4 years, married for 6 months. We were actually together for a while 15 years ago but our paths diverged. In a crazy full circle way we were brought back together and I’m happier than I’ve ever been in a partnership. Our relationship is based on mutual respect and admiration, and he is extremely loyal when it comes to friends, family, and me. I want to make it clear that I trust him 100%. This isn’t about infidelity, it’s about boundaries and respect and how he shows that he cares about my feelings.

All week I’ve been dealing with icks and ughs about this. It’s been occupying a huge portion of my thoughts. I was by myself while they were working together every day, sharing meals, presumably hanging out until bedtime? And then of course there are my irrational, neurotic thoughts like “did he make coffee for her every morning? Did she use my MIL’s shampoo? Does he think she’s cooler than me? Is he going to run off to City C because it’s way more rewarding than our life together??” I hate that I’m this insecure and jealous and prone to ruminating on this stuff. Yes, I have a therapist, yes, we talk about this sort of thing.  It might be different if I had met Colleague or knew ANY details about her at all. All I know about her is that they have a lot in common and she’s apparently comfortable with this level of familiarity with a married colleague.

I’m already prepared for how it will go if I bring this up. His reaction at best is going to be invalidating my feelings in the guise of reassurance (“you’re being silly! That’s ridiculous, what are you worried about?”) or defensive (“why are you admonishing me when I’ve done nothing wrong?”) He bristles when it comes to personal critique, which makes it hard to express my feelings sometimes. He’s not one to conform to the conventions of society, so me saying “this is objectively inappropriate” or “this simply isn’t done” would not be useful arguments. He usually means well, but can be really blind to how his actions affect me. I’m really hoping that me saying I’m uncomfortable is enough for him to agree to the very reasonable request of getting Colleague a damn hotel room next time.

Ok, so here’s a part I was on the fence about adding in, because all of the above is enough for being upset, but it’s important in the context of my emotional needs not being prioritized (and it definitely adds to my sensitive emotional state). My mom died 3 months ago, so I drove up to City B on Friday to prep for my mom’s Sunday memorial celebration. I thought Husband was going to join me at my parent’s house across town Friday night, but I guess there was a miscommunication and he had to do a bit more work on this project Saturday. We talked about this on the phone Thursday and he told me he was probably going to stay with his parents Saturday night too, so Colleague wouldn’t be uncomfortable at the house without him there. I basically told him no, I needed him with me. I honestly can’t even believe he entertained the idea of prioritizing her comfort over my need for his support during a huge emotional life event. A few days before the memorial.

I love this person. I trust him, but I’m frustrated and sad. Why is he such a dummy when it comes to all this shit?? The big work job is done, and we got through the memorial. Now I guess I’m looking for some communication advice, some validation, and maybe personal experience. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this.



tl;dr: Husband is overfamiliar with a female colleague. He doesn’t think it’s a problem, but the real issue is that he's oblivious to how this makes me feel. I’m not sure how to raise it without him getting defensive.

ANSWER: Okay so this

> Our relationship is based on mutual respect and admiration, and he is extremely loyal when it comes to friends, family, and me. I want to make it clear that I trust him 100%. This isn’t about infidelity, it’s about boundaries and respect and how he shows that he cares about my feelings.

Does not jive with this

There’s some cognitive dissonance going on here and tbh I think this perfect marriage full of admiration and respect is a story you’re telling yourself. Because I’m not seeing much respect coming from his side. And I think you’re being naive to say there’s definitely no infidelity going on. He’s having this woman stay at his parents’ house, that’s so far beyond the boundaries of a work relationship it borders on hilarity. 

And now he’s trying to abandon you in your time of need to make her more comfortable? At best this is an emotional affair. At worst it’s already turned physical.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My bf (M23) stood me (F22) up on Halloween and doesn’t know why

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years, and he’s always been amazing, but on Halloween, he stood me up and can't explain why. I want to forgive him, but I am still so upset.

We both had different events to go to first, but we agreed that we’d meet up later at a club, which is something we had discussed all week. I knew he was with friends, so I told him he could invite them, but that regardless of what his friends where doing we were going to go out. I texted around 9 PM that I was ready, and he replied saying he was picking up his friends and would meet me at the club. I told him it was a 20-minute walk for me, so he should let me know when he was heading out.

I didn’t hear back from him until 11:40 PM when he texted saying he was finally on his way. By then, I would’ve gotten there around midnight, and I wasn’t comfortable walking through downtown that late. Plus, he and his friends ended up not even going in because the lines were too long. So, basically, I spent hours doing intricate makeup and dressing up all so that I could be stood up by my own bf.

What made it even worse was that the next day was Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead/ celebrate the dead), which was really important to me as I’m Latina, and I just lost my grandpa. My boyfriend was supposed to help me set up my grandpa’s shrine and make food, but he completely forgot.

He came over with gifts to apologize, but his only explanation was, “I’m sorry, I don’t know what happened.” When I asked if he thought it was okay for a woman to walk alone downtown that late, he lied and said he would’ve gotten me an Uber, but nowhere in his messages did he mention that. He also tried to play it off as “miscommunication,” when it was really just a lack of communication on his part. I told him I needed space and sent him home.

Later, when he apologized again, he kept saying that thinking about what he did makes him upset and sick. Normally I appreciate when he expresses his feelings, but I told him that in this case, I truly didn’t care how he felt because I was the one who was wronged and upset. I don’t know if that was too harsh, but I genuinely don’t understand how him being nauseous was supposed to help me feel any better.

The next day, after some pushing, he said he’s been emotionally checked out because of how stressful his doctorate program has been and that he forgets things easily when they’re not “in front of him.” I don’t really know what to make of that.

He’s always been supportive and kind before this, especially when my grandpa passed. I don’t think he’s cheating, which I know is always possible, but cheating is one of his biggest fears, so I doubt this is the case. This whole situation isn’t typical for him, but his explanation feels weak, and I’m not sure how to move forward. I want to forgive him, but I also feel really hurt and disappointed.

How would you handle something like this? Should I try to talk to him again, or just give him more space?

ANSWER: He was out enjoying himself with his friends and totally ‘forgot’ he was supposed to be meeting up with you. He doesn’t want to admit that, so his ‘I don’t know what happened’ isn’t true, and is flimsy at best. And the fact he thought it would be okay for you to walk to a club at that time is absolutely ridiculous plus, and I’m just guessing, he was too hungover to help you the following day when you really needed his support. All in all, he hasn’t exactly covered himself in boyfriend glory, has he? Updateme!

================================================================================

QUESTION: I want to divorce my husband. But he wants another chance. Am I being heartless?

Hi reddit. Like the title says, I (f31) want to divorce my husband (m32), but i'm afraid I may be acting too quickly? For context, we've been together for 12 years, married for 3. He's always had a strong temper and frankly, my parents never fully approved of our relationship because of it. I'm the complete opposite, shy, eternally optomistic, a little too nice (husband says I'm a pushover). Anyway, while we dated he would often be rude to me but his excuse was that he was stressed out from college or he was tired, or he had something else going on. And I believed him. 

Fast forward to our first year of marriage, and I found out the hard way that it wasn't college or any of that. It was just his actual personality. He hates talking about, well, anything. We never talk about money which is outrageous to me because we're married, I can't talk to him about family drama because it annoys him, can't talk about my feelings because he'll get mad, insult me and walk away. He's not only rude to me now but to my parents too. Despite the fact that they've given us a house, a piece of land, helped us get out of a debt, etc. And I could not be more embarassed.

Mostly, I feel stupid. My parents warned me again and again. My dad especially, because he noticed early on how different we were. But my husband always said opposites attract (sounds kind of stupid now). And he wasn't as mean then as he is now, in fact, he got along great with my parents back then. He even got them gifts and things. Now, he's moody all the time but even moreso when we go over to their house. He won't even engage in conversation, all he does is look down at him phone the entire time. It honestly feels like he doesn't care about being part of the family. Whenever someone tries to give him adive, he doesn't take it well, like he's smarter than everyone else and there's nothing you can say to him that he doesn't already know. The few times we do talk, we end up arguing because everything I say is always wrong and "i don't know what I'm talking about" or "I'm ignorant". Mind you, we both have college degrees. All in all, I'm just so disapointed and embarrased by the kind of person he is. Btw, he's not like that around his friends. 

I brought up the possibility of getting a divorce during an argument and he's been nicer to me ever since. But I've seen this side of him before. He's promised to change in the past and has said that he can't live without me. This is the only time I've truly seen him so remorseful though. 

TD;LR: Am I being too rash in suggesting to my husband that we divorce because of how he treats me? Should I give him another chance?

ANSWER: No, you're not being too rash to divorce someone who is not nice to you or your family and has never been, who insults you and who you can't communicate with. In fact, I have no idea why you've stayed with him this long.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How can I (21M) make my Chinese dad (61M) get a life?

The title might sound a bit harsh, but I honestly don’t know how else to phrase it.

There’s a lot to unpack here, but here I go (TL;DR at the bottom):

My dad is a Chinese immigrant who moved to California in the early 2000s. To this day, he hasn’t learned much English, which has really limited his ability to explore new things — even simple stuff like trying non-Chinese restaurants. Over time, that’s made him more closed off and unwilling to try anything new.

He’s naturally introverted, and with his difficult personality and years of working tirelessly since coming here, he’s struggled to make friends. As a result, he doesn’t have many hobbies or much of a social life.

Now that he finally has more free time, I’ve been trying to get him to enjoy life a bit more — to go out, meet people, or pick up a hobby. But whenever I suggest something, he just says things like “There’s nothing to do here in America” or “Nothing interests me.” I know those are excuses — I think it’s hard for him because he can’t read or speak English, so everything outside his comfort zone feels impossible. Still, it’s tough watching him just… fade into routine.

I’d love to know if anyone has gone through something similar or has advice on how to help a parent like this.

Some background that might be helpful:  
My dad doesn’t have the best relationship with our family (my mom, sister, and me). He wasn’t really a great husband or father figure when I was growing up. He and my mom fought a lot, mostly because he’d spend so much time at the casino playing poker — which he insists “isn’t gambling” because it “takes skill” and “helps him relieve stress.” But back then, we were struggling financially, living in affordable housing, so it only made things worse.

He also had a lot of anger issues and poor communication skills. He couldn’t empathize or see things from my mom’s point of view, which led to constant fighting. My sister ended up developing lasting trauma from it, and I’ve always had a hard time talking to him too.

That said, something changed earlier this year. We visited some old family friends — people who somehow have stuck by him despite knowing his flaws — and they had yet another intervention with him. This time, it seemed to click. Around the same time, I broke down in front of him and told him how all of this affected me. I think that really got through to him, because since then, he’s been trying to change, little by little.

Honestly, I’m still conflicted. Writing this all out makes me realize how complicated it is. My dad isn’t the best person, but he’s still my dad — and I know he did what he could with what he had. I just want to help him find a way to live more meaningfully instead of wasting away.

TL;DR:  
My dad isn’t perfect, but he’s still my dad. He doesn’t have many friends or hobbies, and I want to help him find some so he can live a fuller, happier life. Any advice or similar experiences would really mean a lot.

ANSWER: Your best bet is probably to find out where other senior Chinese guys hang out and take him there. He'll be able to communicate and feel a lot more comfortable. Maybe he'll make friends.

QUESTION: M55 How direct can you be to ask relatives to invite you for the holidays?

I (M55) am suddenly without immediate family: no spouse, no kids and nobody at home with me.

I am dreading the holidays.

I have (1) an aunt, uncle and cousins in one city a few hours away and (2) a brother and his family in another city a few hours away.

I’ve usually just waited for invitations and if they didn’t come, I’d spend holidays with immediate family at my home, but immediate family is now gone.  

My sister-in-law has said “we’ve got to get you to come out sometime” and I said, “sure!”, but I don’t know if that was just a general statement or if it was supposed to be an invitation.  My aunt said, “we need to stay in touch” but it would be kind of weird to invite myself to their house.

How do I get an invitation for Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas dinner?

That’s all I need; I can stay in a hotel.

TL;DR: how direct can you be in asking family members for an invitation for the holidays if you’re all alone?

ANSWER: My brother reached out for a thanksgiving one year, he hadn’t been to family events in years. He just said “hey sis, I really wanted to spend the holiday with family, do you have anything going on that I could come to?” damn near broke my fucking heart that I didn’t make it clear enough to him that he’s ALWAYS invited, I didn’t ever think I needed to invite him to these things.

I’m really glad he asked, because now I always invite him.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (23F) BF (23M) said he’d consider breaking up with me if I changed my appearance and now I can’t look at him the same.

TL;DR:
My BF hates all forms of body modification and has made it clear he doesn’t like when I change my appearance. When I mentioned tattooing over a fading mole, he sternly told me not to “Do that to my face.” When I asked if he’d break up with me over something a bodily change I made he didn’t like, he said yes. He apologized afterward, but I can’t shake how disrespected I feel or how hard it is to be affectionate again.

I (23F) have been dating my BF (23M) “Andre” for a little over 2 years. It’s both our first relationship. Andre has always hated any kind of bodily change: tattoos, piercings, dye, even getting a hand stamp at the bar. He scrubs it off the second we get home.

I’m the opposite. I love tattoos (I have 3), I’ve dyed my hair ginger (naturally blonde), and I have a few piercings. Since we started dating, though, I’ve only added one ear piercing and changed my hair tint slightly. Whenever I bring up wanting something new (like tattoos or piercings), he gets visibly uncomfortable. His voice goes high, eyebrows raise, and he starts asking, “How much of a change are you thinking?”

His facial expressions alone have always felt like a subtle threat to our relationship. if I go too far, he’ll stop being attracted to me or even consider leaving. That’s honestly a big part of why I’ve stopped changing my appearance at all.

Earlier this week, I mentioned that a small mole on my nose is starting to lose pigment, and I brought up maybe tattooing over it with brown ink kind of like a freckle tattoo or microblading. His response was instant and firm: “Do not do that to your face.”
That hit me hard. He didn’t even ask why I wanted to do it or how I felt about it just completely shut it down and told me what to do.

Later that night, I texted him and asked, “If I did something to my appearance that you didn’t like, would you break up with me?”
His reply: “Yes, I could see it playing a factor.”
My stomach dropped. I called two of my friends to make sure I wasn’t losing my mind and they both said that was insane. I ignored him for a bit, and when he called back, I ended up yelling at him for almost an hour (which is unlike me). That’s when it seemed to finally hit him how serious this was. He started crying, apologized, and admitted he was being inconsiderate and disrespectful. The next night, he told me he realized how entitled it was to act like he has any say over my body, and that he needs to work on his reactions. He said he understands I’m my own person and that my choices have nothing to do with him.
I told him straight up that he needs to always speak to me like an equal, and that just because he gets to see my body doesn’t mean he gets to control it. I made it very clear if he ever does this again, I’m gone.

I also told him I’m not applying to jobs in his area anymore. Someone who would consider breaking up with me over a freckle doesn’t deserve me moving states for them.
We’re still together, but now I feel… icked out. I don’t want to be affectionate or sweet toward him. even though he’s apologized and seems to be reflecting. I feel like he doesn’t deserve that from me right now, but I also feel mean with giving him nothing to work with.

How do I forgive him? Will that natural affection come back with time? Is it harder because we live far apart? I get forgive but don’t forget, but how?

ANSWER: Relationship aside, please be careful about tattooing over your mole. You want to be able to monitor moles for changes and tattooing over it could get in the way of that.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (26F) break up with my fiancé (28M) of 7 yrs without destroying him? The timing feels cruel.

See my last post about why…

TL;DR:
I love my fiancé but know the relationship needs to end. He lives with me in my family’s home, is struggling in school, and has a birthday/holidays coming up. Ending things now feels cruel, but pretending until the end of the year also feels wrong. How do I break up in a way that causes the least damage?

I (late 20s F) am at the point where I know I need to end things with my fiancé (late 20s M). I love him, but after reading the feedback on my last post and really sitting with the things I didn’t want to admit, I know I can’t continue this relationship.

The problem is… the timing feels awful.

He currently lives with me in my old family home. It’s not technically either of our places—my parents don’t live here, but two of my adult sisters do. Asking him to leave feels like kicking him out to nowhere, even though he does have family he could go to. I just know it’ll shake his sense of stability.

He’s also really struggling in school. I don’t want to pile this on while he’s barely hanging on academically. College is rough, I’ve been there and completely understand. I’ve told him multiple times that I’m unhappy, but I know this will still blindside him.

Part of me wants to end things now because living like this—acting like I’m not completely torn—feels emotionally draining and dishonest. But the other part of me wants to wait until the semester is over… except then it’s his birthday in mid-December, and then Christmas. It feels cruel no matter what.

I’m torn between doing what’s healthiest for me vs. trying to protect him from more stress.
Do I need to end it now, or should I let him have the end of the year without adding this pain?
Any advice on how to do this in the least damaging way is appreciated. Honestly I’m not sure if I’m mentally prepared for it now - please give me your honest advice I’ve never had to break up like this before

ANSWER: The only reason to delay ANYTHING about this would be to give him a chance to get his bearings and find a better living situation.

Which would sorta mean breaking up with him and then giving him a week or two or more to sort of figure out his next living situation.

There's no point in delaying through Christmas just to wait until the ball drops on New Year to shout "Surprise, we're breaking up! Pack your shit!"

Also... you need to brace yourself for being the "bad guy" here. There is only so much you can do here to soften this landing. You are about to wreck this dude's whooole existence. The odds of getting a handshake and a thanks for the memories card is... low.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My gf (F23) is trying to move in with me (M31) way too soon

I (M31) started dating his new person (F23) back in July. Things were going great and we decided to make our relationship official after a vacation a few weeks ago.

The problem happened as soon as we got back from vacation. She lives with her mom and apparently when she got back home, she got into this big fight with her mom's bum ass boyfriend. Now she refuses to go back home until homeboy moves out. I'm trying to be a good boyfriend and let her stay with me for a while, but "a while" is starting to feel permanent. Her mom's boyfriend doesnt even have a job and theres no sign of him moving out any time soon. It doesn't help that my apartment is tiny and I hate not having space to myself.

A couple days ago she asked me if we could get a place together when my lease ends in February, and since she's already living with me, that would mean she permanently moved in 2 days after becoming my girlfriend. Thats way too fast for me and tbh it feels like shes taking advantage of my kindness and resources. I genuinely don't know what to do because I don't want to kick her out with no place to go but I also don't feel comfortable with her moving in on such short notice. How can we resolve this problem?

TL;DR girlfriend of 2 days is trying to live in my tiny apartment now

ANSWER: Well, first of all, if you date a woman eight years younger than you she’s gonna be in a different place in life and have different expectations. That should be a no-brainer. You want a grownup, date a grownup.

That said, you’re going to have to have a conversation with her and however you put it, she will feel rejected and upset. Just be prepared to remain calm and kind. Explain that you’re not ready to live with someone. That you need her to have a plan for her living arrangements that isn’t just live with you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Update: How do I (27 M) get my gf (24 F) to understand that I can’t do it all on my own. Is this the end?

My last post on this [(can be found here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ok0qa9/how_do_i_27_m_get_my_gf_24_f_to_understand_that_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) got a lot of responses so I wanted to give a recent update.

A couple days after that post, on November 1st my family had a Halloween party. We attended as we have been staying with my parents. It was fun, it was going good. I allowed myself to just relax, had a few drinks which I don’t often. I “let loose”. This all came crumbling down though when my gf made a comment/joke about getting married. She asked “Do you want to marry me?” I said “Yes!” She asked “so when are we getting married?” I said “When we get married!” she responded “So you don’t want to marry me” I responded “That’s not what I’m saying” and then it got quiet. Now mind you, this was a few hours into the party, after we had a good bit to drink. So it wasn’t really the time or place to have a serious conversation about our future marriage.

Later we are in our room, to escape the party for a bit. She says sorry. I tell her thank you. She says something about how it was just joke. I tell her that the joke isn’t really funny given we’ve had all of these conversations regarding issues we’ve been having, how before we even really think about getting married I’d like for us to be out of my parents house again. She says she wishes joking about marriage wasn’t a stressor. I said that it isn’t just about the marriage, it’s about the accusation that I don’t want to. When I’ve been trying so hard to get us to a point where we have our own place, where I can afford a ring, where we have finances to plan a wedding. And know we are having a good foundation for our shared future. And the fact I reassure her nearly every week. I do so many things to show her I love her, care about her, and want a future. So when she says things like that, I feel unheard in how much I am struggle to carry all of this by myself.

The rest of the convo is a bit of a blur (alcohol and it being late doesn’t help), but it turns into a fight. It went on for about 2 hours. Which really sucks, because I’ve said time and time again I’m really uncomfortable having these conversations while we’ve had drinks and when it’s late. But nonetheless there we are.

I tell her that I don’t want to get married until I feel like I can depend on her. She says that I can, that she listens to me when I talk about work. I tell her that I mean like seriously depend on her, like what if I lose my job? What if I get deathly ill? I want to feel like we aren’t totally fucked, because she will be able to be there for us. I tell her about how we were supposed to have a check-in mid-October, to discuss her progress on things we had talked about fixing in July to keep the relationship going. That we never had that check-in, and it is past that but she hasn’t done these things. I told her I was glad that our conflicts had become less, but that these things were still not being met. She immediately got defensive and said “so how long were you going to wait to talk to me about this if I didn’t joke about marriage?” I said “not long at all, I was getting my thoughts together, and deciding when we should sit down and talk. October just ended.” She ends up telling me about how she has looked into a program at our old university and how she has had two phone calls with them that led nowhere. I was aware of one of these. I asked if she had ordered her transcript and applied to FAFSA like we talked about. She said no. She said it’s all confusing and she doesn’t know what to do. That it’s “hard.” I tell her “You can ask for help when you starting do it and I’ll help. you know when I was looking at going for my masters recently, I applied to both FAFSA and got my transcript in one day. It isn’t hard too hard.” she then brings up us having different capacities.

It some how derails and we are talking about the past. It’s hard to remember all that was said or how we got there. But I do remember telling her how it’s hard to trust her, because she hasn’t done these things, and because right before her psychosis this year, she admitted to me, that early in our relationship she had been posting nudes on a secret Snapchat to try and sell them, browsed Tinder, and apparently had her coworkers thinking I was abusive, that we were in an open relationship, etc. She justified the nudes by saying she was trying to make us money (which we didn't need to do, as I had a teaching job at this time. Also I don't have an issue with some posting nudes online, it's that we had talked about it early on, as she used to do it, and I told her I just didn't want the one's she sent me to be the same one's she posted, because I wanted to feel special, and then SHE decided she didn't want to do it anymore), and that she only did it like once a month, and didn’t do it for that long. And also that it never came up. As if I was supposed to know and ask?? She didn’t respond to the Tinder thing. She also said she didn’t know why her coworkers thought that of me, that she always told them how great I was. She said she speculates it’s because they thought it was odd she had a job and needed to work while I had a teaching job. I told her that, the point is she kept that all from me, while I took my first “grown up job” to try and start building our future, and she was doing all of that, and kept it from me for years. She said she was super supportive of me during that time.

We end up back to the original topic of what we had agreed she would do. I said something about how she has had 3 and a half months to make real progress and figure these things out, and she has done less than what I managed to do in a single morning. She got upset and she said very angrily “so what you want me to get my transcript, apply for FAFSA, and start applying??” I said “well yeah, that’s what we agreed to. It was either that or find another job.” She was upset that I didn’t see her having a phone call with a university about a program as enough. She said she needed me to see that as a good step. I said it was a good step, but it isn’t what we agreed to by this point. She was upset and said something about “so the conflict being less isn’t good? Because I haven’t done this?” I said “No I’ve said the conflict being less is good, it’s just that this was an important part of what we agreed to.” I had said several times in the conversation I was happy about that. I also around this point reminded her what I said last time we had these talks, which is that if she didn't want to go back to school or get a better job, that it was fine, we would just be wanting different things in life, and I wouldn't hate her for that, I would still love her, we would just not be compatible which happens sometimes. She stated multiple times this is what she wants, this is what she wants to do.

Honestly, this whole thing for me is in fragments. I remember points at which she kept trying to change why we almost broke up in the past. She tried to say she is worried to talk to me because I’ll just “break up” with her. And I had to tell her the reason we have almost broke up, was the first time, it was because I told her I got tremors and heart rate spikes when I felt like we were going to have conflict and she belittled me for it. The second time it was because she continuously ran over my boundaries, and had a whole meltdown that started from her tripping and falling when hanging out with family and being embarrassed. Which then went from me supporting her for being embarrassed and trying to make her feel better, to somehow being accusations that I didn’t love her, and she spiraled for like 4 hours, until nearly 5 AM, threatened to not go to my nephews birthday party with me the next day because I told her I think it’d be best if we continued talking about it in the morning, since we were both tired and have had a few drinks. Which she refused to do, and she blew up my phone and criticized my therapy for “changing me.” These weren’t light hearted moments for me, these weren’t just any conversation leading me to think it may be best for us to part ways. This is the second time she has tried to reframe these scenarios as me casually wanting to leave. Instead of what they truly were, which was her pushing me as far as I could go. She also said it’s my fault she has the job she has. That I “made her take it.” Because I’m the one who found it, and told her to apply to there, to get out of the other job that was making her absolutely miserable. Like that job made her seriously depressed. And that we had agreed it was something she could do while she figured something more long term out. But I never made her take it, I suggested it because the other job made me very worried for her and her mental health.

I had 5 heart rate notifications from my Apple Watch from the stress of this conversation. By the end things had settled, she apologized for not doing more, and asked me to promise I wouldn’t break up with her the next day, the next week, and this year. The party was over and everyone had gone to bed, so I missed out on seeing my aunts for longer as they left before we even woke up the next day.

Since then, I’ve just been feeling very confused. I feel sad, angry, confused, and kind of numb. I feel like I don’t remember everything, so if it seems like it doesn’t make sense, I’m sorry.

I just don’t really know what to think. Part of me really feels like this is the end. I just felt like all of our issues are not being dealt with, and that every issue we’ve had, I have to fight against her rewriting what happened. It’s just so confusing. I love her, I really do, so my heart hurts, but I just feel like things shouldn't be this hard. She's been extremely kind since this conversation, and she submitted to get her transcript. But yeah I just don't know. I am really just exhausted of things being like this, and I really wish we didn't have to have an argument for something to happen.

TLDR: Update from my last post. We had a chat, under not good circumstances. I feel very confused and lost. I think maybe it’s just time to throw in the towel. Is this something that can be fixed? Am I being reasonable?

ANSWER: Hon, she is never going to grow while you’re taking care of (frankly enabling) her. She needs to be on her own to figure shit out, and you deserve better than this. Break up, make it a CLEAN break, no contact, and recover. Once you are outside of the situation, you’re gonna realize how unhealthy it is.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (30F) boyfriend (28M) doesnt have a job and just got kicked out. Im concerned about him staying at mine. What should I do?

Hey humans, I need perspective. Help a friend out. I (30F) have been dating a guy (28M) for two years.

At the beginning of our relationship I was struck by the depth of our conversations, his (verbal) support of my painting, and how he turned his life around (gave up drugs and alcohol 3 years ago). He took practical steps to show up for me—changed the litter box for my cats, took the recycling out, took my car to get the tires rotated. In the past I dated guys who talked a big game, but never did anything, so I felt so hopeful.

(For extra context, both of my parents are mentally ill drug addicts so there’s lots of pain there and kinda… hope for care? Which I know I need therapy for). 

Anyway, while we’ve been together I squared away my first year of a social work masters program and it was the hardest thing Ive ever done. In the meantime, he lost his job 8 months ago and has been playing music on the weekends to scrape by. I told him the high risk of that (lack of savings, etc) was making me nervous. He also really wasnt scraping by bc he didnt have enough money for food… so I started paying. Now I buy almost all of our groceries, and Ive been pleading with him to get a more secure job in addition to music… just a bookstore or something 2 days a week! (or something). 

Anyway he wont. He is working really hard to make enough money with music, but he wont get another job. And yesterday he got asked to leave his living situation so… He needs somewhere to land. He’s not from this town, so there aren’t a ton of options. I want to be a good partner and show up, but my nervous system is terrified. 

More context: He was asked to leave bc his landlord wanted to move his daughter & her fam into the property. He never missed a rent payment. 

He did say he may have found something for work this week, and with losing his housing maybe he’ll be more open to change? 

When I question him about the situation I feel like our conversation always ends up with my “trauma.” ie: clearly Im having a big reaction bc I have trauma and it’s not fair to him bc Im not seeing all he does for me.

On top of all of it the uncertainty and anxiety makes me heartbroken bc Im yearning for a “forever home” with someone. 

Extra context: before he was asked to leave his place, he was spending most nights at mine anyways. But, it feels different if he were to not have a place of his own.  

My question is: If I were a friend, what would you advise me to do? Is it amoral to tell him he cant stay with me? (or maybe to stay with not just me? me part time and his moms part time?) If he does stay here, is there anything I can do to stay sane? (make a chore chart, or something? and have a timeline?). If Im telling him he cant move in… what should I tell him yo do? Im open to the thoughts 

TL;DR My (30F) boyfriend (28M) doesnt have a job and just got kicked out. Im concerned about him staying at mine. What should I do?

ANSWER: I think that your gut is telling you something and you should take some time to listen to it. It's not a moral to see that someone isn't willing to really put in the work and effort to build a life and be a partner and want to keep some distance and safety. The fact that you are expressing these concerns and he's chalking them up to "trauma" is really manipulative

================================================================================

QUESTION: How can I help my husband understand that appreciation in marriage should go both ways?

I (29F) and my husband (29M) have been together for 10 years and married for 1. Lately, we’ve been arguing about household responsibilities — but for me, it’s less about chores and more about feeling appreciated.

He often tells me that I should be grateful he helps around the house because he’s the “breadwinner.” I do appreciate everything he does, but I also work full time — 10 to 12 hour shifts, 5 days a week, as a pet groomer. I handle most of the cooking, cleaning, dishes, and general organizing at home. He handles laundry more often, manages the yard and finances, and does most of the grocery shopping.

The grocery part has mostly fallen to him because we’ve been sharing one car. We moved from Philadelphia about two years ago, and until recently, I didn’t have my driver’s license (I used to be really anxious about driving). I finally got my license last week and am now looking for my own car, which will let me help more with errands and take some things off his plate.

Still, when I try to explain that while I’m thankful for what he does, I also deserve gratitude for working and keeping up with the home, it turns into an argument. He takes it as me being ungrateful or trying to “one-up” him, which isn’t what I mean at all. I just want mutual appreciation — not a scoreboard.

How can I bring this up in a way that helps him see that appreciation should go both ways, without it turning into another fight?

TL;DR:
29F married to 29M for 1 year (together 10). My husband says I should be grateful that he helps around the house since he’s the main earner, but I also work full time and handle most housework. I just want him to understand that gratitude should go both ways — how can I communicate that without starting another argument?

ANSWER: You're explaining your reasoning extremely clearly here, and it's a totally reasonable ask - so if he's not "getting" it, it's likely because he doesn't want to. There are a few reasons why that may be, unfortunately none of them are great.

QUESTION: My (21F) partner (21M) just came out as transgender, and I feel confused.

Me (21F) and my partner (21M) have been dating for three years, right before we graduated high school, when she identified as a male. Yesterday, she called me for a serious talk, and told me that she was transgender. 

Of course, I want to be by her side and help her with her transition. However, I don’t know what to do, as I see myself only being attracted to men. I don’t want to hurt her because of my sexuality. 

I am still so in love with her, and I don’t want to end our relationship, but I see myself as straight. As of now, I can’t see a future with a woman. I don’t know what to do, and I need advice. Should I stay? Should I break up with her? What do I do? The last thing I want to do is hurt her. 

TL;DR - My partner just came out as transgender, and I don’t know if I should stay or leave the relationship, as I identify as straight, even though I’m still in love with her.

if you’re not attracted to women, it’s okay to break up - you can support her without being in a romantic relationship

QUESTION: My husband (37M) blames me (35F) for our child being on the autism spectrum

In the pre diagnosis phase he started to shut me out and drink more. She is now officially diagnosed and is a beautiful and happy 3 year old who lives life in her own way. She is minimally verbal and requires a lot of extra support (we are level 2 for those familiar with the level stuffs).

I tried to bring this up. He rejects the notion but isn’t himself. He was my rock and best friend. But I went through a period of time that I couldn’t trust him to take care of her. He let her elope multiple times while I was at work and had to have a home visit from CPS.

I think he is drinking too much and putting us in financial trouble with his drinking and reckless spending. I don’t think divorce is something I want but don’t know how to fix this. How do we move through this? Please do not just say therapy because I have tried.

TL;DR!

We have been friends/ dated since high school. He is a reliable and good person. When I unexpectedly got pregnant with our son (now 8 years old) it was the logical thing to get married and build a life together but now all of that is in jeopardy.

================================================================================

QUESTION: We were ALMOST perfect for six years, bought a house together... then everything fell apart. (Me 25M.. Her 25F)

So me and her been together for 6 years! Everything was great! Even perfect! In my head she was the woman I was going to live my whole life with. We just bought a house and it’s been 2 months we have it. I recently had a harder past 2 months. All my friends were moving some place far so I felt a certain way like I was losing them. So I was a bit more distant, in a mini depression, wanted to do nothing all the time and was always refusing her (let’s say for small activities like walks, etc). I was in my head a lot and was more distant from her and did not really talk about it to her. So she was a bit disconnecting from me.

She, 1 month ago, started to game with a work colleague that she discovered liked playing WOW. They started playing every night and me, not naturally jealous, started to feel things were strange… like she was just watching movies with him online and you know doing stuff she normally would never do.

At a certain point, 2 weeks ago, I asked her if everything was great between us and she then said that she was loving me less. I asked her, shocked and a bit hurt, if she is in love maybe with him or maybe she’s having some feelings for him and she then said yes. My heart shattered… my heart EXPLODED…

We then came to the conclusion where she would stop contacting him. She told him and they stopped talking. The day after she came home and I saw that she was distant. I asked her if she was doubting us and if she still wanted to try working on stuff. She said no, so then we broke up. She moved to her parents’ place...

A week after that she decided that she loved me and wanted to work on us. She came back, I left her as much space as she needed. The first night she spent it on the couch and then the second night she gave me a hug and touched my arm a bit, nothing too serious, and then slept in the same bed with me asking me for a kiss before going to sleep.

The third night I unloaded my bag so I let her know that I feel the guilt, like I fucked up everything by being closed off and being stupid to leave her and not being as much present as I used to be. She after this came in my chest and cuddled me “sensually” and kissed me deeply.

The day after, she came back from work and I saw in her that she was different, a bit weird, bizarre, like she was hiding something. I then asked her if she had something she would like to tell me. She then sat down and told me that she’s not loving me anymore and that she has difficulty trying to work on our relationship and seeing me giving my 2000% for her and she could not give that much to me. She also told me that the whole week she was giving me love not because she wanted to but because she knew I wanted it.

We then had a big conversation, a rough one, and concluded that it’s maybe too early to take the big decision to completely cut off the bridges. The night after I exploded, my heart is destroyed, I don’t know what to think or do anymore, so I go for a car ride alone. She then started texting me a lot. She started asking me where I am and if I want to watch a movie with her. I said yes. We watched the movie, she asked for my hand, I gave her. We then went to bed, she asked me “can I cuddle with you? I need reassurance.” I said yes. We then did some adult stuff...

And now we are 2 days after the movie night. She didn’t tell me I love you or cuddled me since... but this morning before leaving to work she came in the room and kissed me goodbye and said I love you. I love her so much. I have no idea what to do anymore. What to think... I’m lost... I’m hurt... and I want some advice and some exterior advice on my situation.

  
TL;DR: Been with my girlfriend for 6 years, just bought a house. I went through a rough couple of months and got distant. She started gaming and connecting with a coworker, developed feelings for him, and said she loves me less. We broke up, then she came back saying she wanted to try again, but now she’s unsure and says she doesn’t love me anymore. I’m heartbroken, confused, and don’t know what to do.

ANSWER: Could 2 months of you withdrawing cause this much damage to a 6 year relationship that you describe as great and perfect? 

I wonder if she saw it as great and perfect the way that you did.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My SO M45  insists on doing family events with his ex-wife for the sake of his now adult children. I F42 feel like the third wheel every time. Has anyone experienced and how can I navigate the situation?

I am a divorced 42F and my SO 45M is also divorced. We both have two children over the age of 16yo. My children live out of state and visit them or they visit us. His children live close by and visit every other weekend and Wednesdays as their schedules allow. My SO and I live together and have known each other for 7 years but romantically for just over 2 years now.

My SO and ex-wife still want to do family events for the children (19M and 18F) together. My SO does invite me but it makes me incredibly uncomfortable and awkward. I feel like a third wheel and not even present. I understand they have a past, but she has remarried (they don't live together though). His ex-wife talks a lot about their past history or memories while I am present. My SO also insists on me going and says I am not being a great partner by not accepting their arrangements and invitation. I tried to talk to my SO about how I feel alienated at these gatherings and he gets very defensive and lashes out saying I am "Jealous" or making up my own stories in my head. I don't understand why we can't do our own thing with the children without her being present especially now that they are older.

I don't know if I am being insecure or if this should not bother me as much as it does. I feel like my SO and I argue for a few days every time I go to these gatherings and it is really frustrating me.

ANSWER: You have to insert yourself to not be a third wheel, or leave the relationship. If i were uncomfortable and my husband told me i was the issue, I’d choose the latter option.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (27f) bf (27m) of 2 years needs my constant attention. How can I approach this kindly?

  
My bf (27m) constantly needs my (27f) attention. We've been dating for 2 years and overall, the relationship is healthy and happy. However, lately I've picked up on some habits of his that are starting to drive me slightly crazy. These are habits that have always been present in hindsight, but as we start talking about and planning our future together, I'm worried that these habits will get worse over the years, and cause damage to our relationship.  
  
1. When we're together and I'm busy with something, he'll start showing me random things on his phone just to get my attention. He'll start showing me long, silly videos or start laughing until I ask him about it.  
  
2. If I'm playing a game, he'll sometimes take the controller out of my hand and start playing, or start giving me unsolicited instructions on how to play, even if he has never played the game himself.  
  
3. If we're in a group setting, he'll sometimes try to start a conversation with me while I'm listening or talking to someone else.  
  
4. When I try to nap, he'll constantly try to keep me awake my rubbing or tapping me, or will call my name until I respond. This is the most annoying habit of all. I'm a naturally sleepy person during the day due to working night shift and insomnia. On Friday nights, I get home really late (early morning) while he works a 9-5. This usually means that he'll wake up ar around 8 or 9am while I sleep until noon. However, most of the time, he lets me sleep for an hour or two before he gets bored and wakes me up. He'll physically wake up me up, even though I take sleeping tablets that keep me asleep for 8 to 9 hours. This will cause me to crash in the afternoon and I'll get sleepy, but he won't let me nap for longer than 15 minutes at a time. And then he'll complain that I'm 'always sleepy'.  
  
5. If he has recently discovered a new interest that he knows I'm not interested in, he'll make me sit and watch him do it for hours, but when the roles are reversed, he'll just go on his phone or try to change the subject.  
  
Whenever he comes over, I feel like I'm constantly cleaning up after him. He grew up quite wealthy and has always had a maid who keeps his space clean and tidy while I was raised to clean up after myself. I live with my mom who is quite a neat freak (lowkey borderline ocd). He'll leave his clothes and belongings all over the place, especially my room, mess up my bed, and leave food and trash in my room. He'll use also use lots of unnecessary things in the kitchen, which I'll have to wash. When he prepares food, he'll leave crumbs and spilled food all over the counter, which I'll have to also clean. He'll offer to help here and there, which I always decline because I know he won't do it properly, so I'll end up doing it anyway.  
  
The points that were made are the only negative aspects to our otherwise happy relationship. I feel like I'm slightly at fault for letting it get to a point where it annoys me this much, as I haven't ever talked to him about it. I don't want to be a nag, but at the same time, I really don't want spend the rest of my life in a relationship with a puppy/toddler. Breaking up is out of the question, as despite these shortcomings, he makes me happy and I love him.  
  
How can I bring these topics up in a way that's productive and kind, while also being stern?

ANSWER: you have realized that all these are not funny little quirks but actually giant red flags, right? 
Because he disregards your work, patronise you, mess with your healt and overall dont treat you like a person but like one of his accesorise.
I would reconsider yours definition of happy and healty

================================================================================

QUESTION: I 25F want to spend Thanksgiving weekend at home instead of with my husband 25M’s family

No, this is not one of those toxic inlaw posts. 

Next week during thanksgiving weekend, we are travelling to my husband’s parents’ state 4 hours from where we live. They live in a small town with pretty much nothing to do. We are stuck at home the entire time we’ll be there. None of us celebrate thanksgiving but since I’ll be off from work, I really wanna spend the time at home learning new recipes, visit my mom who has been travelling out of country for a while and just relaxing instead of having to travel 4 hours, spending 5 days at his parents place and getting bored out of my mind. 

Now the thing is, I love his family but they’re very different from me. My social energy is dead every time we return from visiting them because his entire family (extended family included) get together every night and have a little party as they all live close by.

They also speak a different language and I understand them well but haven’t gotten quite fluent with speaking and frankly feel a little shy so I stick to English and sometimes I miss some things so it can be exhausting to try to put the puzzles together and understanding what they’re talking about. 

The main reason we are travelling to them is because my husband’s childhood friend is getting married. We visit his parents every month, I enjoy their company and never really mind visiting them but if we have plans, we switch to a different weekend to visit them. But because we are specifically visiting to attend this wedding, we can’t change dates this time around. 

Now the thing is, there is a certain pressure in our culture for the daughter in law to be there for there for all social events unless there is a solid reason such as being sick. My husband would be okay with me staying at home, might be a little disappointed but generally he would respect my choices. My in laws are very sweet but I know they will be hurt if I don’t go. 

I am in a predicament as to what to do as I really wanna use this long weekend to take time off work and truly relax, go out with my friends or just visit my mom as I have been working Saturdays too for the last couple of weeks. I have considered faking being sick to save everyone’s feelings but I really don’t wanna do that. 

I feel a sense of unspoken pressure.

How do I deal with this? Any advice would be appreciated.

ANSWER: You're traveling to an actual wedding happening that weekend? Assuming this is a thing you've already RSVPed to, suck it up and go. Staying home because you want to play around in the kitchen is not a valid reason to ditch a wedding.

I sure as hell would stop traveling there every month with 8+ hours of driving though. Let him go by himself and you'll pick a few times a year to make an appearance.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My(M33) girlfriend(F28) has a past I’m struggling to get over, how do I get past this for our relationship?

My girlfriend recently told me the amount of men she was with and though I was taken back by the number it didn’t bother me because everything about the relationship is good and I believe we are both happy. In comparison, I married my hs sweetheart and have been divorced from her for a few years. So in terms of partners, my gf is only my second. 

The divorce def may have altered my brain as it was “out of nowhere” (late blooming lesbian thing after having an affair.) throwing that in there because I def have some residual insecurities now. 

My gf left her phone out and I went through it and can’t help but feel a sinking feeling. She kept texts and snaps from a lot of her hookups, which held details of their intimate lives. My initial thought was retroactive jealousy, which I brought it up to her apologizing for the breach of privacy and telling her I saw some stuff that I obviously wish I didn’t read. She said that was all before she knew me and she wasn’t truly happy and all that.

A few months later one of her college friends brought up a guy they “knew” and my gf got a bit awkward and changed the subject. (I know from the previous snooping their sex life and pics and stuff) so I also got uncomfortable as well. 

All that to say as we move past that my feelings are less of jealousy now and more of disbelief that the person I’m with would do a lot of these acts with people she didn’t even know their names and stuff. I know people grow up but I’m almost in the mindset of is it just my turn with her? Will she cheat when eventually the relationship goes through a slight low point? 

Again I recognize the insecurity and something I am working on, but my question is is this just normal for people to have these phases? And do you grow out of it?

ANSWER: I would break up. Not because of her past, but because of your incompatibility.  She seems to be a more liberal sex positive person and you seem to be much more conservative.  And there is zero wrong with either approach to life. You just need to find someone with more of your own ideals. That she still has those conversations, pics or whatever is a little weird for someone in a current relationship,  but it isn't anything  nefarious.  

It is in your head now and probably will never leave.  You are always going to sneak a peek at her phone when you feel off or she does something that you construe as possible breach of trust. That isn't how to live your life and she deserves a partner more in tune with her life. Good luck.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I'm (M34) still close with my ex (F34), and my fiance (F33) is suddenly uncomfortable with it. How should we handle this?

tldr: My best friend (F) and I dated for 3 months at the start of college. My fiance (W), who's known about this and has been okay with our friendship, is suddenly feeling discomfort after years of being together, and neither of us can understand why.

This is a throwaway, as I don't want to risk people in my life finding my main account.

I've known my best friend (we'll call F) since we were 10. We grew up together and got close in high school, since we are both pretty introverted people with a lot of similar interests and experiences. During our teenage years, our relationship was strictly platonic and neither of us had any romantic interest in the other.

When me and F were off to college, we both went to the same one a few states away from our hometown. During the early months of our first semester, I started to develop a small crush on her, and eventually found out that she felt the same. Now, I'd like to pause here and say that I don't think there was ever any chemistry between us, and we both think that we only had "feelings" for each other because we relied heavily on each other during the start of college. Being in a new state, only having any familiarity with each other, and being the introverted people we are, it was very hard to make new friends. So for a while, it was really only her and me to lean on each other for social interaction (outside of our classes). We think that this created a sort of codependency and gave the impression of interest. But even at the time, it never felt right, and it was very much a forced relationship. We barely acted like a couple, hardly kissing or showing physical affection, going on few public dates. We never had sex and neither of us ever wanted to. Overall, it wasn't too different from when we were just friends but neither of us acknowledged the divide. The only reason we lasted 3 months together is because both of us were terrified that breaking up would ruin our years long friendship (stupid, I know, and we both acknowledge this was dumb). The catalyst for our split was when both of us got drunk and made out (first time doing so ever), because once we were sober we couldn't deny how wrong being together like that felt anymore.

After that, we communicated and finally ended the relationship amicably, both wanting to remain friends. We did take some space from each other in order to work on other friendships and stuff, and eventually got back to being close friends after a couple of weeks. We had another conversation in which we admitted it never made sense for us to have dated. This is when we came to the conclusion as to why we likely developed "feelings" in the first place.

Skip to a year after I graduate, and I meet my now fiance (W). At this point, i have 3 total relationships under my belt. When I met her, I knew pretty quickly that she was the woman I wanted to marry. She has said the same about me. I was very open with her about my relationship/history with F and made sure she knew that there was nothing romantic between us. She was always 100% okay with it and after the two met, they became close. They now have a friendship outside of me, to the point that W and I spent 20 minutes debating whose wedding party F would be a part of (bridesmaid or groomswoman). W has always said that she has no problem with F and I remaining close, and that she knows our relationship is purely platonic. She has even made jokes with my sisters about us dating.

Recently, however, I noticed W acting a bit off whenever F is mentioned, primarily by me. Usually, we communicate well, so I waited a bit to give her time to come to me about whatever the issue may be so we could talk about it. After a while of nothing, though, I asked her about it when I noticed it again. I just asked if everything was alright, if there was some kind of conflict or anything. She was reluctant to say anything but eventually told me that she had been feeling some discomfort with our friendship recently, and she couldn't really explain why. She says that she never had an issue with it before, never felt uncomfortable or anything, and wasn't sure what changed. She trusts me entirely, and feels ridiculous for feeling this way.

W thinks the change could have something to do with F recently getting out of a long term relationship. Of course, now F is leaning on her support systems a lot more (me, W, family, etc) to get her through this hard time. W herself can't fully understand why this would make her feel the way she does, especially since F has primarily been going to her for advice on how to move forward (W has more relationship experience) and not me, and she trusts both of us. Neither of us can fully understand how this could be the cause, but it is the only new change in our lives, really.

Since we don't really know the cause, I'm not sure what to do to help. I've planned for more fancy dates and a short trip for us, hoping that a bit more romance might help her feel better, but I know that our relationship isn't the issue. We have great communication, spend plenty of quality time together, have frequent dates, and overall a very healthy relationship. I'm just hoping this might help even a little because right now, she feels bad for her feelings about this. She cares about F a lot, and loves me and she wouldn't want to strain our friendship. She says that after so many years together, and knowing everything between me and F, she feels ridiculous for even caring now. Even though I tried to reassure her that her feelings are valid, and that we would figure it out together, I know she still feels bad.

I'm not sure what to do, really. I love my fiance and I hate that she feels this way and I don't know how to help. I don't ever want her to doubt me or our relationship, and she says she doesn't, but I'm worried that if we don't figure this out, she might start to. I also don't want to lose my friendship with F, though I am willing to set more boundaries if that would help (W doesn't want this). We are both just kind of stuck right now, which is why I'm here for advice. Any ideas on what could be the issue, or how to go about fixing this would be very appreciated.

ANSWER: I think your ex should not be coming to you at all for relationship advice right now. Your fiancé needs to come first. She can be the one to talk to her.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Girlfriend (29F) constantly procrastinates. I’m (29M) already sick of it. Any advice?

She does say for a fact that she struggles with indiscipline (breaking a chocolate addiction, debt, etc)

I’m far from perfect. I suppose I’m good at following through on plans. We’re actually talking about getting married soon, and I’m doing the heavy lifting financially. She swears she wants it, too but consistently fails to deal with stuff she promised to handle. What things? For instance, she’s put off waking up early to go to submit documents or pick up test results from the doctor’s. I paid for these things more than a fortnight ago.

I’m starting to think she isn’t as excited as I am about our wedding plans. Or is she too indisciplined to be bothered? My decision is to have sit down tonight after work and propose that we postpone wedding plans for another 30 days, cool things down. 

I seem to have lost my excitement.

ANSWER: Does she have ADHD, or been evaluated for it? This is screaming ADHD to me. ADHD often looks different in men than in women, and can present with procrastination, disorganization, difficulty with follow through on tasks, and forgetting to do things they wanted/needed to do. Obviously, men can have these symptoms, too, but they are very common in women with ADHD. 

Google Inattentive ADHD, see what you think. And it's fair that you're frustrated - we are hard to live with.

He sleeps almost 95% of the day and has mentioned he has fatigue issues when I mentioned that I was concerned that he’s sleeping so often then he spiraled at the thought of me not liking that he’s asleep a lot and I still am but i’m learning to disregard that thought pattern as i’m not his mum and he’s got things he’s dealing with too..But I don’t want to hurt him by breaking up w him, what’s the best way to do this?  I don’t want to toy with his heart and I fear I already have…

EDIT I just sent him the “break up” text I did need chatgpt to help word it as I had no idea how to do it, he read it as soon as I sent it which is odd as he doesn’t usually see them for a bit but either way he knows now

ANSWER: > Im trying to force myself into liking him as I know he really likes me, but it seems as though it’s not working

I'm not sure what you thought was gonna happen here. You're with him out of pity. That's a cruel thing to do to someone. Calling it people pleasing makes it seem like you're pleasing someone, but you're not. Nobody is pleased by you ignoring your own needs. You're just being inauthentic.


> But I don’t want to hurt him by breaking up w him


Have you thought about how you're hurting him by staying with him?? You really need to get over it and just break up. And stop dating people you don't like.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (35F) almost husband (40M) has never introduced me to his friends.

So, first of all, sorry for any mistakes, English is  not my first language.

Me and my boyfriend have been together for 3 years. We moved in together 7 months ago. Life is very good and, usually, very easy with him. He’s a usually easy person, and every discussion we have, he’s not exactly understanding, since most of the times he cannot see from where I come from, but he tries to listen. He has a problem where he finds difficult to empathize with things and point of vies that are distinct from the ones he have. Not only with me, but with everyone.

As said in the title, we’ve been together for 3 years and I have never met any of his friends. To be fair, once there was a birthday of a friend and another time he was meeting a friend at the same place that I would be after work, so ho I met them for like 30 min. Besides that, he never called me or tried to include me in any situation. 
I have told him a few times over the years that I find it strange, but he always dismiss it, saying that he is not that often with their friends (even though he usually meets them when he’s leaving his daughters at her mother’s house every other weekend.)

Last Sunday, I was sleeping when he woke me up telling me that one of his friends was having a baby shower and he was going. He didn’t invite me to go with him. Most of the times, I was ok with me not being included, ‘cause it was like “random” situations (that are not so random ‘cause almost every time he takes his daughter home after his weekend with her, he meets theses friends, what happens every two weeks). I always think things like: it wasn’t planned, I don’t know them, he wants to be alone. Always creating execuses. But last Sunday it made me feel really bad, because it wasn’t something just for the boys, it was a family event. There was no reason for him not to call me to go with him. After he said, I got upset and he noticed. So he came to talk to me and said he didn’t think that I want to go, that his friends didn’t say he could take anyone, that I didn’t know anyone and that’s why it didn’t cross his mind to invite me. I got really upset, but he left without me anyway.

When he got back, 9 hours later, he was drunk and I was crying about it, so he started a conversation and we talked a little about it. It made me worse, because it was very difficult to hear the things he had to say. Basically, he said that he didn’t want to take me. That his time with his friends was his personal time. That he will not feel the need or the urge for me to meet his friends, among other hurtful things (not cursing or anything like that, just things that I found heavy). I said that I get that I’m not going to be wanted ALL the time, but the problem is that I don’t get why there was NEVER an appropriate moment. Since he was very drunk, and I was very uspet, we decided to leave the conversation to another moment.
Today we decided to talk about it, while he was sober. Basically, he just repeated himself and reinforced what he had said drunk. After a long discussion, he said that he would never feel that I have to meet friends, he doesn’t see the need for me to envolved and that he never had the opportunity to put us (me and his friends) together. I said that, for me, the problem was exactly that: in three years, he couldn’t find or create an opportunity to make it happen, even though I have talked about it before. He said that he would do it if it was something that was asking him, but only because of that; if it was up to him, he would never do it. Mind that he knows all my friends, he’s present in every situation and they treat him like he is their friend as well.

Everything was so absurd to me that I don’t know how to feel. I’m feeling numb, I’m feeling hurt. Why he doesn’t want me to meet his friends? Why isn’t that important to him? He says I’m overreacting, that it’s not that important, that he’s with me most of the time anyway. I can’t help the feeling that he is hiding me from someone or hiding something from me. Honestly, I don’t think he has an affair or anything like that. We are very different people on how we think, act, different points of view, and I think this is just one of the situations where we can’t see eye-to-eye. I just don’t know what to do from now on, since I’m very hurt. I need some advice as how I deal with this situation.

Tl;dr: after three years together, my boyfriend has never introduced me to his friends and says he doesn’t have the intention to for his own will, even after I said it is important to me.

ANSWER: Not meeting your partner’s friends, especially in a long-term relationship, is a major red flag. The fact that he didnt invite you to the baby shower AND stayed out for 9 hours is another red flag. Do his friends even know about you? It kinda sounds like he’s leading a double life. Possibly another ‘female’ friend. Sorry, OP, I would throw this man out. There’s no respect there.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (F26) feel like my boyfriend (M27) doesn’t make any efforts to get to know me

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years and started living together a year ago. He is a good partner - he’s always gentle, does his fair share of cleaning and cooking, is incredibly supportive, and encourages me to try new things and challenge myself. I feel completely at ease around him.

The thing is, he doesn’t ask any questions. Sometimes he forgets to even ask how my day was. I don’t believe that you can learn everything there is to know about someone in a few years, let alone a lifetime, so I ask him genuine questions pretty frequently: “did you ever ___ as a kid?” “How did your parents meet?” “Do you ever wish you ___?”

I can’t think of a single time he has asked me a question like this. It’s as if he has no interest in knowing me. I have expressed this to him and he seemed kind of confused and then said he would make an effort (he hasn’t). It’s just odd to me that you can live beside someone and just be happy with them existing and not have an ounce of curiosity? It kind of makes me sad. I always envisioned my life partner knowing me inside and out, better than I do - and in some ways he does. 


I want to know if this is a common issue with men in general or if it’s a compatibility thing…

ANSWER: I fear this is quite common for a lot of men. The man I am dating is somewhat similar. Especially at the start but he is getting better.

QUESTION: 23F & 31M Do I need to leave?

My boyfriend (31M) and I (23F)have been together for 5 years. In the beginning he talked about marriage and kids etc and how he wanted those things in the future. 

We’ve discussed breaking up due to him no longer wanting the same things. We talk about leaving but neither of us have really pulled the plug. 

Just today we had a call and I mentioned “well when we get married” and he said “that’s not happening we’re not getting married I don’t want that”.

Which kind of broke my heart a bit but now I’m questioning if marriage is even something I really care about and I shouldn’t leave just because he no longer wants kids or marriage. 

Could I just be delusional (: ?

ANSWER: So let me get this straight, he, a 26 year old ADULT, started dating you, a 17 year old MINOR?

Just break up, this man is disgusting and you're still young. He's already shown (even if you weren't a minor), that he isn't going to marry you, why stay?

A few weeks ago, one of my best friends from high school Ivan (24M) was in town. He invited along one of his friends, Tyler, to our plans. While all of us were hanging out, Tyler began gradually focusing on me more and asked for my social medias. At the end of the night, he messaged me ensuring I got home safe. From there, Tyler and I talked constantly for a little over a week because he said he wanted to get to know me more. We chatted on Instagram and Snapchat most hours of the day, and I had been talking with him more than anyone else.

When I would tell my family and friends about our conversations, they all thought he may have been flirting at certain points. However, I wasn’t 100% sure if he was interested. I asked about him being single, and I was told he’s been trying to date but he hasn’t had much luck. I would occasionally be flirty to test the waters, and I figured he would likely shut it down if he wasn’t interested in me like that. But he would usually respond positively or say “Thank you!”, so I assumed he was okay with it. 

However, Tyler texted me the morning after he had ignored my text messages for a day. He apologized for being busy, but then he told me that he was only interested in being friends since he was currently seeing someone. I replied saying I’m cool with being friends, apologizing for misreading the situation and potentially making him uncomfortable by flirting. He said I didn’t make him uncomfortable at all and that he understands.

I’m not opposed to being friends, but I’m not sure where to go from here. Tyler hasn’t answered the last message I sent last week, but he’s been active on socials and watching my stories. I want to be careful about how I deal with this situation because we have a lot of mutual friends. We’re definitely going to be seeing each other again at some point.

I just feel really embarrassed for thinking he liked me in that way. What would be the best way to move forward from something like this? Would I even be able to? Like I said, I do like him as a person and wouldn’t mind being his friend. :(

ANSWER: I would say "don't be embarrassed" but I get it. Just take a step back, keep things casual. Try the friend route especially if you have mutuals and go from there. 

I come from a time before social media and texting so we had to be face to face and it's easier to judge when someone is right in front of you. That seemed to make life easier.

QUESTION: I need sincere advice. I '30F' he '38M'

In the past few weeks I have argued several times with my partner. I had met a stray cat with whom I formed a special bond and wanted to adopt him. He told me he was allergic as a child, refused to be tested again for allergies and never wanted to talk about it again. Last night, looking at the photos and videos of the cat, I started crying because I miss him. He got very angry and annoyed saying that I am too sensitive and it is not normal to cry for a cat I have known for 15 days, which was not the animal of my life. He also suggested that I talk to my doctor about it and, if necessary, take mood stabilizers because a reaction like this is not normal. Do you think he's right? Am I exaggerating? I'm trying to question myself, your advice is precious.

ANSWER: He sounds like a dick honestly. If he refuses to get tested for allergies then he probably just doesn't like cats. It's obvious his needs come before yours.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 34F with 33M boyfriend, he still messages his ex several times a week, and I don’t know what to think

Hi everyone, I could really use some perspective, and I’m trying to figure out whether my reaction is reasonable or if I’m just insecure.

I’ve been dating my boyfriend since early July. Things have been going really well, we talk almost every day, see each other regularly, are even planning trips and talking about our future together. He’s been wonderful with my cats, I’ve met some of his friends, and his mom likes me. I genuinely felt we were building something stable.

He recently told me something that I didn't take well, he’s still in direct contact with his ex. Not occasional interactions in shared circles like he previously made it sound, but messaging each other several times a week. He sends her memes, political content, random things he knows she’d enjoy, and she does the same back, not just one-sided messages, but actual back and forth conversations. What bothers me most, is thinking there are multiple things that still remind him of her, things he knows she will appreciate, and he intentionally goes out of his way to share them with her. He barely does this with me.

For context, they dated for over 3 years, over 10 years ago. She cheated, they tried to reconcile, and he couldn’t get past it. She was his first everything, and he hasn’t had another girlfriend since. So she’s essentially his only relationship reference point. She’s also been married for a year, and according to him, her husband wasn’t comfortable with their interactions either.

What really bothered me is that earlier in our relationship, when he mentioned being “friends” with her, he worded things in a way that made it sound like they occasionally crossed paths because they ran in similar circles. He never mentioned active, frequent DM exchanges ever since we’ve been together. And I only learned the truth because her name came up while he was mentioning past intimate experiences.

When I told him I was upset, he initially acted surprised and minimized it, saying "it was over 10 years ago,” that he interacts with “all his friends" similarly, and even scoffing at my reaction. I don’t see how someone who was your first love, first and only sexual partner, and only long-term relationship fits into a “just a friend” box. After I had to really spell out why I was hurt, he changed his tone, apologized, asked for forgiveness, and asked what he needed to do to make this right.

After this conversation, I admittedly looked through his Facebook profile, something I’d never cared to do before. I saw they used to say “I love you” constantly back then, she’s wished him happy birthday and posted multiple times over the years, and he even gave her photo credit for two of his more recent profile pictures, which again, made their continued relationship feel even more significant than what he’s portrayed.

To be clear, I don’t think people can’t be friends with exes, and I’m not trying to control who he talks to. But there’s a difference between casual, friendly interactions and intentional, frequent, personalized communication with a former partner, especially one who was your first everything and whose ongoing contact isn’t fully shared with your current partner.

I’ve kidded with him more than once that I’m actually glad he hasn’t had much relationship experience before me, and that I’d probably feel a little jealous otherwise. So I genuinely don’t understand how he didn't think this would bother me or how it didn't even register with him.  It makes me question how much he respects my feelings, especially because I’ve also told him I have trust issues from two past relationships where things were hidden from me repeatedly. Due to some other unfortunate things I let slide in previous relationships, I told myself that I should never feel embarrassed by a partner’s behavior or feel like I need to hide anything they do or say from family or friends… but here I am, feeling exactly that.

I told him I need some time to think. The lack of transparency, the initial minimization of my feelings, and the depth of their relationship history have made me feel uncomfortable. I don’t think he was being malicious, I actually think he normalized this dynamic over the years and never considered the emotional weight it carries or how it would look to someone he’s now serious with. But I’m struggling.

My questions, how can I understand and navigate my feelings about this situation? And what could be done to possibly move past this?

Any insights are appreciated. I’m confused and trying to approach this as reasonably as I can.

TL;DR: Dating my(34 F) boyfriend(33 M) since July and things felt serious and stable. Just learned he’s messaging his ex (his first everything) several times a week, even though he previously made it sound like they only interacted socially occasionally. He minimized my feelings at first, then apologized once he realized how hurt I was. Their ongoing interactions, the lack of transparency have affected my trust, and I’m taking time to think. Trying to figure out if my reaction is reasonable, how others would interpret his behavior, and whether this is something we can move forward from.

ANSWER: he’s treating his cheating ex better than he treats you. drop him lmao / why is this a question?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Boyfriend (31M) of almost 2 years never felt a “spark” but loves me (28F) and doesn’t want to break up

TLDR: Boyfriend says he loves me but has never felt a spark but wants to stay together. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year and a half and moved in together about 6 months ago. We’re crazy compatible, have great talks, amazing sex, and he’s truly my best friend. We hang out together all the time, im super close with his family, and we sometimes talk about marriage/kids. We both agree it is the happiest and healthiest relationship either of us have been in. 

Although we’ve only been serious for this past year and a half, we technically met like 6 years ago and have casually dated/been friends throughout the years. When we first met, he had just gotten out of a really hard breakup, manic depression phase, and had just moved to my town. He also has some deep rooted trauma from his mom (they do not talk). He was definitely going through it. 

I fell for him immediately because we really get along and it’s always felt when we’re together like he feels the same. Basically when we first casually dated back then I wanted commitment and he wasn’t ready for that, still hung up on his ex. He ended up dating her again (while I was dating someone else) realized it wasn’t for him, and closed that door for good. We both went through college and have been casually texting, going on dates, hooking up, every few months or so through the years. 

As we’ve gotten older he’s more ready for something serious, and says that he chose me because I’m his best friend and he wants to build a life and a family with me. Sounds perfect, but the catch is I recently found out that one reason he was hesitant on seriously dating me for so long was because he’s never really felt a “spark” with me despite our intellectual connection and mutual attraction (in addition to just not being ready for a serious commitment). I got pretty upset and slept at a friends house for a day or two when I found this out. 

When I came home, he said he really does love the fuck out of me and doesn’t want to break up and he cried pretty hard. He said the love has grown over time, and that sometimes he feels a spark. But he did admit that sometimes he does worry there may be something missing. 

He says Im his best friend, check 9/10 boxes in his head, and that he decided the “spark” isn’t important in building a life with someone because it fizzles out and he wants something stable that will last. He said he thinks we have a good thing going for us so he wants to see it through, and that people always say to marry your best friend. 

We also talked about what a “spark” means to each of us. And to me it’s like this overall feeling of connection and attraction. He says he feels like men’s brains are more compartmentalized and that the “spark” to him is maybe just a pheromone reaction? Like he doesn’t obsess over me or anything but he does look forward to seeing me and says he loves kissing me and having sex with me. 

I asked him if he felt the spark with his ex and he said yes, but that he didn’t feel the intellectual connection with her he had with me and that was ultimately why he ended it. I have trouble understanding a difference between this “connection and love” he feels for me and a “spark” because in my mind it’s all one thing, no compartments. 

I love him but I don’t want to be settled for. Maybe I feel too safe to give him that “spark” he’s accustomed to, especially growing up with a toxic mom, suffering from depression, and not wanting to open up to women. Maybe he didn’t feel it when we met because he was guarded and emotionally going through things/hung up on his ex. I appreciate him being honest and we decided to work on things and be more open about our feelings. He’s been really sweet since then and has been trying to reassure me and make me feel extra loved, but I’m having a hard time finding peace with the topic. 

Additionally, I have a an anxious attachment style while he has an avoidant one. We’re both trying to work on it. We talked about maybe if I gave him more space he would get a bit more of that spark feeling (my suggestion, and he agreed). I’ve also suggested letting him pick out my perfumes and things like that if it’s a smell/pheromone thing. Aside from this we’re basically perfect, but I don’t want that feeling to be one sided. But I also don’t want to throw away a great thing from my overthinking and fairytale expectations if it’s really not a big deal.

ANSWER: I think that in a lot of cases the “spark” is actually anxiety. A happy, respectful, peaceful love is more sustainable in my opinion. This doesn’t mean you can’t surprise eachother and have new exciting experiences together though.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (31M) am feeling resentful of my girlfriend (33F) because of her depression.

Alright Reddit I need your help, I’ve been putting this off for a while because I don’t want to have to make a decision. I’m the kind of person that finds it easier to get broken up with than to break up with someone. But I think I’m at the end of my rope and need some advice. 

I’ve been seeing my girlfriend now for a little over 2.5 years. She is a very sweet person, very loving, and very expressive. She loves art, being outdoors, traveling, and good food. We live together and have two cats. She is great but … there is a reason why I wrote this. 

My girlfriend suffers from both really bad ADHD and Depression. The ADHD is year round and the depression as she puts it is “seasonal” but in reality I feel like it’s year round. As far as I know these are the only two mental health “things” she has, but I suspect there is more there. She has also suffered trauma in her past relationships. And also has abandonment problems, co-dependency, and overall is just very unhappy with where her life is. To be fair she was honest with me about all this but I had no idea how bad it was.

The first glimpse I saw of how bad it was came around our 3rd month of dating. From then on things have been about the same. She tells me how unhappy she is with the current status of her life. Everything from how much money she makes at her job, to her not exercising, to being too far from family and friends, to being depressed, sometimes it feels like she’s not satisfied with any aspect of her life including myself. The more she feels depressed the more it stops her from doing things that do bring her joy the more she gets depressed. 

To help her I’ve taken it upon myself to be her biggest support network. This includes doing all of the cooking and about 80%-90% of the cleaning around the house. Cleaning after and feeding the cats. And overall just doing everything I can to free up as much time and energy for her to focus on things that do bring her joy and fulfillment. In addition to this taking on more of the financial weight of the relationship since I do make more money.  

Since I’ve known her this has included taking up hobbies like surfing, exploring passions like pottery, and trying to be a social media influencer . But I feel like inevitably her ADHD and depression get the best of her and she ends up for lack of a better way “not following through” with what she wants to do. And every time she has an emotional breakdown that usually involves her crying and basically feeling sorry for herself and saying how she will never have the life she wants. Sometimes she asks that I help with those things, which I am happy to but because of my career it's sometimes very hard for me to help without neglecting my own needs, which I already do (more on this later). I feel terrible because I just want her to be happy. 

Like I said I’ve taken it upon myself to do my best to support her as best as I can but I am burning out over here. I have a demanding career that involves me working 40+ hrs a week with most of my time spent inside a traditional office away from home. I love my career and see myself doing it for the rest of my life. But the demands of the relationship are taking its toll on me, over the past months my performance at work has slowly been dropping. I’m sleeping less because I am finding it increasingly harder to get to bed at a decent time because by the time I finish cooking, cleaning, feeding the cats and spending “quality” time together its closer to midnight (I put quality in "" because at this point this mainly looks like watching tv or playing video games). I do not ask my girlfriend to do any of the cooking or cleaning because I want her to focus on things that do bring her joy. On top of this the usual demands of life like aging parents and money stresses are also added to my load. Additionally,  whenever I feel like it’s time to bring it up with my gf that she needs to help a little more she has a breakdown because of how unhappy she is and I feel like I need to sideline my own problems in order to help her overcome the current crisis. 

I also feel like she is projecting at least some of her unhappiness onto me. Specifically when it comes to money. Over the past year she has been bringing up quite constantly about how she needs to make more money and how unhappy she feels in her current position. About how she wasn’t meant to live a “poor” life (I put this in quotations because I disagree, we are not poor we just do not have a rich lifestyle, meaning she doesn't travel as much as she wants and doesn't have the things she wants). My main means of supporting her when it comes to this is me taking on more responsibility around the house to free up time and energy for her to focus on her goals and always giving her positive encouragement when she says things like "Im going to apply to a new job" or "I am going to start my own business". I don't care if the business never pans out or never make money, all i care about is her trying and feeling happy and fulfilled, but so far it has never gotten off this stage. As i said ADHD and Depression end up getting the best of her, she gets overwhelmed thinking of all the things that can go bad it completely stops her from doing things she needs to do.  In addition to this she expresses that I also need to make more money, which makes me feel uncomfortable (reasons are below).  She also brings up how much she wants to buy a house with a lot of land to grow food and raise animals and how that will align better with what she wants for her life and will ultimately make her happy. This is something that I do not share with her. Before I met her and even now, money is not a super important thing. Nor do I feel like buying a house with a lot of land will fix everything. Money has never been something that I pursue, instead I like to focus on being in a workplace that I feel relaxed, comfortable and engaged. It doesn't mean I am un-ambitious, its just that I have always believed that its more important to focus on growth and education and the money will follow after. But in an effort to help her I’ve gone into debt, this includes going on trips that I couldn't afford, buying her things that I couldn’t afford, helping her with just straight up cash. This has contributed to me being stressed about money because now I have a bunch of debt hanging over me. I am someone that believes in living below my means and being grateful with what I have, but when she wants things my heart melts and I fold and get her things. I know that this is on me and I do not hold it against her. However, it makes me feel like I’m just throwing away money and even if we buy the house with the land exactly the way she wants it , what will happen if she is still depressed after that ? 

I also wanted to address that I do not have depression. To be fully honest before meeting her depression was not something I had ever spent more than 5 min thinking about. No one I know is affected by it. My background is one of an immigrant family that believes the only way to success is paid by working your butt off and that anything outside of that is an excuse. Since then I have read books on depression, gone to therapy, and done my best to be as empathetic as I can be. My understanding is that depression is for life and there are ways to manage it but it never really goes away. I’ve also encouraged my gf to attend therapy, she wants to go to therapy but cites not having enough money as the main reason for not going. I do disagree with her on that , she has health insurance that covers therapy, and in addition to that her parents have expressed in the past that they would help her to pay for therapy. In the past I have even given her money with the expressed condition that she use it to pay for therapy (I think she used it to pay off her credit card bill which I was ok with because I thought that would help her feel better). When confronted with this she cites that it takes a-lot of emotional energy to find a therapist, and that even when you find a therapist it takes time to figure out if they are the right person for you. This has been the current stats for about 2 years now, the biggest development being that she found her health insurance card but nothing after that. Again I am trying to be empathetic and just give time and space but I also know that I’m starting to feel resentment.

I believed that taking a load off her shoulders in the form of cooking, cleaning, financial support, etc could help give her the boost she needs to take care of her own needs and accomplish the things she wants but very little if anything has changed in the past 2 years. I already know I am overworking myself to the point where I am struggling to find the time and energy to do basic things like going to the barbershop or styling my facial hair (i like to do these things as a form of self love lol). I've never worked so hard for someone and a relationship and I feel like I am not receiving anything from it. I truly feel like I am doing everything I can, and the thought of doing more sends me into a bitter, angry, and sad spiral. I hate that I wrote this, a younger version of myself believed that all it took to have a happy relationship is love and that everything else would fall into place. Now I feel like I need more than just love.   

I spend time thinking about a life without her and what I could do with the time, energy, and money not spent on her. I know that sounds horrible and I feel guilty for it and it is affecting my mental health as well but that’s me being fully honest. I feel like the most evil person in the world for having these thoughts because I know depression is a horrible disease that she didn't ask for. I remember one of the books on depression i red asked the reader to look inside and figure out if you have what it takes to be with a person who suffers from depression, and that if you don't it's ok to walk away, that's it's better to walk away than to stay and build up resentment. 

Anyone been in a similar spot?

ANSWER: I understand that your compassion and care for her makes you feel guilty about the idea of leaving or even of pressing too hard any specific positive steps in her life. But I worry as part of that you are being exploited.

As you note a lot of her life seems to pivot around her being sad, her complaining, then half assing a plan of action, then when that falls through she gets sad and complains again. It's all a very nasty feedback loop and one that right now you aren't actually helping her to escape, if anything you are unwittingly becoming an enabler, you are making it easier for her to fund and enact these cycles. 

>I’ve also encouraged my gf to attend therapy, she wants to go to therapy but cites not having enough money as the main reason for not going. 

Because also note she actively avoids any practical approaches to her problems. Working on her mental or physical health she avoids but she'll attempt to kick start a full time influencer account? Like you see the absurdity of that right, the cart before the horse thinking? How else could that stuff possibly end but failure if the foundation, the core of who she is, is so dysfunctional. 

If you think you've helped her I worry you haven't. I think it's deeply concerning that a year in you are already living together especially given you knew fairly early the scope of her problems but even sidestepping that there has not been any actual progress made. Even with all the time, effort, care, and money you've sunk into it she isn't actually closer to therapy or any kind of positive change.

I get wanting to keep her afloat but be aware she's dragging you down with her. You need to leave because right now all this ends in is you drowning and her finding someone else to cling to.

QUESTION: my (25f) bf (26m) deleted messages w a coworker

my boyfriend and i have been dating for 7 years. he cheated at the beginning of our relationship, and we broke up briefly, but things were okay until recently. we’ve been arguing a lot and going through a rough patch.

i noticed he followed a coworker on instagram, which was odd since he rarely uses it. when i asked him about it, he said it was just a coworker. today, i saw that he had dm-ed her to ask if she wanted to visit another coworker in the hospital. they didn’t go because she was busy, but he deleted the message right after. i noticed this by chance while using his laptop.

we had a phone call afterward, and he didn’t mention the message when i asked if he was going with a coworker. i feel uneasy about it, especially since he deleted the messages. i’m concerned about whether he’s deleted other messages without me noticing. how do i bring this up to him without sounding like im going to start another argument?

ANSWER: OP, he's a liar and a cheat.

You already know this about him.

What are you trying to prove here?   Do you like being lied to?  Do you enjoy his infinity or something?

We know why cheats cheat.   What we can't figure out his why people refuse to believe the person who cheated on them once isn't a liar and a cheat?

If I stole money out of your purse, would you ever ask me to hold it while you while you were doing something?

================================================================================

QUESTION: 26M & 25F, friends for 8 years — need advice on handling feelings for my best friend

I am 26M and she is 25F. We have been friends for around 8 years. Our friendship started with light flirting, but at that time we were both dating other people. Over the years, we both went through breakups and ended up becoming very close.

We have supported each other through arguments, periods of not speaking, and plenty of ups and downs. No matter what happens, we somehow reconnect with the same trust and comfort.

Over time, I developed deeper feelings for her. She once mentioned that she would never date again or go against her parents’ wishes, so I never said anything. I haven’t dated since 2018, and whenever I think about relationships, she is always the person who comes to mind.

She considers me her closest friend and trusts me with everything, and even though she sometimes goes distant for a while, she eventually reconnects and is very emotionally supportive. I’ve tried hinting at my feelings, but she always laughs it off as a joke.

I’m starting to feel emotionally stuck because I don’t want to lose the friendship, but I also don’t know how to move forward.

My question is:
For someone in my situation, what are some healthy ways to approach these feelings while still respecting the friendship? I’m looking for guidance on possible steps or perspectives, not a judgment on whether I’m right or wrong.

ANSWER: > I’ve tried hinting at my feelings, but she always laughs it off as a joke.

She knows it’s not a joke, dude.  She’s not interested.  You need to accept it’s not happening and really focus on meeting other people, even if that means pulling back from her so you can.  And if you can’t handle the idea of letting anyone else into your life because of her, then you need to accept that this friendship is not good for you and walk away.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Me 24M and my gf 22F have problems with her friend


I've been dealing with a situation for almost a year now regarding my girlfriend and her best friend.
My girlfriend and I started dating over a year ago. Before we were officially together, her best friend had a crush on me. Her friend told my girlfriend something very weird…that she was more deserving of a relationship because my girlfriend already has "nice things" in her life. This was despite knowing that my girlfriend and I had feelings for each other.
Once we became a couple, I started noticing concerning patterns. The friend frequently seemed to try to undermine my girlfriend's confidence or make her feel bad. I later found out she was also speaking negatively about me to my girlfriend.
I've tried to have honest conversations with my girlfriend about my worry that this friend is not a positive influence in her life. However, she struggles to hear me out. Even though she acknowledges the friend's difficult behavior, she defends the friendship, saying she feels she is her best friend and that the friend can sometimes be very kind.
We've argued a few times over this. I am concerned that this relationship is negatively affecting her and potentially putting a strain on ours. I'm not sure how to approach this topic anymore without causing a fight, but I feel strongly that she deserves a friend who is genuinely supportive. How to solve that problem?

ANSWER: You need to protect yourself from this friend. Don't ever be alone with her. Make sure to keep any messages as proof. These types of people can be a serious problem.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do you heal from a heartbreak that feels permanently etched into your life? 25 F was in a relationship with 27 M 9 yrs ago.

Is it possible for someone to still feel intense emotional pain many years after being left by someone they deeply trusted? The situation involves a person who was in a serious relationship nearly 9 years ago. The partner ended the relationship because their kundalis didn’t match and moved on quickly, eventually marrying and having a child.

Despite every attempt to rebuild life , career shifts, new environments, focusing on family, trying to move forward but the emotional wound hasn’t healed. This was a relationship where she could finally express her love and trust. Losing that connection has made her feel like she lost herself and her dreams. She has tried to rebuild her life repeatedly, but nothing has worked for her in the past 9 years, and the pain feels so deep that she’s losing the will to keep going.

For people who’ve faced something similar:
How do you heal from something so intense ? What genuinely helps someone forgive themselves, rebuild trust, and find a reason to live again after so many years of pain?
Looking for real, practical advice.

ANSWER: Nine years ago, that person was a child. Dwelling on heartbreak for that long is immature and just kinda sad. She needs therapy, this is way above Reddit's pay grade. That's probably an actual mental health issue.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend told me he’s not in love with me 22F 24M

My 22F boyfriend 24M has said he’s not in love with me

I have been dating my boyfriend for about a year now
Recently he told me that he loves me and feels love for me but he’s not IN love and said that he misses some feelings. He said he’s never been in love despite having past relationships. He still wants a relationship and want to be with me but I don’t know if I can stay with someone who isn’t crazy for me. He described his feelings for me as a really good friend who he’s also attracted to and only wants to do relationships things with. I don’t know if its a good thing to think about a partner as a good friend but on the other hand you’re partner is supposed to be your best friend.

Our relationship has had some ups and downs because he also has a sleep disorder and because of that he’s always very very tired. He said that at days he has some energy he feels excited to talk to me and see me but some days of the week he wants nothing to do with me because of his tiredness.

I honestly don’t know what to do because this hurt me a lot, I love him very much and can’t imagine my life without him right now and really don’t want to break up but it feels like I’m keep begging to be loved. At days he’s energised we never have a problem in the relationship and have so much fun so I really don’t want to lose that. What would you’re advise be?

ANSWER: Being told this is the death knell for any relationship. You need to find someone who loves you properly. Don't settle for less. Don't wait around hoping he changes his mind, because you will end up heartbroken.

You are only a year in, it should still be in the honeymoon phase, if hes said this already, its over.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Im (24m) in a very complicated situation with my gf (21f)

So me (24m) and this girl (21f) have been together for 3 years, like every relationship it was ups and downs and we were like every other couple, we had issues but worked through them and continued together, at some point, she always complained about not feeling loved and whatever i did it was never enough, so she decided to break up with me after one year and half of relationship, after some time we started talking again and we acted like before while staying loyal but we never made it clear if we really were in a relationship or not but we really acted like we were in one.

So time went by and we really acted like a couple so for me we were together but she always said that we are not really together and she is kinda testing me if i was good for her or not, so i kept doing efforts and trying to make her happy but it was never working, it was never enough and she always got mad over things that for me were insignificant or didn’t mean shit to me, so i was always the one apologizing to her and trying to make it up to her

I really was trying to get back with her for real and she always insisted about the fact that we are not really together, and acting like she is single, if someone asked her if she was in a rs she would say no while forcing me to say yes if i got asked, she would accept guys on instagram and if i got mad over this she would say that it’s people she might need or she is forced to socialize with and cannot not accept, while if i accepted some girl i know she would get mad about it and force me to remove her, she used to say that she would never marry me and that im not the one for her, that she finds me boring, she did so many things that made me feel disappointed and disrespected but i tolerated them because i loved her so much and didn’t imagine my life without her.

So recently, we were still in the same dynamic, and and old girl friend from high school added me so i told my girl that i would be accepting her and we argued but i still accepted her and some days went on and we were back to normal, and i dont know how but my gf added my old friend and saw that she posted some bikini pics that i really didn’t see or care about so she started to say that she understood why i insisted on accepting her and that she had to listen to her gut the first time and that she doesn’t wanna hear from me again and she asked me to stop texting her or trying to meet her etc so i tried to explain calmly things to her irl and through text and she ignored everything so i decided to stop reaching out and see what would happen and we didnt talk for 3 days right now.

Im really confused, do you have any advice for me concerning this situation ? Because being in such dynamic gave me stress and anger issues and i just keep losing time while very other important things to deal with, so please help me with your thoughts on this

ANSWER: The only person who’s going to break the cycle is you. It’s gonna hurt like crazy, but it’s gotta be done.

QUESTION: Am i insane ?25M/30F

I think my gf is cheating on me .
She wanted to show me something on her found and I accidentally stumbled across her messenger app where i found she is talking to a guy but since she is speaking her mothertounge with him and the guy as well i could not understand what they were writing, what i noticed is that they were sending in every message kiss emojis and hearts, even if it is a relative its to much. Then i gave her  phone back , after a few minutes i asked for her phone again and after going to massanger app i noticed she has deleted this exact chat only. I assume the chat was open when she got the phone back and paniced then deleted the chat. I searched through her facebook but couldn’t find that they are friends on fb and no likes between each others pics indicating once again that they are not relatives

If she has nothing to hide even if misinterpreted she would have not deleted the chat , at the last she would ask me to use google translate to understand it so that is not an excuse. Comforting her won’t bring the truth out she will of course lie. I assume have to find my own truth in another way

QUESTION: Breakup pain 27F/32M

I [27 F] had been thinking about leaving my boyfriend [32 M] for about a month but finally did it tonight. We were only together about 8 months but I am extremely in love with him. I felt a connection with him I’d never felt with anyone else and he said something similar.

However, he never wanted to commit to me. I would ask him what we were and he never wanted to label it, he said it was okay if I called him my boyfriend but he didn’t feel ready to call me his girlfriend.  I had told him I loved him about 6 months in and he never said it back.

Tonight we had dinner and then I told him I couldn’t keep doing this halfway… I didn’t want to have to convince him to want to be with me. He was clearly caught very off guard. He said he didn’t want to stop talking to me and just because he didn’t want to label things doesn’t mean he’s not passionate about me. I said I didn’t want to stop talking to him either but I’m looking for a real future. I cried and he cried…Then he just packed his things up and left without saying anything else.

I felt like I couldn’t keep waiting for him to commit. I had spent nights agonizing over this, not understanding why he doesn’t want me. But now that he’s gone I feel totally broken inside, like my whole body is breaking. I’m scared I’ve made a huge mistake and that I’ll never find anybody I love like him again. Even when I broke up with my last boyfriend of two years it didn’t hurt like this. How do you deal with pain like this?

ANSWER: Oof, been there. It sucks hard, but you did the right thing for yourself. Time dulls it, even if it feels like it won’t. Focus on yourself, stay busy, and don’t guilt yourself for feeling broken. You’ll heal and you will love again.

================================================================================

QUESTION: my boyfriend (m19) called me (f18) names in a passive aggressive way and i can't stop thinking about it, is there a way to get over it?

So me and my boyfriend have been dating since I was 16, throughout that time whenever he'd lose his temper or become impatient with me he would just blurt out a passive aggressive comment about the situation or about me.

For example, i didn't understand a question he asked me and it took me a while to understand and then randomly said "it's like talking to a brick wall". 

In addition to calling me selfish whilst on our first holiday together because we had 10 mins to get to our dinner reservation and i wouldn't be the one paying for the late fee even though i was ready and dressed to go and he hadn't even gotten dressed. That ruined the whole night for me as i was sat at our table trying not to cry my eyes out and he responded to that as "are you just gonna be in a mood all night" and "well theres my night ruined".

We have talked about it and he has stopped and become alot nicer to be around but I can't help but still feel upset and humiliated whenever I'm around him, i catch myself doing things to prevent a reaction from him, even though theres no reason to.

I just want to find a way to overcome this for me and for him. Any advice would be amazing even if it's something small. Thank you for reading!

ANSWER: >I can't help but still feel upset and humiliated whenever I'm around him  

Then why in the world are you choosing to be around him? A boyfriend should make you feel good about yourself, not upset and humiliated. You need to set some higher standards.

QUESTION: Update: Am I(f22) a crap person for wanting to end my relationship(m23)?

Well, I did it. The break up ended up being very amicable in the end, we both agreed that we let our relationship go on longer then it should have and we should have been more honest with each other with the fact the neither of us were happy or had anything in common.

We talked, it was a pretty short conversation but we figured it out and we can move forward in our lives instead of just holding onto to something that wasn't working anymore and just hurting each other.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (F23) do not enjoy kissing my boyfriend (M26)

I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years now, we’re very happy together and plan on getting married. One thing that bothers me though is that I don’t enjoy kissing him. I love cuddling, forehead and cheeks kisses or little pecks, but actual french kissing disgusts me a little. It started making me nervous about having intimacy with him because when he starts to kiss me the saliva disgusts me and I feel my libido slip away and then I only keep going to please him. I’ve never told him because I’m scared of making him sad, but I think he maybe notices because sometimes during intimacy I purposely avoid his mouth when he tries to kiss me.

I don’t have enough past experiences to say what would cause this, I’ve only been with an other man in the past and I also never enjoyed kissing him either as far as I remember. I don’t think my boyfriend is the problem, he doesn’t disgust me at all, he’s incredibly handsome and I love him with all my heart. I think it’s just the act of kissing in general.

It’s making me feel really guilty because my boyfriend is crazy in love with me and loves every part of me and everything I do, so I feel like I’m not reciprocating that to him. Has anyone ever felt like this?

ANSWER: My ex didn't enjoy open mouth kissing so we just didn't do it much. What mattered to me was that she felt ok saying that to me and could talk about it.

You find a way to make it work when it matters. Talk to him.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I(M30) love my wife(F30) but I feel stuck. What can I do?

My wife and I started dating when we were 17 and a couple months into the relationship she got pregnant.  I never wanted to have kids or be in a long term relationship, but once you have a kid it doesn't matter. 

I thought I had to do it the "right way" so shortly after high school we got married and had a second child. I got locked in on being the best employee possible and I spend all my time out side of work being the best husband and father possible. I am involved in my kids extra curricular activities, I designate one-on-one time with each kid. And make sure my wife never has want for anything. I bought the house she wanted, I got her the car she wanted, and a couple times a year we take a trip just the two of us. And I'm not complaining, even as I kid I always tried my best to keep everyone around me happy. 

I love my wife. She is an amazing mother and I couldn't ask for a better partner in a relationship. My problem is I have an insatiable appetite for sex. I dont drink or use drugs. I never developed any interest or hobbys. I dont even watch porn. She would be fine with "missionary Wednesdays" and I want to try new things but she is not interested. I feel like on paper she wants to do whatever she can to make me happy but she is not comfortable with the things that I actually want. I would never cheat on her and I feel like it would be shallow to leave her just so I can chase my sexual desires. But I don't know what to do. I have been told by several people that I am a good dad and a good husband, but I just feel so... unfulfilled.

ANSWER: Sex is overrated man. I’m sure it’s tough to hear if you’ve only ever had the one partner but trust me whatever you think you want from sex will ultimately be meaningless next to the bond you’ve formed over time with your wife and the family you’ve created. Don’t let the world tell you that you should give in to your lust, you already won the game man. Be grateful for what you have now, it’s better than having sex with any women you’ve ever wanted.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I found out my bf(21m) dated his step sister(22f). I need advice.

Hi, this is my first time on Reddit and idk what I'm doing, but I'm desperate. Me (20f) and my bf (21m) have been dating now for over 2 and a half years. He's everything I could have ever dreamed of until he spilled his biggest secret to me that he dated his step sister(22f). 

For context, he said him and his step sister have known each other since he was 10 and she was 11 or 12. After they graduated highschool they got an apartment together. Eventually she told him she had feelings so one thing led to the next. They dated for 5 ish months and then eventually she cut it off. She told him it would never work out and it would be better to take it to the grave. 

After he told me, I've just been in a state of shock. We have always hung out around her in social settings and family events. Now that I have this context, I feel sick. It's like now I can recall every instance she was possibly being flirty with him or being condescending to my face. She would post pictures of everyone at an event except me. The only pictures of him she'd use for a post are the ones I'm not in. He would talk about having a good time living with her and missing being close with her so I would encourage him to reconnect and talk more one on one at social events. His whole family and even strangers jokecthat me and her look like sisters. I feel like a rebound. I feel like the second best option. The worst part is I can't tell the difference between what's just a coincidence or what corilates to the situation.

Our relationship has been so amazing. He's planned vacations for me and we've discussed marriage. He said he can't propose if he's not honest so that's why he told me everything. He said he wanted to tell me sooner, but he didn't want me to look at him differently. He never talked about it with her and he couldn't talk about with friends or family so he kept it in and never fully processed it. He was trying to act like everything was normal when it wasn't. He doesn't know what to do and being around her isn't healthy for us. He's willing to get couples therapy and individual therapy. He also has OCD so maybe those "unwanted" thoughts or feelings kept coming up because of it. 

I just am not sure what to do and I'm not sure of the situation. He's been patient and receptive to how I feel. I love him more than anything, but I feel so torn and hurt. He suggested that he should tell her I know and that we will be distancing ourselves from her as much as possible, but we would still have to see her at every family event. Idk what the right thing to do is. Does anyone have advice?


EDIT: I feel like I should add more context as to why I'm bothered by the two of them especially his behavior. I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt, but my bf was not over their relationship by the time he started dating me. He admitted a lot of hard truths. Our bedroom relationship was great at the start of dating while we lived in the same apartment as her. We moved out to our own place and our sex has become rocky. He admitted that had to do with the step sister and feeling guilty, but that doesn't fully make sense to me. Also I had long hair that went past my lower back when we met. She has short hair. I told him I was looking for a new look/color and he convinced me to cut my hair short. We have the same hair color and cut now. That's when the "look like sisters" comments from his family started earlier in our relationship. For Halloween we struggled to pick a costume as he wanted to be something he liked too and not just an "accessory" to the gf. We saw her at the Halloween party and she was a siren. We got home afterwards and he drunkenly told me I should be a mermaid next year and he can be "umm whatever goes with that". He said that was because of a mermaid show we've watched together. We were on family vacation with the step sister and apparently she followed him into the house while everyone was outside. She was saying something along the lines of her not liking how I talked to him. When he told me I was very confused because we had never bickered or argued at the time. When we eat dinner anywhere she always wants to be on one side of him while I'm on the other. She was in the car with me and my bf for the 5 hour road trip there when she has her own car. She pulled me aside at her birthday party and asked "Are you going to be okay? Your bf's ex that he talked to for a couple months is here. I invited her but I didn't even think to ask if you'd be comfortable." Also on vacation I asked if my bikini was covering enough so I could be respectful of the family. She then said ,"Well my whole a is out. We're all just family here." And then proceeded to chuckle. The list goes on for situations that can be taken as simple coincidences or I can dig for deeper meaning.

ANSWER: Man that's weird. Step-sister sounds like she's still holding on to your bf a little bit, he may need to talk to her about that. I'd go to couples therapy and see if this is something you can get over. Personally, him saying he wanted to "reconnect" is very deceptive given their history and makes me wonder if they've been doing stuff behind your back...

================================================================================

QUESTION: I am F20 He’s M22 — I’m heartbroken, alone in another country, and I don’t know how to deal with this breakup anymore

My ex ended things about two weeks ago after more than two years together, and I still feel like I’m walking around with a hole in my chest. We didn’t have some explosive breakup. It was more like he slowly disconnected over time, and then one day he just told me he wasn’t happy, that the relationship felt heavy, and that he didn’t see a future with me anymore. Hearing him say he doesn’t love me the same honestly crushed me.

He unfollowed me from everything, removed me, stopped opening my messages… but kept following girl after girl. Not random people girls he actually knows, girls he used to have feelings for, girls he flirted with before. Seeing that happening in real time hurt more than I expected. It made me feel rejected in the most direct way.

The worst part is that I’m living abroad, and I don’t have family or close friends here. So the breakup just… hits deeper. I go to school, I go to the gym, I’m trying to make new friends, I’m trying to stay busy, but when I’m alone at home the sadness gets overwhelming. My mom visited, and even that turned into fights. I’m basically going through this with no emotional support system.

I know our relationship wasn’t perfect. We were both anxious, emotional, reactive, and we triggered each other constantly. I felt abandoned so easily, and he shut down whenever there was conflict. It was a constant push-and-pull, and I ended up depending way too much on him. He became my comfort, my routine, and my safe place. So losing him feels like losing stability.

I’m doing no contact because I know it’s the only thing that protects me right now. But it’s so painful knowing he can just block me out, meet new people, and move on with his life while I’m here struggling. I don’t know how someone can sleep peacefully when the person who loved them is crying every night.

I still love him. I still miss him. And I still have that stupid hope that maybe one day we’ll talk again, especially since I’m going back to Spain for Christmas. But at the same time… I’m terrified. What if he doesn’t care anymore? What if he replaces me with one of the girls he just followed? What if he actually meant it when he said he’s “done”?

I know this is probably just part of heartbreak, but it feels unbearable sometimes. I just needed to get it out of my chest. I don’t know how to let go of someone who was such a big part of my life, even if things weren’t always healthy. I guess I’m just trying to figure out how to be okay again.

ANSWER: unfollow all his shit and just keep living, keep moving, keep meeting people...life will go on and at some point you will start feeling better and meet someone else.

No contact means not looking at his socials to see what he is doing, cut everything.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (f28) needs another perspective on M29 behaviour

I (f28) have been talking to a guy for a couple of weeks. He (m29) doesn't seem to respect my choices. I basically have some rules which I kinda go by. For example one of them is I don't kiss just anyone because I can due to some health issues I usually ask them to get tested at least. Told him this from the very beginning and down the line he came to visit me on his way home and asked me to kiss him, even when i explained the situation he made the comment that "sometimes he also has to win and I have to compromise".  Second time he went around saying we were dating after two weeks of hanging out told him I need time to get to know him and that he shouldn't assume we were dating. For another whole week kept saying we were dating. When he finally stopped he told me I have to give him an answer in three weeks time on my birthday if I want to be his girlfriend or not. Mind you by my birthday it would have been a month of knowing him. I've just lost interest in him
 When i finally sat him down to tell him I am not longer interested because of his lack of respect he said it was expressing himself and challenging my decisions. Would it be better to just move on from this or give him a second chance?

ANSWER: If you have lost interest, as you stated in your post, then I'd say it's best that you move on. 

If within a month you've experienced behavior that's off-putting, imagine being in a long term relationship with this person.

This morning I needed to check an app on his phone because he has an Android phone and I needed to check a Google Play only app, asked and he said yes no hesitation. We share our passwords so I just grabbed the phone sat down and started checking what I needed. My last relationship was with a guy that never let me touch his phone so I even thought 'wow I feel so safe being allowed to grab his phone like this'. It When I went to close the app and instagram message with another woman was opened. This was just one message not a long convo or anything but still it was inviting her to do things lets say. For health circumstances we haven't been doing it more than twice a month and I'm doing all I can with my doctors to fix this asap. He ended up not meeting her and he came back home right after his last message but my whole world crumbled right before my eyes and I don't even know how to function now. I don't know if I should believe him when he tells me this is the first time he does this, or that he's sorry. I want to continue with our relationship and believe him but I'm finding it very hard to find a way to trust again and I'd like some advice.

ANSWER: He is a liar and an attempted cheat. It won’t stay as attempted. Proceed with this knowledge.

QUESTION: Asking for things you want - for everything? (f27/m33)

Hello,

I have a lot of thoughts concerning stuff I see on the Internet all the time. A lot of advice givers be it therapists oder influencers big and small give the advice of being able to ask for things you need (f. Ex i just saw "hey if you want flowers you have to ask for things, no one can read your thoughts") I understand that in theory but I wonder what you all think about how much of the relationship falls into the "if you want it you have to ask DIRECTLY" category?

I struggle a lot with thinking about my last relationship which ended (i broke it off) because the other person did very very few things for the relatiobship (few warm words, no initiative, no romance, no thoughtful gifts, flowers once in 3 years (i asked for those), no cards (i mentioned id like that but didnt get any), no vacay... you get the idea)

Where do yall personally draw the line between asking for what you need bc the other person cant read your thoughts and the idea that this can become "raising someone"/"changing someone imto sth that is not instinctive to them"?

ANSWER: It depends on what you're asking for, and how clearly you communicate. And by communication, I mean you are sure the other person comprehends what you said by repeating what was said in their own words. 

Just saying "I like flowers" doesn't communicate, "I like to be surprised with flower arrangements on special days and for no reason at all."

If you said the second one more than 3 times, then he either didn't care about you, or he's too broke/poor to afford flowers.

So to be clear, you still HAVE to communicate what you want, CLEARLY. You can't just say "I Like x, y ,z" because that’s just a statement. That doesn't tell the other person you like for them to do x, y , z.

QUESTION: I (26F)saw a Facebook Dating notification on my boyfriends (28M) phone

I (26F) saw a notification on my boyfriend’s (28M) phone that said something like:
“Facebook Dating: You’ve caught someone’s attention! Want to connect?”
The image in the notification was of a man. I asked him about it and he said “Oh it happens sometimes but don’t click on it cause I’m afraid it will activate a dating account”. He seemed calm. 

He has never admitted to having Facebook Dating, but when we first started dating, I did notice the Dating icon showing up on his Facebook home screen. Later on, it disappeared, so I assumed he deleted the Dating account once we became official.

Now I’m confused because this recent notification makes it look like the profile is still active. He hasn’t used Facebook Dating (at least as far as I know) for about two years, but he uses Facebook regularly.

My question is: Is it normal for Facebook Dating to send notifications like this if the account was supposedly deleted or not actively being used? Or does a notification like this mean that the Dating profile is still active?

Trying not to overthink, but this feels off in combination with some other things…Has anyone had a similar experience or knows how Facebook Dating works with old or “deleted” profiles?

PS: I would not have any problem finding out that my bf is Bi, but you know it’s different from being on dating apps for men/ women ….

ANSWER: I used to use fb dating years ago when it first launched and I still get notifications every now and again especially when I've been on fb in general browsing marketplace or whatever.

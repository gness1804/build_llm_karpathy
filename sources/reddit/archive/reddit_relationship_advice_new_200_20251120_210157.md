QUESTION: 25/F Mixed Feelings About Guy From Past Reappearing 29/M

Basically I’m 25/F & he’s 29/M now & I had a small fling with a guy 3 years ago. I was 22 & he was 26 at the time. It was an amazing experience in every aspect but I kept it very quite because I wasn’t ready to be public with anyone or commit at the time due to a breakup that had occurred a few months prior. So once I started to feel too emotionally invested & didn’t want to chance anything I kinda bounced. I don’t remember too much of that time it was an emotional blur haha. Fast forward to now he just started working at my job! It was an utter surprise for BOTH of us! It’s all good blood & no tension but wow the feelings it’s kinda brought back for me. 

The first day of his walk through, at the end he walked over to my desk before he left and said he almost didn’t recognize me & WINKED! The next day he had found me in the filing room & said seems like you’re always here, now I know where to find you! When he knows I have an office. For the past week now he’s taken every opportunity to go by my office to either the bathroom & supply closet. NO ONE goes in the supply closet THAT much with 0 supplies in their own office as a result! My office buddy sees it & tells me he’s trying to see me. I don’t see it, It like goes over my head! He’s always smiling and being goofy but I just assume he’s being nice & playful! 

He does have a girlfriend but he didn’t mention her at all today when we worked 1:1 & we talked about everything! We caught up a little & I mentioned I am with a guy I met after him and he made the comment “ wow 3 years I’m surprised you’re not engaged “ my office buddy says he still may have feelings. I may do too…what do you think? My current partner isn’t showing up in our relationship anymore, everything feels really ironic & weird right now.

# URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1p2mu1t/my_partner_24mnb_asked_about_having_an_open/
================================================================================

QUESTION: My partner (24M/NB) asked about having an open relationship to “platonically explore his queerness.” I (25F) don’t know what to do?

He even asked if it would be okay to kiss our HOUSEMATE. (My partner uses he/they pronouns, but I’ll be using strictly he/him to help the story make sense)

We’ve been together for over three years, and have officially been living together for four months. He dated others before me, I didn’t date anyone (simply wasn’t interested). We are both bi, it should be noted that he only dated girls before me though - no boys or enbys.

We got a housemate two months ago (28NB). They’ve been great so far. My partner and them have become very good friends and sometimes stay up late at night hanging out. I don’t mind the housemate, but I struggle with making new friends because I’m autistic. Sometimes my partner will take their side over mine whenever I talk about house issues, which hurts.

A few nights ago, I woke up at 4am and realised my partner wasn’t there. I panicked and went looking around the house, only to find him sitting outside with our housemate. There was a bong sitting next to them. This irritated me a little, but I know I got out-voted on household “weed policies” (the scent of weed makes me nauseous so I wanted to keep this a weed-free household, but my partner insisted I let the housemate smoke it) so I didn’t bring it up.

I told my partner to come to bed NOW because it was ridiculously late, and we both had work in the morning. My partner came to bed, and was a little silent. I asked if he was high, he said no and asked “would it matter?” I think he was lying about it, but I didn’t press.

We’ve been in a bit of a rough patch lately anyways, over an argument with his parents. But last night, he asked to talk. I thought it would be about his parents. Turns out, he was telling me about how when he was outside at night with our housemate, he had an “ego death” and started crying, and our housemate “held him close” and comforted him. I don’t know why he felt the need to tell me this.

He then started talking about how cool our housemate is, and how they’re like an “elder queer.” Then he said he wishes he could kiss a friend or someone else “platonically” to “explore his queerness.” THEN he asked if he could kiss our HOUSEMATE. He says he “wouldn’t mind having an open relationship.”

I just sat there, shocked. This is awful. I asked why I wasn’t enough? He said I was, and that he loves me, and that it would just be a kiss. I said if it’s “just a kiss,” that he can kiss ME. I said if he wants to physically explore his queerness, why not ask to have sex with someone else, instead of just a kiss? 

I said there are other ways he can explore queerness. I said if he’s craving intimacy like his “ego death” situation, then he should try hanging out with his friends more. I said if he’s just craving something new in his life, he should find a new hobby or go travelling somewhere. I said if he wants more sex, I can try to give it to him.

He said he just wants me to think about it. He went to work this morning and we acted like nothing happened. He is not home from work yet.

I’m devastated and feel sick. I’m thinking of telling him that he can do whatever, as long as it’s not in the house, but it would be his secret to keep forever. But then I know that I would spend every day wondering if he was out doing things with other people, and it would drive me insane. I want to kick out our housemate over this, even though I haven’t heard their side of the story. But we can’t financially afford that, and maybe I’m being rash.

I am so hurt. This has really ripped open all of my insecurities. I feel like I am too autistic and awkward and uncool for him, and that it’s so bad, he wants to see other people. 

I never thought he would suggest anything like this, I thought we were both totally secure. I moved away from my family to be with him here. 

I don’t even know what advice to ask for. This is just the worst situation and feels like a bad dream. How do I deal with this?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (28f) therapist thinks I'm not compatible with my husband (30m)

My husband and I are high school sweethearts. We have been married for 3 years now and have lived together for 8 years.
I've been in therapy for about a year and a half now and just recently (May) opened up to my therapist about relationship concerns.
My concerns were mostly about his unpredictable mood and the feeling that I was walking on eggshells because I never knew what little thing would set off his bad mood. He has never ever even threatened physical abuse and I feel completely safe in that sense. 
In May I spoke to him and told him he either got therapy and a psychiatrist or I had to leave for my own well being. He agreed and signed up for both by September.
He's been improving. He overall controls his mood and when he does have those moments of speaking harshly to me or being mean about a situation, I'm able to let him know and he apologizes. He is definitely improving, but I still spend every day wondering when I'll set it off. I think it's because it's been only a few months of improvement vs the 12 years of being an emotional punching bag (as my therapist says).
 I know if I got the therapy I'm in now years ago I would not have married him. But now we are married and I feel like I have a commitment to stay while he figures his shit out. To give him grace on his bad days because he is working on himself.
My therapist pointed out ways we were not compatible like him not being as romantic as I want, or us having very different interests - we usually spend our time together doing different things- or him not spending time with my extended family if he can be doing something else. He also doesn't participate in anything creative and I'm a very creative person. He doesn't like to be outside because he's outside for his job so we spend all of our time indoors.
In some ways we are very compatible. We love to watch a lot of the same media, we have the same political views, we have the same love of animals, we make each other laugh a lot, we share parenting views. 
I have brought up problems to him and been more open about what I need and he's receptive for 90% of the time. And when he's not he eventually comes around after we talk. 
I don't know if I leave now because of how he's previously treated me or because of how he occasionally treats me now, or if I stick around and stay by his side while he becomes a better version of himself. If I help him become a better version of himself. 
Context on my life, I had a very rough childhood and spent the first 18 years of my life (and the first 3 of our relationship) very very repressed and traumatized. I moved straight from that home life to a house with him. 
Please help me. Can we be compatible? should we be?

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (30f) end my potentially toxic long-distance relationship (35m)?

Hey there! Me (30f) and my bf (35m) have been doing long-distance for about 4 months. When we were re-introduced at a birthday weekend, it felt like he was it and he certainly thinks I’m it for him. Things moved super fast and because we’re older, I guess I thought that went with the territory of dating in your 30s. He’s also related to one of my very best friends, so I didn’t treat this as carefully since I’ve known him vaguely over the years. We’ve been treating the relationship like we’re for sure in it for the long run. However, leading up to this visit, I’ve been picking up on what I would call “pink flags”.

He’s really educated, hilarious, HOT, and we align on a lot of beliefs, however, he’s got some demons that tend to rear their heads after drinking. Basically, I don’t like the way he speaks to me after having a couple, and I’m not one to back down from confrontation. In August, we were in the same city at the same time for different reasons and he completely ghosted after having gotten too drunk with his family the night before and nursing hangxiety. We moved past that but I’ve held a sense of distrust since. When I went to go visit him in his city the last time, we got into an drunken argument over the way he was speaking to me, and I left the bar only to not see him again til the morning because he went home and passed out. I met some really awesome people who took me under their wing for the night and we had a great time, but I would’ve been stranded had I not.

The last time he visited, he met my parents and everything went well, but I think my feelings have slowly been turning away and in my gut I know this isn’t right. On this current visit, it’s been butting heads a lot, and we had a full-blown argument on our way back from what had been a nice day out. I just don’t think it’s healthy or normal to have that much conflict in such a short amount of time.

I’m having a hard time figuring out what to say to him though for a couple of reasons. When we re-met, my dad had been going through chemo and his mom is having to adapt to a life with Alzheimer’s, so safe to say we trauma bonded. Next visit is supposed to be in a couple of weeks and I’m supposed to meet his parents. I don’t think it’d be right for me to do so if I’m not so sure about the relationship anymore. He’s here in my town for one more day and I’m panicking because I feel I should have the hard conversation before he leaves. Or if I wait, I still don’t know how to word it because I do genuinely care for him and I know he’s going to be heartbroken. I’d like to try and stay on good terms since we’ll be seeing each other at two weddings next year, which are important to the both of us.

================================================================================

QUESTION: in a dilemma, i am M24 and she is 22F we are in love but should we end it?

so I'm in a dilemma, so I'm with this girl (22F) that I've been with since February, she is loving, caring, god fearing Catholic, with an amazing personality and she is beautiful and basically everything i've ever wanted in a woman besides a slight increase in some maturity but I'm older with military experience so I can't expect her to be on the same page as I am.  In the future, I'm (24) wanting to go to grad school in a different state due to the fact I've lived here my entire life, I'm getting my bachelors here and to top it all of I got stationed here in my time in the military and all in all I just know there is more to life where I'm living at. also most important fact is I have to move out of my city due to the fact that the program I want is not offered here, so its a non negotiable that I have to leave. 

my issue is that she's a family woman who doesn't want to move away from her family, her whole life is here, her friends, her job, and her involvement at the church we go to is heavy. she said she's had a dream of wanting to take her kids to grandmas house and be in the general area around where we currently live. I don't want to break up with her and we've already had this convo where we basically told ourselves "we're doomed aren't we". I don't want to take her away from her family because it seems unfair to her, due to the convo we already had she doesn't want to move either, and I don't want her to get sad/depressed like her sister did with her husband to the point where they moved back in the area. I don't know what life is gonna be like for me so I can't make promises to her about how hers is going to be either. her entire life is here and mine is wanting to be somewhere else.

I'm confused on what to do. I graduate a year from now and then after that I have to go somewhere else for school fall 2027. I don't want to break it off but I can't give her what she wants in this life. it would be unfair of both of us for either one to give up what they want. its gonna hurt worse if I keep it going then we end up breaking up because of this anyway. honestly my head is spinning and I don't know what to do, do I hold out and wait to see if her answer changes or do we break things off soon? we talked about the future and she did say a nonnegotiable for her was that she wasn't gonna leave her house without a ring.

  
also important things to know I've never felt safer in a relationship, she tolerates my BS, her family loves me, she's a hairstylist that does a lot of the people in my life's hair, we lost a couple friends due to the circumstances we got together in (we didn't cheat or anything like that), she's very patient, has a amazing motherly instinct, has some amazing qualities I'll keep to myself, and she's not crazy despite being hispanic lol and the women in my culture tend to have a reputation for stressing people out

and like ive gave up major things in the past for relationships, like for example I had the chance to live in Japan for 3 years and didn't bc of an ex (which is now married) I stayed for  for example. so im hesitant and confused about what to do next bc my mind is jumping back to "do I put myself first or do I put us first"

  
do I hold on or do I let go? I'm really not wanting to let go but my future is somewhere else

================================================================================

QUESTION: 33F 35M affair partner 44F Cheated on for 3 months straight, 2 yrs together, Horrible treatment towards me. Need advice, plz read?

been with my fiance for 2 years. I found out in August this year that he had been cheating on me since June. I didnt know the extent of it until September. He found her on a dating app, shes 44 years old, hes 35 and I’m 33. They had been talking every single day since June and started seeing each other consistently in July. I even found out that the new paintball team member he was playing with every weekend who was 17 years old, whom he would send me pictures of them together all the time, was actually her son. 

In August we got into a huge argument because I found a box of condoms in his truck, we didnt use condoms. He lied saying they were for us because he wanted to practice safer sex. I immediately knew he was lying. He got physical with me that night, I rushed towards him because I was so upset yelling at him, and he shoved me so hard 3 separate times that I went flying across his apartment and smacked my entire body on his hardwood floor face down, he shoved me again and I flew over his couch I literally saw stars. Then we got into a pushing match and he held me in a choke hold on the floor, laying on his back and I was on my back on top of him.

He said I couldnt come to his apartment anymore because the neighbors complained about the loud yelling. About a week later, I came over to talk about things and he was getting ready to go on a date. He told me he was about to go to the laundry mat and that the laundry mat was “super busy” at like 6 pm, something in my gut told me he was lying so I showed up unnanounced. He freaked out and said he was going out with the boys to the bar. I said no you’re not. He said fine, I’m going on a date. I begged him not to go, he walked out to his car and I got into his passenger seat. He came around and scooped me out of the car and we both fell onto the pavement. I walked back to my car crying and he came to my window and said “If you’re still here when I get back I’ll call the cops. If we’re meant to be together then we will be.” 

He said he only saw her once after that night, but turns out she said that was like their 20th date. He told me he left her in the movie theater that night because he felt so guilty and immediately tried to call me. That was also a lie, because she said she went home with him that night, they slept together and stayed in bed drinking coffee all morning (found this out days later). 

I woke up to an email from him the next day saying he was so sorry, that he needs me, loves me and made a huge mistake. I took him back. He told me the name of the woman he was seeing and I found her social media. I asked her how long he’d been sleeping with her and she told me “multiple times a week since July” she didnt know about me, he told her I was a crazy ex and that we broke up a year ago. Not true. The entire month of September she said he told her they were exclusive but that was a lie because we were obviously still seeing each other too, although he said he was “busy” more and barely put any effort into our relationship, it became more just about sex for him and no emotion. After he found out me and her had been talking, he “chose” me and said he’d stop talking to her. This was in October. That weekend I went over to his place for a few days and he made comments like “Dont start arguing with me, dont make me regret my decision.” I was so mad. 

He made so many backhanded comments blaming me for his cheating, saying he was unhappy and thats why he cheated, telling me details about their sex life - how she gave him better sex, how she felt better and tasted better, how she gave him massages, was more sensual, and how she touched him lovingly and tenderly unlike me. We got into 3 arguments about the affair that weekend, he would flip from crying in my lap saying how sorry he was, how it should have never happened, to being angry that I kept bringing it up. At 2 am when he was sleeping right next to me, he texted her saying “we got into a fight again, I think I made the wrong choice. can I see you again?” She said she’d tell me he said that, so when I woke up he confessed to sending her that text. I called her on his phone and begged her to block him and she refused saying she feels like he has more to say to her and that she feels like the victim in all of this. 

He promised me he wouldnt talk to her anymore, I told him if he does we’re over. A couple days later, I asked her if he was still talking to her, she said yes. He denied it. When I confronted him that she said they were, he says “I asked her to meet up with me tomorrow, I need to know if I’m making the right choice. I dont want to regret this for years. I’m sorry it sucks but its true.” I told him we’re over and he said “Ok I wish you the best.” A week later, he sends me 24 text messages proclaiming his love for me, that he “made a mistake and that we’re soulmates, saying she isnt my person, you are a part of my soul. I’m coming over right now to pick you up (at 6 am) to get my heart and soul. I love you too much to keep effing this up.”

I got into his car and he was super sexual with me immediately. Making out with me, etc. I was like what is going on? He told me she was just using him, seeing other guys and just wanted to “win”. She called him while we were in the car talking about this. I knew something wasnt right. We got to his place and he started acting really shady, pacing around and acting agitated. He told me he needed to take the call, he goes outside in the hallway, I open the door and see him texting her. He comes back inside and says “This was a mistake. We need to go now. It was a misunderstanding, she says she wants me and only me.” I said what is a misunderstanding?? He said “she saw me on bumble the other day but his profile was on snooze.” Bull. I know he was on the dating apps still cuz he said he saw me on there too while we were talking in the car.

He said “Get your stuff now. I need to take you back home.” I asked him if she was telling him to do that and he said yes. Unbeknownst to me, he started recording our conversation for her on his phone. We get into his truck and he said (while recording for her) “I want to be with you but I want to be with her more.” I said “Are you so smitten by her that you’re willing to throw away our love after 2 years?” he said “Yes.” I said “You dont have a future with her. She already has 3 grown kids. What are you gonna do? Have a baby with her and when the kid is 5 she’ll be 50?” he said “Maybe!” I was crying and heartbroken. He was furiously texting her the entire time, and took a picture of the freeway for her to prove he was driving me home. I said “can you please stop texting her the entire drive home out of respect for me?” He said “Yeah one sec.” and continued to do it the entire 40 min drive.

I said “What about the 24 text messages saying we were soulmates and that she wasnt your person??” He said “I thought I meant it but I dont know now.” I said “I loved you with my entire soul. I cant believe you’re doing this to me.” He said “Do you really mean that?” I said “Yes!” I got out of his car, he grabbed his gnomes that he kept in my front yard and left. I didnt hear from him for a week again, I contacted him to come get his stuff he left in my garage. He said he thinks about me every night, that he’s still in love with me. I asked him if he’s really happier with her and he said hes not happy. I told her all of this and she didnt believe me, she said next time record the call or I wont consider it. She started getting really rude with me so I just said whatever, you can have him, hes a habitual liar. 

He even lied to her in a group chat between the 3 of us saying he never kissed me or did anything sexual with me in the truck that day he picked me up. Literally lied to my face for her when he knew what really happened (more than kissing). Then, he told me he got a new promotion at work and is making a lot more money now and she was going to take him out this past monday to celebrate. Well, that was a lie too because she told me no, monday was her birthday and he was taking her out. She said they’re going to see each other every thursday and friday for the forseeable future. He said in the group chat, “I’m sorry I hurt you, I feel guilty, I do care about you but I care about her too and need to see if its real. I’ll let you know one way or another.”

I saw so many pictures, naked pics of her etc on his secret phone that I didnt even know he had. He would send me the same naked pictures of himself to both of us. I saw the loving texts her sent her saying he wanted to be in bed with her rubbing her back again, how amazing and perfect she is, etc. He told me he “loves us both and wants to be with both of us.” He would have sex with both of us on the same day sometimes. For months he would see her on saturday and me on sunday. I am disgusted.

He didnt do anything for our 2 year anniversary in August. I asked him if he got me flowers, he laughed and said yeah they’re at the store. Yet when she left him for a few days after finding out about me, he sent her a huge bouqet of flowers to her door.

A couple months ago he lied and told me he went to the mountains with his guy friend, said there wouldnt be service there so he couldnt use his phone. Called me that morning and said his guy friend was about to be there and that he loved me. Turns out he actually took her to the mountains that entire weekend. I have blocked both of them. It seems like he just assumed I would always be there waiting for him whenever he gets done with her. The way he treated me was so horrible and heartbreaking. I dont understand it. He went from someone that loved me to such a cruel person. I need some advice please?

TLDR; Cheated on for 3 months straight after 2 years together. He fell in love with both of us. So many lies. He was extremely cruel to me and still kept saying he was in love with me. She is 44, he is 35. I am 33.

ANSWER: Why are you still with this guy? He’s not a prize worth fighting over. He assaulted you and shits on you, and you still want to be with him? Have some self respect and move on. He’s just going to continue abusing you. You can do better than this piece of garbage. Updateme

QUESTION: (F22) unsure if i should reject guy (M21) im seeing

i’ve (F(21) been seeing this guy M(21) for two weeks now. we met on a dating app and chatted there for a bit & it was going well. we texted for about a week and i asked him we should go out because it felt like we were texting too long so we eventually met up for drinks. on our first date it was pretty good, we talked about for 2 hours. held hands, flirted a bit and we got to know each other pretty good during our first time meeting..
i had a good time our first time meeting
but would notice i would ask questions more then he would & there would be occasional awkward silence, but it wasn’t too bad… we said our goodbyes and held hands then parted ways. 

we ended up texting more for another week & would call/play video games together throughout the week. sometimes there would also be occasional silence on the phone too. it did bug me… but i would always bring up topics so it wouldn’t be as awkward? .. because tbh, when i didn’t we would sit in silence for like 20 seconds. sometimes he would bring topics up but it would be after it got so silent after a while.

we ended up eventually seeing each other again. on date 2. i did initiate meeting again soon because i wanted to see him. and he said he gladly wanted to, so we did. we went out to get tea at a cafe, & it was pretty fun i would say but i would notice, …again that i would ask more questions then him. he does ask me things back too a bit… but i would say i ask more. like 60/40… we did joke & banter a lot & during our date & i like that about him, he also brought me flowers and kissed me on the cheek. he seems like a good guy. i just don’t feel emotionally connected to him.. since i’ve done most of the  initiating, topic carrying, conversation-starting, and most of the “when can we see each other”.
he’s very consistent, gives nice gestures and we have the same relationship beliefs but i feel like he doesn’t pursue me enough? & there’s not more i want you energy. i’m not sure.. im just used to high emotional energy chasing me when it comes to men.
he’s not doing anything wrong per say .. i just don’t feel like, oh he wants me or relaxed…

TL;DR: unsure if i should reject guy IM talking to

================================================================================

QUESTION: Me (34M) and my girlfriend (32F) of 5 years can’t see eye to eye on me having female friends.

Hey, so I want to give some context first. My partner and I have been together for 5 years, and we recently moved to a new city where we don’t really know anyone. She has used Bumble BFF and MeetUp etc to meet people and has made some new friends and they’ve all been female (I’ve never known her to have male friends). I, however, have been a bit slower to put myself out there. I’ve had lots of different friendship groups over the years and they have always been mixed. So I want to carry that forward. I have mostly male friends now in different places, but I’ve had female friends before. To me, especially now that I’m in my 30s, it doesn’t matter who/what you’re friends with it’s just about staying close to the people you feel comfortable and connected to.

So my GF told me to try out Time Left where you meet up for dinner with a group of strangers, and then with the app you can choose to connect with anyone you got along with. 

Before I even went to it my GF asked if I would mind if women were there, and I obviously said no - and she said it would be a boundary of hers that she wouldn’t feel comfortable me forming any one-to-one friendships with women. She doesn’t mind that women will be there in a group setting, but just wouldn’t feel comfortable me connecting with any individual women. This wasn’t a shock to me - because even if I go visit one of my closest male friends and we end up hanging out with their female partner my GF gets stressed and upset about that too. My best friend (M), who has been with his GF for 9 years, even has a female gym buddy and my girlfriend said that’s weird too.

So basically, I went to the dinner and it ended up being mostly dudes, but there was one women. You’re all strangers, so it’s pretty awkward - but some are trying harder than others, and some do loosen up over the course of the evening. So you do ultimately end up leaving the evening with a good understanding of who was cool, and who was maybe slightly too odd…

Sorry if this is sounding like an ad for the app! But I can tell you that a slightly barbaric element kicks in the next day where you basically rate everyone you went to dinner with on a 1-5 scale. 1 being “didn’t like, never want to see again” and 5 being “they were great I want to see them asap!”

This kinda felt judgey and weird, so I gave two of the dudes I didn’t get along with a 3 which basically means “don’t match me, but I don’t mind if I see them again at another dinner” and I gave the rest including the women a 4 which means “match me and I’m happy to go to dinner with them in another group” (hope this is all making sense).
The people I gave 4s to was purely down the fact they put in the effort, had great chat, and we had a proper giggle with each other (but they weren’t quite 5s).

So I’m always honest, and also I was slightly reeling by how weird it felt rating people I just met on a 1-5 scale, and I told my partner what I had done and she completely hit the fucking roof. To be clear, her boundaries weren’t established knowing about the rating system, that was news to her too - so I didn’t feel like I had done anything wrong by just using the app.

It got super intense and she told me to get out of the flat because I clearly didn’t listen and I didn’t respect her boundaries. I told her if the tables were turned and it was her using the app and she did the same with some guys I wouldn’t give a shit because she’s ultimately just putting herself out there and seeing how the app works - but she just doubled down on the boundaries argument, so I said that maybe it’s my boundary that I’m in a relationship where i can be friends with anyone without any rules about who I can cannot be friends with and she said that’s selfish and not what being in a relationship is about…

Sorry for the essay! But I’m sleeping on the sofa tonight writing this and my mind is jumping between if I’m just not being considerate towards her emotions and anxieties, or if I’m just not recognising abusive behaviour?

================================================================================

QUESTION: 28M finds out his 29F now ex-girlfriend has been talking to her previous BF who has been engaged for a year and getting married soon claiming he should’ve chose her instead

I have been dating this girl for almost two years, she previously told me that an ex she previously had feelings for was reaching out to her saying he proposed to the wrong person and that it should be her. We were still new at the time and she explained that this happened before we met and assured me it was nothing and she hasn’t heard from him. 

We were on and off for a while and when we started talking again she informed me that he was still asking her to hangout on three separate occasions clearly without the knowledge of his VERY soon to be wife. They’ve now been engaged for over a year and are planning to get married soon and I feel so bad for this poor girl who is his fiancée. 

I tried to slide in his DMs to let him know that what he’s doing whether im with this girl or not anymore (I was at the time of the DM) is horrible to do to his fiancee to which he clearly ignored and won’t allow me to follow him to let this girl know she is about to ruin her life committing to someone who already does not want to be with her. I put myself in her shoes and I would want to know if it was me and clearly it wasn’t one moment of weakness since this has been ongoing for a year. 

His name is Matt DiCarlo of Long Island, what are some ways in which we can find a way to contact the fiancee to let her know what’s been going on behind her back?

================================================================================

QUESTION: my boyfriend (22m) doesn’t want to have sex with me anymore (22f)

ive been dating my boyfriend for more than four years. in our first year of dating, we’d see each other about 4/7 days of the week and have sex twice a day that he almost always initiated. we moved in together about two years ago, and now he initiates sex maybe once every two weeks. 

he does generally have a hard time with initiative in his personal life, but i can’t help but feel that im just not new and interesting to him anymore. we’ve talked about this issue EXTENSIVELY and tried to fix it many many many times, but it just never goes through. ive told him how i feel (unwanted, sad), tried to figure out what he needed, etc etc. on top of that, it’s always me bringing up the issue and trying to solve things. 

i’ve just lost hope and feel like my boyfriend will never be interested in me the way he used to. i’m young (22) and i know this sounds egotistical but i am really decently good looking. i’m pretty, skinny, and quite fit. i feel really sad that i’m good looking now and it’s not enough for him. i want him all the time, i would say i have quite a high sex drive, but it hurts to be the only one initiating. can anyone tell me what might be going on from his end or give me general advice on how to get through this?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I’m (31F) thinking of leaving my partner (31M) after 15 years

I am 31F and my partner is 31M, we have been together since we were 16. 

I have felt unhappy for the last year; when I look back I feel I have been somewhat unhappy for longer than that. I remember having feelings of doubt as long as 9 years ago, but they always seemed to be phases that we pushed through and things always got better and sorted themselves out. However things seem to have got progressively worse, and now I’m at a stage in life where I am starting to worry about my future and about wasting time. I’m worried in case I regret it, and he’s all I’ve ever known. But I can’t shake the feeling that we aren’t right for each other anymore. 

It’s difficult because he’s a nice guy, he’s never cheated as far as I know, he has a good career, he’s a good person. But lately I feel like we have grown to be different people. He’s desperate for children; I assumed I would want kids by now, but I’m 31 and still feeling unsure about it. I don’t yet have the desire to, but I’m an only child and fear I’ll live a lonely life if I don’t have children. But I don’t want that to be a reason to have children. I worry I still won’t have a desire to have children in a few years time, and I don’t want to waste his time or hold him back from what he wants from life either. 

He is quite negative, lets things get him down/angry really easily, and everything is the end of the world. I feel like he is constantly snapping at me and talking to me like shit over small things. I am more positive and easy-going, if small things go wrong and there’s nothing we can do about it, I have more of an ‘oh well’ mindset and prefer to laugh about it. I don’t let things stress me out, but he projects stress onto me and I feel it’s affecting my wellbeing. 

I cook and clean more often than him, but if we have a busy week or so and housework piles up a bit, I am chilled and easy-going about it, it doesn’t bother me, I just get on top of it when I have time. He lets it get to him, and whenever he does do housework he gets angry at me and snaps or makes constant digs, I feel it’s because deep down he doesn’t feel like he should be doing it, despite us both working full time. It makes me feel unappreciated for the work I do around the house. It’s like he’s a clean freak and is unhappy if the house isn’t spotless, but also doesn’t feel he should be the one to do it. And I can’t help but feel like this situation will be worsened by having kids, me having more work to do and him feeling even more so that it should be my responsibility, and me being on the receiving end of frustration and digs if the house isn’t spotless after a stressful day of looking after a child.

I also like to go out and have a good time. Not particularly regularly, not even once a month, but I like spontaneous plans and feel I am quite a ‘live in the moment’ kind of person. He used to be up for a good time too, but now less so. I’m a big family person and we have a lot of family parties; these days he always wants to leave earlier and gets angry if we stay half an hour later than planned. And if I do have a night out with a friend, he’s over the last couple of years started to make judgemental comments or show signs of controlling behaviour. He will try to shame me or call me immature/say I need to grow up, and say I can’t be doing this when we have kids etc. This summer, he went away on 3 trips with friends, 2 of which were abroad. I didn’t say anything about him going, I didn’t mind at all. But one day I decided to go to London for one night with a friend to watch a football match; they asked me as the person they were meant to be going with was unwell. My partner had just been away for 4 days himself, yet he absolutely flipped his lid and starting trying to guilt trip me into not going. Saying he can’t believe I’m choosing this over my partner, he wanted to spend time with me as he’d just got back (despite us having made no plans and him being off work for the next week so we would still be able to spend time together when I got back), his parents would be upset if they knew I was doing this to him etc. The texts went on for hours and hours, and I was so shocked at how he was acting. Even afterwards he refused to accept he had been unreasonable about it. It gave me serious doubts, as again I feel like if I have children I’m going to be being shamed and guilt-tripped if I want to go out and see friends. He claims he would never be like that, but I just feel like his actions in recent times show otherwise. I don’t want to be stuck in at home miserable with all this extra responsibility and not have a partner that supports me and wants me to have a break and have fun too.

I have communicated these issues to him for several years now, but nothing has changed, if anything it’s got worse. And I feel that it has now changed the way I feel about him. We don’t seem to laugh together as much anymore, I’m not as enthusiastic about spending quality time together, and I’ve stopped feeling attracted to him or wanting to have sex with him. I told him this a few months back, and that I thought we might be best splitting up as we seem to have grown apart and perhaps aren’t well suited anymore. All of a sudden now he’s crying, begging me to try, saying he’ll kill himself if I leave, he’s sorry he hasn’t shown how much he loves me, he thought I’d always be here, saying I need to put the effort in to make it work rather than giving up etc. It’s like they always finally take you seriously when it’s too late. He has now gotten some anti-depressants, and I have noticed him making some positive changes and things are a bit better. He’s done some sweet things like buy me some thoughtful gifts and bring me home flowers, but I am struggling to feel any different, and the issues we had are still there (e.g. I went out with a friend I haven’t seen for a while the other day and he made a couple of digs about it, though tried to pass them off as just jokes; and I’m still getting snapped at here and there about housework). I fear my feelings are too far gone now.

I feel guilty leaving him, and I don’t want to give up on a 15 year relationship. But I don’t know how long to keep trying before I give up, as I’m worried about wasting time given my body clock and my dilemma about whether I want kids or not. When I think about actually leaving I start to feel sad, I think about all the memories we’ve shared together and worry I’ll regret it and ‘the grass isn’t always greener’. We also are suited on a lot of other aspects. We have similar interests and hobbies, neither of us are very materialistic, we’re aligned politically and have the same values, I’m vegan and he’s always been very supportive of it, etc. He’s generous and can be really good fun when he’s in a good mood. We know each other inside out and feel incredibly comfortable together. 

I guess I’m just looking for advice from others who have been in long relationships and had similar experiences. Did you stay and manage to work things out for the better? If you left, how did you find it and are you happy you did?

ANSWER: Congratulations 🎉🎊🍾 on your upcoming freedom.  Have fun and be safe 👍

================================================================================

QUESTION: Me- 27F and my husband, 30M.

Me- 27f and my husband- 30M have been together for 7 years and I am thinking about asking him if we can open the relationship for specific sex only.- and here's why- 

I will try to make this short, It just feels like alot of details. I'm so sorry. 

Im not satisfied with our sex life but I am with our relationship. 

For the time we have been together everything is great. I truly feel like he is my soulmate and my best friend. We are totally in sync and theres no issues emotionally. We have great communication. 

But sex is.. showing more and more like.. we need more? 

He is completely submissive and wants a hard domme. I do like a large part of it, and do feel like that part of what i want to do- and how we both want to experience sex is full,  but the problem is, 

we rarely have sex. 

I know I can use him like a toy- as he wants- and I have done other things but there's never a time where we simply just have sex and enjoy the other. I never get railed. I almost never get more then ate out. I stay really focused doing things to him.

I call him my pillow princess. And as a domme I love it but not always in a domme mind set. 

And I think its feeling like I cant ever step out of being in charge.

I am not a full domme.
I am a switch, and he is a full sub. 

I miss having the Mario coins knocked out of me. I miss being used too. I miss feeling like my partner just needs me to feel good and wants this specific position or angle right at this moment. 
I miss feeling desired in this way? Im trying to explain the feeling I have. I think its just me being a switch and wanting to be more then a domme. 

My husband doesnt really care for sex- I'll peg him or other things and I just miss being able to switch into other roles.

 So we have talked about it. 

And he wants to try to bang some coins out for me but I cant get comfortable enough to allow it because it absolutely is him doing it only for me and like hes suffering through it. And not in a fun way? He just doesnt want to dispointment me along with him being submissive and wanting to please me. But him not wanting it is like its not his favorite. Top ten on his list its at like at 2 or 3. And even then its not how I want sex. He is really out of pratice for it and when I allow it its just.. its not in rhythm. Its not hard. He doesnt stay hard long. It doesnt cum easy- but he looses his boner. And its just not how i want it. 

We talked about having someone for sex- because of kinks on either side. But we've never done it- I honestly dont want someone like a random bar hook up. If im doing this, I want to not be disappointed. 

It may sound silly but I want a professional. But even when visiting places where buying these services are legal- they never have men on the menu. 

I dont know where to go- what to do- how to go to the next step? We dont know how to fix this without an outside help.

================================================================================

QUESTION: (M20) How do I tell my gf (F21) for 5 years that I can't handle our relationship anymore?



Before I start, I would like to say that this all is my fault 100%. She have done absolutely nothing wrong. I know I am at fault for deteriorating our relationship and I will not make any excuses for my actions.  

We have been dating for 5 years (currently last year of university). She is a fantastic human being, I genuinely from the bottom of my heart love her. I can't think of a single thing she did that is morally wrong or unacceptable. I am so mad at myself these recent weeks for having thoughts about ending our relationship. 

We share a common religion, political beliefs, we travelled to many countries together, she knows my family and my family knows hers. Words cannot describe how good of a girlfriend she is to me. 

My friends, her friends, and herself think that we are in a perfect relationship, set out for lifetime but deep down, I know this relationship isn't for me but I can't explain why.

The past 6-8 months I have been trying to distance myself from her. It all started when we were hanging out like we have done for the past 5 years but she started crying really badly talking about how much she appreciate my presence in her life. I think that I'm not good enough for her and starting on that day, I just cannot talk to her the same way.

Its so so difficult to explain this feeling. Her background is very, very sad, she is a survivor of suicide and SA and have a lot of issues with her family. She was still going through these struggles when she met me but her life did a complete 180 when she met me, and so did my life. Now, she even make jokes about her past (which honestly I don't think she should be doing). I think the crux is that I can't be responsible and mature enough for her to be dependent on me. When she cried Infront of me, I felt how important I am in her life and I just can't hold that weight. 

Since that day, I am just sacrificing myself to make her happy, thinking that our relationship is still going great. I know how bad this is and I'm really angry at myself for this. On a weekly basis, I would have the urge to SH thinking about how horrible of a person I am manipulating her in this relationship. 

My friends are rightfully mad at me too for the same reasons. I'm not going to make excuses for my actions because I can't. If I straight up tell her the feelings I feel, I know she cannot take this and might resort back to her struggles. If she does, I don't know how I am going to live.

================================================================================

QUESTION: i (f22) feel like I’m not able to have empathy and my girlfriend (f23) thinks i don’t care. how do i fix this and show her i care?

my gf (F23) and I (F22) have been together for 2 years. over the years she has expressed that when she feels down or sad or any negative emotion, she feels like i don’t care. this is not the case, i care so much and i love her with all my heart. she says i am not empathetic and instead of comforting her when she’s upset i just get frustrated. i don’t know why i do this. it’s super hard for me to be around people who aren’t happy because it makes me not happy. i guess i kind of take on their emotions (which i guess is kind of empathy) however i can never put myself in their shoes or understand what it’s like for them. 

my gf has told me over and over what she needs when she feels down but i seem to forget everything when she actually feels that way. and even when she asks me to comfort her in the time she feels bad, i instead get stubborn and can’t even comply. it’s not that i don’t care, i just sort of feel uncomfortable in these situations and i don’t know how to just suck it up and comfort her. she claims i put my feelings before hers constantly and i think she is right. i’m not trying to be selfish, i just honestly don’t feel capable and that is so hard for me to deal with. i don’t want to be a bad person but it seems like i am. 

if i continue this and don’t figure out how to be normal and empathetic than im going to lose her which is the last thing i want. please give me your advice. 
i am really struggling here and anything anyone says would be helpful. btw this is my first and only relationship so i have no experience. thanks

tldr; i struggle to show empathy and care please help me fix this before my relationship ends

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (F 30) have discovered so much about my bf (M 26) in the last few weeks and I don't know what to do.

Okay, so please help me navigate this as I don't think I have experienced this before. When I met my boyfriend, he was so nice, caring, sweet, and a true gentleman. I really thought I finally got it right this time.

A few months ago, I noticed he was becoming distant with me. He didnt want to be intimate, and when we were, he'd struggle to maintain an erection. I told him that if this wasn't what he wanted anymore, that we should just break up. He insisted he still wanted to be in a relationship, and slowly started planning dates and things like that again. I thought things were turning around.

A few weeks ago, I noticed on our home camera that he left randomly at 3 pm during the week. This isn't totally unusual as he's a "daily" grocery shopper, but when he came back an hour later, he had no groceries. Something wasn't sitting right with me about that. When I got home, I asked him where he went, and he said he did go to the grocery store. He said he forgot his wallet. But I know the grocery chain here takes Apple pay. It wasn't adding up in my head. When he went to work that evening, I watched the camera footage over and over until I saw it. When he turned to lock the door, you could see very slightly a wrapper sticking out of his pocket. The footage was so grainy, but I knew it was the condoms we use.

I confronted him when he got home, and he admitted to cheating on me. He told me that this was always something he has struggled with his whole adult life. He said he is very lustful and constantly needs the thrill of sex. I felt so blindsided by it. What's worse is that it was just random hookup with some random person. He refused to tell me where he met this person or how they communicated.

We were set to take a mini vacation the next few days. Everything was paid for, so despite everything, we still went together. We spent a lot of time talking about what happened and whether staying together was the right option. He agreed to go to counseling with me, and offered to share his location with me at all times. I figured if he's willing to put in the work then so am I.

However, I am clearly already an insecure person, and this has only made things worse for me. He often leaves his laptop here when he leaves, and I will occasionally check his socials. He never mentioned reddit, so I didn't think he had one. One night, I checked his search history and sure enough, he gets on reddit to look up NSFW content.

As disgusting as this is, it's actually a lot worse than I ever imagined. When I had more time, I check to see if he was signed into a reddit account, and he was. I reviewed messages and he has been requesting meetups with random people (women and married couples) for years. The last dated message was before we officially started dating. However, I am not so convinced that's really when it stopped.

I feel so gross. And I truly can't wrap my head around who this person even is. How do I even confront him about this? Is it even worth doing that? I feel so stupid for even thinking this was even remotely close to perfect. What should my next steps be?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I’m currently (31f) breaking up with someone (42M) I love. How can I handle this?

I thought he was my one from the moment we met. We moved in pretty quick (we started dating Feb 14th), and things seemed to be running smoothly. He treats me like a princess, is realistic, and I loved every second with him. 

The last month or so though I started noticing some moments where I was being heavily criticized and feeling like he felt like he could do better then me. Hot and cold, which I thought was more mood swings - which we both struggle with. 

The last week or so I noticed he was attached to his phone and texting. It set off the redflag, I would only be attached to my phone that much if I was talking to someone very interesting. I was up last night thinking that something isn’t right. So I checked his Facebook messages (yes, I got burned by what I found when I shouldn’t have been looking). 

Found out he had been texting his ex since Jul. he says 4 days total, and honestly I can’t remember if that was true. His last contact was Nov. 2nd. 

I asked him about it, he apologized saying he can’t say sorry enough and fell into a toxic pattern that’s been ongoing for a long time prior to me. He should’ve never even messaged back. 

She sent him pictures of her chest. She referred to me as a freeloader (I’m in the middle of changing jobs). They told each other how much they miss each other and wanted hugs from each other. He mentioned how his dick has touched every part of her, she mentioned how wild they got. Told him not to let me trap him with pregnancy and he said “GOD NO. I’ll die alone and childless. “. Talked about me as “wifey” and her in the corner. They had FaceTime chats about 4 times. But a lot of the rest of the conversation was him saying he was with his girlfriend, her asking why he never had time for her, getting upset with plans to meet that never happened. 

It’s a lot. I’m fucking hurt , disrespected. I was making our lives like he was the man of my life and he was talking to his ex. 

I packed up 99% of my stuff. He has stuck by me without saying a word after many many apologies. It’s ready to go into the car tomorrow after I sleep in a seperate room. 

It all came crashing down 4 hours ago, am I reacting to fast and harshly? How do I treat this calmly and hear him out - since it was 4 days (total) of emotional cheating that he had been ignoring for the past 3 weeks. (Not blocked mind you)

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (m36) wife (f34) had an emotional affair with her ex out of the blue. Are my efforts to save the marriage worth it?

We’ve been married 9 years, together 13. We have a 7 year old son together and all the things that come with marriage (house, dog, car payments, shared bank accounts). Our relationship has always been up and down like most. My wife comes from a lot of trauma. Her parents are separated after years of DV in the family. She has two half siblings who have been in and out of the legal system and most devastating, she has suffered tremendous loss. When she was 14, her cousin died suddenly in an accident. They were best friends. And in 2020, she lost both her nephew and another cousin in separate car accidents. She’s has issues with depression and anxiety and while she doesn’t have a formal diagnosis, she believes she may have OCD as well.

Like I said, our relationship has been up and down, but nothing too outside of the norm. I’ve made my slip ups in the past. I’ve been caught in lies, but never infidelity. Recently, things have been tougher with both of our jobs and the hours we put in there. I haven’t slept in the same bed as her in almost 2 years, mainly because our son sleeps in there and it simply isn’t comfortable.

Fast forward to two weeks ago. We went on a family vacation where she was extremely cold to me. When we got home, I found out she had been texting her ex boyfriend for the last 3 weeks or so. Very flirty messages, I’ll say too while also sending pictures of our son. Without specifics, it was abundantly clear what he was looking for. I called her out on the texts that I saw on her iPad and while she did apologize, she immediately turned it around on me and how I’ve been to her recently, which I won’t disagree with. I’ve be avoidant. I’ve had stressors with work and our finances and obviously haven’t been there for her. 

Well two days ago, I found out they have continued talking through all of this, at one point, meeting up to talk. I lost my mind and left the house for a hotel. According to her, she’s “very very confused”. Mind you, this ex of hers used to beat her up, cheat on her and gave her an STD. 

According to her, she needs space to think. Personally, the idea of throwing away our marriage and family for her abusive ex is frightening. Some of her friends and family know of the situation and they are disgusted, while also providing support for her.

I have returned home for normality for our son and she is all over the place. Yesterday, she gave me a hug while today, she’s as cold as cold can be. After this all happened, she expressed interest to me in “trying it” with her ex, meaning a relationship because he said sorry for their past.

I’m numb to put it simply. I’m doing everything to admit my faults and understand my role in this while simultaneously trying to be the best father I can. I am petrified they are still talking but I don’t want to infringe in her space by asking. While I can see us coming back from this, it’s so hard right now for me accept that not only it happened, but it continued and she is having actual thoughts of being with this guy. She’s being very closed and won’t discuss anything with me.

Is this worth putting in the effort to change myself for the better and keep us together?

QUESTION: Letting go of family expectations in relationships 26F 30M

26F dating a 30M for over a year. I make almost 6 figures and my bf makes about $70k as a store manager. We’re thinking about marriage and kids done the line but I’m worried about his line of work and trajectory. He is at the highest point he said that he could be and if he wanted to switch careers it would be to be a sport psychologist. He’s pretty traditional and wants to eventually pay all our bills but I’m concerned if we were to have kids or I take a leave we would drown in debt. ( I own my own home at about $2200 a month + additional expenses). Financial stability has always been pretty important to me and my friends and family have always honed in on dating someone who financially ambitious and stable. However, I really do love my boyfriend and think we can figure things out later down the line. Any advice on how to let go of financial advice I was taught or other  considerations before considering marriage?

================================================================================

QUESTION: boyfriend (M28) told me that he cheated on me (F25) for  about a month and begs for forgiveness

Please be a little considerate with your answers. I am very conflicted and so hurt that I do not even know where to begin.

I have been together with my boyfriend, 27M, for a little over a year. Today he told me that he cheated on me about one and a half months ago. It lasted for about a month with someone from his work.

We had a very good relationship for the first half year. Then I had to study for my finals, so I was extremely busy. I did notice that he wanted a lot of attention that I could not give him at that time. When I asked him if that was the reason he entertained the situation, he said it was not. He said he does not sure why he entertained the situation but can only say that he initially liked the feeling of being wanted. He also said he chose to tell me now because I am done with my exams.

According to him, there was no emotional attachment. They sexted, he sent her three nudes and she sent him some as well, and they made out once at work. She knew he had a girlfriend, but I am not mad at her because she was not the one in a relationship. I actually feel more sad for her.

He eventually ended things with her, told her that he has a girlfriend and that he did not want to continue anything. He told me he never wanted anything serious with her and was not even really attracted to her, but he entertained her advances. She is not happy about how it ended and now he is planning to change his workplace because of the situation.

He is asking for another chance and promising to do everything he can to show that this will not happen again. When I told him I do not know if I can trust him, he said he will take responsibility and does not expect me to carry the burden alone. He said I can check his phone whenever I want if that helps me feel safe. When I mentioned that I might feel like I need to monitor him or track his location, he said that it is okay if it helps me during recovery. When I asked him if I would be allowed to cheat to make things even, he told me that if that is what it takes for me to feel better, then I could. I do not think I could ever do that because it is not who I am.

He also told me that I should take all the time I need and decide what is best for me, without any pressure from him. He said he wants to go to therapy to understand his actions and work on himself, and this was his idea, not mine.

For now, I broke up with him, but I told him that I need time to think. I do not know what direction to take. I have always said that cheating is a deal breaker for me, but he is my first relationship and the first person I was ever able to trust. He is my first everything except kissing. Part of me is tempted to try again, and part of me is scared of being hurt again 

I would appreciate perspectives on how people have handled similar situations, whether rebuilding trust has been possible for anyone, and what helped them make their decision? A male perspective would also be helpful to me if anyone wants to share.

ANSWER: If he would cheat on you during, what I can only assume is a stressful and highly important exam season, I don’t think this is a man to take into your future with you. What about childbirth? Or the loss of your parents? You cannot afford to deliver a constant chase and attention. If you get busy again and he feels unwanted, he’s going to do the same thing and the anxiety of it will just distract you from furthering your own life. He gotta go.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 32M dating 25F, how have you worked through different sex drives or better to call it quits early?

32M and have always had high sex drive. started seeing 25F and one of the first conversations was around sexual frequency being very important in the relationship for me, she said "yeah otherwise you are just roommates" and agreed that having sex as close to daily was what she was looking for as well.

First 4 weeks no problems, she got sick back to back for two weeks and following that it dropped to every other day. Work got busy and now it is literally once a week 5 months into dating. She's great in the "tick box dating list", but I am near considering this too catastrophic to continue with.

The sex we do have is boring. She only wants to do missionary. When she made it seem she was quite freaky early on (have seen zero evidence of this beyond first month). I just don't feel like she ever has that "desire" switched on. She can be ovulating and I won't even know from her behaviour. She never initiates. I initiate multiple times a day, its always "haha later omg" "something else has to get done first" "nooo later tonight" then she will seemingly deliberately fall asleep on those nights.

I have never had success approaching frequency in past relationships so i am reluctant to do it. It always turns into a fight or a "what, you expect me to do something like that even if I don't want to" conversation that just shuts it down. I have raised it gently in the past and she acknowledges the point but you can see her eyes rolling when it is raised.

I will add I am tall, fit, well groomed, good job, hygiene freak, good social skills, sexually successful in past before do the basics is brought up.

Is there an approach that is even worth trying?

ANSWER: I'm in a low sex marriage and you don't want that. Words < actions. You can either listen to what she says or pay attention to your own experience of the relationship. She can tell you the sky is orange and the moon is made of cheese. It doesn't mean it is true. 

She isn't freaky and she doesn't want to have the same sex life you do.

Don't make things more complicated than they need to be.

QUESTION: How many times is too many times? What would you do if your partner called you 36 a day everyday? 28/F 34/M

So I’m a little conflicted. For starters I’ve never been in a real relationship like one that’s healthy and genuine, so I don’t really know. So I am gunna ask, how many times is too many times for your partner to be calling you. 
Seems silly but like my partner calls me every minuet almost, just the other day he called me 36 times to say things that could have been texted. I have two kids, work full time and a college student. It’s not even like we don’t talk at all, but I am called legit every minuet. Any time I ask or voice how I feel he brushes it off as “I care about you and love you” 
What would you do?

ANSWER: Someone calling you 36 times in a day needs to be put into a mental hospital.

There is no other way I could interpret that type of obsession.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 13 year long relationship on the brink of collapse between me M/30 and my partner F/30

I (30M) and my partner (30F) have been together for just shy of 13 years now. I love her with all my heart, but for the past few months I’ve felt like I’m no longer IN love with her, and it crushes me. 

We met in high school. I went to college in San Francisco, and a year later, she joined me at the same school. While there, we got a (walk-in closet) apartment for ourselves, and she started developing SEVERE depression. And unfortunately, by her own admission, she ended up treating me pretty poorly as a result. This began a cycle of me trying to advocate for myself, and being punished for it.

You see, she grew up in a household where she was constantly feeling invalidated and crazy for simply feeling anything that went against the grain of her family. She grew up in an extremely emotionally abusive household. 
She confided this in me early on in the relationship, and I made it my mission to make sure she never felt that way with me. 
So over the years, whenever she would be upset with me, I’d take it 100% seriously, valid or not; which over the years has made me lose all self-esteem and self-respect. I lost myself. 

I would always try and push through with my “optimism” about us as a couple, that and the fear that she would do something drastic, as she has told me on three separate occasions at her lowest points that I was her only comfort in this world, and the only thing keeping her from doing something awful to herself. 

I felt responsible for her life. So I would be gentle with my words of dissatisfaction or anger on my side of the relationship. Which would result in her not fully understanding the gravity of my side of things, and would push back on them; almost always resulting in me feeling guilty, and like shit afterwards. Over time, as a defense mechanism, and me fundamentally being a coward, I stopped saying anything “real”. I wouldn’t speak up for myself, and it started to grow resentment in me.

Over the years, she has felt a distance between us, which we now know was the lack of me being honest with her. It came to a head around June when, during an argument, I flat out told her I was scared to talk to her; out of fear of having my feelings rejected, being told I’m being mean or selfish, and being made to feel like there’s something wrong with me. She cracked, she understood the severity of this, and almost broke up with me, but I wanted to work on us. I didn’t want to lose her. 

Then, a few months later, I tried talking about our money situation with her, as I had been the sole money maker for 2 years, which was really stressing me out. She was trying to make money for herself with a private business, but struggled with it because of her depression. She understood my plight, but ultimately the conversation ended with me feeling like nothing really changed.

Then a few days later I initiated a moment of intimacy between us, a nice romantic kiss. Which went great, but a few days later, when I tried again, I was turned down. She said that she felt obligated to do it, which made her feel uncomfortable. This made me kinda spiral a bit because, at this point, we hadn’t done anything intimate for three years. I stopped initiating intimacy, precisely because of years of guilt that had built up from making her feel uncomfortable. She says that she’s scared that a real, romantic kiss would get me to riled up, and have me asking for more. So after 3 years of me not trying anything, and her not trying anything, getting a taste of it again, to then be rejected again; it made me feel awful.

After that, I started feeling horribly, as I was already, and currently still am, in my own horrible depressive funk.
One day I had a mental breakdown, and the next, I broke up with her. 6 hours later though, I went back to her, wanting to make things work, and she said okay.

After that, I started going to therapy, which gave me an outlet. But my partner felt a distance growing between us. She wanted me to be more honest with my feelings with her, but I still didn’t feel safe, and now that I had an outlet with my therapist, I thought talking to them would be more helpful to me; unfortunately I’m a moron, and never told her this, as I didn’t even realize it myself yet. My partner felt like I was pulling away from her, and started overcompensating, making me  want more distance.

It came to a head where we both understood that I am NOT doing well, and the relationship is harming both of us. 

We are currently on a structured pause, one month of no contact, except for one phone call to just check in on each other on the third week; all in an effort to help me figure myself out, and what I want; but it hasn’t gone well. She had a really rough day after the first week, asked me to call her, and I caved. I wanted to help her through her feelings of fear. Then she started developing feelings of resentment towards me as the days went on because she’s basically waiting around to find out if I still want to be in the relationship or not with her; which I think is totally fair, she’s in a scary, uncertain situation right now. So she asked me to call her, and stuff spiraled into us breaking the pause early. It felt really good seeing her again, and being there for her. But the next day while I was at work, I started feeling doubts. We went on a date afterwards, which felt great again, but the next morning I woke up crying. I broke the pause out of guilt, which was one of the main problems of our relationship to begin with, me doing things out of shame and guilt. 

We decided to continue the pause after a heartfelt discussion. That’s where I’m at now, laying on my mom’s couch, missing her so much, hours after feeling like I shouldn’t have seen her yet.

She finally understands how truly bad she hurt me over the years, and wants to make changes in herself to remedy it all. But I get this sinking feeling of it all being too late. I tried over the years, but nothing stuck till now.

She’s an amazing person, she’s flawed like anybody else, but she’s amazing. I love her so much. But for years I’ve gone without any of my needs being met, or my feelings being validated. I so desperately want this relationship to continue, but I can’t help but feel so guilty and shameful and sad and angry when I’m around her. I hate this. I hate that I let this happen. I could have tried to advocate for myself more, I could have tried to help her understand the severity of what I was feeling more, but I didn’t. And I hate that she saw glimpses of my pain over the years, and didn’t get it until I literally had a mental breakdown. And I’m afraid I’m going to lose her. I’m so scared. I don’t want to end this pause and not want to be with her anymore, but I also don’t want to prolong any suffering between us.

Please, any insight would be helpful here. I don’t feel safe talking about this with anyone in my life, and I only see my therapist once a week.

How do I move past the years of resentment built up in me so I can feel safe in my relationship again?

ANSWER: I see that, I really do. And the part of me that wants to break up with her sees that to the fullest.

But she’s human, she didn’t grow up with the necessary love to have the tools to properly navigate positive relationships. The part of me that wants to stay with her understands that.

It’s all so confusing.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (F36) am not sure if this is imbalanced relationship (M41)

I (F36) am currently dating a guy (M41) long distance for maybe a year now; we broke up briefly for a month and got back together a month ago so in total we have been together for 11 months. 

He has always said that he hates being left on unread and always told me that when he reads my messages i dont need to wait for him to respond it just means he doesnt know what to say next. 

But if i am busy i haven't read his messages, he gets upset by but won't bring it up as an issue until i bring something else up as an issue, almost like a tit for tat (I hope i am saying that right). So I compromised with him that I would do a little better by letting him know that I was going to be busy or doing something for a couple of hours that would tie me up. But I dont get any promises from him that hed message me back or make efforts to just randomly message me throughout the day or my issue i bring up doesnt get addressed at all. 

So I dont like being left on read but he doesnt like be left on unread, who opposite hates and i dont know how we can meet each other in the middle. What would you suggest I can do to bring it up? How can we meet in the middle with two different ideas on how messages are handled?

Then we encountered another issue:

I had issues in the past that hed send me something and complain about how dysfunctional about something was... and I would respond with my own opinion about how awful the same person he was complaining about (almost like agreeing with him). He would attack me and call out a bunch of things I have done that was dysfunctional... or if something had failed it was all my fault. I told him how hurtful it was and explained that he knew the decision on what he mentioned was not all my fault and should not be solely placed on my head. I expressed with him how hurtful it was to me but he was relentless and kept jabbing at me over and over again. Eventually as I kept trying to defend myself, he stops the conversation to say, "we are going in circles" and just ends it like that.  
  
Since then when he sends me something complaining about this person or a group hes friends with, I don't want to comment or engage in that cause I fear I would get personally attacked again even though hed made the opinion first. 

Obviously, there are a lot of layers that I haven't put down but I feel like I am in an imbalanced relationship that is one sided and I'm not sure, based on how I would get attacked by smallest opinions or asks, how I can bring it up?

QUESTION: I [35 M] and friend [35 M] been friends 16 yrs and he goes radio silent for months at a time. Would you let him go and move on?

My friend and I been pals for a long time. 16 years now and for the fifth time in our friendship he’s gone silent. Every time tho for just reasons, alcohol, relationships, depression, life issues etc. I understand. We call each other brothers and such. 8 months now, nothing. He’s just gone silent. It’s hurtful and confusing . I send follow-up texts and calls. Occasionally see his social media posts, which is a little. But part of me feels regardless of what’s happening. Let me know. Keep me in the loop. But what keeps me hanging on is…I really do understand it…there times I just don’t want to talk to anyone either. But the last year up to his silence were very brotherly, loyal, there for each other and hanging out. My best guess as to what’s going on…he’s focused on his life goals and he’s working on his drinking. I’m supportive of him in that. But to keep me out? I get it but also at minimum let me know. Or, if I’ve done wrong, discussing it. Definitely hurts tho. I miss him. But, I too wonder if this is worth continued effort on my part, I care, but I’m exhausted and I’m not for crawling after someone. I just been leaving things be.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (36F) regret my entire relationship with my husband (36M) and feel stuck. Do I stay or go?

My husband and I met when we were 22 and are married with two kids under 6. I honestly don't think I have ever been happy in this relationship. He's not a bad guy or anything but he's also never been the type of guy I dreamed of being with or met my needs. He's not an emotional guy or even a gesture kind of guy. I remember feeling unwanted a lot at the beginning of our relationship and when I told him this and that I wanted him to tell me or show me how he felt he would always say stuff like it's not you, it's me. I just don't like to talk about my feelings. I just am not good at showing you, etc. Every once and a while though he would say or do something that I guess felt validating that he did, in fact, love me. He was also not the guys I typically dated who were strong willed, protective but also assholes, cheated on me, abused me, etc. so this was a totally different relationship for me.

I don't know why I didn't end it initially, it wasn't like I was insecure. I was attractive, I feel like I had a good/fun personality, great body, good career. I had a lot of options. I almost feel that it was maybe because he wasn't giving me the attention and emotional support I craved so I HAD to prove to myself I could get something out of him. I also think it was just too hard to disentangle myself. We had pretty quickly bought a house together after we started dating (like less than 1.5 years into it), had pets together, mutual friends, etc. So I just kept going with it because he was a decent guy, everyone liked him, I wasn't miserable and we had fun together but I was never madly in love with him or super attracted to him, like I never wanted to rip his clothes off or anything. And before anyone asks he did NOT have money. I actually made more money (still do). He is a bit anti-social and it's hard for him to make friends, conversation, etc. which is why I felt at one point we worked. I'm extremely social, used to be a party girl so I felt like it was a balance. 

Then every one of our friends started getting married, so obviously the next step was for us to get married. One day he asked if I liked a certain type of ring and when I told him no he said well I guess you'll have to go look with me. We picked out the ring and then a couple months later we went on vacation and he gave it to me, didn't really ask me to marry him, just gave the ring to me. No emotion, no planned proposal, nothing special. 6 months later we had a wedding and were married. I think we both settled. Him because it was easy and he wasn't social or motivated enough to find anyone else and me because I felt stuck and everyone thought he was so great (compared to my past relationships). 

After the happiness of the wedding planning, wedding, honeymoon all wore off that's when I really started thinking about what a mess I was in and how this really wasn't the life I wanted. But I just didn't know how to get out we're in it like 4 or 5 years at this point. I became more and more miserable until I was at the point where I told my friends I was going to leave. But for some reason I decided to give it one more shot by going on a vacation together.......and then I came back pregnant. So I kept going. After our first child was born I was happy and I felt like I was finally getting the love I wanted... from our kid. So what did I do? Had a second one. My thought was I could fill the void I was feeling with the love I had for them since I wasn't going to have the dream life and relationship. But now as the kids have started getting older and I'm getting older, the regret I have for staying is becoming this ever constant presence in my life. I do NOT regret my kids, I love them more than anything so don't come at me for that. But I do wish that I would not have wasted my entire youth on this man and relationship.

Some days I just try to tell myself it's fine. You have a good life, you have a nice house, beautiful children, stability, nice cars, money to play with, tons of vacations you can go on, it could be worse. You can continue to live like this. Give your kids everything. Make sure they don't make the same mistakes. Would I even find anyone decent anyway at this age with two kids? Probably not. 

But then other days I just get so depressed that this is my life. I want something more. Something better.

We don't fight, we go out together, do dates together, laugh together, parent well together but what I feel is like he's a best friend. I am not in love with him and I am not attracted to him at all. We still have sex but it's because he initiates and I feel like I have to. I do not want to, not even a little bit anymore and I do not really enjoy it. He definitely realizes it because he said to me the other day he knows I don't find him attractive anymore.

It feels like a lose lose situation. I don't want to destroy my kids lives and not have their parents together. I don't want to hurt him. We don't hate each other, we don't fight. What am leaving for, to find some dream man? Not fucking likely.

I'm just at a loss at this point and I don't have anyone else to talk to about it because on the outside I think people think our relationship is great. Has anyone else felt this way?

ANSWER: You should start with a therapist. You initially chose the bad boys who cheated and disrespected you. Then you find a genuinely nice guy and settled. Before blowing up your life and that of your kids, at least talk to someone so that if you do leave, you do it in a respectful way so you can coparent well.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Is there a such thing as rekindling the spark with my ex boyfriend? I [f19] and my ex [m18] have recently broken up from a seemingly perfect relationship because it got “boring” and honestly, we both had a lot of growing to do.

As stated up top, I’ve been wondering if anyone could rebuild a spark. I don’t believe love just disappears, I think it dims overtime and even now, we’re not a full month out but we are in no contact but it doesn’t feel right. I don’t know if that’s just my emotions still running high but I don’t feel heartbroken anymore, I’m not even bitter, I guess it feels as if I’ve grown enough with this time apart to realize what I want and how I want to go about it.

Our relationship was good from the start, we had great chemistry, our families liked one another, it literally felt like a match made in heaven. His family loved me and even after the breakup they continued to show their support for me. Honestly we didn’t even end on bad terms, it just ended. I’d just like to know if this is something achievable, I know we can’t control every narrative or how people feel but there’s hope in my heart.

ANSWER: It’s always to good ending ones that are more difficult.

================================================================================

QUESTION: (33F) (53M) Is the drop in communication normal considering his personal issues or am I being clingy/needy?

I have been dating this guy for five months, and honestly, he’s my dream man in every way. He’s romantic, affectionate, and relationship-oriented. While we aren’t officially together yet, he has expressed that he’s looking for a serious commitment.

When we first started dating, we would talk on the phone for 30 minutes to an hour every day, exchange good morning texts daily, and usually send a message or two throughout the day without fail. If he couldn’t talk one day, he would send a text explaining why. However, over the past month, our communication frequency has decreased significantly.

\- He has stopped sending me good morning texts. If I send him one, he often doesn’t respond.

\- Sometimes I text him, and he doesn’t reply until later in the day or 24 hours later.

\- If I call him and he can’t answer, he rarely calls back or even texts me back to explain why he couldn’t talk.

\- Occasionally, we go three or more days without any texting or talking at all.

\-Forgetful, he says he'll call me or text back but rarely ever does. One time I asked him to send a picture of something and it took him 2 days for him to send it.

I understand that he has a lot going on and I'm not trying to make excuses for him.

\-He has a structured schedule everyday.

\-Owns multiple homes and sometimes he's preoccupied with tentant issues.

\- He has kids so things will pop up out of the blue with them if they need him.

\-He's neck deep job hunting and interviewing since he got laid off.

\-Is a social butterfly with numerous family and friend engagements or plans throughout the week.

\-Family drama that is ongoing (death In the family, property issues etc etc.)

\- I’ve noticed that he doesn’t check his phone frequently when he’s out, and he receives a lot of spam calls and texts, which can bury his notifications. He even has a select few contacts pinned at the top of his phone for easier access to text I think.

I recognize that he has a lot happening in his life right now, but it has been jarring for me to go from consistent communication to not hearing from him for days at a time. I don’t think he has lost interest or is trying to ghost me, as we still plan dates and see each other in person when we can.

I believe he was putting more effort into our communication at the beginning because we were getting to know each other. Now that some time has passed, it seems to have naturally slowed down. I also understand that I am not yet a priority in his life, given everything he is dealing with, so those things come first, and I might be on the back burner until these issues get sorted out, and I’m fine with that.

I've also been guilty of reading a text, planning on responding back, but not responding at times.

However, I feel like I’m in a weird limbo because I don’t feel comfortable asking for better communication when I'm not his girlfriend yet.

================================================================================

QUESTION: M21 F20 Would you end contact?

I 21M have been talking to 20F since August and it’s been quite the experience, I met her in August, and I’m absolutely ready to end it. We aren’t a couple, it’s like a fwb no label thing. She’s severely clingy, and although it stems from anxiety, it’s getting to be a lot. She’ll call me while I’m napping (and she knows that) because she’s severely nervous and won’t stop calling until I wake up. Asks me a lot if her and I are good daily, she blows up my phone no matter where I am or what I’m doing if she gets upset or nervous, and with my job I can’t have that distraction (I’m in IT for a very well known tech company). She wants me to share my location with her (that’s a whole no). But there’s been periods where everything is perfectly fine, and we’ve talked about it, but when she’s in the moment all boundaries are out the window. Now, I do know how it is to be in those moment because I struggled with severe anxiety for years, so I don’t want to be an asshole because I’ve been pushed off by others in the moment years ago and I know how that feels, but at the same time it’s aggravating and super annoying. She also asks sooo many times during the day if we can have our daily FaceTime after work, and then will send something else, edit that to include something else once or twice (it sends another notification on iPhone) and then apologizes. I did tell her about how she shouldn’t text me at work a lot after I was in a meeting with high up management and her blowing up my phone made me lose my train of thought for a few minutes. She’s been doing this since September and it’s really getting to me

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (24F) partners (22F) parents (47M and 45F) don't like me?

Hey everyone, I'm looking for advice on my (24F) relationship with my girlfriend (22F). For context: We have been together for a little over 2 years and just moved into a shared unit a few months ago. 

Before I fully explain the current situation there is some background information that I need to get out of the way. First, she is gender-queer and while she is generally open about this, her family is not aware. When I first met my girlfriend she had just moved out of her home state to attend college away from her family. This is important information because when I met her she had just gotten out of a very toxic household and was not in a great place mentally which lead to her engaging in multiple destructive coping mechanisims, the main one being lying. Among many things she was lying to her father about how well she was doing in school. Her roommate was also very anti-trans which meant she didn't feel safe to dress or behave differently at that point. After a year with that roommate she moved into the same complex (but a different apartment) as me. 

Now, the first part of my current situation. I moved into her apartment a few months ago. We made this decision because it felt like a middle ground between living seperately and moving in together because we would each have our own rooms and we also have two other roommates. Soon after moving in together we went to visit her parents. A few days into being in town her mom invited us to dinner and it did not go well. In summary my gf said she was struggling with the lack of sunlight in our state and I added in that I have the same experience. Her mom told her that everyone struggles with that and to basically deal with it and that if it was that bad, "people could just move". Many people in my state don't have the finances to live anywhere else. Keep in mind, her mother lives in one of the nicest places in southern california directly next to the beach without paying rent. She would never be able to live in her city, let alone neighborhood on her current salary. I noticed myself feeling hurt by her words and quickly dismissed myself and cried outside. During dinner her mom asked if we could all get ice cream together and I agreed hoping it would help salvage the relationship. After dinner I asked my gf if it would be ok if I talked to her mom about what had happened earlier to try and lessen the tension and she told me she was fine with it. I chose to wait until it was just me and her mother because I didn't want to embarrass her or make her feel called out. I told her that I really wanted to get along and even bond because I know she's important to my gf and that I wanted to make sure that there were no hurt feelings left from earlier. I told her that I cry very easily and there was no need to feel bad about what happened and I had just felt a little hurt because I've had very hard experiences around living where I do. She responded and said that people make choices and have to live with them and that we were "going to butt heads and that's that". After we left the house I told my gf how it went and she said we didn't have to get ice cream, so we called her mom and said we were too tired and would go another time. 

Now, the second part of my current situation happend a few nights ago. My gf was on a phone call with her father who never seemed to necessarily like me, but also never seemed to have issues with me either. He had been especially worried about her mental health recently and on this phone call he directly identified me as the cause of her problems and suggested she move out. He said that I was the only thing that could be causing them because the changes he was seeing started when we began living together. He listed many concerns all of which were tied to causes other than me. He said that since being with me she began acting differently, dressing differently, and was keeping her hair long. All of these things are gender related and did pick up when we got together, but that's because I was the first person to create a safe space for her to do whatever she wants without judgement. He explained that she wasn't struggling with school before meeting me, but she was. She just decided to be honest about it now because I suggested she talk to her dad about it to see if he would allow her to take less classes. He also talked about how she's been more depressed since around when we moved in together and she did have a huge mood shift around then, but it was directly after it started to rain regularly and the sun went away. She had the same experience the last couple years too, but had chosen to lie to her father about it then. He also said a few things that made it seem like my gf mother had spoken to him about me. 

So this is where things are at the moment and I'm not sure what to do about it. It is in part frustrating that the people who could potentially be my in-laws dislike me because I cut off the family I grew up with and having in-laws that are kind to me would be ideal since I can't bond with my family. The main issue though is that I'm worried about their interference in my relationship with my gf. We were planning on moving into our own apartment next year, but given her dad doesn't want us living together and pays for her rent that may no longer be an option. Her father and mother have also hinted that they want her home for holidays which makes sense and at the same time I can not afford to come and have no one else to spend them with. She does avoid seeing her family as often as possible, especially because every time she sees them she calls me in tears at least once and comes back home feeling terrible in the end. Saying no doesn't feel like an option because when she does that her parents, especially her father, shut her down or pressure her to drop the boundary. Explaining things also doesn't feel like an option because her mother tends to jump to the conclusions that she wants to believe and not change her mind. Her father is similar, though not to the same degree, but explaining what's really going on would mean coming out which may not end well and admitting school isn't going as well as it should which would most likely end in her father forcing her to move back in with him. I love my gf so much and I'm very thankful that I get to be a support for her and that she feels safe enough with me to be honest and be herself. I just also have concerns about being tied to people who dislike me so much and have some level of power over my partner/our relationship. I've worked very hard to get myself to a place where I feel secure and have the self-respect and self-love to not put myself in positions where I get treated poorly. I'm noticing a lot of fear around if my relationship is secure and falling back into a place where I let people treat me poorly because I don't want to face the consequences of speaking up. I'm wondering what people think of this situation and any advice they may have to offer.

ANSWER: If they don't like you then they don't like you. What should be important is what your partner thinks. You can't change or shouldn't change someone opinion of you if they don't know the whole story

================================================================================

QUESTION: how do i [20F] tell my boyfriend [23M] that i'm not comfortable with his friendship with his female friend?

tl;dr: i'm not comfortable with my jealousy, it's new to me, and my bf's relationship with his friend is making me really miserable and feel guilty

i don't think he'll ever cheat on me and i know he loves me, but i want the closeness he has to her to be strictly for me and me only. i don't want to be one of those people in a relationship who control who their partner is friends with, and i don't want him to end his friendship with her, but i want him to distance himself.

he knew her before he met me i think for at least 3 years so i already feel invasive by being upset and jealous but it's driving me crazy and i've cried about it already.

this is an online friend he has, so he watches movies/shows with her and talks to her regularly, like friends. i still feel rly jealous and uncomfortable about it because i don't know why stuff like that can't slow down now that he has a girlfriend and we're in a serious relationship.

i don't bottle up my feelings so i talked to him about it a couple days ago because i felt really horrible for being jealous. i told him how i'm sorry for feeling this way and i talked it out with him, and he reassured me with kind words and a lot of love and attention the next day when i saw him in person. 

the next day i went to work and i talked to my friend \[34F\] who is a lot older than me and has more relationship experience. she's currently in a really long-term relationship and from my perspective it looks like a healthy one. i told her about the situation and she told me that i was valid in my feelings and that at a certain point, some friendships change in respect of the relationship, meaning that he should be distancing himself from his friend because he has a girlfriend now and i want stuff they do to remain strictly within our relationship. this changed my mind a bit about how i was feeling and i trust this friend a lot, she gives really great advice that has helped me because she's like an older sister to me.

today i find out that the show we both thought he was gonna finish with his friend has 4 more episodes left and that he was going to watch it right after a call we had together. he then told me that he thinks he will be watching rupaul's drag race with her (which he told me he'll stop doing bc he knows i really want to watch that show with him) and even though it's such a small issue, it made me really upset and ruined my mood. 

i feel really bad already about feeling this way (i'm autistic and have a hard time with feelings) but i'm someone who never gets jealous and is usually reasonable and calm about things, so when something like this is making me uncomfortable and jealous, then it has to mean something, right? i never had jealousy issues before in my previous relationships and my first ever boyfriend had an emotional affair with his friend and i was still able to get over it and trust him before i ended things with him.

i'd appreciate any advice given. i just want to stop feeling miserable. i have a lot of stress on me right now

QUESTION: how can i get over this? (32 f) (31m)

okay so for back history…me (32f) and the father (31m) of my kids have been together for 12 years. we split for 3 years because he kinda dropped the ball on the relationship. we don’t argue a lot or anything. and then decided it’s best if we got back together 6 months ago. anyway the one relationship he had in that time was with someone we work with. so it’s caused a bit of trust issues because he lied about it for a while and called me crazy until i caught him talking to her through text and that’s when he admitted it. that was last november. fast forward to today. me and him live together and everything since we got back together but he certainly shows no effort of reassurance at all. we work down the hall from eachother and he does not talk to me at all during work. he says he is too busy. i get home and it’s just like hi and then we go about our business. my mind always goes too oh well he’s talking to her all day and that’s why. should this be bothering me as much as it does? we have talked about it numerous times and he’s dismissive. we have two boys as well.

QUESTION: 25-F, 26-M 11YRS: Always told I don’t listen. But really, I don’t understand.


Always told I don’t listen, but really, I don’t understand.

If I ask clarification questions, I get my intelligence put down or told I’m not listening. I’m constantly told I’m not listening when really, I’m not understanding. Or I’ll forget someone thing that someone told me last night and next thing you know, I wasn’t listening. I just have a bad memory though…

For example I just had a friend of 11 years 26-m show me a video three times and I didn’t understand it until the third time. He made me feel really really bad. He said I wasn’t listening and that after 3 times it’s not fun for him and that I need to listen better. But I don’t understand. The video was supposed to be a camera man walking into a door. He told me to watch for the camera man walking into the door. The video was inside a building with many doors and many people. I was looking for a camera man, I didn’t consider the person who was actually filming. And when they hit the door it barely shook the camera so I didn’t realize it. Now I feel really stupid. I brought up that I think it’s not fair to say I’m not listening when simply, I didn’t understand.

Please help. Is my stupidity going to be the end of me? I have dyslexia and was extremely sheltered from pop culture growing up and I just “don’t get it” like other people do. And it makes me hurt so much seeing how frustrated others get by my lack of understanding. Which is always wrote off as not listening. And I refuse to accept it. 

Now I’m watching my hockey game alone because i didnt understand what to look for. Go Leafs… 👍I’m just trying not to cry and finding a way to stand my ground, yet try to improve. I can’t keep living like this, it’s painfully disheartening and ruining my self-love.

ANSWER: I really think besides dyslexia you might have some other form of neurodivergence going on? That would explain why you don't grasp things in the same way that others tend to.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [18F] and my boyfriend [20M] need advice about how to handle our differing views.

My boyfriend of 2 years has homophobic views and is dating a member of the lgbtq+ community. 

First and foremost, I’m somewhere on the asexuality spectrum, I do not know where yet because things like that take time to figure out. I do know I am panromantic. Because of the fact that I do not know where I am on the asexuality spectrum, all he knows is that I’m a member of the lgbtq+ spectrum. And now that I know he has homophobic views, I doubt I’ll have the courage to come out of the closet to him. 
I love my boyfriend, I want to give him the chance to change, since I know where he lives, what he does is “normal”. Little bit of history, we met when I was 12, we were both social outcasts that banded together, eventually developed feelings for one another, 2 years into the friendship we confess out feelings right before he had to move away to a different place. While I was 16, we began to officially date long-distance. 
Where he currently lives, his behavior is “normal.” He finds same-sex couples weird, and thinks they shouldn’t be around kids. I’ll use the example of my favorite show, The Owl House, he thinks same-sex representation should be away from kids. To which I always disagree, they are an adorable couple that deserve to be happy, which I tell that to him every time he brings it up, which is every single call, wayyy more than necessary in my opinion. Every once in a while he will say these same exact words, “I pride myself in being the only straight man in my family.” He has 2 siblings [18M & 24M-F], one has transitioned and is out of the closet, the other he just claims he knows is gay, he “can tell” as he puts it. Whatever the heck that’s supposed to mean. 

I’m trying my best to be patient, to educate him and correct his behavior, but he changes the subject every time, and when I try to change it back to that subject, he says he wants to avoid an argument. Which is understandable, but some arguments are needed in a relationship, that’s just a part of my belief when it comes to that. 
But patience only goes so far, and by now I’m beginning to run out. If things do not improve, I’m going to break things off with him. How do we resolve this issue?

ANSWER: Break. Up. Already. Jesusss. You're dating someone who doesn't respect your identity or his siblings identities. It's not up to you to educate him, and it's clearly not working anyways. Leave the man and be fully yourself!

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (22f) have a crush on my online friend with benefits(25m) and he doesn't feel the same

I’ve known this friend for almost three years. We used to be regular friends, but this year we got closer after things didn’t work out with a friend I tried dating. It really hurt me, and it was a complicated situation. Since then, I opened up to him, and he was there to support me I could tell him anything and felt safe with him.

Back then, we were both single and just wanted to have fun and feel wanted, so we agreed to become friends with benefits, no strings attached, and we could do whatever we wanted outside our fun. Months passed, and we kept doing this. At some point, I started liking him, but I didn’t say anything because I felt he couldn’t feel the same way about me. I managed to brush off the crush and moved on, getting closer to another friend. I started liking this other friend, and eventually, we started dating.

When I told my FWB, he started acting cold, upset, and sad. After asking him some questions, he confessed that he liked me and was heartbroken. I felt bad but told him it was okay that we were still friends after all, and I cared about him.

Sadly, things didn’t work out with that friend. After just one week of trying to date, he left me because he couldn’t handle long distance. I was heartbroken, but my close friend was there for me once again. He supported me while I vented all my pain. I felt safe with him, and he made my days better.

I wasn’t ready to go back to being FWB after that, but he kept flirting and being a little pushy. It was sweet in a way, but it also made me uncomfortable, it was too early for me to do anything with someone else after my breakup. I wanted to be okay, so I flirted back sometimes, but felt terrible guilt. One day, I got upset and told him to stop, that I couldn’t pretend nothing happened and I wasn’t still heartbroken. He was sad, but he understood and stopped.

After some time, I started feeling better and agreed to go back to being FWB. I cried a little the first time because maybe I wasn’t fully ready, but we continued being close, flirting, and more. Eventually, I started liking him again. His compliments, sweet words, and the way I felt safe with him slowly got to me. I gathered the courage to confess my feelings, but he said, “Oh, I’m flattered, I don’t know what to say, but I care about you.” At first, I didn’t understand because we had fun that same night, but then I realized it was a rejection he didn’t like me that way anymore.

I kept being FWB while trying to distance myself texting him less, not sharing feelings or thoughts but eventually stopped being FWB entirely. He accepted it when I told him it was making me sad and I wasn’t enjoying it as much as before.

Some time later, he flirted with me again, and I gave in because I like him and wanted to be close to him once more. Now, he’s asking if we can go back to being FWB. I’ve been trying hard to keep it together and not let him get too close because I don’t want to get hurt more. But I’m questioning myself and wondering if maybe I should just enjoy being close to him this way even if it might hurt me emotionally.

It’s better than nothing, but I know it could make things worse. I think he probably likes another girl now, and it hurts. It hurts that he acts flirty and calls me baby when we have fun, and he wants to keep doing it but to me, it’s more than just flirting. I deeply care about him, and knowing it’s just superficial to him makes me feel terrible, like the only way I can make him happy is by pleasuring him.

I don’t know what to do. Do I continue having fun with him, knowing it will probably backfire, or stop and try to move on? How can I stop feeling this way about him while also being his friend? I'm tired of all these ups and downs

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (25m) am self sabotaging the girl (23f)  Im dating.

Hello everyone,

I (25m) have been seeing this girl (23f) for about 1,5 months now and things are going really good. We talk daily, call a lot and plan in days that we can spend together. It has been going really good and she I affirming that she likes me back.

We talked about how we are going to date because I want to move a lot faster then she does (mainly because she isn’t sure about a relationship) and since we talked about it im fine with that. 

She has had a busy week so contact has been less, and my mind just started to overflow with bad thoughts. Today we called and she was super excited whilst I was cold. When she asked about it I told her I had the feeling that the communication and effort felt one sided. 

We called again later and I had the feeling that something was off so I asked about it, she told me that I was cold and that she was really excited to talk, and that what I said wasn’t right because she made time for me when she could and is always happy to talk to me. She made me realize that im self sabotaging and looking for problems when everything is okay.

Now I feel really bad and Im really scared that I just did something that will end our relationship overtime. My mind jumps to doing something big to show that im sorry but that doesn’t seem right. 

If someone went through the same or can help with dealing with this internally? I would appreciate it And if this could be the end of something good that I just ruined.?

Thank you so much in advance.

TLDR:
I look for problems and self sabotaging a relationship that I am really happy to be in with a girl that I really like. Said something and now I’m afraid I ruined it.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (36F) make my husband (41M) be more responsible in this marriage?

I '36 F' and husband '41 M' (lets call him Jake) have been married for 11 years. We also have a 2 year old in the picture now. 

During our initial days of marriage, Jake used to be what we can call mamma's boy. There are few things that made me think his relationship with his mother is not typical. Once when we were in our in-laws place, he complained about stomach ache. MIL told me he is unwell and she would keep an eye on him. He happily went to sleep with his mother at night. She told me she massaged his stomach and he slept well. They would nap together during the day at living room floor when FIL, his sister and I would be there like that is normal for that family. It made me really uncomfortable but I couldn't say anything at that time. We did talk about it later. Jake stopped doing it when I would be there. But would sleep in MIL and FIL's room when he went to visit them alone. I know it was pure love and not anything appropriate but it still didn't sit right with me. He doesnot do that anymore as we communicated well and I told him to see it from other peoples prospective.

Coming to the actual problem, he is not a responsible person. He doesnot remember anyones birthdays, our anniversary or any important events. Earlier when we were newly married, I used to constantly remind him of my birthday, our anniversary as a hint that he would prepare something. He has never prepared any gifts in advance. I always planned our anniversary. I always planned all the dates we have ever been to. I have always planned all the itinerary, flight tickets, hotels everything for any holidays/vaccations we have ever been to. He would just be there as a happy child who does not care about anything. He would not even know if there is a transit or how mant hours is the transit. I am constantly looking at the map on the way if we are going somewhere unfamilier. I plan all the appointment. I am the one deciding where to invest money or open a new bank account. You name anything life offers, I am the one planning it. It feels like I don't trust him with anything now even if he says he will do it. We live in a rented appartment. I am the one who looked for it and secured and he only saw it at the time of moving. In his defence, he always says I am good at these things so he wants me to do it. 

When I was pregnant, I planned everything, what to buy, which hospital to deliver baby, which doctor to visit. Now, my kid is 2 and I have been responsible for his every appointments, looking for child care. It is exhausting. 

The other day I had scheduled the diswasher repair but had to postpone it because the lift to our building was out of order. I told Jake to call the repairs and make appointment for thursday. I had to remind him they would be closed on Sunday so call them on monday. He never called. When I asked him if he did it, he said he was busy. When I asked him, do you want me to do it, he happily said yes. 

Jake is not a bad person. We both work fulltime and he takes our kid to the park almost everyday. He loves our kid as much as I do. He does cooking and cleaning whenever he can. Helps with feeding our kid sometimes as well. But I want him to be more responsible with money. He is not smart with money and keeps spending on phones and gadgets. I had accepted/ settled I guess before but I don't want my kid to have this role model. How do I make him realise he needs to be more responsible?

ANSWER: You married a momma’s boy and you got a momma’s boy. Trying to change him now will have a low chance of success. 

Maybe try impressing upon him the fact that he probably doesn’t want his son to have him as a role model either.

# URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1p2iy6y/what_is_the_normal_standard_of_cleanliness_in_a/
================================================================================

QUESTION: What is the “normal” standard of cleanliness in a small apartment? Partner (28F) and I (28M) keep arguing about consistency.

My partner and I live together in a very small apartment (35 m²).. and cleanliness has been one of our biggest sources of tension. It has improved compared to earlier days.. she used to get very defensive anytime I brought up cleaning, but generally it’s still something that causes arguments or frustration.

Lately over the last 4 months or so I started suppressing my frustration because every time I brought up chores or clutter, it became a tug of war:

me wanting what I consider a basic level of tidiness, her not liking the feeling of expectations being put on her.

So I told myself: « This is the way she is, so just accept it. »

But now I often end up doing most of the recurring cleaning myself: sweeping dust and particles off the floor, wiping surfaces, tidying the living room, cleaning the kitchen top before bed, , keeping the bathroom counters clear, etc. I don’t mind doing my part, but it upsets me when I see how easily the place becomes messy again…especially when she gets ready to go out and leaves piles of clothes on the bed or chair. I’m totally fine with a couple things here and there, but not piles, especially in such a small space.

My issue isn’t “she never does chores.” She does clean, but like randomly. She might clean properly today and then not care about any cleaning for the next 4–5 days, and then suddenly one day she’ll clean something. The inconsistency is what gets to me. It doesn’t feel sustainable when two people share a tiny apartment.

So I’m trying to figure out what’s actually normal in households, because neither of us has lived with anyone except our families.

Here are my specific questions: (Context: Both of us have hybrid jobs, three times at home and twice in the office)

1. After a meal:

If we cook together, eat, and then watch Netflix for an hour, isn’t it normal to load the dishwasher, wipe the countertops, the baking tray, the sink, and the table sometime during that evening? Isn’t it pretty standard to reset the kitchen/living area before bed? (Obviously there are rare exceptions like being drunk or exhausted… but then again, one can just simply say they’re exhausted every day of the working week from their 9 to 5… when does it stop being an excuse?)

2. Floors:

How often do you sweep/brush the floors in a small apartment?

3. Carpets:

How often do you vacuum or brush the carpet for dust and random objects? We have a fluffy cat and people over almost every weekend so I think it should brushed once a week

4. Bathroom counters:

Is it normal to keep the counter free of clutter? Things like hair dryers or products have drawers….shouldn’t they go back after being used?

5. Bathroom floor after a shower:

Is it normal to leave the floor covered in water? I prefer soaking/mopping it immediately so the bathroom stays usable. She says wiping after a shower ruins her “clean feeling,” but it’s literally a 2x1m area that takes 2 seconds.

6. Clothes piles:

I understand leaving clothes on the bed or chair during outfit trying or when rushing out. But is it normal to wake up the next day and leave the piles there (especially if they were moved from the bed to the desk/chair before sleep)?

7. Proper cleaning:

Like somewhere between deep cleaning and meh cleaning: mopping floors with product, vaccuming the carpet, cleaning the bathroom more thoroughly seat and everything, wiping mirrors, decluttering… what’s the frequency for you? Mine is once every two weeks or 20 days maximum. I suggested that many times but I find myself the only one sticking to it and proactively suggesting we should do it when those twenty days pass… she can postpone for a month and it won’t bother her.

My main question is really about frequency and consistency. What is the normal standard for two adults sharing a small apartment? I genuinely want to give her the benefit of the doubt and stop feeling this internal anger if I’m actually the one being unreasonable or “too much.”

What do you consider normal in your home?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend (20M) is making me (20F) feel like he has only stayed in this relationship because of the intimacy, has anyone else had or felt similar experiences?

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half now, and about 8/9 months into the relations his jealousy started to show. My boyfriend considers himself to be a devoted christian, and therefore believes that people should wait till marriage (you know all that stuff), and I never had any thing against that. I personally am not religious but we both agreed to respect what one chooses to believe in. 

Now what is probably expected by whoever is reading this, we did have sex. To me this was very surprising as he really was a devote christian when I met him, he always showed respect to god and even said he puts god over everyone. I didn't mind having sex with him, because well I love him and it's not like I am going to tell his family about it. a time jump to weeks before we hit our one and half year mark (so like a couple of days ago). He began acting way to hyper sexual, to the point where I didn't even want to shower with him, get changed around him, and honestly go to bed with him. I would tell him to stop watching me get changed and instead of just saying okay and looking away, he would persistently ask me why, or say "its just me" as if that changes anything.

I also want to mention that around this time or maybe around august till now (sorry I am bad with timelines) I would ask him to say what he likes about me (yk like sweet talk me or be flirtatious) and all he could say was "I like your hips :), I like your waist.... Oh and your face :))".... I never felt more uncomfortable. I ask him to say what he likes about me like the type of person I am, and all he could really say was that I am funny.

Both of these actions have been a come and go for him, so maybe I just got so annoyed that I don't even expect him to be able to say anything other than that. What has been the biggest and most hurtful manner that he has adopted is the way he talks to me when we get into a fight. 

This fight starts like this:   
The lights in my apartment start flickering due to the intense winds outside, the wind was so bad that it fully took out the power in my building. I (am a really anxious person, due to childhood up bringing) start to panic and meanwhile he's trying to turn the stoves on and, idk I'm a paranoid person so I tell him in a panicked voice to stop messing with stuff and just come sit down, he doesn't listen and just tells me its not a big deal and continues. Now I have really bad anxiety to the point where I take two different medications for it so to me it's like the whole building is going to come down. I get upset because I feel embarrassed and invalidated. we then eat in silence and then get into a fight, because I was crying and not telling him what was wrong. The reason I didn't want to tell him was because it always end up being me hurting him. I cave and tell him, he says that I was being rude to him and yelling, I tell him I was scared and not saying anything in way that could come off as being entitled (sure my voice was raised), we then have this back and forth before I ask him to stop raising his voice at me and to which he says that I treat him like a child and that if he doesn't raise his voice then he won't get his point across. This felt like a sad to the gut, as I never once talk down to him and believe me I hear his point, but that doesn't mean I have to agree or question it yk.

Another time jump to us hanging out watching temptation island which he never wanted to watch because he didn't want me looking at shirtless guys, but like why would I be fazed by men ten years older than me, and I feel like if you've seen the guys on there, they're pretty much giving doucheburger but wtv. We watch, and we are introduced to the singles and one of them is having her first impression tells us about yourself type of thing and she says, "My guilty pleasure is sucking d," I found this funny, but he for some reason believed it was okay to say (I am not kidding), \sighhh\ if only. Referring to me not giving him head???  
  
I know reading this and there's a lot more but this has all been happening in like the past month or so and I truly have debated on leaving him, but first I decided to tell him exactly how all of his words had made me feel. His response is that he needed time to think and went back to his place.   
  
When we saw each other again the next day it was awkward but after that we went back to our playful happy ways. That is until I realized how overdramatic he was being every time he "accidentally" brushed up against my chest or grading my hips, always reacting to "OMG Im sorry I'm sorry I didn't mean anything by that," and it was giving "Ig I'm just a bad mom" where all I asked was to be more respectful to me and to tone down his horniness. He also when I playfully said you're so mean to me, he got serious and said don't say that's not true.   
  
I just feel really dumb and I keep flipping between leaving and staying hoping he will actually stop making me feel like he wants me for my body (he has denied this multiple times) and to actually be romantic and make me feel like he's still chasing me instead, "I bet you look really good right now ;)"  
  
He has been more respectful and kinder to me and always lets me know that he loves and cares for me and from what I can tell he thinks everything is chill and we are good, but I feel like I am with a completely different person now, and right now I am just kinda sitting and seeing if he actually listens and changes or just keeps disrespecting me.   
  
I have been keep this to my self and have only told a friend of mine, but I just feel like I am not getting the clarity that I am hoping to feel by talking to someone who understands, and also I just don't believe that another 20 year old knows about life after uni and all that stuff.  
  
So I question if its best to should stay and continue to try and mend the relationship or just leave? I ask this in a way that's what has been other experiences with loving someone so much that it hurts, and how to go about the situation. (sorry for the long post I tried to space it out a bit :p)

ANSWER: If the relationship isn't making you happy -- and it seems that it isn't -- then you should end it.

QUESTION: I 32M Felt a Good Connection Quickly with Coworker 30F, Then She Disappeared

My crush at work showed strong mutual interest, then suddenly went quiet. Trying to figure out what actually happened.

I’ve been talking to a coworker who lives in another state. We hit it off fast. I’m talking all-day Slack chats, inside jokes, light flirting, cute messages. She asked for my Instagram, we moved over there, and the vibe kept going. It felt mutual. No awkward energy. No weirdness. I wasn’t forcing anything. It was just easy.

Then out of nowhere her energy dropped. She said she was tired, stopped replying as much, and eventually deactivated her entire IG. She didn’t block me. She didn’t act weird at work. She just went quiet everywhere.

Now I’m stuck trying to figure out what actually happened. Did I misread things? Did her life get heavy? Or is this just one of those situations where the timing lined up at first and then life got in the way?

We’re supposed to meet in person at a work conference in January. I’m trying to stay professional and not overthink it, but the sudden change really got in my head because the early connection felt real.

Anyone been through something like this? How did you handle the switch from flirting every day to basically nothing?

ANSWER: She's seeing someone else and either it got serious or he got jealous.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My sister (23F) and her husband (25M) have been married for 5 years, and together for 9. She wants to know Reddit’s opinion on her dilemma, so I am posting on her behalf. - TDLR:Potential cheating?

My sister has been dealing with some struggles in her relationship for about a year. A year ago, this month, she found out her husband has problems with a porn addiction. Their relationship experienced a lot of stress and they have been trying to rebuild trust and she has been trying to rebuild her confidence and heal. She has been going to therapy for the past year almost. He has gone to therapy 3 times recently but stopped at the 3rd visit because his therapist is an 80 year old religious woman who told him “Your wife’s feelings don’t matter and God forgives you.” Since quitting that therapist he said he is willing to find another one but hasn’t yet. 

Recently he got out of the shower and she noticed some scratch marks on his back. Linked below. I attached two pictures, one edited to show separate scratches that were made right before the picture when her husband scratched his back after his shower. Those circled scratches are not in question. 

https://imgur.com/a/Em0lMI9

So, these scratches have made her question his loyalty to her. She asked him “Are you cheating on me or something?” And he said “I’m not cheating on you.” She said he sounded convincing and empathetic, but has also sounded that way in instances when he wasn’t being honest so it’s hard for her to tell. She said another thing is she was upset he didn’t say “I’d never cheat on you” because in that past he’s said that, no problem, unwarranted. So she was confused why he didn’t say that specific phrase this time. 
EDIT: for more clarification on the confrontation about it. He claims to not know where the scratches could have even come from. 

Another thing she’s noticed is, she’s said lately not only has he not been “as hard” in bed, he’s been doing things he’s never done before. 

Another thing to mention is that she’s also mentioned that he seems to get more reactive towards her. Snapping more, easily defensive in situations he didn’t used to really react in. Otherwise he’s still been loving and all over her. 

As far as his work schedule- he is in the Air Force and does not have a set time he gets off and comes home. He never knows when he will “be off”. His schedule has been like this since the moment they moved to where they’re stationed years ago, so it’s nothing new. 

So, Reddit. Does this seem like cause for concern?

ANSWER: Why to people always come here and either forget to tell us what the guy said, or just not asking him at all. 

Okay OP, I'll bite.   When she saw the scratches, and asked "where did those scratches come from" what was his answer?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Husband ‘M32’ has lost me ‘33 F’ after 7 years of marriage and 3 kids. I feel lonely and heartbroken

Hey guys.

This is a long post. I apologise. 

I dont tend to usually write on reddit on anonymous posts but today I feel so low and lonely and I have no one to talk to.

For context. I am married ‘F 33’ since 7 years and have 3 lovely kids. I have been a sahm for 6 years and have just gone back to work as a driving instructor. We have been through really bad poverty and financial problems in our marriage and only now because I am working does life feel a little lighter in terms of financial distress.

My husband ‘M/32’ works for openreach BT in the UK and my family are all business owners. I have motivated and always been my husbands backbone and even now he is opening a cafè which I got funding for (through a loan) I found the premise and all the ideas and everything are mines as he bas no clue. It was to build something special for us and our kids and local community (where there is no cafè)

My relationship with my family is strained. My mum has undiagnosed Bipolar or something. Her mood changes when she feels like it. This has been a common theme throughout my life since I was a child. 1 year ago she owned up to all the hurt she has caused me and since then we re established our relationship, stronger than ever. Recently she had a fall out with my brothers and came to visit me and was snappy and awful to me (she came to help with babysitting the kids whilst I went to do my instructor exam) she said mean things like ‘The kids are not my responsibility, they are yours’ she never babysits, she has never been an active grandparent, I went through horrible postpartum and she watched me fall apart to never be there. I asked her to come help as my husband was my student for the exam. I got really upset and went to do my exam but ended up in tears and came back. I went to my room and she left. This was all also on my wedding anniversary. 

My husband agreed with me saying she was wrong and he will back me. My whole family sided with my mum. She has always been good a twisting the narrative to make herself the victim and target me. I dont have a sister or anyone I can speak to as our relationship fell apart. I am 33 and after my whole life of forgiving and forgetting, I do not trust her anymore to open up to her.

I have been with my husband 10 years. I have always made him feel seen and special, celebrated him and his achievements. I have only ever asked him to do the same as I love being seen and celebrated. Every mother’s day, birthday, any celebration. He would ignore me. Not even flowers or a card. I would get really upset, he would stop talking to me and eventually I would reach out and he would promise to be a better man. This is a cycle that had been going on for years. I would always forgive and forgetting as I really loved him and because we have kids together.

I recently passed my instructor exam and now I am fully qualified. I took on this journey when I was pregnant with my last child. Due to financial distress, I wanted to support and help my husband. It took me 4 years as I had small kids and also couldn’t afford paying £80 every week for 2 hours lessons. AllI asked from my husband was if he could get me a cake when I pass so I can cut it with my kids. I told him a few days before he said okay. The day of the exam he didn’t get me a cake. The day after he called me from work and I got really upset, all I asked for, was a cake, to cut with my kids. He came home with cake and flowers and hour later. It’s not the same when you have to ask for it once the moment has passed.

He has been working on the cafè and hasnt been able to see his mum. I told him if he wanted to invite her, he can. She comes over and realises we are not okay so tries to pry me for information. I told her everything, how he has made me feel so unseen over the years when all I have done is build and support him through his life. She said he was wrong and she will speak to him. That evening she did but she flipped the narrative and asked him to tell her what I have done wrong, rather than hold him accountable.

I called my mum and dad over the next day as that evening my husband and mother in law really cornered me and it really upset me the way my mother in law said in a condescending way ‘you should just get her gifts’ its not about that at all and made me feel so small.

I asked my parents to come the next day and my husband sat there and let his mum disrespect me i front of everyone and he also took it upon himself to bring up my past traumas in front of my parents and things I shared with him on how my parents made me feel growing up and their lack of love for me but all the love in the world for their sons (my brothers). When my MIL was disrespectful to me he didn’t speak but when I defended myself he threw me under the bus and said ‘I threw my mum out the house the day she came to babysit’ I was wrong and that was evil. None of it is true. How did he sit there and tell me on the day he will back me and I wasn’t wrong but then do that?

My husband has always disrespected me in-front of his family. But he promised if it even happened again he would stand up for me, he didn’t. I now feel very indifferent towards him. It’s been nearly 2 months now. He has apologised and said he wont do all this again but I have been hearing that for 10 years and nothing changes. He talks about how frustrating this all is. But imagine how I feel? I am grieving a life I thought I would have and the one we will build. The happily ever after especially as now he is opening the café and I am working too. It felt like the storms had eventually began to pass, like the pain I went through had paid off. But despite his sorry, his empty promises. I am not going back to just forgiving, forgetting and being my normal self. He has narcissistic traits, he manipulates, lies and gaslights every-time we fall out. I am always left feeling so burnt out. 

I thought he was my best friend. I dont have my family and now I dont have my husband. I have all this pain everyone inflicted on me and such a heavy heart. I am going through grief. These people that claimed to love me. Broke me down. I dont trust anyone. I am walking around really broken. I am comfort eating sugar (have pre-diabetes) and gaining weight. Its a horrible feeling. 

I have tried to find out why my husband is the way he is. I have found out he is an avoidant. I have tried sending him to therapy. I have tried speaking to him. He has come back and said he took me for granted. He cheated on me this year and the last by looking at girls and pornstars on instagram. All I ever did was love him and be faithful to him. Sometimes I feel like the easy way out is…, but then I have 3 innocent little kids. 6,5 and a 3 year old. 

Sorry this is a long post. I just have a heavy heart with why life is so unfair? Why could I not have 1 person who understood me? 🥺

ANSWER: I’m sorry that you feel that you have nobody on your side. But I’ve seen 4 replies to your post and all of these responses are from people who ARE on your side. I’m number 5.

You have just started a new career as a driving instructor. That’s good money. You also own the cafe that you are paying for. So you have two businesses. And you are raising 3 small children. You are overcoming the negativity from your husband, his mother and your own parents.

Keep up the momentum, but don’t forget about yourself.

Your husband won’t buy you flowers or recognise special times such as birthdays and Mother’s Day? Treat yourself. Buy your own flowers. Book yourself a spa day for your birthday or Mother’s Day and tell your husband that HE is taking care of your children. 

And stop doing things for him as he clearly doesn’t reciprocate. No birthday or Father’s Day gifts. Let him deal with his own laundry. He can do half of the housework. He can reap what he sows.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Unhappy with the amount of time husband 35M and I 33F spend together.

My husband 35M and I 33F have been together for 12 years. We had our first baby around a year ago and I am now pregnant again (first trimester) and I'm really unhappy about the amount of time we spend together. I am a stay at home mom and my husband works in health care, he is quite an involved dad, we have dinner as a family, do bath and bed time together but after that he just wants to play video games. We occasionally spend a few hours together in the evening watching a show but it's more often that we don't. I've started to feel lonely in our relationship and only feel like it will get worse once our second child arrives. 
I mention this to him and it is always met with push back, that he is too tired, had too much of a hard day etc, but I feel as though spending time with me should be easy? and not feel like a chore? 
Please help, not sure how to bring this up without him getting defensive again. Ask any questions you want in the comments!

ANSWER: He’s too tired to do what exactly? What are you expecting out of him when you say spending time together? Something low effort like watching a favorite show together or movie time? Do you have any interest in video games? Even if not, it may benefit you to initiate playing a co-op video game together. Make that an activity that you guys do together since he enjoys gaming. And then let him know you’d like to pick an activity once or twice a week, even if it’s something as simple as cuddling on the couch watching a show.

QUESTION: My 36F boyfriend 33M doesn’t want me texting my guy friend of 10 years

My boyfriend have been together for almost 5 years. I have a guy friend in his 50s that I have been friends with for almost 10 years. We have always joked around, sent funny memes and been absolutely more than platonic friends. He has been a listening ear and checked in on me during tough times. 

When his girlfriend died last year, I made sure to reach out and make sure he was okay and invite him to outgoings with other friends. He has even hung out with my boyfriend and I several times.  

For whatever reason, my boyfriend has disliked this guy friend the entire time we’ve dated. Now we are in a breaking point in our relationship and one of his “non negotiables” is that I no longer text my guy friend on a regular basis. This feels unreasonable to me and controlling.
How can we get past this in a way that is fair to all parties?

ANSWER: Did you mean to say “nothing more than platonic friends”?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Do I 33F leav 30M situationship without saying anything?

I (33F) have been seeing this guy (30M) for about a year and a half. I will say he is very hyper independent person and a closed book who almost finds someone caring about him an inconvenience. Well at least it feels that way. 

We were friends at first and one thing led to another organically. We connected beautifully at first, then I guess when things start to feel too real, he’ll step back and distance himself. He does this push and pull thing with me. So, this is the harder part.. when he’s going through something, he practically ghosts me. Yeh, I don’t hear a peep, it’s suddenly like he’s disappeared from the earth. I thought ok, clearly he’s just not use to having someone support him so this is how he just deals with things but then it’ll happen one too many times where I’m just like what’s the point of this if you can’t even trust me to be around during your hardest times no matter how much I respect your space, show up from a distance and patiently wait. 

I want to stick through it because he is genuinely a good person with a great heart but seems like he’d rather be alone and have be around when things are good with him.

Anyway I don’t know what to do anymore because I truly love him but I’m losing myself in the process.

ANSWER: This is a wasted effort. I promise you. I just finished waiting seven years for a man who was avoidant in the end. I finally had enough and had to end it, even though I thought he was my forever person. No amount of patience or love would ever be enough for someone who is like that.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife 37F doesn't trust me 44M and is ALWAYS trying to catch me doing something

Can someone please explain to my wife what r/roastme is? She is currently losing her mind on me because she decided to try to "bust me" doing something inappropriate and went snooping through my reddit. She has full access to my google and all my apps and everything, so I don't mind that. She saw a comment I made on a lady's post asking to be roasted on roast me. In the post the lady is wearing a pearl necklace and I commented "ah the MILF starter pack, complete with the pearl necklace".
 She has severe, SEVERE trust and abandonment issues and I just don't know what to do anymore. The smallest, most insignificant things (well, small and insignificant to ME anyway,  but maybe I'm dumb) trigger hours long screaming rants about how I don't love her and all this other stuff. I tried to circumvent all this drama by giving her full access to all my apps and accounts, but it seems to have made things worse. I hide nothing and have nothing TO hide... I don't talk to other females, I don't drink or even go out with friends anymore. Everything I do she is WITH me, she even comes to work with me everyday and waits in the truck all day until Im done. I'm a small business owner. She has me on a tracking app to see where I go in the VERY rare cases we aren't together, but even THAT caused a MASSIVE issue... One day on my way home it stated that I was at some random address because I had pulled over for about 30 seconds and it triggered a barrage of accusations. 
 Full disclosure, I was unfaithful many, MANY years ago in my younger years, but so was she. More recent than myself, in fact. 
 I just don't get it. Did I make it worse by giving her access to all my stuff? I did it thinking that she'd be able to see I wasn't trying to do anything nefarious, but it seems to have backfired and she is constantly looking for things to get angry and throw accusations at.

ANSWER: Jeez... it sounds like you are in an abusive relationship my friend.

I and my partner have been together for over 2 years. We have our spats but recently, I've been feeling neglected by her when discussing our problems. During a disagreement, she has voiced her thoughts and issues that have upset her. Every time, i apologise and offer solutions, afterwards making sure that I voice my concerns and my feelings to her, however she denies me of processing what I am thinking by reasoning her actions, leading me to always having to prompt an apology. To add, said apologies only feel as though they are said for the sake of getting the conversation done with. She then proceeds to continue reasoning herself and circling back to herself only, leaving my thoughts unresolved. She has told me on numerous accounts over a span of months that she would stop this, however she continues to reason herself, deny me any comfort and deny me from having any comfort. I have been left feeling gradually unloved more and more by the end of each argument. How am i supposed to approach her for a resolution?

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (23F) communicate my needs with my boyfriend (24M) of 7 years?

Hi y‘all!

My boyfriend (24m) and I (23f) have been together for almost 7 years now.

We obviously got together very young (16 and 17) and have been the only people we‘ve ever been with respectively. I always considered us to be very happy and close. We barely argued, never stopped joking around and being goofy together and always kind of stayed in this honeymoon phase of loveydovey behaviour.

But recently I‘ve felt a shift in our dynamic or maybe I feel like looking back I‘ve just realised that I was mostly the person initiating these things. 

It started with me realising that I was always (and I mean always) the one saying I love you first. He‘d only ever say it back to me. 

This is when cracks seemed to form. I started noticing more things. Like how he‘d never spend the night with me no matter how late it was or how long the way home.
Or how he‘d rarely initiate physical intimacy when he came over. It was mostly me.
Or how he didn’t get excited talking about our future together anymore. Whether that be imaging what our wedding would look like, baby names or just moving in together, he barely acknowledges what I say and changes the subject.

The biggest thing I started noticing was how we seemed to fall into a very specific routine that just didn’t make me happy anymore though. When we meet it usually goes like this: He comes in, I hug him quickly, he gets on the couch, we talk for a bit, we order food, we watch a series or movie or YouTube or whatever, we talk a bit in between and he leaves. 
I mean sure there’s cuddling and goofing around involved and I don’t mind spending some down time with him but he always declines other kinds of dates.

Now I know all of this makes him look uninvolved and honestly maybe he is a little bit. But it’s started making me become uninvolved too and I feel like it’s an issue on both our ends as we let this dynamic happen. 

Now my problem is I‘m really bad at communicating my needs. I always have been and it’s something I want to get better at truly.
I have started asking him questions like “Why do you never want to spend the night?“ to which I only got the answer of “I don’t know“ even after multiple attempts of rephrasing and emphasising that I want an answer, so I dropped it. 

I realise that asking questions like this is probably very loaded and makes him get defensive so I want to approach the subject differently with him. But how do I do it? Do I just sit him down and say “We need to talk“ as soon as he walks through my door next time? That feels so weird to me. 

I really need help on how I can communicate my unhappiness in a way that won’t make him become defensive but help us become close again because I really do love him and I don’t want to lose him and all these memories we‘ve made throughout the years. But I don’t want it to be like this anymore.

ANSWER: By using I statements. 


I don't feel close enough to you when we dont do anything but repeat the same routine


I want you to stay over.


Etc.


But honestly if hes not staying over after 7 years and everything is basically initiated by you, it really doesnt sound much of a reciprocal relationship. If he responds defensively to you asking for literally bare minimum shit after 7 whole years, that already says a lot.


Dont let sunk cost fallacy keep you in a relationship, memories are nice but a relationship with someone who wants you like you want them is better.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (31F) don’t know how to feel about an old friend (30F) I recently reconnected with

I could use some advice on the recent rekindling of an old friendship. I’ll try to keep the story short.

About 7 or 8 years ago, one of my college friends who I was very close with & did almost everything with tried to date a recent ex of mine, a guy who was my college boyfriend and whom I dated for most of college. We all went to school together including with our other mutual friends. 8 years ago she had a lot of issues, with an eating disorder and serious mental health stuff, and she was much more childish and immature. When I told her I was ok with her dating my ex but that I just couldn’t be around them as much (because he was still being clingy towards me and trying to stay friends, and I wanted to cut that cord with him), she looked me dead in the eyes and said, with no emotion, “That’s okay, I’m ok with our friendship ending, it doesn’t mean that much to me.”

That caused our falling out and I didn’t speak to her for like 8 years. (For the record I wasn’t dramatic at the time, I didn’t yell or anything, I just told her good luck with her life and walked away. I was very hurt that she said that to me). She went off overseas to teach English, went through a series of bad relationships, had a suicide attempt, and finally started therapy & meds and working on herself.

Now she’s moved back to the states, in a healthy new relationship, & things finally seem better for her, & she reached out to me maybe 6 months ago asking if we could meet so she could apologize to me for everything that she did when we were younger. She seemed sincerely remorseful and apologized for hurting me badly back then, and took accountability & responsibility for her actions. She told me she just wanted to right a wrong and she thought about reaching out to me so many times over the years but I had cut contact with her on most platforms and areas. 

I already forgave her a few years ago because I didn’t want to hold on to the anger and it just became old news & water under the bridge, but I can tell she’s not all the way mentally stable yet. She still has some anger and self control issues with her family (she told me about an incident two months ago where she punched her dad in the face because of how her dad was treating her cat, and her sister called the cops on her out of fear. Now she’s on probation for 2 years). This really surprised me. I don’t necessarily feel unsafe around her because she’s always been super calm & laidback & has never acted out in my presence, but after hearing that, I have only seen her in person once or twice in groups & that’s all the in person time I’ve had around her so far. 

It seems like she wants to start a new friendship with me, and I’m not opposed to it, but I’m wondering if it’s a good idea to proceed, or if I should try to keep the door closed? I’m considering proceeding with caution, and maybe only seeing her in public places with other people, but idk what to do. I’ve never been through this kind of situation. Usually any old friends I’ve cut off or that have cut me off I’ve kept in the past. Thanks for any help.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Do I (30F) tell my friend (37F) that our other friend (38F) needs space from her?

This feels genuinely absurd to type out because we are all adults. But you don't really consider how much of this teenage drama happens purely because you are all in the same place all the time. 

I'm getting my Master's degree, and at the beginning of the program, I quickly formed a friendship with three other women; Gina (37), Gabriella (38) and Claire (36). 

In the first year, we maintained a pretty solid friend group, however, throughout the year I became tired and stressed by some of Gina's personality traits. But by the end of the year we had talked through it, and I felt we were on better terms.

This second year, we've split off into more specialized research. Gabriella, Claire, and I are all in the same department, and Gina is in a different one, but we are all still on the same campus, and we will often meet up for lunch or coffee breaks or whatever when our schedules allow. 

Claire and I like Gina, but can find her draining. Gabriella on the other hand is pretty done with her.

It's been helpful to have a bit of space from Gina since we're in different programs, but she is highly anxious and neurotic and feels very left out. Claire and I make a point to message in the group chat when we want lunch or a break to see if any of the other girls are around. Gabrielle does not; she will find me or Claire directly if she wants to have lunch with us.

Earlier this week, Gabrielle specifically scheduled to have lunch with me today. And last night, I was texting Gina, and she told me 'let's see each other tomorrow.' Not lunch specifically. When Gabrielle and I were heading for lunch, I did consider inviting Gina, but knew Gabrielle didn't want that, so I didn't and figured I'd have a break with Gina later. 

But at lunch, another friend of ours -- who is in the same program as Gina -- saw Gabrielle and I having lunch together and reported back, and now Gina is hurt and upset with me, because this is proof to her that we are excluding her and don't want her around. And it's half true, Gabrielle didn't want her there, but I'd have been happy to have lunch with her. 

But it's not my business to tell Gina that Gabriella needs space from her. And at the same time, Gina feels the distance and is being extremely neurotic about it and asking me about it, and I keep having to sorta obfuscate or dodge the question.

We were even all planning a weekend trip in a few weeks, and I've backed out because I just can't bear this weird dynamic between Gina and Gabrielle anymore. I wish Gabrielle would just tell her, and I think she's moving in that direction, but I don't know how to deal in the mean time balancing both friendships and with Gina thinking I'm intentionally excluding her. 

Idk, what would you do?

ANSWER: Were I you, a grown woman in what's probably a demanding MA program, what I would do is accept that all these other people are likewise adults and can manage their own lives and relationships. It's just not your problem if "Gina" is "neurotic" or "Gabriella" is over her. "Gabriella" can either communicate this to "Gina" or not talk to her at all. You're not the den mother of this group and you probably need to just conduct yourself with each of these people to the degree you wish to but let them sort out whatever differences or difficulties they may have with each other.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Help me understand this situation with my (19F) boyfriend’s (19M) mum

I’d like to hear some of your opinions because I honestly don’t know what I’m doing wrong.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year, and I’ve always known he doesn’t have a good relationship with his mother, probably because of past abuse. She has always been kind to me, even though I’ve seen how badly she argues with him.

Recently, my boyfriend bought me an expensive ring for my birthday. That same day, he told me not to show it to his mother because she thought he shouldn’t spend so much money on “someone who won’t stay anyway.”

I felt sad thinking she didn’t believe I had serious intentions with him. My boyfriend told me they argued about it, which made me feel even worse. He was irritated, but said he’s used to it.

Now I’ve found out that she thinks I talked back to her the other day. My boyfriend’s room isn’t very big, so when I come over it gets a bit messier (nothing extreme, just a few more things around, mostly his). My boyfriend wasn’t in the room; it was just me. She came in to put clean clothes in his drawers and said to me loudly, “This room is always messy, why don’t you tidy it up? You should know, you’re a woman.” I jokingly replied, “Men can tidy up after themselves too,” thinking she was just tired of cleaning after her husband and son. I wanted her to feel like she shouldn’t have to do everything alone, and in fact she answered, “As if he would ever bother to do it.” Then she scoffed and left the room. I didn’t think much of it, because she acts like this with everyone, it’s just her personality.

But now my boyfriend told me she went to him complaining that I had “talked back” and that she thought I was smarter than that. I feel both sad and irritated. It was so obvious I wasn’t trying to be rude, and my tone was NOT aggressive. Besides, it’s her son’s room, not mine. I do tidy up sometimes if there’s a lot of mess, but as a mother I would never expect my son’s girlfriend to clean his room.

I just wish she wasn’t so aggressive and defensive about everything. I’ve lost a lot of respect for her, and now I feel a bit uncomfortable interacting with her. She doesn’t know that I know…

TL;DR: My boyfriend’s mother says I talked back to her about cleaning her son’s room and doesn’t think I have serious intentions with him.

ANSWER: This mum is obviously a little crispy and it would probably be great if her son (your boyfriend) didn't talk about the things he buys you nor have you in his room very often. Your "respect" for her is irrelevant, she's not your peer. She's the person the guy you're dating is apparently still financially dependent on and must maintain some semblance of a relationship. You don't have to get along with her. Just stay out of her way.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (23m) boyfriend’s best friend told him to try hitting me. Am I (20f) overreacting for wanting to leave ?

Long story short, my bfs best friend hates me because he heard a single part of a fight 8 months ago and decided from there. He’s said some awful things, like I’m a crazy bitch and that I should basically kill myself. I’ve asked my bf to stop going to him for advice and he continues doing so. Recently, we had a fight and I asked him not to speak to said friend, and he did anyways. His friends advice was “have you tried hitting her?” This is my final straw. I’ve asked him to stop being friends with this guy so many times even though maybe it’s bossy, and I’m at the point where I’m going to breakup with him if he doesn’t cut this person off. We live together, I’ve told him how badly his friends words hurt, and he apologies but says they are childhood friends and he won’t stop being friends with him. I’m almost ready to tell him it’s time to choose, but I think he’ll choose his friend.

ANSWER: No you’re not overreacting and yes you should leave if he doesn’t cut this person off

================================================================================

QUESTION: Is my (43F) BF (40M) choosing a "business gig" and his new "associate" over me? or am I being insecure??

My (43F) boyfriend (40M) and I recently moved together (he left his rental apartment and moved to the apartment that I own), after one year together. Initially he was very sweet and attentive and all days were full of joy at home... but I feel things are changing. He lives off his investments and has lots of free time and he likes to organise social events at bars. I have a full time job and don't like drinking and bars too much, so let's say we have different lifestyles.... Recently we attended one event and sat together with other people, among them a woman that later contacted him and proposed to organise events together at that bar. He said yes.  He's being paid for it, around 500$/month. The thing is I attended the events and the woman was systematically ignoring me, even learning the names of people around me and talking to them, but never addressing me directly, when she knows me and knows I am the girlfriend. I tried to be friendly once and greet her, thinking she might be shy, and she turned her back on me, pretending not to see me when I was 50cm from her face. I didn't want to think much of this and wanted to be supportive since this seems to be very important for him. But when my BF said that he was going to do events with her more often, I finally told him about this and that I didn't like the woman, and he was dismissive and said I exaggerated...he even told me to go with him to the woman's solo events. He also acknowledged that she has invited him out a couple of times to go to events with her friends and never mentioned me. I was angry for a few days and told him that I would find a new hobby for his event nights, a place where I can feel welcome. He suggested I stayed home instead, and when I said no, he proposed to have a date the day before ( I suspect so I'd be too tired the next day to go out without him...).  After some days and new conversations where I told him I needed his support and feel that we are a team, etc. or our relationship would not last, he finally apologised seriously; he said he will cut ties with the woman soon, that he doesn't like her either, and these days he is being really lovely and attentive, doing everything I ask, etc. I was happy and willing to give him an opportunity, but today something weird happened. He told me he had printed new flyers for his events because now they will say "pet friendly" since this woman proposed that and said she has many friends with dogs that would attend and that likely the events will be more successful. Well, he knows I am very scared of big dogs since I almost was attacked once,...we have talked about this and when we find big dogs in the street I always ask him to "protect" me half joking, half serious. So I said "Yeah, I don't like dogs", and he said "I do", then he said "I'm not making it easy for you to return to my events", and I said "No", and that was all. I really didn't know what to say then. It almost feels as if he is kind of resentful towards me. 

I have to say that I come from a problematic family and never had good references on how a loving partner behaves and how far he will go for his girlfriend. So with these issues I'm always doubtful thinking if I exaggerate and should give less importance to this and find another hobby to spend the nights he's in the now "pet friendly" events, give him space to do things without me...or, in the other hand, if I should expect a loving boyfriend to reject a possibility for more audience to his gigs, prioritising that I can attend them first. So, what's your opinion on this matter, and the level of commitment of my boyfriend? ... I have to clarify that I don't think there is anything romantic going on between them and that except for these weekly events he spends most of his time with me, doing things together. I am 100% sure that he's not interested in that woman. He's very interested in organising those events though.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (24F) may be living in an enmeshed family (64M, 62F)

So I’ve recently become aware of the term “enmeshment” and want some input

I’m 24. My entire life, my parents, especially my mother, have controlled my every move. When I was little, I was never allowed to go outside because my mother thought the neighbors would hurt me. As I got older, I was forced to pull away from friends and isolate myself. I have struggled with depression and gender dysphoria for well over a decade, but was never allowed to receive treatment

Now, I’m a college graduate, have a job, my own apartment, everything, and my parents are still just all over me. They come up to see me after work 3-4 times a week, I’m not allowed to do my own shopping or laundry, they insist they pay part of my rent, if it’s raining they’ll come drop me off or pick me up from work because they don’t want me getting wet, they call and text nonstop and if I don’t immediately reply they either get angry or panic, they’re immediately suspicious of any hints that I have friends, and I’ve been working on transitioning but I’m overwhelmed with guilt, knowing that transitioning would destroy them and cause a nuclear meltdown of rage and depression. Cutting them off seems like a massive safety risk both for me and for them

Is this enmeshment?

ANSWER: Are you afraid she would hurt you or your dad? It really seems to me you should get into therapy and work on a lot of this with someone who can know the details and help you develop a plan to seperate safely from your parents and establish your own identity.

QUESTION: How do I (22F) go about not feeling resentment towards my boyfriend (24M)

Me and my boyfriend have been dating for about 2 years now. Our main issue right now is that I saw he followed his ex and another girl he used to talk to on instagram. He has done this before and i’ve let it slide but to be honest im kind of sick of always telling him that it’s wrong. he says “oh well its just a follow” and well obviously it’s just a follow but it’s the principle of the situation. i’ve told him i don’t like that he does that and he does it again. We went through a rough patch in our relationship when we were about to hit the 1 year mark and i struggled with forgiving him. he would get upset when i would bring it up so i just had to get through it by myself. i felt resentment towards him where i did want to continue the relationship but i was just so mad and upset with him and i feel the same way now. He says that he will be there for me this time but my best friend says i should just break up with him. is that true?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Am I (27m) being unreasonable to my girlfriend (26f)?

My girlfriend of 5 years (likely ex at some point soon) recently encouraged me take some time off work  and move back in with my parents for a couple of weeks as she could see I haven't been the same recently and often quite tense, stressed and lost my mojo in life. She rightly identified this, so I eventually agreed to this as I thought it would be good for me to have some space from our house as I've began to associate it with being isolated etc.

We adopted a dog together a couple of months ago, it is mostly her dog, it's in her name and she was the one who wanted it. Now, I got signed off work and have come home a couple of weeks ago and she told me on the first day of me being gone that 'she was unsure about the relationship' and whether she thinks we could make things work, and in all honesty, I agree. Things had been different recently, and it was becoming increasingly obvious to me that my needs weren't being met as I kept bending over backwards to fit my life arounds hers (and the dog).

Now it's only been a week and half since I've been gone, and twice I've had to drive an hour then and an hour back to look after the dog whilst she's at work as she works long shifts. She has now asked again if I could go over this weekend to look after the dog as she wants to spend the day with her friends. I politely explained that I wouldn't do that since a) the whole point of me having time off work, and away from the flat is to work on mental health and get back to being 'me' and b) I've already helped out twice since leaving.

She is now annoyed with me and thinks I'm being unreasonable, a part of me feels guilty, but another part of me feels like I need to stand my ground with this one.

What do you think?

ANSWER: Did you guys discuss the dog before you moved back with your parents? Do you feel less stressed at your parents? (Second question is huge because if so, I would think long and hard about a future with her.) It sounds to me like she wants a dog sitter and the freedom of her own home. Stand your ground. You’re not the dog sitter.

QUESTION: My [21 F] crush [21 M]’s bsf [21M] likes me

Okay so i had a crush on a guy (i prolly still do) and we were having a ALOT of eye contact. At first, it was just me crushing alone then this one random day he couldn’t stop staring at me. Even in crowd his eyes would find me. Then we didn’t see each other two months.. when he did see each other tho again had an eye contact which lasted four secs (god i sound so lovesick but yk precision matters) i could see a smile building on his face but i passed him. He even gave some sign to his friend that day after which his friend started noticing me in passing too. Well after that four second eye contact.. we again didn’t see each other for two n half months. When we did, we got to looking at each other in corridors, strolling around each other’s class just to look inside. It was sweet. I felt oh so high school (yeah yeah i am in college second year and he is in third year) He shows me off to his another friend V now. Everything is going fine. He is coming to uni everyday unlike last year when he’d come like once every two weeks. He suddenly had variety of clothings unlike last year when he chose a two piece of clothing for a sem and religiously repeated them. And he is really shy i guess. Like there were times when i caught him looking and he’d look away in panic and stare at the ground like a embarrassed schoolboy. 

Now V (my senior and his bestfriend) asks me to join their hackathon team. I knew who else would be in that team so i say yes. My boy (crush) was beaming the day i said yes to the hackathon and the next day. I was over the moon too and so impressed that he made this whole plan to get me in their team n all. Now the problem started. V never introduced me to the other two team members (my crush included) and once V (with my crush) approached me n my friend asked me to hangout with him while my crush just stood there, stared at me and again didn’t introduce himself. Me and V walked around the campus for like five minutes and i asked for a leave. That was the day i realised that maybe V likes me i didn’t completely believe it at that time. He asked me to hung out with him one more time. I said yes yk just so i can gauge if this is friendly or actual liking and yes he likes me. Now my crush is avoiding me, doesn’t come to uni if he does he would look everywhere but at me. Like i am medusa. So well i don’t know i just wanna know what’s happening here. Was he only looking at me for seven months (including 4 n half months break) cuz he liked my attention? Cuz yk obv if he liked me his friend won’t be stepping in, right?

================================================================================

QUESTION: [25m[24f] my ex-girlfriend is still someone who I still deeply care about and I live with their grandma on the off season of my work sometimes and help her out. And I found out for her that she may be dying and even though we ended up rough I still have a lot of mixed feelings and concern for this?

And I'm not really sure how to go about this.vl I respect their boundaries, I do wish to be invited to your funeral if it does happen because I'm still very much the love with her I've done my best at moving on and creating my own life but the feelings never stop and the hole never left and probably will never realistically leave. But how do I show that I respect her boundaries but  also show I am concerned because her family has took me in as one of their own and so I'm not really sure how to go about this cuz she has a bit more disdain for me. I won't pretend that I understand with the breakup or her reasons because I don't I do my best that processing things but sometimes I'm just not good at it.  Been spending last 5 years since then working on myself trying to better myself but I also am quite saddened by it and I'm not Shure what to do. Therapist won't work I've had three never really got anywhere with them and I'm also broke with no health insurance and from what I've heard free ones aren't that great. It does not really sure how to navigate this and I lack the friendship group to have this kind of conversation with and I'm not really sure how to process this. I don't want to bother a family with this because well they have to deal with this on their own and I'm technically an outsider although they help me take care of me and I help them where I can I am still not technically part of it.

================================================================================

QUESTION: New relationship, I (23M) am somewhat unsure about her (25F). What can I do?

I've been dating this girl for 1,5 months now. Last weekend we talked and ended up making it 'official'. But to be honest, I've had doubts the entire time.

The reason I went with it is because on paper we are extremely compatible. Similar views on society, our future. We both have gone through a lot of the same things in our life so we understand each other really well.

She's extremely sweet, mature, really good at communicating, SO beautiful , my mother loves her, I get along with her mother really well too. She's someone I think I would rarely ever have fights with. She likes cooking and loves to do it for me which I really adore, loves nature and animals as much as I do, will take care of me and be there for me as much as I will be there for her too, ... So there's a lot of good things.

BUT ...

I'm somewhat unsure about the chemistry we have still. I often think things like "Is this really it?". I can make her laugh and she appreciates my humor, but she doesn't really make me laugh in return. And I feel like this is more important to me than I previously thought.

I'm probably autistic and have a social anxiety disorder + generalized anxiety disorder, which makes initially 'clicking' with people very hard, and some of the friendships I have needed some growing towards each other too. So it's probably on my part too, for not quite being as comfortable and relaxed around her yet as I would like to be. But I'm just really worried that I'm trying to hope for something to develop which just isn't there, and wasting her time in the process and possibly breaking her heart as she seems to be really into me.

During some moments I feel something for her, but then other times I don't really, and I get  this feeling in my gut that something isn't right. That this isn't really what I was looking for. I struggle trusting this feeling though cause I'm a very anxious, overthinking mess and this influences that a lot.

But it's really hard to know for me what to do, cause I believe love can grow through time, and often as I wrote earlier the 'click' I get with people gets better through time too.

My mother thinks I should give it a serious chance, and I'm thinking the same thing, cause what if the connection does get better? Then I have this absolutely amazing girlfriend beside me.

I just don't want to break her heart and lead her on for a long time, while knowing I wasn't sure basically from the beginning. (I'm never sure about anything though ... damn anxiety)

What do you all think about this? Have any of you been through the same thing, stuck with it, and ended up in a great relationship? Or has the opposite happened?

Any and all thoughts are appreciated. Cheers! <3

================================================================================

QUESTION: Please help me (25M) process crush on coworker (25F)?

Posted a similar thread recently, accidentally deleted it. 

I have a crush on a coworker that’s taken and I’m not really sure how to process it. We work in extremely close physical proximity so I don’t have an option to distance myself. She’s been in a very long LDR and there’s no signs of that situation ever changing (they don’t want to move to where the other is living) and no signs of the guy taking action and getting a ring. 

I really haven’t heard anything positive about this guy, and she’s shared with me things that she “doesn’t really tell other people” (her words). She’s shared a lot with me about her life, her worries, her interests. I know all about her family, what her siblings do for work and their names, etc etc. We have  really good connection at work and we laugh all the time. She even laughs at my darker jokes when others don’t. We have really good rapport. At a coworker event, one of her friends even made a comment that were like the “dynamic duo”. 

I’ve been working on making myself feel a little less crazy about this situation because I was definitively feeling some Limerence. For a hot minute I was overanalyzing non-verbal signals.  How much eye contact is more than normal, who she’s facing in a group setting, stuff like that. Unfortunately (fortunately?) there’s definitively data to suggest that there is a bit of a preference for me. 

We text semi-frequently. I initiate most of them, but she’s almost always super quick to respond back, and incredibly warm in person. She initiates conversation at work a lot, shows me memes, etc etc. It also doesn’t help that I’m a bit on the spectrum. 

All that being said, I don’t want to be the “other guy” but I had a hard time reconciling my feelings. I really enjoy our friendship too and worried about ruining that as well. I just really don’t know how to proceed. I feel like I’m getting legitimate subtle signals and I don’t really know what to do. I’m not doing the creepy thing that guys do and obsessively orbit around her, waiting for an opening. I just feel like we’re got really good chemistry and it feels like there’s more to it. I’d appreciate some advice on this. Thank you so much and have a wonderful day. 

edit adding another piece of information that has me feeling conflicted but should probably be noted. All of the more intimate details about her life that she’s shared with me have occurred after she found out that I was no longer in a relationship.

ANSWER: A friend of mine went through something very similar, but in the end, she only wanted to be friends. So, based on what you've said, I suggest you keep the friendship as it is for now. Since she has a partner, in your case, I would wait for her to make the first move or for time to clarify things

================================================================================

QUESTION: Am I (19F) toxic for not wanting to end a friendship of 4 years that my boyfriend (20M) is jealous of?

Some context before I begin: I met my boyfriend three months ago at university because we study the same major, so we talked a lot. At the end of October, we started dating. As for the friend in question, that I’ll call him CC(18M) to avoid confusion, I met him four years ago when we were teenagers (I was 15, he was 14) on Discord. We were originally part of a group of eight people, but earlier this year some fights happened, and in the end only he and I stayed friends. I didn’t (and still don’t) have any friendships outside that group that fell apart.

I introduced CC early on to my now-boyfriend because I talked about both of them a lot. CC thought I would never get into anything with a guy I had just met, especially since I had said I didn’t want a relationship for a while, so he treated me with the same humor and jokes as always. CC always treated me like he treats his male friends, so flirty jokes or playful things like making kissing noises when we were locked in a game room together were normal. There was also a night when CC and I were talking about the old friend group and he mentioned that at the beginning of the group (four years ago) he had a crush on me, but as we got closer he realized he only saw me as a friend. All of this was before my boyfriend and I started flirting and eventually dating.

Recently, my boyfriend has been saying he feels jealous of CC because of those things that happened before our relationship, even though CC stopped making those jokes after I told him I was dating someone. I sometimes bring my boyfriend into calls I have with CC, whether we’re gaming or talking, because my boyfriend says he doesn’t like the idea of me and CC being alone in voice chat. So he has seen with his own eyes that nothing’s going on. But today we had a conflict where he implied that he’ll only feel less worried if I cut ties with CC. He says he trusts me, but he doesn’t trust CC. I told him I wouldn’t sacrifice the only friendship I have, because I’m afraid of ending up in an abusive relationship if I have no one to talk to in case something happens. After that, we both went our separate ways to cool off. I still believe in what I said during the conflict, but I feel horrible and scared this will snowball into a breakup, is there a way to make both sides happy in this situation? (Before anyone asks “Why don’t you talk to family or try to make new friends?”. My parents once encouraged me to stay in a relationship where the person raped me, saying “you’re just a crybaby and you’ll get used to it.” I’ve tried making friends at college, but I constantly feel academic competitiveness or transactional dynamics with the girls I try to befriend. It was already a miracle to find someone like my boyfriend.)



TL;DR: I (19F) have one long-term online friend, CC, whom I’ve known for 4 years. He used to make flirty jokes before I started dating my boyfriend (20M), but has stopped completely. My boyfriend is jealous and says he’ll only feel secure if I cut CC off, even though I’ve been transparent and let him join our calls. I refused because CC is my only friend and I’m afraid of losing all support if my relationship ever becomes unhealthy. Now I feel guilty and scared this will lead to a breakup.

ANSWER: I didn’t need to read beyond the title and the first line for the red flags to distract me. Asking a partner to dump a friend because they’re jealous is a hard no at any time. Asking them after meeting them 12 weeks ago?! Ruuunnn from this man. 

OP, I know you said you don’t want to breakup but please - as an older woman and someone who works in DV - the level of controlling it takes to not want your partner to even be in a voice call because of jealousy is a level of controlling that will escalate and become dangerous.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Someone help me understand if I’m overreacting please?I (21f) found out my (23m) bf was using Kratom again , but he’s been lying to my face.

So when we started dating he told me he was taking Kratom. Now I know people have their opinions on it but I told him I don’t fw any types of pills bc my mom abused drugs and it affected me deeply growing up and she also lied to my face about it. So it felt like dejavu. And he was using a lot at the time, and spending all of his money on it. So I felt he was addicted, and at the time he said he felt he had a problem . He promised to stop for me bc I told him it was a dealbreaker . Fast forward to a few days ago, he went outside and grabbed something out of his car(I saw in the window).. I asked him what he was doing and he said he was outside feeding the cats. I looked him dead in the eyes “I saw you go to your car and grab something. What was it” he said “I was just looking for something” he wouldn’t tell me what it was and he initially lied completely .. eventually like ten minutes later he told me he took Kratom. Claims he got it from a friend and he hasn’t done it any other times besides this one but I don’t believe him. He has lied about important things before, and addiction I know is a heavy thing and people who use don’t ever consider other people’s feelings. But for months he’s been acting like he has been using, showing signs all the time. He can’t get hard sometimes, he can’t cum sometimes, he’s not in the mood some days and that usually doesn’t happen. He has mood swings . He fell asleep driving. He lied to me and disrespected me on so many levels. But i love him, so i want to stay with him and help him. I just don’t know what to do.

ANSWER: Can just find someone else on the same page as you with regards to the topic at hand. I know easier said than done but this ain’t changing. This isn’t a fix it thingy.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I'm starting to feel like my (19F) boyfriends (19M) mom (45F) acts weird towards him

His parents are strict, his room is labeled the ''quiet, isolate'' room, which is usually what her excuse is for randomly being inside without asking him first, he usually finds her randomly with little to no explanation, she also uses the room for work, phone calls etc.

It doesn't have a door, but it's also connected to their living room which has a door. (how's it isolate if it doesn't even have a door? i don't know)

He doesn't usually sleep in his bed instead he sleeps on the living room couch which he decided, but he uses the room frequently besides that, so his room is used for sleep arrangements for guests that come over (males only) and by his parents when they argue (mostly his mom from what I've heard) she also does this because "it has a window, and she likes sleeping with air on her" his window is right by his bed and apparently she's very picky with how she gets her hot air.

There is 1 spare bed in his sister's room for her to sleep in, but she stays up late for exams, he also has to change the sheets every time he finally wants to use his bed. I find it weird that his mother runs to a different bed in general whenever she has a disagreement, even if it isn't weird that she's sleeping in her child's bed avoiding your husband frequently to the point that you don't want to be near him and giving up your bed for it seems childish to me. I don't think it's a good example for children and it's just toxic.

She also gives him small tasks like getting snacks, etc. that in my opinion a husband would be more fit for.

(most of you are probably going to say he needs to make boundaries, I know and I've tried convincing him, saying no to her will probably cause an argument/drama)

He gets bothered about these things sometimes as well, and he says it's normal for his parents to go and sleep in different rooms whenever they argue.

I really want to know how other people see this situation.

ANSWER: Okay, the details are ringing all kinds of bells for me. Are we dating the same guy? There's a secret room connected to the living room. He sleeps on the couch.

QUESTION: 💜 Rekindling💜 38F 44M

I’m usually a looker..and just reading all your stories, 💜 which made me learn a lot from all of your experiences.

My other half and I have been together for a year and 1/2. We’ve had some close calls of ending it, we are learning about each other, more or so recently, we both have paths of trauma, childhood and previous relationships, communication was hard at first, lots and lots of shutting down, we’re both pretty bull headed, even after a very ugly fight and words were said that was hurtful..we still choose us, never in a million years did we ever feel like we had to run the other way and cheat or talk to someone about our relationship..I told him that today and said that I appreciated he still was choosing me..that is our fuel..that is the glue that is holding us..that was my realization and wake up call even through the chaos ,  half of me and half of him threw a lot of good qualities away..meaning the main question, “what can I do for my spouse today” Even small gestures went away..writing love notes or whatever.

I don’t wanna lose the good spot we’re in 💜 we’re still building our empire..but would like to know what will help to keep the progress going, he said the other day, when I let him sleep and I lost sleep, but I got up and took care of what needed to be done, and still went to work, he works more hours then I do, so he needed the rest, he said “You sacrificed your own self for me to recover. You recognized me baby girl.  You seen i was struggling and didn't put your foot on my back to hold me down you gave me what I needed to get back up and provide for my family.  You made me feel like your man again. And I fell in love ❤️ all over again.  You reminded me I worth love.”

How do I keep that going? He looked at me that day with lust and I’m in love look..throw your best advice 💜

He’s an amazing man, and never had someone choose me and not give up

================================================================================

QUESTION: I M21 hit a rough patch with my girlfriend F21.

For context, my ex and I were in a relationship from August 2023 to May 2024, we broke up in May because I got really close with my co-worker F20, we hung out outside of work and spent time together. I DID NOT PHYSICALLY CHEAT ON HER. I did not tell my girlfriend at the time because I didn't think it was a big deal because nothing happened. However, when my girlfriend found out about this, she naturally got very upset and kicked me out of her house. After this she texted me a lot out of concern and my mom convinced me to block her phone number.
After this happened my coworker admitted to me that she had been attempting to manipulate me into breaking up with my girlfriend so that I could be with her. Once I found this out, I cut her off and went back to my girlfriend. In December of 2024 we broke up again, this time I really missed her and didn't want the relationship to end but she did and after we broke up, she hopped around from guy to guy. There was a repeated pattern of her finding a new guy and then unblocking me, and then reblocking me to get with another guy, this happened a couple of times.
As of October 2025 we had been together for 3 months and then she ended things with me abruptly after things had been going very well this time. For the 3 months we had dated this year everything was actually good and I thought it would work out this time. But she broke up with me for the reasoning that I "was not disciplined" , "don't have a job" , and that she "woke up one day and didn't feel like it anymore". This makes no sense to me because I am a full-time student with a full-time internship, it's not that I'm unemployed I just literally do not have any time for a job between my school and internship.
I'm very confused about her reasoning because it contradicts her behavior towards me entirely, she never gave signs towards disliking me and quite honestly her reasons were pretty bullshit. Now she's been hanging out with this new guy, and they seem to be very close in a relationship way. And I am also blocked on everything, and she said if i reached out again she would contact authorities; but she has told me this before and never followed through with it (I HAVE NOT REACHED OUT TO HER SINCE SHE SAID THIS TO ME). I would like advice as to what this behavior even means and keep in mind that I am absolutely desperate for her I am so in love with her I do not want to end the relationship but that's the common advice I am getting. Still, I don't want to do that. Please give me advice on how to deal with this situation and if the best option really is to give her up. 

Does this mean she never liked me? Yes or no.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (27F) pull my boyfriend (25M)out of victim mentality?

Me and my boyfriend have been together for 2.5 years. We met when we both started our graduate degree as international students, became close as friends and then started dating.

But unfortunately it has been literally one crisis after another for him. From our 3rd semester onwards he was struggling to pass a language exam on which his admission to the course was dependent. He failed that exam multiple times and got exmatriculated. Then there was the struggle of finding a spot in another university within a short timeframe. When the new course started, it was the insecurity and fear of the cycle repeating another semester. Then he failed a couple of exams there too. Then there was the struggle of low grades, the research project, working a tiring minimum wage job to pay for his living expenses. Then his grandmother passed way and then his childhood pet. Now he has been looking for internship opportunities for over 4 months and has done 70+ applications without a positive reply. It was been a terrible terrible time for him. 

I’ve tried to be with him through all of it patiently but somehow, other than the deaths, I feel like he is atleast partly responsible for the situation he is in. He used to struggle to wake up in the morning and miss a lot of classes when we were in the same university. Day started at 10-11, long breakfast in front  of TV and then lunch, a short nap. He would start doing productive work only in the evening. I might just be a morning person but if felt too me like he doesn’t understand that sometimes you’ve to put more effort to get more things done. 

I sometimes feel alone because my problems always seem to be lesser than his. I’ve had to get through the same exam stress, working part time to earn a living (although it was office work), move again for exchange semester and research projects , search for internships, move back again and find thesis work and now job hunt for full time role. 

TBH, it has been hard last couple of months since I have been job hunting and it is a difficult time to find a full time role. But whenever I share about it, I get the same you are atleast in a better position than me, look at me struggling to atleast get to your position.. 

I want to be there for him, but I also want to pull him out of the struggling mindset. How do I approach this? 


TL;DR:
My boyfriend (25M) has faced nonstop academic and personal setbacks for years, some caused by circumstance and some by his own habits. I’ve supported him through all of it, but he often compares his struggles to mine and dismisses what I’m going through. I’m exhausted and feel like he’s stuck in a victim mindset, and I don’t know how to support him without carrying the emotional weight of everything. How do I help him shift out of this mindset?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (M 33) gf (F 36) not talking to me after very minor conflict. What can I even do here?

So, she came round my house last week Friday, previous to which I cleaned everything, made sure I had anything she wanted in he fridge, ingredients to cook nice meals for her and plans to spend a day shopping where she could help me buy clothes and a nice Thai meal in the evening.

So Friday comes around, I cook a beautiful chickpea and lentil curry which she loves, after which we start chilling on the sofa and put a movie on.

Shortly after the movie has started, she starts taking all of the thighs that I normally have on my coffee table and moving them all elsewhere, I ask her not to do that to which her reply was 'you can move it all back there when I'm gone', which, frustrated, I replied "I will." She sat in silence through the movie, pushed my hand away from hers when I tried to hold it, when I asked if she was annoyed with me, she said she was hurt, I asked what she was hurt about, to which she replied "Everything." and refused to say anymore, didn't want to talk at all. When the movie was finished, I tried to get her to open up, talk to me and apologized for probably overreacting to her moving my things. She said nothing, said she wants to be alone and will be sleeping on the sofa and leaving in the morning, which all happened.

Said nothing for the rest of the day after leaving, didn't reply to my messages until the next day, where I just said I wanted to understand what's going on with her, which she then exploded in to:
The weekend that she was looking forward to was ruined
The coffee table was gross and unwelcoming
Me replying 'I will' was disgusting 
That I'm not putting effort in and my hospitality is 'selective'
and that I gave her so much shit that she didn't deserve.

I apologised again for the tone of the I will and forgetting to clean the coffee table (there was a bit of dust on there), but also said that the suggestion that I'm not putting effort is actually kind of hurtful, the reply being 'you can find it however you want'. 

Forward to tonight, she's replying to messages some times, but mostly single words and leaving me on read.

What on earth can I even do here?

ANSWER: You can nope out of this and date a sane person who appreciates you

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (23M) can’t work up the courage to breakup with my girlfriend (22F). What is the best course of action here?

I (23M) have been dating my girlfriend (22F) for a little over 3 years now. We get along well, hardly ever argue, see each other multiple times a week. However for the past 2 months or so I can’t shake the thought that she isn’t the person for me. More and more I find myself wanting to do things by myself or with friends. She hasn’t done anything wrong, but over the years our relationship has started to feel (at least for me) like a really good friendship. My sex drive has always been really high and for the first half of our relationship we were having sex multiple times a week but now it takes a lot for me to get to the point of wanting to do that with her even twice a month. There’s also moments where she mentions marriage and our future together and honestly I just have a really hard time seeing myself there with her. I’ve been spiralling for about 2 weeks now thinking on what to do and hoping this feeling goes away. Any advice is appreciated!!

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I 32F stop feeling numb with my fiance 31M?

DISCLAIMER: mentions of suicide and self harm

I (32F) currently live with my fiance (31M) 'M' and two roommates.  We've been together about a year and a half.  Moved in together about a month ago, got engaged a couple weeks ago (on Halloween). We've never really argued before. Both of us come from family trauma, a history of cutting, and suicide attempts.

He's a personal trainer and takes my physical health very seriously. I have a bad habit of not eating some days and don't enjoy working out. Having a physical job until recently kept me in shape. And I have very bad insomnia but also chronic fatigue. He said I drink too much soda, shouldn't eat canned soup so often, etc etc

At first I liked how he would ask if I've eaten, reminded me to drink water, etc. But a couple months ago he told me all these things I wasn't doing to improve my sleep and I got mad and shut down for an hour or so. Due to my family, when I'm upset I isolate. No talking no touching, not even eye contact. I told him then I didn't like when advice was unsolicited or when it felt more critical than affectionate. I've recently gone NC with my family because of their constant critism and expectations (i.e. I published a book and my dad rolled his eyes and said "you could've written a dozen by now"). I struggle with perfectionism. I thought he understood then.

Yesterday I went to his big gym with him and I was going to jog on the treadmill but I got winded fast so I just walked. In the car after I admitted it to him and he said "you need a personal trainer" and started going on and on about ways to get me to enjoy going to the gym. He even suggested a competition between the two of us.I tried to gently bring him down ("I dont like the idea of competing with you" "I've known for a while but when I was younger I had sports") and when he kept pushing I snapped. Tears running down my face, screaming "everything i do is wrong isnt it? What I eat, how I sleep, how I work out, everything! I'm sick of it!" He tried to say something and I said "I dont want to talk right now". When we got home I handed him the keys and walked through the neighborhood in tears. It was a bit before I realized he followed me. So I walked home, went into the bedroom, and locked the door. For 3 hours. I knew we had to talk but it's so hard for me. I was so angry and yet so numb. I realized I needed to take him to the car shop to pick up his car (oil change) and the whole time didn't say a word. He asked "did you want to talk?" And I didn't answer and I thought that was obvious. When he got his car I texted him "we need to talk" (yes even that was hard for me to do). So when we got home I said I wanted to walk the 2 miles to a nearby bar because I needed a drink and because I didn't want our roommates to hear. I told him I was angry, how he's always telling me to improve but never the other way around. I told him we'd been through this exact argument months ago and he claims he cannot for the life of him remember. And I guess I got really angry because I said "this is why I'm better off alone. Im happiest by myself" (what I meant was it's easier to be alone). I guess that broke his heart because he broke down sobbing. I've only ever seen him cry twice and it was small tears. But he sobbed. Then after a while got really angry, punching the fence and screaming that the cold shoulder i gave him was disgusting and how anger never solved anything. We cooled off, got Mexican food, walked home, and went to bed. He understood I couldn't handle physical contact of any kind. I hated that I felt guilty. I wanted to sleep on the couch but I felt guilty about that too. I thought I would feel better in the morning (could NOT sleep at all) but I just feel numb. He tried to cuddle, and I just let him because I felt guilty about that even though I wanted to ask for space. We went to McDonald's and I broke down again. Saying im angry for feeling guilty when I did nothing wrong. Im angry that the only times he's shown anger is at me (he once witnessed a fight with my parents and told them I needed space but didn't show much emotion). I'm just...hollow. I dont know how to move on. I don't know if its him or my trauma or even PMS. I wish I could ask for a more sincere apology. I wish he understood why I got mad. He said he won't offer advice anymore and said he can see why to a normal person that would be upsetting but "it's just the personal trainer in me". 

TLDR: my fiance and I had a huge fight and I dont know how to stop feeling upset

================================================================================

QUESTION: Girlfriend [19F] got frustrated that I [20M] changed profile pictures. I thought it was small and she got upset.

Hi. Me ‘20M’ and my girlfriend ‘19F’ of 4 months, recently got into an argument over something I found small, but was big to her. We recently just got into a discourse over something I found small, which was matching profile pictures and banners. We match on all the big apps we use (Instagram and Twitter) and I sometimes feel forced to change. I told her sometimes I feel trapped to change it. I told her that I wanted to change my Discord profile (her initial is in my bio with a heart next to it, and so is her name and I say how much I love her in my bio). Again, I didn’t think this was a big deal since we match on everything else. She asked why, and I said I just wanted some individuality. She said that was fine but to just keep the banner as us. No big deal I thought since she’s my banner everything else, and so I said I was gonna change it to where the banner matches my profile picture. She got frustrated at that, so I said it’s fine and I’ll just keep it all the same. She then proceeded to immediately change her profile picture and banners to something else, after I had told her I’ll keep mine the same. I thought it was something small, and I apologized for not taking how she felt into account. I told her I was gonna take the day to clear my head and I just needed some space to feel normal again.

This is the first time we really argued, but we’ve had small issues before. She always talks about hating men and how she doesn’t like them, and I told her that it makes me feel down as well since I am a man myself and I try to treat her like a princess, and I do. She told some random dude on Twitter that she loves him, and then said she thought it was a girl and apologized multiple times and genuinely felt bad, so I forgave her because while yes I was angry at first, I then came around and forgave her because it was a mistake and it was no big deal. Her best friend ‘22F’ will make these smart remarks and insults to me, and has called me a “bitch” multiple times, and I just don’t like joking around with that word. She said that her friend was joking and that’s how she always is with her friends, but I told her I don’t like it and it makes me feel bad, regardless whether it’s a joke or not and it seems like the friend genuinely doesn’t like me, and my Gf said to message her but I don’t want to cause anymore issues. Going off of that, my girlfriend will just laugh along at what her friend says.

I understand she’s been through bad relationships in the past, I get it, and I really really love this girl. I think she’s the one and I love her with all my heart. With all these small things adding up, I just worry about how when something big comes up in the future, i just don’t want either of us to be stressed or scared over big problems. Pair on the fact that she lives 3 hours away and I spend a ton of money just to spend a weekend with her, all these things take a toll, and have taken a toll, especially over something like matching profile pictures and banners. I just don’t understand why something so small (when we’re matching on everything) turned into something so big. I’m not gonna breakup with her and I told her that, im just worried about the future. Am I missing something? Am I doing something to upset her and im not realizing it? I told her that im sorry I didn’t take into account how she felt and how I didn’t think it was big, but I see now how I meant to her and how it turned into something big because I hurt her feelings.

ANSWER: She’s being ridiculous and your feelings of being trapped into her dictating all your social media profiles is valid. It’s immature, insecure, controlling behavior

================================================================================

QUESTION: 28f 34m struggling with dynamic?

I am 28f he is 34m

We’ve been together 8 months, and recently I find it hard to see my partner as a mature adult?

When we have arguments over things he tends to want to break up instead of resolve the argument. 

A few of these arguments have revolved around him messaging his ex and not telling me, he also wanted to move into my house when he was switching jobs to save money on rent, my bills are 1600 so I said he can move in for 600pm and he said this was me profiting off the relationship and when he lived with his ex he only paid 200 per month. 

I then decided it was probably best for him not to move in as I thought it would create a huge imbalance and resentment if I was paying 1400 and him paying 200. 

He is now renting and paying 1200 plus bills. I accidentally fell pregnant (I’m on the pill) and he went out drinking for 2 nights and then said he wanted to end things with me because I got upset that he had gone out rather than have a conversation with me about the pregnancy? 

He’s now said he doesn’t want to leave and will stay and support whatever decision I make but I actually don’t trust him at this point to stick a relationship out. 

He said sex is important to him in a relationship but tbh I haven’t felt like it so we only had sex twice in a month and so he wasn’t happy about that either. 

Pregnancy aside, is there actually any hope for this? Because honestly I don’t know if I’m extremely harsh or if this is genuinely not normal behaviour?

ANSWER: Why would you want to have a kid or be with someone like this? You can do bad all by yourself. I’d get rid of him and his cells

================================================================================

QUESTION: What does love feel like? (21M, 21F)

How do you know when you're in love? What does it feel like? Is it supposed to be instant or does it happen along the relationship? My boyfriend (M/21) and I (F/21) have been together for 6 months, which I guess isn't a really long time, but even though we both like each other a lot and deeply care for the other we don't know if what we feel is love. Is it being able to accept all their flaws and being willing to figure out all the issues we have to stay together? Sometimes I think I'm already in love but I don't know what it feels like.

TL;DR I don't know if I'm in love

ANSWER: Mmm..  love is when you find someone whom you enjoy spending a lot of your time together, care deeply about them and their well being, whom makes you feel happy, and who can you truly be yourself with. 

But love is not enough for a successful relationship. It does not mean “forever”. You can love and care for someone but not be able to accept their flaws.  Or love them but not be compatible long term due to different goals or timelines.

================================================================================

QUESTION: M 21 and F 20 . Relationship advice and to know whether my pov is correct or not

For the past few days, my girlfriend has been telling me things like she’s doubting everything, even whether what we had was love. A new guy proposed to her, and instead of ignoring him, she has been talking to him normally. That’s not even what hurts me the most. She keeps questioning herself, saying things like, “If I truly loved you, why didn’t I block him? Why am I replying to him? Why am I waiting for his texts? Why didn’t I tell him to stop even when he’s waiting just to see me for a second?” She keeps saying she feels what she’s doing is wrong and wonders, “What if I actually like someone else in the future?”

I told her to think about the last 3 to 4 years. If that wasn’t love, then what was it? Even I accept that sometimes she showed more love than me. So if what she showed wasn’t love, then what exactly is her definition of love? She also told me she gets irritated talking to me whenever I try to sort out the issues between us.

But when I told her, “Okay then, I’ll leave,” she asked me not to go. She said we should take some time, calm down and sort everything out in a month. At the same time, she says things like, “When I’m treating you badly, why are you still staying? You can leave right?”

I told her that for me, love isn’t just about feelings. It’s about staying even when things are tough. Even though I’ve been getting hurt for the past month, I never once thought about leaving her. And even when I said I would leave, she begged me to stay and wanted to find a solution. So if she truly feels confused about whether it was love, then why would she beg me to stay?

Now she’s saying things like “I love another guy,” “I might love someone else,” or “Even if I’m with you, it will feel like compulsion.” She’s saying all this because she wants me to leave so I won’t get hurt. But she doesn’t understand that for me, it’s not just about the relationship. It’s about the trust, belief, and everything we’ve built over the years.

No one is perfect. There will always be someone who seems better. If that’s the basis, no one will ever stay with anyone. Sometimes you naturally find qualities in someone else that attract you, and that’s normal. You can still talk openly with your partner about it. That’s how relationships grow and that’s how love gets stronger.

QUESTION: I (20M) get scared when my girlfriend (21F) gets angry. How do I bring this up?

Title is as it states. Throwaway account.

I have been dating my girlfriend for just over a year, and things have been really great. We have a healthy foundation and we make each other fairly happy.

But over time, I’ve noticed a pattern when she gets frustrated. We’re both uni students, and sometimes course work can get overwhelming, I get it. However, when she gets frustrated, she often yells fairly loud to let off a lot of anger and she’ll occasionally throw things. I noticed this about two months in.

As to why I get scared: it usually starts when she yells, and I don’t know why. I had a fairly healthy upbringing with little in the way of fights, so the fact that I just shut down when she starts yelling is weird on my front. Worse, when I console her (usually in the form of a hug, kisses, and just pressure on her so she feels supported), she’ll yell “hello?” at me, because I haven’t said much of anything since I’m still processing what transpired. This then sends my brain into fight or flight again and sometimes the cycle repeats. 

I brought this up to her at around 10 months in, and she cried and apologized profusely and didn’t know it affected me so much. I hadn’t told her about it bothering me previously, so I felt terrible that I sparked tears because of something I withheld. She said that she’d do better.

And for about a month, she kept that promise. But recently for the last two months, it’s come back. 

Before I talk about this moment, I want to say that at every step of the way, I tried to console/support her. I would do this through affirming her feelings, giving her hugs, kisses, just making sure she knows I’m listening. I also helped her find some items.

Today, she got very angry at one of her assignments and was also generally agitated because she hasn’t cleaned her room in a while. She first slammed her notebook down on the couch and stormed off into her room. Then when she couldn’t find her AirPods, she started yelling that she couldn’t find them. I looked for them and eventually found them at the bottom of her bag, and when she realized one of the AirPods were missing, she threw it toward the ground but it hit me instead. She immediately apologized but then went back to her room to lay down. I cuddled her for about an hour before her class, and now I’m typing this out.

I come to this subreddit because I need to know how to bring this up to her, that I still get very anxious/shut down when she gets mad like that. In that moment, there were a lot of shitty circumstances, and her anger was justified, but to the point of throwing things? I just felt very intimidated and had no clue what to do when that happened.

Please give me advice as to how to bring this up to her. I love her so much and feel like I see a future with her. Feel free to tear me apart if I’m just being a pussy, but in my experience, throwing things as an instinct when angry doesn’t feel like something that should be done when other people are in the room.

ANSWER: She's abusive. I don't think you should be in this relationship.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (19F) Friend(19F) calls me very frequently

So I have a very confusing relationship with someone.

There is this girl, we are both 19/F
We are in a club sorta type of thing( i can't give the specific)

Anyway, the thing is our relationship is confusing like yes, we are friends but i never thought of us as very close ones. So when she called me few times for the club things, our conversation always goes very long, as long as 2hrs or more. I had no problem when it was only few times but then the call started to get very frequent like everyday. So we had long conversation everyday and night. Even when she is back to her hometown, she calls me even while she is working. I get confused as to why she wants to talk to me.

Like I hear her cooking, washing dishes/clothes, eating, bathing , taking notes while talking to her. She also calls me when she is walking to college.

Because of this i thought we were close, although I'm still confused about the calls.

So this one time we were taking our juniors to camp. She was going with another girl and I was not supposed to go but at last moment I joined. Before camp day, she called me at night talking about stuff and how she doesn't want to handle everything and how she doesn't want to take responsibilities. Hearing her complaints, I suggested if I should join her to help her. She agreed obviously and I joined them very late the other day on the camp site.

My reason for joining was because not only i was worried what will happen to her and the other girl and if they could do it but also because everyone from the club was worried about only sending those two as the seniors 

The problem started from here, the moment I joined they(she and the other girl) passed me as the captain or leader whatever on the spot. Anyway  i did think they would do that so i didn't mind it and did all the work. But.. i didn't think she wouldn't help me with any work and i only got some help from the other girl. In 2 days i stopped asking for help from her and let her wander around in the camp with others while I and the other girl did all the work and look after our juniors. She did have her part of the job as looking after the mess but it was only to ensure every thing is okay around the mess and the teachers were also there so it was not very high stress job.
So, even if I knew she was wandering and lazing around, I and the other girl never said anything to her. Like we didn't even gave her night duty that the seniors were supposed to take and we had 3 days of night duty. We didn't even woke her up early and let her sleep for few more hours every morning.

Our problem started when I joined them late. We  were 3 seniors so we were supposed to sleep together and then she goes and tell me to sleep with juniors which i immediately rejected. After I managed to get a space with them, she started making a fuss like not wanting to sleep in middle or corner which sounded much like she didn’t want to sleep beside me. She even asked me before sleeping if I roll around and hug things, which I found funny because I clearly remember her hugging in her sleep and rolling around during our previous camp. This all came to my ears as if she doesn't like me being close. And when we changed our rooms she took her bedding completely far from us, like we were on one corner and she took her bedding to the opposite corner where the other clg were sleeping. This irked me and the other girl very much.

After that we have many problems with her like one time she was scolding a junior for not doing some steps properly but I then interject and told her enough because it was sounding too much and rude, which led to us having a conflict about taking care of our juniors. 
One time I got scolded in front of many people (students from different clg) because of wrong data. I was the leader and i had to give a report so i made sure again and again I got the data correct since i was making mistakes from morning so i triple checked. When the teacher asked for it, I gave the correct one but then she interject and said another number, the teacher believed her and I got scolded in front of so many people that I felt humiliated. Although she said sorry afterwards for it, I was still angry because of this matter. It was still the 2nd day at that time. We had then many small conflicts and misunderstandings sometimes because of me, her, juniors etc. I stopped talking to her eventually and passed message through the other girl.

The other girl was surprised about our fighting because she knew how we were and are always talking to each other on the phone and are close.

The day camp ended arrived and we talked to each other awkwardly because well we are seniors 🫠 we had to talk someday or another.

In the club too we were awkward for many days but i had enough since i can't handle the awkwardness which is clearly disrupting the work so I went to smooth things over. We did smooth things out easily since we were both awkward and didn't know how to talk to each other. Our relationship got normal minus the call.

After 2 months the call started again. This time the duration is more longer. Before we called during evening now it's morning, afternoon and evening. I have never been the one to initiate a phone call, it was always been her calling and never me. But then she complainted to me that i never call her and don't care about her, so i relented and called her few times to coax her. 
She wanted talk in morning, the moment she woke up and after breakfast.  I always cut the call during noon because well.. I'm tired of talking and want to do things for myself. 
Sometimes she calls me during afternoon but mostly during evening like around 6pm and it goes to Sometimes 9, 10, 11,12pm. Depending on our circumstances.
 I would Sometimes cut the call to study but i still had to call her after studying otherwise she would make a fuss. One time I forget to call or idk maybe it was intentional but she made  a fuss about me not caring about her and don't want to talk to her and stuff so after that I made sure to call her or messaged her.

The fact that we always find topic to talk or even when  we don't have topic, we still talk idk how.. even when we are quiet it's not awkward, sometimes she sings to fill the quietness and I say random things to fill it..

But it's still very confusing because i feel the amount of calls are clearly too much for me to handle.

She did say she chatters with another girl too... but how will I believe her when she is on call with me every moment 

So my question is ---
Is this how friends are in real life?

ANSWER: Gurl…are you her girlfriend??? I don’t think so don’t answer the phone and also no this is not how friends are in real life

QUESTION: Relationship advice needed.. m25 f24

I started talking to this guy and we have been hanging out for two months now. We never go anywhere outside of his house. When I’m with him things are great he gives me his undivided attention and we watch movies and cuddle. But what has been bothering me is that he never asks me out on dates or anything. We hardly ever text too. I talked to him about it and he said that going on dates just isn’t his thing but if that’s what i want he will do it. But is that normal? If he really likes me shouldn’t he want to go out on dates with me? Why can’t he take initiative and not wait for me to say it? I feel like if i ask him to take me out it’ll feel forced and i just don’t like that. I want someone who is capable of doing those simple relationship things without me pointing it out.

ANSWER: Well, it's normal for him. He told you what he's like, the things he doesn't like and maybe that's just who he is.

Your complaints are more about what you'd prefer in a guy.

In the end, you'll have to choose if that's a deal breaker or not. We can't change him into the man you want him to be.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (21F) feel guilty and disgusted because my ex (23F) told me that she felt coerced.

I (21F) and my ex (23F), had been a in a relationship for a year. We stopped communicating not too long ago however she has previous told me that I tried to sexually coerce her.

Before I explain, I am currently going through something where I have to take tablets, therefore we cannot have sex right now, so it’s only kissing and touching. 

For context:
When we usually have sex, or about to get heated, we both would try to play hard to get in order to get more aroused, etc. 
EDIT: by hard to get, i simply meaning teasing, as couples would do. We still have safe words in case anyone feels unsafe or uncomfortable. 
She or I, would eventually win over than we would continue. I would also check in with her to see if she’s okay or if she’s still feeling it and vice versa. 

However this time, we were sitting down (both high) watching a movie on her bed and whilst we were watching it, I started to kiss her on the lips and she started to kiss me back, I then started to put my hand on her upper thighs and try open her legs as it’s a sensation that i know she likes. She wasn’t opening it, but kissed me harder (which she does when she’s extra aroused), so then I believed that it was a playing point so I tried to open it again but she didn’t open , I then got up and asked if she was okay then she said if we could kiss and cuddle instead, I said okay yes sure then that was it. 

The following day or to, she told me how she felt coerced into continuing and was very angry and upset at me as I didn’t read her body language within that moment as well as she felt as though I kissed her harder and didn’t catch on, not the other way around. but I’m confused as I didn’t continue at all or attempt to pursue sexually after I felt as though she wasn’t interested then. 
I still apologised immediately because it’s still something that she went through and I am the blame for that. 

I am confused because this is something that she also does when we are getting into it and I would partake (consensually). I know people in a relationship have different ideas of what consent means for them, but when I would usually do it, there wasn’t an issue (that she has brought up to me). 

Would that still be trying to make her do something she didn’t want to do? I made sure to ask once I got the idea that she wasn’t interested.

ANSWER: The whole point of having a safe word is that the person has a responsibility to use it when they don't want to continue. It's not your job to be a mind reader. If she can't use a safe word well, she should stick with vanilla sex. She's just making your responsible for her actions and emotions. It's not healthy. Good luck.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Is it worth it trying to continue my (27F) relationship after the below experience with my boyfriend (27M) ?

I (27F) have been with my boyfriend (27M) for almost seven years now. Last night, I had to go to the ER and he refused to join me for hours because of his office job, telling me “id need to wait without him.” He eventually came when he determined my ER trip was “serious enough”, waited with me and walked me home (we live together). Today, he has snapped at me multiple times when I’ve made innocuous comments (ie calling me “wasteful” when i said i was going to order food when i’ve thrown up everything ive eaten for the past 24 hours). When i told him how these things made me feel, i essentially got an “im sorry you feel that way” and he told me that other people must care more than him.

Most of the time he is very kind and caring, but this is a pattern when i get sick. He was also rude when i had surgery this past year, giving attitude when i asked him to grab things for me.

We are supposed to be getting engaged next year, and now I’m honestly just so upset and concerned about the relationship in general. Does anyone have any advice on how to try to have a conversation with him, or if it even seems worth it??

ANSWER: Don’t get engaged unless you want this to be your life.  

It will get worse.  Lockdown your birth control.

================================================================================

QUESTION: She (23F) removed me (22M) from social. I want to know if she has any feelings?

I’m in a sutdent club at my college where I’m the vice president, and there’s a girl who is the president. We’ve always had a close friendship and a professional relationship because of our roles. Until recently, we were especially close compared to others in the club (meeting outside, talking a lot, making plans). 

Today, I noticed that she unfollowed me on Instagram and removed me from her followers as well immediately after seeing my instagram stories. The stories were just about how I spent my day: a rooftop hill view, premium food I ate, my outfit (the outfit was so awesome that that day a lot of people DMed me and praised, some even said are you dating someone). There was nothing offensive or directed at her. 

What makes it more notable is that she still follows other people from our club, but she specifically unfollowed me. After that, we haven’t had much contact. Later, I initiated a professional conversation with her on WhatsApp (in order to test), and she replied normally. Nothing seemed awkward or unusual in the professional chat.

I’m curious about why she might have done this. She’s the type of person who’s extremely extroverted, emotional as well as logical. It feels intentional and specific to me, but it’s unclear whether it’s about boundaries, feelings, or something else.

Also, i am thinking about mentioning this to her that I noticed she did that. (I want open communication but am afraid it might make her uncomfortable on chat or in-person).

QUESTION: Is this normal for a relationship that's only a year and few months in? (22M/20F)

We've spent the past 3 or so months in conflict for a week or two every month (conflict for us means shes isolating/avoiding/ghosting me so barely any communication). Its always over small mistakes on my end like leaving her at school by accident, adding old female family friends on social media, liking female celebrity ig posts (non sexual). 

Its become an ebb and flow thing, academic pressure from school have made our conflicts more stressful compared to last year as well, making her meaner/moods worse. 

Overall we are very happy with each other, intimacy is great its just that when its bad it takes days and  so much frustration comes with it..

================================================================================

QUESTION: Obsession over 2-day old Tinder Match turns into hospital visit. (21F-21M)

As the title described, I (21F) matched with a man (21M) on Tinder 2 days ago. 

We called once 2 days ago for 4 hours out of boredom, and ever since then I haven’t been able to stop thinking about him. He has made it clear he does not want anything serious, and to be honest I don’t think I would like to date him either since he’s kind of a douche. But calling him was so nice and I am so attention-starved in my daily life that I instantly became attached and asked to do it again yesterday. He has not answered for 20 hours, and I had to take a day off of work due to how ill this made me feel. My heart started racing and chest tightened, and eventually I ended up in the hospital. They gave me benzodiazepines and sent me home. While this worked temporarily, I am not sure what to do in the long run. I can’t keep destroying myself like this as soon as someone takes away their attention from me. I guess it doesn’t help that I don’t have many friends to receive attention from either.

I’m not sure if anyone has experienced something similar for someone they’ve known for so little time. Where do I go from here? Any thoughts are appreciated. I feel ashamed.

ANSWER: I think you need to seek therapy, as this is clearly not good for you.

QUESTION: I think my friends are being fake  'M25' 'M24,M22,F22'

Hello, I have these friends who I hangout with at times and their friends with my other friends. I'm starting to think they aren't really genuine because of a few things. They never answer my calls or texts at times like they never even say "I'm busy, I'll call you later" nothing like that. I always answer someone's calls or texts or even if I can't I always make sure to respond within the same day. They sometimes gossip about others at work but when they see those ppl they act all friendly.

Also, there was recent drama between me and a friend who I'll call Nancy said they never get invited to stuff and doesn't like getting their pictures taken. Nancy kept saying how they never get invited yet all our hangouts are last minute. I was getting annoyed because each time she saw me post me hanging out they get upset because they weren't invited when it's only me and 2 other ppl. Once it was 3 of us and we tried invited Nancy but she lives like 40 mins away and it was late, she said she couldn't go.

The drama with me and Nancy happened then I tried texting and calling my other friends to see if they wanted to do something later but of course no response. I then see on two of their stories that they are hanging out with another friend of mine and Nancy and taking photos. I wasn't jealous, ofc you can hangout with whoever but this just felt weird for some reason.

A lot of this is starting to make me think about my high school years where ppl I thought were friends were just using me for stuff. They never like any of my posts but always like everyone else's posts. Always there for them but they were never there for me. I think I'm overthinking this but I just don't feel a genuine friendship with them as of late but could just be my weighing thoughts. What do you think?

================================================================================

QUESTION: 23F Struggling with feeling unappreciated in my marriage with 29M and unsure how to move forward

Hi everyone,

I’m 23F and married to my husband (29M). We’ve been together a long time, and although there is love between us, the dynamic has been wearing me down emotionally.

Right now we are doing long distance, but we also spend periods of time living together. During those times, certain patterns make me feel unappreciated and very disconnected from him.

Some examples:
• When I cook for him or do something thoughtful, he barely acknowledges it.
• He has never given me a birthday gift.
• He doesn’t plan dates or outings unless I specifically bring it up.
• I’m always the one initiating physical affection like hugging or cuddling; the only time he initiates anything physical is sexual.
• Even when I’m right next to him, I often feel invisible or ignored.
• He doesn’t clean up after himself. If I ask him to help with something, he either “forgets because of work” or does it halfway.
• I feel like I’m constantly putting effort into our connection while he puts very little into the emotional side of the relationship.

On top of that, I’m at a point in my life where I’m finishing my studies, trying to figure out my career, and working on building confidence. His career is already stable and established. That leaves me feeling financially and directionally dependent on him, which adds to the pressure and confusion.

There’s no dramatic event or crisis, just a slow buildup of feeling unseen, unsupported, and unsure where I fit in this partnership. Being married young makes all these doubts heavier, because I’m still learning who I am and what kind of relationship I actually need.

I would really appreciate advice from people who have been in similar situations or who understand these dynamics. Specifically, I’m hoping for guidance on how to approach this kind of emotional disconnect, how to communicate these feelings effectively, and how to figure out whether a marriage can grow through issues like this?

If anyone wants to hear the full situation (there’s more I don’t feel comfortable posting publicly), please feel free to message me privately.

Thank you to anyone who reads this

ANSWER: I'm curious about how long is too long being together. You are in your early 20 and he's almost 30. Obviously, there is a difference in life experience. You are just finishing school and he has already a stable career. This is telling, at least to me.
Secondly, this kind of attitude in a man will most likely not change in a positive way. He most likely will continue taking you for granted, and it won't matter if you talk to him or not. He has already established a pattern with you. That disconnection that you feel will only grow with time. If you are not married yet, do not do it. 
In my experience, I felt the same during my marriage. Unseen, unappreciated and sometimes blatantly ignored. I talked and cried and begged for two years. He always put the blame on me. I was the one making a big fuss. I was the one who was unhappy. At the end, I left and got a divorce.
I would think about it this way. Is his presence adding up to your life? Are the moments of "happiness" outweighing the moments when you feel disconnected and ignored? Are you really looking forward to spending time with him? You'll have your answer then.
Good luck!

QUESTION: I (23M) didn't fight to keep the relationship with my depressed ex (19F), need opinions/advice?

My ex deals with depression, health anxiety, health issues, struggling financially, childhood traumas, family issues, and loads more issues. We both hit a point where we were just emotional disconnected from one another and she wanted to break up. Thing is during the breakup she still wanted me to still sleep in the same bed and live with her but I found that odd. I didn't fight to keep the relationship because I just asked her a couple times that is this what she wants and she said distance is what she needed and I found a way to move out within a couple days after the breakup. 

I was drained from constantly reassuring her and comforting her with health issues due to her health anxiety but she didnt take any initiative to go to the doctor either. I had the talk with her about comforting her but there comes a point where something serious pops up and I wouldnt know what to do and that a doctor would always be the best to consult with but during the entire relationship she didnt go to the doctor despite constantly worrying about inheriting multiple diseases from her mother.

The entire relationship felt like I was just constantly in a give give give state due to me also doing some of her homework and exams from uni as well. She would constantly complain about how shes doing so poorly in school but from her behavior she doesn't put any effort in either to do well and tends to break down crying when she doesnt understand her homework. 

  
From just a couple issues on her end and her talking about wanting multiple kids, the behavior displayed I can't see her being able to be a long term partner with how she handles stress and being put under pressure as from what I've seen from her she wont be able to function when shes put in the real world.

  
Shes told me that I was the best thing to ever happen to her and I was the best boyfriend she ever had but I slowly clocked out of the relationship over time and I still believe it should be pinned on me as well that I let this relationship string out this long but I've had talks with her where I wanted to break up but she went through the ends of the earth to have me stay with her but all I asked was to just work on herself and not neglect yourself, and I said I would be by her side as long as she improves but she took no initiative which in my eyes shows lack of responsibility. She has a habit of putting herself down constantly and is very insecure.

ANSWER: Yeah, that shit can be draining... can't say I'd find it attractive to date someone with those issues.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Boundaries with my (36 M) partner's (35 F) kids

I (36 M) am struggling with some parts of my relationship with my partner (35 F) and we are trying to talk about how to move forward. She has 3 kids  part time, and I help look after them when they're at ours.

Due to her mental state, she is not able to have all 3 at the same time without becoming overwhelmed, and in a conversation today, said she didn't want to work towards that because 'she had full care of the kids in her relationship with the kids dad and that's what lead her to a declining mental health'. She has said she doesn't feel able for me to not be there when the kids are and that me being away 'could genuinely kill her'. I am worried about her mental health and her suicidal ideation which I'm trying get her help for.

Am I 'minimising her experience as a parent and not allowing her to express her boundaries' by not listening to what she says she is capable of?

Thanks!

ANSWER: Honestly, if I were dad, I’d be petitioning for supervised visits only for her. She doesn’t sound particularly safe to have any of the kids alone and taking one or two at a time doesn’t seem like it would be so great for the kids either.

Honestly, she just doesn’t sound like someone I’d date. Especially since she knows she has a problem and has zero intentions to work on it. Nope, her plan is for you to take over.

Yikes

================================================================================

QUESTION: How can I(f18) make my depressive episodes easier on my boyfriend(m18)

Sorry if any grammar is bad, I rushed making this during my lunch break.

My f18 bf m18 and I both struggle with depression, mine comes in episodes while his is more of a constant state. I can't afford to go to a therapist or psychiatrist and I can't go through my parents because they don't belive in mental health. My bf was given medicine but he stopped taking it because it was making him feel numb and the withdrawls were worse than his depression ever was/is. 

Whenever I get into an episode I become really emotionally sensitive and I'm either in professional mode for school or work, or I'm resting and everything makes me cry. But even though I've told my bf that he isn't directly making me cry he still feels like its his fault and he becomes upset. Then after some time of this my emotions become too much for him and he starts to feel overwhelmed w/ me getting upset all the time over everything, so he becomes distant and more withdrawn from me. 

And recently my episode has kinda hit its peak, and hes been snapping at me what I consider small things. He's never yelled or insulted me at all, but yesterday we were fixxing his car but it wasn't rlly working and we needed to wait to use our friends jack and he seemed frustrated so I asked him if he was okay and he got really pissed off and told me that I didn't need to ask him every 5 seconds if he's okay and turned away from me and ignored me for the rest of the night. 

On tuesday we had a conversation abt him talking to me abt things that are bothering him before it gets to a point that he feels like its killing him. So that night after he went home I texted him asking if there was smth deeper bothering him other than what he told me on tuesday and asking if he was okay, and he told me that he wanted to sleep on it.

So I don't know yet whats bothering him yet, but I want to know what I can do to break this cycle. It's not the first time and the only way it seems to go away is if i stay in professional mode w/ him for about 2 weeks and don't feel upset at all over anything. And if i break before the end of the two weeks it starts over bc then it just seems like a good couple of days, but its not over. But staying completely happy for 2 weeks striaght is almost impossible when i hit my episodes. 

Is there something I can do during my episodes besides reasuring him its not his fault that would help him? Is there a cheaper way to help my episodes? Or a way to make it up to him now so this cycle can be over?

Tl;dr my depressive episodes are too much for my bf and I don't know how to make it easier on him

ANSWER: You need someone who you can be completely honest with. Someone you can just let it all out with. 

There is no shame if that is not your bf. You are both very young.

Is there anyone you know who could handle listening without being judgemental?

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (29F) have conversations with my fiancé (30M) about things as they happen without having an attitude?

My fiancé and I have been together for almost 10 years now, and I’ve been working on communicating my needs (I was raised a people pleaser, by a narcissist and an enabler). The problem is, every time I bring something up in the moment, my first reaction is to respond with an attitude. With that said, I’ve resorted to saying nothing at all, which obviously builds up in my brain and causes problems. 

For example: the other day, I was starting some laundry, and he said he was asking if he could do anything to help. The first thing that came to mind (that I didn’t say) was, “Well it would’ve been helpful if you had started the washer while I was at the store instead of playing video games” but I didn’t want to start a fight so I just said nothing, but it’s still looming in my brain. 

I know therapy is in order, but does anyone have any tips for me that will solve the issue pretty immediately? Count to 5, take a deep breath, etc.?

ANSWER: I have a similar thought process. I've been to therapy. Here's what I do:


The first blast of things your brain wants to attack with, don't react to it at all, obviously, but don't ignore it either. Treat it like a wild animal you're studying. Accept it passively and use what it's telling you the problem is to build a script from. That is what you actually say out loud. 


I recommend looking up non-violent communication techniques and fitting things into that frame to start. It will sound scripted because it is, duh, but you will be able to sound more natural with practice.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Boyfriend of 1.5 years (27M) is emotionally available, but has little time for me (28F). How do I reach a proper resolution about this with him?

My boyfriend of 1.5 years is an amazing partner to me. He is sweet, caring, emotionally available and if I give him feedback he will take it seriously. 

But in the last couple of months I haven't been able to communicate with him about how lonely I've felt because of how little time we spend together. I wouldn't feel as hurt if we spent less time together because of being busy despite still really wanting to be together. But I feel like his desire to be together as often has declined a lot in the past few months.

We don't live together. We're both pretty busy (I'm doing a PhD and he's finishing up his MA thesis) and like our own independence. But I try my best to see him at least 2-3 days a week and crash at his place (or have him at mine). I don't mind if we meet and just work/study together because we have a lot to do. But over the last few months, I've noticed that he's always in a hurry to leave after spending a single day with me. Or when I crash at his, I feel like he wants me to leave the next day ASAP so he can be alone again. I often feel like he's in a rush to get away and that hurts. I've felt very unwelcome. 

It hurts more that despite how busy I am, I will try to make time for him. Yesterday, despite having so many deadlines and a full day, I went to his place with medicines because he was sick and because we missed each other. When it got dark outside, I said I might crash with him because I don't like going home when it's cold and dark. And he said he wanted to be alone because he's sick and sleeps better alone. I was surprised because I felt like my needs didn't really matter in that moment, despite how I went out of my way to get him things. And because in the first few months of our relationship he would be grateful when I stayed with him to care for him when he was sick.  

There's always a different reason every week (he went home and spent time with his family so he needs to be alone, he wants to focus on work so he needs to be alone, he feels overstimulated or  oversocialized so he needs to be alone) but the dynamic is the same -- our time together is cut short because he wants to be alone. Despite how much I like my time alone, I still want more togetherness and interdependence. I've tried to minimize my expectations for texting/calling when we're apart because he has ADHD -- I don't mind having in-person time and not texting/calling much -- but I don't get the quantity of time I need IRL either anymore. He's really kind and emotionally available to me when we're together, but we're not together often enough for me. 

I've tried to talk to him about this and even though he understands, we fall back into the same dynamic. I also don't want to force him to be with me more if he doesn't genuinely desire it. I want to feel wanted and welcome. What can I do? Is breaking up the only option? I don't want to break up because we've had a good relationship overall but I am now wondering if we're just fundamentally incompatible.

ANSWER: Sorry but your example of him being sick and wanting to rest and be alone but you’re all “what about MY needs?” Comes off as incredibly selfish. 

The rest? Seems to me that the honeymoon is over and he’s done pretending that he can spend that much time together when there’s so much else going on.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My 21F College GF has a questionable new friend we've argued about and new relationship ideals and I 24M am struggling trying to figure out if our relationship is in trouble or not. Is our relationship evolving or devolving?

I 24M without going deep into things, am doing well for my age. I have a great job in my field, I own a home, have savings, workout regularly, have many hobbies music, painting, videogames and a few more. I am 5'8 and and am considered somewhat attractive. Overall I have covered almost every base when it comes to practical and financial goals. There is nothing left to really be desired when it comes to that kind of stuff.

I met my girlfriend 21F a year ago when I moved for my new position. We have had an absolutely amazing year together. She moved in after 4-5 months of us being together (I acknowledge it might seem rushed but she only moved about 15 minutes away from her family's house. It was not an extremely dramatic change although still a change. We spend lots of time with her family too). Rough patches consisted of very surface level things that could always be addressed. She fell hard for me and I honestly fell pretty hard too. She talked about marriage and family life many times, asked when we could get promise rings and that she is so happy she met her person. We have a few hobbies in common. Our beliefs also line up very well. Overall I feel lucky we found each other.

PART 1 Issues Between my Girlfriend and I:  
About 2-3 months ago she started expressing a few different sentiments.

One sentiment was about feeling like she was missing out on certain things like campus life. She went into deeper detail and meant attending college clubs and activities, not depraved sorority life or anything like that. I was understanding and am comfortable with her utilizing everything at her disposal during college. Most nights are spent apart now, not enjoying much together though. When she is home now it mostly consists of study nights and nothing else.

Another sentiment is she has changed her mind on drinking and smoking and has encouraged me to let loose more too. When we both met we were both against drinking, smoking, and other substances. I cannot smoke for purposes of my work. She knows this and has still told me to try. I have turned down all offers besides having 1 drink. To my knowledge she hasn't been smoking or doing any edibles since we've been together. She has expressed wanting to let loose more as well and as long as it is done in moderation I am ok. I do not want to be too controlling but also need to make sure my boundaries are known and respected. I have told her if she plans on drinking somewhere foreign, either I or her brother should be there.

the last big sentiment is she has completely changed her outlook on our relationship. It confuses me because she is still affectionate, nice and tried to do nice things together every now and then. She used to be very pro-marriage and being together forever. She has explained that she has a more practical outlook now. She just wants to enjoy the relationship day-by-day. She says we don't really know if we'll get married or not and there's no way to know. Fair enough. . . That's all true, but it comes off as very cold to me. I'm not entirely sure how to interpret it. I would think if I really loved someone I would be thinking about how to make sure they're a part of my future. . . It is hard to approach her on this subject as she says she doesn't want to think about the future right now.

PART 2 Issues with her new girl friend (she is single and lives a sorority-lite lifestyle)

This new friend makes my gut twist. My instincts reading people usually do not fail me but I also want to try to be as objective as I can in the way I explain this situation.

At first things felt totally normal I met this friend just like any other of her friends. She has a large friend group of guys and girls and most of them see me in a very positive light and they've gotten to know me and I've put effort in getting to know them. I am socially awkward and can check out some nights before the hangouts fully end. Over the next few hangouts I noticed this new friend was getting very touchy-feely with my girlfriend. holding hands, hugging and holding each other, honestly more touchy-feely than she likes to get with me in public. I brushed it off but kept it in mind. Eventually one night this friend grinded on my girlfriend right in front of me. My girlfriend jumped back. Neither of us expected it to happen and were both taken off guard. The next day I requested they not do that and that is crossing a boundary of mine. I found it embarrassing and not very classy. My girlfriend honored my request and said it wouldn't happen again.

My gut was telling me there might be more to this situation so I reached out to a few of the guys I'm close to in the friend group. I made cold-calls asking What they thought of this new girlfriend. None had anything good to say about her and one told me a few things that were very alarming to me. Apparently after first meeting me this new girl and guy talked privately. The new girlfriend unprompted started telling him:

\- I am not a good fit for my girlfriend, my girlfriend needs to explore more options, and my girlfriend needs to experience the college party life and go to some bars with her.

Usually gossip and crap-talking is beneath me but in this case I didn't want to stay quiet. This shook me up a bit and I lost my composure. In a moment of weakness I called my girlfriend. I asked her to distance herself from this new friend and that we need to figure this problem out. I told her what I had found out. Instead of concern I was met with a barrage of insults and defensiveness. I was told I should not have gone asking around for answers, what I heard was a fabricated lie, I am just jealous of this new friend, and that I can't control who she is friends with. This baffled me as I had never tried to control her friend group before. I felt like this new friend was a genuine threat and wanted to share my concerns. My girlfriend's perspective was the conversation was so stupid to begin with because this new girl friend doesn't have any influence over our relationship so we shouldn't even be talking about it. From my point of view, it just sounded like my girlfriend didn't hear me and didn't take my concerns seriously. That caused a lot of unnecessary back and forth.

Long-story-short, the new friend was confronted by my girlfriend a week later and it turned out not to be a lie. The new friend confessed and spoke in half truths compared to what the guy told me she said and she regrets saying she didn't like me and it wont happen again. My girlfriend mentioned to me that she might have said mean things about us because of my social awkwardness that night that I rubbed her the wrong way. I don't find that a good excuse at all whatsoever and even if I was awkward I didn't deserve that kind of treatment. I kept poking my girlfriend (probably too much) about the issue until it devolved into both of us living in separate realities. I caved and gave up trying to talk about it as to not fracture the relationship any more than I already had. I'm left hurt and confused. Half the people I have talked to emphasize with me and say my girlfriend's reaction was horrible, the other half say it is fine now that the friend apologized to her. I would personally like an apology but that is most likely not happening. My girlfriend swears up and down this new friend does not talk about me with her at all.

I have friends in the friend group I trust that swore to keep an eye on things for me. Besides that, talking about it is completely off the table with my girlfriend. She refuses to hear about it any longer.

Are these issues mendable? If so any advice would go a long way. Does it sound like the relationship is potentially evolving, or is it starting to fade and devolving into something not worth sticking around to be a part of?

ANSWER: Honestly, dude, you are why reddit warns 21 year olds not to date people in a different stage of life than them, even if it’s only by a few years.  No shit she’s having second thoughts about whether she’s really ready to be settling down and doing the domestic thing with you instead of making the most out of her college years, in whatever form that looks like for her.  And now you’ve weaponized her friend group against her by making the guys who also see nothing wrong with controlling who she hangs out with into your spies?  If you can’t take several steps back and realize that you’re not going to be able to prevent her from becoming whoever she’s growing into by forbidding her to do stuff or socialize with people you don’t like, then end things now so you don’t have to take that risk and stick to dating people whose lives are already established in ways that work for you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (21F) boyfriend (20M) has been acting differently lately?

I will try to keep this simple but give as much context and detail as possible! 

My boyfriend and I were friends for three years before we got together. More like we knew each other, didn’t interact often, but when we did hang out together sometimes, we clicked very well. We are both very stubborn and young so we have run into problems and had little fights (sometimes big fights) but we love each other to the ends of the earth. We have been together for over a year now.

Now here’s the thing. I used to be more “anxiously attached” at the beginning of the relationship, which was hard for both of us, but I have grown very very secure and learned to trust a lot. However, I still have some of those more immature tendencies occasionally and am still working on it. He on the other hand tends to draw back during conflict. He closes down a little when he feels hurt or disrespected or anything. I think it’s mainly because of how his father treated him growing up.

Now before yall go and say “that’s so toxic of him!! Break up!!” I have known this man for a long time and know that he has a sweet sweet heart and has good intentions, and has gotten really good at eventually recognizing when he does this and apologizing. I have learned that even though I feel an urge to grab on tighter, sometimes he just needs a little time and space to think and process things. We are young and learning.

We have been long distance for about four months now. 14 hours apart. We rarely fought before this, but we do bicker a little more often now. Long distance is hard but we have found ways to bond and spend time with each other. 

Here is the issue. I can very often tell if he is feeling depressed or something is on his mind, or if he is holding back things he wants to say while we fight. Before long distance, he would eventually open up and talk to me a little about these things, even just over text. However, now that we are long distance, his behavior has changed. He rarely opens up during these times and he seems to get extra upset when I bring something up that I want to talk about in our relationship (which I try not to do often, maybe about once every 3 weeks). 

A lot of the time, I think he’s upset because he trusts me so much but he thinks I don’t trust him. Which I do. I don’t know how to explain why sometimes I need reassurance that he loves me (need this way way less often than earlier in the relationship), most often when I notice he’s being a little distant. I’ve learned that this is mostly because of outside factors, not usually something I’ve done, and he’s needing some time to himself for a little. If I ever bring this up to him, he gets upset and frustrated because he believes this means I don’t trust him, when he says he trusts me 100%. Maybe this is immature, but I can see that it isn’t coming from a place of manipulation but a place of hurt. 

Mostly what I’m asking for is help learning how to support him. Since he’s turned more reserved lately, I’m a little worried I’ve done something that makes him nervous or hesitant to open up to me. I love this man and I really want to learn how to support him like he supports me. He’s given me so much and it’s time for me to do the same or more for him. Thank you for any advice.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Couples therapy for a four year relationship? (M24, F23)

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years. Consistently for 2 1/2 years we have had issues with his lack of effort, drive, motivation, both in life, and in our relationship. I fear he has not been growing up while I have been. I am a very open communicator and have been from the start because I was scared of resentment building up overtime, but despite my efforts to avoid this, there is still resentment. he goes in and out of struggling with mental health problems and I’ve tried every possible way I can think of to approach the situation, but he has continued to do absolutely nothing about it. I have stayed with him while he has lost his job and couldn’t pay rent, I have stayed with him while we didn’t have sex for over four months and rarely have sex once a month. I have stayed with him despite his lack of hygiene. (he doesn’t smell bad or anything, but he often skips, brushing his teeth, and will wait too long for a shower). He and I have both been smoking weed since before we knew each other but as we’ve gotten older, it’s become more of a social fun thing for me to do while he uses it as a crutch. He is high majority of the time, but it doesn’t even affect him because of how often he uses weed. He clearly doesn’t care about himself or his health even though we say we plan to live our lives together and eventually have a family. He’s never been able to prove to me that he can quit a bad habit like vaping or smoking excessively. at this point there are so many things that I don’t know how to fix, and when I bring up any of these things we never argue he just doesn’t say anything at all. And he never actually changes even if he says he’ll try. I have thought about couples therapy, but neither of us are financially stable. I’m still in college and he lost his job so he went back to grad school but if I bring up any of these things, his feelings will just get hurt and he won’t actually end up saying anything.

ANSWER: No, couples counseling isn't for you.     

Couples counseling is for couples who were very strong in their relationship and over time built up lots of healthy traits and good will but because "life be life'n" they hit a rough patch, examples would be, the complexities of parenting, managing time and effort for extended family, major changes in income dynamic's, sick children, and ageing family members. 

What you are suggesting is counseling to make someone who is UNacceptable to be someone who is acceptable.   When you try to "therapy" a partner into a more acceptable version of themselves, you are committing abuse.    

If he isn't the type of partner you need him to be, then you need to move on.

================================================================================

QUESTION: my long-term girlfriend (30 F) and i (36M) have always had a mediocre sex life and i don’t know what to do?

i (36 M) am divorced and have two school age children. i’ve been with my girlfriend (30F) for 3-4 years and we’re at a point where we either need to take a next step in the relationship (i.e her moving in with us and/or getting engaged) or we need to go separate ways. i don’t want to waste any more of her time.

i’m starting to feel not 100% sure that i want to spend the rest of my life with her, though. i absolutely do love and care for her so much. we communicate well, have lots of fun together, have shared interests, and have the same values & worldview. 

the issue is our sex life. to be clear, i think she is very beautiful and attractive - it’s more that our sexual chemistry isn’t fully there. it’s not horrible but it’s not great either. maybe like a 5/10. and it has always been this way, so we’re not just in a rut at the moment. we’ve had some direct conversations about it but that hasn’t really changed anything. 

i’ve always gone back and forth about how much this matters to me. on the one i hand i know that the sex life of a relationship can be really important and i really dislike the thought of potentially going the rest of my life with only mediocre sex. on the other hand, we have such a strong connection and are a great match in most other ways and i can’t expect a relationship to be a perfect match in every way. 

ultimately i feel like it comes down to how much of a priority sex in a relationship is to me, but i’ve been so indecisive on that for such a long time. i’m hoping to get some advice or wisdom from others.

ANSWER: So, despite what a lot of neigh sayers are saying here, if everything else is so good and you’re attracted to her enough to have mediocre sex, you can absolutely build up that chemistry. But it will take time, effort, trust and a lot of open honest conversation. 

Sexual chemistry and foreplay are not something that just turn up when you start in the bedroom. It should be a part of your lives together. Esther Perel says foreplay starts as soon as you stop making love. With knowing glances, little smirks. Gentle arm touches. All these little things build up to something more. And it might feel like you’re “forcing” it at first, but believe me it’ll start to feel natural pretty quickly. 

You say you’ve had open conversations so that’s an amazing start. You have a great foundation to work on this with. But Nothing will change if you don’t do something different. What have you tried? Toys? Teasing? Telling each other your fantasies? There is so much you can do. Try something brand new together. Ask her to show you what she likes while you watch. Send sexy messages to each other when you’re out or at work. Whatever it is. It sounds like it’s bothering you more, so you take the steps to spice things up. One thing I’m fairly sure of - if you start focusing on giving her a lot of pleasure, chemistry will build. But you have to put the time and effort in!

================================================================================

QUESTION: My 22F boyfriend’s 22M sex drive has been lower lately, any advice on what I should do?

My (22F) boyfriend (22M) have been together for about a year now. For the first 7-8 months of our relationship, we saw each other about 3-5 times and week, and he would initiate sex every time once we started getting physical. This felt like it was a part of the routine, and a way for me to build emotional closeness with him. To be honest, it made me feel physically desired by him. Lately, we’ve been stopping this and only have sex about 2 times a week. It’s not necessarily that I crave sex, I just have been feeling less desired by him. He has also noticed a drop in his sex drive and assured me it’s not due to a loss of physical attraction, but likely other factors like work or stress. This is my first serious relationship, so I’m wondering if this is normal? Any advice on how to be less insecure about this? Thanks guys!

================================================================================

QUESTION: I '32F' found out my boyfriend '37M' has been sexting another woman.

I found out yesterday my partner messaged another woman. I had a gut feeling he was up to something then realised he was installing telegram when I was work and uninstalling it again. 
I confronted him and he told me he was just wondering what it was as he had never used the app before. I didnt believe this and told him to reinstall it to prove to me he hasnt been going behind my back, this is when he admitted to me he has been talking to someone, first of all he said it was just silly flirting, then admitted what had been said and im just disgusted. 
I feel so betrayed and broken, I don't know if I can get past this. 
Hes told me he doesnt know why he did it, he loves me and hes really sorry but I just dont believe it. Why would you hurt someone you love and why would you even want to engage with another woman in that way? 
Its been a  tough couple of months, he suffers with depression and tried to take his own life about 6 weeks ago. 
Ive tried to support him as much as I can and ive been there when he has needed help but I just feel likes he thrown everything back in my face. 
I just dont know what to do.

ANSWER: Don’t let his mental health get in the way of doing what’s best for you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: F26 how do I deal with being in love with my married friends M29 & F28?

This is a hard one to explain so I'll do my best, I (F26) have two married friends T(M29) and C(F28), I met T 4 years ago when we worked together, we became good friends and he eventually became an important support system for me when I found out my ex was cheating on me, after a few months of work friendship with T I started to gradually fall for him, he was always sweet,considerate, thoughtful and smart. I kept my feelings to myself because I knew he was married and am not a home wrecker but we remained friends.

I met his wife C and she is amazing too, balances him out and honestly me and her are very much alike and we hit it off immediately. Almost a year after me and T became friends he opened up to me and told me he loved me, I was immediately concerned and told him that he can't and that he's married. Apparently he had told his wife about this as well before ever confessing to me. I talked to C women to women and she explained to me that the two of them had discussed an open marriage and that she too had developed feelings for me.

After the initial awkward phase things were actually really good between all of us, we hang out regularly, I go out with T and we do stuff we both like, I go out with C and we do things together, have game nights at their house and just enjoy eachothers company, they are my support system and I do have romantic feelings for both of them.

Eventually after talks between the three of us me and T got intimate I lost my virginity to him and honestly it was incredible, the issue I'm having is discussions have come up about being in an actual relationship the three of us, I am not against the idea at all but I'm scared about my family's response.

 I was raised Christian and my parents are so important to me, my dad seems to like T mentioning in the past he'd like to see me end up with someone like T, my mom was the ice breaker for me and T when she tried to set us up on a date, T laughed about it to me and I had to tell my mom he's married. My concern is how they would react to it being a real thing, my mom is my best friend and I don't wanna lose her over this.

 I'm scared of my mom turning on me, but T and C are my people, I've tried finding other guys and T and C have always been supportive of what I want to do, though if I'm honest even if he dosen't admit it T clearly gets uncomfortable with the idea. I just don't know how to approch this and if I'm doomed to lose somebody in this.

ANSWER: If your parents are religious Christians they're probably not going to be very happy about you being some third in a menage et trois. But it's unlikely that situation would be a permanent one anyway. So maybe just don't feel the need to tell your parents about it.

Before this I only sought for a marriage partner, but I love this girl so much. so in my mind I feel like it's so selfish to confess for a possible relationship of less than a year. And I don't want our friendship to get awkward if she rejects me.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How can I 42f stop being angry with him 44m and move forward

I met my boyfriend 44m four years ago. I fell hard for him and now I can't stop being angry.

When we first started dating he still had lingering feelings for an ex. I tried to be understanding,  but it hurt when he would bring her up....his eyes would glow and he would drone on about her. He would also compare me to her by saying I was funnier, a better cook, but it still bothered me because I still think it's rude to compare. 

I know I am stupid. But I really didn't think I could do better.  He would ask me to do favors like pick up dog food for his dog after work, even though he doesn't work (waiting for ssdi) . I paid for all of our dates.

Getting him to celebrate our anniversary was like pulling teeth out of a chicken.  I gave up. I just wanted to feel a little special to someone. 

So I began pulling back a few months ago and last month out of nowhere he said "hey, let's have a fresh start." He admitted to being an asshole to me and begged me for another chance. He'd offer to rub my back, tell me he loves me, etc.

The thing is,  I really don't care anymore. Everything i look at him i feel such intense anger because I remember the time I got violently sick with food poisoning and he said "thanks alot. Now I have to worry about my mom getting sick."

Every time I bring up these horrible memories I get a "I thought we talked about it." Or "that was years ago" like the time he said he hated my golden retriever. But the memories still hurt for me.

So how do I let go of the anger I have towards him given that he's been acting so much better? Is my anger unreasonable?

ANSWER: He's been unemployed and waiting for his SSDI for four years?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I(27F) slightly fantasized about being a relationship with someone else(27M). How to deal with that?

Me and bf(32M) started dating five years ago, back in the end of 2020. Me being kinda introverted shy felt more connected to his more outgoing type, he encourages me to try out new scary things and we share the same values.

2020 was a very weird time for me, I was feeling very unmotivated in uni, just feeling lost and depressed. I didnt really have a lot of friends either. 

Which is why my brother used to invite me when he hung out with his friends. One of those friends was my age. But also very very shy and quiet just like me. In the summer of 2020, I made myself more available, wanting to hang out with my brother just to hang out with his friend, hoping maybe we would talk more. My brother (very subtly) was trying to push us together, just by creating events where we could all go (because neither me nor his friend were very outgoing people). But he did invite me along to a family dinner with his family along with my brother as well,  which kind of showed me that he might also be interested.

It was just the fact that he was so shy that made me feel like nothing would come of it because no one would make the first move. I would also listen to my brother rant about their fights and didn't particularly felt like that would be a good dynamic. Apparently he is also kind of a holocaust denier, maybe a bit too much leaning into far right for my taste, too. Enjoyer of conspiracy theories, if you know what I mean, and that all combined just turned me off even more. 

Anyway we literally hung out like this (with brother and other people) for like three months, for the whole of the summer during the pandemic and nothing came of it and I moved on. 

I never saw him since until today. We greeted each other and, not gonna lie, he does look fine and a part of me was like "what if". And I was kinda shocked because never in the five years me and bf been together, have I ever even looked like that at other dudes. So I'm just wondering if having that "what if" feeling is okay and normal or if I am indeed a total AH that doesnt respect my boyfriend. I entertained it for like not even a minute, it was just a brief thought. So Idk just writing this out is a bit cathartic and maybe I do deserve all the online lashing I will get.

ANSWER: If you're happy with your bf overall, a brief "what if" is pretty much nothing. I'm guessing most people have those thoughts at some point in an LTR. If you aren't happy with your bf, then a "what if" might be more meaningful. There is no such thing as thoughtcrime, OP, though. People have thoughts, some of them less than stellar. Actions are what count.

================================================================================

QUESTION: [42M] Wife [F33] and coworker [M23]. Do you think i should be worried?

Hello everyone, I’am 42 and my wife 33 and we have been together for 9 years, 4 married. Two weeks ago my wife told me that she organized a after work drink with her team coworkers (men and womens) wednesday (past week). Then last week she told me that it was moove to this wednesday. This sunday she told me that this wednesday she will have this drink with jack and jade (famtasy names). I probably made a strange face because she asked me what was wrong. I told her who are this jack and jade because i never heard abut them. She explained that thise 2 arent coworkers from hers team but another one but same branch. I didnt know them coz she never mantioned about those. I felt it was ok because i knew on wednesday she was working in that branch so it was fine to have a drink after work. Yesterday (wednesday) she texted me at 5 pm. Telling me jade had a problem so only her and jack were in the office and she asked me if it was ok for me if she went with only jack to get drink. I told her that she had to decide and that i cannot decide for her. So she texted me she will have only a glass of wine and then come back home. To give some context this guy jack is 23, single and good looking. So she went with him to get a drink at 6 pm he paid For her and she was home at 9 pm. (She stayed with him for like 2 and half an hours). I feel that something is off in this situation and that there were too many coincidence that casually led them to have a drink alone. In all those years she had a lot pf lunch with coworkers that became somewhat like friends. The strange thing is that she never had this after work drink with the others that she also knew better.. I must say i feel something is off! What do you think?

ANSWER: Nothing in this post made me personally suspicious. Could it be suspicious? Sure, most things can be. But nothing is unreasonable about her spending 2.5 hours with a male coworker to get a drink one time.  If it becomes consistent and stays just him, that would make me suspicious. But, unless there is additional context clues missing, you just currently sound a bit insecure to me.

QUESTION: 39M and 43F dating question

Throwaway account for this situation. A few years ago around 2021 I met this girl named P who at the time was getting divorced and I was dating someone else. Who I was dating at that time is still P’s best friend. My ex and I split up in 22 and now P has hit on me a few times while drinking but I brush it off as I don’t want to kill a friendship between my ex and P and their friend group, as I am still friends with all of them. I am and have been interested in P for over a year now but I am not sure how to approach this situation. I don’t have any social media and reactivated Facebook messenger to make sure she got home okay about a month ago and gave her my cell number, she said we should go golfing sometime and I said I am always down for that but we never went because she didn’t contact me. After the messages I deactivated Facebook messenger again and haven’t seen P as we usually bump into each other every few months when she is kid free. Would it be okay to pursue P or just cut my losses and remain friends? 

Edit: I forgot to add this is an extremely small and rural town with the closest bigger city is 45 minutes drive away.

ANSWER: Some sage advice and I am probably just over thinking it all. Thank you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I [21F] bring up the topic of sexual enhancers to my partner [31M]?

I have been with my boyfriend for almost a year now. I love him dearly and see us having a future together, however… recently I feel I’ve been building up some sexual frustration with him. We both have a fairly high drive, which I feel is making things a little worse for me. I enjoy having sex with him… but he just doesn’t last long. When we first got together I didn’t think much of it as it’s not a totally uncommon problem I’ve faced with past partners. But as I mentioned, we’re almost a year in now and it’s still ending very quickly. And it’s now to the point that I’m not finishing at all when we do it. Which has brought me to the point of wanting to include something. My biggest problem is bringing it up gently without causing any embarrassment and making things worse…

[Edit]: I fear I left out some important details. We do In fact engage in foreplay, and we have tried various things to enhance our experience in the bedroom. He’s generally very open and we don’t have any communication issues. I get off from intercourse, I always have, I’m very particular when it comes to pleasing myself and get off more from intercourse when others please me

TLDR: my (21F) partner (31M) doesn’t last long in bed, I get off primarily from intercourse and am looking for a way to bring up the convo of extending his stamina

ANSWER: I know this doesn't answer the question, but have you expressed a desire to continue even after he finishes? (I am assuming that's where it stops) Like, encouraging him to please you in other ways during his refractory period?

================================================================================

QUESTION: 19M, 19F What do you suggest?

This particular incident concerns my friend, who does not have a reddit, so he is choosing to use this/my account to post his query.

Backstory: There's a girl who's been my friend in school for about 6 years now, probably known each other I'd say decently well for 5, switched schools, started texting.... the usual. I have a crush on her and for a while I thought she did too (no reason why I believed that though, I just thought) and never acted on it. Legit every day texts and stuff. Recently she's been posting a couple (probably like 2) pics with a guy who she said is  "just close friends".

I am in a bit of a dilemna... I don't even slightly think they are "just" close friends but I don't have any reason to think she would lie. If they are dating it doesn't sit right with me to keep chatting with her knowing that I am interested in her but she is clearly taken. Because if the roles were reversed, I would not want a guy talking to my girlfriend wanting to win her over

So what doyou think I do? I tell her and completely nuke our friendship? I don't tell her and continue being an idiot? Or just cut her off.... I tried killing the conversation a couple of times with dry replies and day old texts but she does come back to message me, and honestly tries to revive conversations between us.

My whole problem being : I am dense, and I have no fucking idea what to do... if they are dating then I do not in any way want to fuck up their relationship or stir some shit.... I want to quietly see myself out and save whatever self respect I have left. But on the other hand if they're not dating.... I don't see me and her dating either because I dont know if she likes me back or not. Plus I'm a 19 year old and probably should be focussed on my education anyway 🥲 I just need some advice or insight.... because I am wayy out of my depth here

TL;DR : I like a girl who probably has a boyfriend, but I am not sure about it, and I don't know if I should keep talking to her.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (24M) broke up with my girlfriend (22F) and now I feel terrible. Was it the right decision?

My now ex and I had been dating for about 8 months. For a bit more context, before this relationship started I had been celibate for almost 5 years (since I was 19) hers was a year prior, and was toxic according to her. When we first started seeing each other things were pretty good, but as the months passed I found myself getting the 'ick' from some of the things she did, such as the way she spoke to certain people in her life, or the way she dealt with anger, confrontation, finances, etc. As I slowly felt myself wanting to pull away, I felt she was getting more and more attached to me. We had a few conversations about our future and what we wanted, and I felt a complete disconnect (she is heavily God oriented, I'm a non believer. She wants kids, I don't). Even then, I kept trying to make things work, but we fought more than I've ever fought with anyone before, friend or family. It came to a point where whenever she would call me my anxiety would spike because I didn't know if she would be mad, or upset. It felt like she was always radiating negativity over something trivial and it would bring me down.

Last night I sat down with her and explained that I wasn't happy in the relationship, that it felt like I was just going through the motions because I didn't want to hurt her and I didn't want to lead her on. It was a very hard conversation but it wasn't on bad terms and she did understand, though she didn't agree and wants to be with me still.

I thought that I'd feel better after being honest and telling her that I felt incompatible. I do love this girl and care for her deeply, but for almost a month I had been telling myself staying together would just make it harder when it inevitably ends. Now I'm at work the next day feeling like I made a mistake and all I want is to see her, but whenever I think of calling her something in the back of my head is telling me this was the right thing to do. Is it better to just get through this and move on? Or maybe I'm just in denial?

ANSWER: You have fumdamental differences with your ex, breaking up is the absolite right decision.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (24F) boyfriend (28M) of almost 1yr broke up with me because I “deserve better” and then took it back

Basically what the title says. We are almost at our one year (3 days away) and I express that I’ve been feeling distant in our relationship, and it prompts him to say that he has a lot of personal things in his life that he needs to work on and can’t give me what i deserve. I accept this reality and we hug each other goodbye while in tears. He calls me two hours later saying that all he can think about is me and that breaking up feels wrong. He tells me a couple of private things that he has been emotionally neglecting and that it’s been messing with his mental health. He felt the need to start over with a clean slate, and that included being single and throwing away the relationship, but realized it was the wrong way to go about it. 

I obviously love him and want this relationship to thrive. I understand that relationships are never perfect, but i’m not sure how to go about this. I want to be treated with consideration (him planning dates, remembering the details, surprising me with flowers, etc) but i also understand that he needs to take care of himself in order to fully be present in this relationship and be present for me. I want to support him, but I also am on the verge of being burnt out from being the one who puts in all the effort and being patient all the time. Do I just focus on myself? If I do, how long do i wait around until I get treated the way I deserve? He is a great person, and i don’t doubt his love for me, I just know he’s struggling mentally with the pressures of life.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (19F) boyfriend (20M) didn’t care about my birthday

What the title suggests. My boyfriend who I’ve been dating for about 4 years, went out with his friends on my birthday. I was obviously upset but he came to see me at night, for context, my mom invited people around for herself, and not for my birthday since I told her me and my boyfriend were going out. When he saw me, he bought me chocolates and a candle, now the monetary value of the gifts don’t matter to me, but they had no thought in them. Every time I buy him gifts it’s thoughtful, it’s not just that either, he puts little to no effort in planning dates etc. I’ve spoken to him about this, and he said he did want to go out but he asked if I want to, like obviously I want to? Obviously I don’t want to plan my own birthday? He said he’ll be better and I really like him and I don’t want to leave him, but I can’t get over it. I guess I’m asking, how do I get over this? I feel genuinely upset

Edit: I’m going to edit to say, he had a job when I just finished college and was on holiday and he bought me AirPods for finishing exams, he picked me up at 4 am from the airport (his parents are strict and he had to sneak out), he’s been there for me when a truly terrible thing happened, he’s the first guy to treat me with kindness, he always gets food with me even when he’s busy or tired, he offers to pick me up or drop me off since I don’t have a license. He isn’t completely an asshole! 

Edit 2: I wanted to say the first 2 years of our relationship, we were long distance. Last year I had some problems and asked for a break which he requested, this is the 4th year of us dating and first time we “celebrated” my birthday. After I did tell him about the no effort about 2 months after my birthday, he bought me gifts. About the finances, we were the same job and we earn about the same, which is quite a lot. 
I guess I’m not asking now how do I leave this, rather what do I do next? Also we’re going on holiday together in Jan, the tickets are non refundable

ANSWER: The bar is on the floor. Don’t settle for such a low effort boy.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (30F) sooth my ex’s (25M) fears?

I (30F) was with my ex (25M) for over a year. We broke up 7 weeks ago. He broke up with me after we had a very stressful trip, we went overseas and it was both our first time out of the country and the airline left my bag in America which set off a chain of events that I can’t even talk about it it was so stressful and we fought for two weeks after we got home. I had never spoken negatively about my relationship before but that trip was the first time my best friend ever heard me vent about my relationship and that was the first time I ever felt like we might really break up. I had never felt that way before. I was always certain that we could get through anything until that point. We both agree that our relationship was the deepest connection either of us have ever felt and recently he said the break up keeps getting harder and he doesn’t know why he was able to get over his two other relationships so quickly but he’s not getting over me. I’ve seen him twice since we broke up. We hung out for 6 hours once (in public) and it was so nice to talk to him without the arguments and it felt like we fully understood each other. He said he still cries at random items he finds in his apartment that belong to me. Last night I came over to his apartment and we talked again. He is scared of getting hurt again. I struggle with relationship OCD and I have trauma from a past relationship that I project onto him. He’s a sweet man, does everything for me, but I still am hyper vigilant of everything he does. I would look for any sign he didn’t love me and run with it. It could literally be the smallest thing too. I started therapy while we were together and have continued it. I do EMDR, am starting TMS soon and do exposure therapy as well. I’m really trying because even if we never get back together I can’t bleed on the next person. He’s petrified and you can tell that he’s fighting his head vs his heart. He still loves me deeply and is soft to me for the most part (he was distant for the first weeks but we’ve made major strides at showing up for each other the past few weeks). Anyway he asked me about if I’ve met anyone else. I haven’t but I’ve texted someone but cut it off because I still feel loyalty to my ex. I told him that. He has tried putting himself out their too with similar feelings that he doesn’t want to move on (his words not mine) He told me he has really high standards because of how I loved him. We just talked and when I was leaving he hugged me for like ten minutes, smelled my hair, asked me if I changed shampoo, walked me to my car and opened my door for me and hugged me for another 5 minutes and kissed the top of my head several times and we said we love each other. I know he’s scared and I am too. I don’t want to repeat the same patterns. I’m trying to assure him that it can and will get better but I don’t want to overwhelm him. Our relationship was overall very great, fun, funny, we had the best jokes, always loved being together, he had already asked my parents to marry me, was super close to my family, but we reached a roommate phase and truthfully neither of us had the skills to navigate how to get out of it so it built resentment. Now that we are broken up and I moved out I feel like I can see more clearly why that happened and how to work on it. I just don’t think he’s ready to take the leap. I think he needs to see it in my behavior now before he’s ready to be with me again. Like I know he loves me, he says it but the fear is controlling everything. He always showed up for me when I had fear about our relationship and I want to show up for him now that the tables have turned. How can I show up for him and be stable and consistent while he’s navigating his fear?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Looking for Non-Traditional “Engagement/Commitment Symbol” Ideas M28 F28

My boyfriend M28 and I F28 have been talking about what getting engaged might look like for us in the future, and we realized we don’t fit into the usual expectations at all. We have been dating for 5 years. We’re not into the idea of a big proposal moment, we’re not flashy, and neither of us wants a ring, he’d never wear one, and I don’t want one either.

We’re not planning a wedding or engagement anytime soon; we’re just trying to figure out what would feel right for us if we ever chose to make that step. But at this stage, we know we’re going to spend our lives together. And honestly, it would be nice to have something meaningful to show if someone asked, without it being traditional or showy.

So we’re looking for ideas for subtle, wearable things that could represent a commitment. Bracelets? Necklaces? Keychains? Matching accessories? Tattoos? Something else entirely?

If you and your partner skipped the traditional engagement/ ring route, what did you do instead? What worked for you?

Would love to hear ideas!

ANSWER: I haven't done this but I think anything that is personal to the both of you i.e. something symbolic you both agree means commitment would work.

A little like in a DS relationship where the sub is collared.  They might have a "play" collar and an everyday collar.  The everyday collar could be a necklace or bracelet which means ownership/commitment/love to the couple but looks otherwise "normal" to the outside world.

Your commitment to each other is personal to you both.  Something like a bracelet could be seen as more unisex as you could have the same one or go for different but similar ones to suit your style. Likewise with a necklace or chain.  

Less standard ideas could be a tattoo (but not something I would recommend as permanent), piercings (ear probably is the most standard or genital if that is your thing and you want a private, very intimate  expression of your love).

================================================================================

QUESTION: 26M unsure about future kids while partner 25F is firmly childfree

My partner (25F) and I (26M) have been together for about five years. We have a strong, loving relationship, shared values, similar long-term goals, and a life we genuinely enjoy. We live together, have fulfilling careers, travel often, and I get along very well with her family.


When we first got together, we were both very clear that we did not want children. She has remained firm in that position, and I have always respected that.


Over the last couple of years, though, I have started having mixed feelings. I am still strongly leaning toward being childfree because our current lifestyle genuinely makes me happy, and I know kids would introduce a lot of uncertainty and change. But I am no longer as certain as I was at the beginning of our relationship.


I think some of my doubts come from a fear of future loneliness. I am naturally introverted, although I have opened up more in adulthood, and the idea of being old and regretting not having kids is something I cannot quite shake. I have also seen the realities of parenting up close through family members, so I know how hard it can be. But I also believe that if I ever chose that path, I would rise to the responsibility and do my best as a parent.


We are at a stage where we are thinking about long-term commitments like marriage, buying a home, and maybe getting a pet. But we both agree that the question of children needs to be addressed before moving forward. It is too important to leave unresolved.


I feel stuck. I am not ready to make a firm decision, and I know my perspective might change with time. I might be someone who does not have a strong drive either way and could be happy following my partner’s wishes, but I worry that wanting kids might develop later and create conflict, even though I have never strongly wanted them.


My partner wants clarity, not an immediate decision but reassurance that the person she builds her life with will not leave her later. I completely understand and want the same for her.


This is what I am struggling with. I deeply love her and truly believe we could build a fulfilling future together. But I am worried that if, years from now, the desire for children does appear, I will not know how to choose between that and the relationship we have built.


For context, we live abroad, have moved between countries together, and have created a life that works very well for both of us. We are close to our families, we appreciate each other's backgrounds, and we are aligned in almost every other aspect of our lives.


I am looking for advice from people who were uncertain about kids for a long time or from couples who have navigated this mismatch. How did you move forward? What helped you understand your true priorities? And how do you make big life decisions when you are not ready, but your partner needs clarity?


TLDR:

Been with my partner for five years. We agreed to be childfree, but I have developed some uncertainty while she remains firmly childfree. I love our relationship and our life together, but I am afraid that a desire for kids might develop in the future and create a conflict. I want advice from people who have dealt with long-term uncertainty about having children or mismatched preferences.

ANSWER: Don't have children because you're worried about being lonely when you're old. You're not their responsibility. Have children if you're prepared to make your entire existence about THEM. Everyday all day. Children are consuming, as they should be. Even as teenagers and young adults.

================================================================================

QUESTION: i’m (f20) having communication issues with my bf (m21)

we have been dating for nearly 1.5 years and sometimes it feels like i carry a lot of of the emotional weight when starting conversations about how we feel or after an argument. during these conversations he’ll either just say “i don’t know”, “it doesn’t matter” or suddenly get aggressive for no reason which can lead to arguments that spiral.

it feels like i’m approaching these conversations the wrong way. however i have been learning to give him space when he needs to cool down, and to remind myself that feelings don’t always equate to facts. i try to be patient, and know there are certain situations that aren’t the most appropriate for a deep conversation. he’s also definitely more avoidant and keeps a lot to himself, whilst i on the other hand have an anxious attachment style (this im in therapy for and have worked through a lot of my codependency issues).

the main issue really is when he has upset me, and i confront him about it, he’ll say sorry but not really elaborate on it? or he’ll get dismissive, “you have done this to me too” type things and maybe i’m being too picky but i like apologies to feel sincere? not just for the sake of saying sorry to appease me. i’ve communicated this to him numerous times as it makes me feel heard and understood when someone acknowledges how they’ve upset me. but he hasn’t changed it at all.

apologies for a bit of a messy explanation but does anyone have any suggestions on what i could do in these situations? it’s frustrating to feel like i can’t share my feelings or that i have to forgive him so quickly when i’m actually kind of upset at him. i obviously care about him and want to find a way we can both communicate in ways suited to us both but i’m not sure how we can do that.

================================================================================

QUESTION: (29M) Trying to figure out how to handle mixed signals from an old fling (26F) who popped back into my life

I (29M) had a short fling with a girl (26F) a few months back. Things fizzled out and she said she wasn't ready and was enjoying her freedom and when we stopped talking she unfollowed me on Instagram. I didn’t chase it.. I figured it was done.

Fast forward to almost 2 weeks ago: out of nowhere, she texted me. It wasn’t anything deep, just casually said she hoped i had a good time on my trip. I replied saying thanks and asked how she has been, and then she never responded. So it felt like she just wanted attention or wanted to see if I’d answer.

A week later, I posted a TikTok video. Within the first 10 minutes she commented on it basically saying it was cool. For context, TikTok is the only place she still follows me. She doesn’t follow me on Instagram or anywhere else.

It feels like she just wants attention, not an actual reconnection. But part of me wonders if she’s still interested on some level and I’m overthinking it.

What’s the best move here? 

TL;DR: Old fling unfollowed me months ago, then randomly texted me last week but ignored my reply. Now she commented on my video within minutes of posting. I’m attracted to her and would like to talk again, but i don’t want to get played or look desperate.

ANSWER: It looks like she had an interest in someone else and so she wanted to pursue that rather than be with you.  That other relationship did not work out, so she is back.

How you proceed depends on what YOU want.

If you want a loyal and committed partner for a LTR, then it seems unlikely this is the girl for you.

If you want to have a good time, it sounds like she is interested in playing together, but will likely be looking for a way to trade up.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Advice on being in a functional relationship with someone on the spectrum. 33f, 35m

My 33f husband 35m together 10 years is not diagnosed as autistic. As a child he had delays and required therepy to start talking at 4. He graduated from speech at 9. He had emotional disregulation issues and did lots of therepy for that, where he feels he was simply conditioned to hold everything in. He was always behind and in special Ed classes for reading and writing. I mean really behind. I dont think he ever got past a 5th grade reading level. Still cannot spell. Its actually kinda cute. He also did occupational therepy for a while, but I'm not sure why. His parents insist he was never actually diagnosed with anything besides developmental delays. We have been together for 10 years. We have 2 small children. He is incredible accept that hes unable to connect emotionally. Express himself, acknowledge my feelings. Be emotionally sensitive. Have depths of empathy. He also really struggles with tunnel vision and once he gets an idea in his head he cannot change it. He cannot adjust to circumstances. A few years ago I couldnt take it and was ready to leave, so he went on anxiety meds. It helped alot. He eventually told me he walked around all day feeling like he was going to have a panic attack. The meds really have helped but I dont know how much longer I can go suppressing my emotional needs. I'm becoming a really angry person, and starting to resent him. I've tried suggesting therepy alot. For him. For me. For us. Anything. He wont do it. I am. And he wont tell me why. I've spent the past few months begging him to talk to me. He has recently opened up a little. He told me he thinks he is autistic, and when he leaves the house everyday he uses every bit of energy he has to get through it. That hes masking. And so with me he just doesnt have any energy to give me. He said he wishes he could be what I need but just can't. That I'm the only one who knows him because he is able to drop it when he walks through our door at night. I want our relationship to work, but honestly I've been thinking about exit plans. Our youngest is 1 and I'm thinking I'll stay till she's school aged then leave. I might start putting part of my paychecks into a separate account and paying off my mutual debt more aggressively to prepare. ​​I really want our relationship to work but the reality might be he genuinely isn't capable of meeting my emotional needs and I can't live like this forever. I'll become one of those angry middle aged women drinking martinis at noon popping Xanax to have a family dinner, and having no relationship with my grandkids. I open up to him and express myself and my feelings all the time. I'm begging him to understand that him ignoring me is killing me. It makes me feel like he doesn't care about me. I never have the ability to resolve a feeling. Every negative thing I feel that I should be able to bring to my husband, talk about, and resolve just gets stuffed back inside of me. The only way I know how to resolve it is by accepting he doesn't care about my feelings, and letting it go. But if I do that. If I start just saying we'll he just doesnt care, then I am gone. I will emotionally disconnect from him so fast it will be unreal. How do you make it work with a person who is mostly unable to do emotional llabor. Is anyone else in a similar marriage?

ANSWER: Diagnosis aside, you have no obligation to stay in a marriage that no longer serves your needs. 

In mental health treatment, we like to say that your problems may not be your fault, but they are your responsibility. For your husband, its his responsibility to figure out his support needs and pivot accordingly as a father, spouse, etc. 

Perhaps he doesn't understand your perspective, perhaps his anxiety is too crippling at this point in time, who knows. 

But at the end of the day, nobody changes until they want to and are ready to. No matter how badly you want this to work out, if he doesn't have the motivation or ability to make changes, then perhaps you need to weigh the pros and cons and make the best choice for yourself and your children. 

The DEARMAN strategy from DBT therapy can help you plan a heavy conversation.

QUESTION: I (20M) and some girl (F20 "honestly unsure") talked and now I have no clue on what to do, like how?

So I'm just a college student, studying all day, not having any sociale life, but some days ago one of my roommates convinced me to go to a party of some kind, and cutting it farly short I talked to a girl and one of her friends asked me for my ig (yeah), now first of all we had a convo of like 7 words each maybe 10, and I barely know anything about her, with barely meaning nothing.
With that the only things I know are like that she should be a girl and that she is/was interested in some way in me.
Honestly I have no clue on what to do, just sending a dm saying "hey" or something like that.
Never in my short life a girl approached me so it's a new experience and it's a strange situation for a first time in my opinion.

ANSWER: If you don't have any genuine interest in her as a person you probably shouldn't message her at all. But generally when people want to get to know each other they'll ask questions and go back and forth giving one another information about themselves and their lives.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (21M) doesn't want my girlfriend's(20M) happiness to be fully dependent on me

 

We both are in long distance for last 1.5 years
And things were averagely going well as a usual relationships we had our good days and hard days 

We both study in med school also

But there's one recurring issue that causes most of our quarrels while on long distance is that 

I don't give her that much attention or that much time 

I try my best to give her my time besides my studies and social circle but she thinks that I'm prioritizing my studies and friends more than her it is true for some time 

but there have been many times that I ditched my friends and postponed my studies just to talk to her but obviously I don't tell her that I did it.

I do many things in med school besides my studies in which I can explore my hobbies such as Drama,Lit,Filmmaking more they also consume some of my time but they are not daily activities but whenever I do that she thinks that she's not the priority.

She doesn't do study or explore her hobbies in her full day, I had told her many times that she should do something persue her hobbies or atleast study a bit but there's issue of my tone also and because of that she thinks I'm forcing her into being a version that she's not,
So I usually don't poke around this topic.

 I also do mistakes sometimes like I tell her that I'll call you in 2-3 hr but something comes up and I forget about that 
ik this is not at all acceptable and I've cut down on my mistakes like this but she makes me feel that because I do mistakes like that I am pretending love or doesn't love her at all 

Sometimes I also feel like I'm not loving her or I don't think I'm right for her and I tell her my feelings but somehow she persuades me that I do love her and all that she said about pretending was because of she was angry.

What I want to know from this subreddit is how can I convince her that I really do love her but I can't match the time she's giving for me while I can't?

Also there's issue in our sleep cycle also I usually sleep around 12AM because i have to go to class or posting the next day but she stays awake because she doesn't care about her attendance and also want me to stay awake with her till she sleeps.

Edit-

I just now realised that similar post like mine has been made from the girl POV but we're not related in anyway

================================================================================

QUESTION: BF Cheated - Would you stay? 23 F , 24 M

TLDR- would you stay with a bf who cheated if he’s extremely apologetic? And you love him? Thanks

I’m 23 F he’s 24 M We’ve been together almost 3 years, since college. From the same hometown but he moved to a diff state, 3 hours drive about 1.5 yr ago. I work remote so it’s not hard to make time to see each other, I can drive to him or vice versa whenever.

He had a work trip to Vegas, when he came back I had a feeling, so I went thru his iPad and found messages with a coworker I’ve always been worried about. He follows her on insta and likes all her posts.. and it was clear they hooked up and he pursed continued communication with her. He called her baby, asked for a pic of the hickey he gave her, and asked her not to text “while his ex came to visit tomorrow” (me, not an ex whatsoever??) and she basically said yeah, that she’d let him sort out his shit.

I messaged her on instagram and she was very apologetic and confirmed that they did everything but sex - he slept over - and that he was very adamant he didn’t have a gf anymore. I’m confused bc his entire instagram is photos of us and he never took them down… the whole thing honestly blows my mind.

On top of all of those details, we broke up in February for about 3 weeks. In my exploration of what communication he had with other women- I find out he broke up with me bc he was at the bar dancing with another woman & got her phone number, and decided to break up so he could sleep with her. He then met a second woman, pursued a relationship with her, and she had no interest so he returned to me… who had been patiently waiting for my turn.

Truly, brutally, honestly - what would you do? I know these stories are awful - but other than these absolutely horrendous incidents he truly has been so caring and understanding, he puts in enormous effort, and I am extremely in love with him and the person he is. We’ve talked about moving in, marriage, and I truly saw my life with him. He’s putting in so much effort to rebuild trust - full transparency, I have all his socials, I have his iMessage logged in, he writes me weekly letters, he ask me daily how to be a better partner- he is adamant that he let lust win but he never will again.

I just can’t wrap my mind around the fact he could even do it 1 time. So how can I trust he won’t do it again in 5 years? 

IF YOU MADE IT THIS FAR - Would you stay?

ANSWER: At this age, with this kind of cheating, no, you don't stay. 

> he was very adamant he didn’t have a gf anymore

This was a calculated decision he made. 

>  I find out he broke up with me bc he was at the bar dancing with another woman & got her phone number, and decided to break up so he could sleep with her.

He throws you aside as soon as he thinks he has something else that's a sure thing. 

Dump his ass.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (25M) in know if she’s (24F) the one, or just the one who checks the most boxes?

I (25M) am dating a girl (24F) who we will call Izzy. Izzy and I have been dating for a bit over three years now, and had met in senior year of college. Our relationship has been great, we care for each other, we support each other, and most importantly we fight for one another.

I moved about 6 hours from home after college to be with her in the city she lives in. We’ve created a life here, with great friends, and I’ve integrated pretty well, although I still do miss my life long friends and family from home.

Izzy struggles with her mental health ever since she was a kid. This was something I knew going into the relationship. While it has gotten better over the three years, I do still feel that it affects me, especially when she backslides into a more depressive state. I’m always there for her in those times, but I feel like I sometimes struggle during those times too.

My real issue is that for as much as we fight for one another, refuse to let things fester, and truly love each other, I’m still left questioning whether she’s the one for me. We’re talking about moving in and marriage more and more, which has me evaluating if this is what I truly want. 

I won’t sugar coat it and say I’m always the best. I sometimes struggle with communicating my feelings, and the truth is, when she tells me the tenth time that week that she’s sobbing and now I have to stop what I’m doing to comfort her, I’ve started to get pissy and uncaring. When it happens so often it just feels like “oh boy what is it this time 🙄” and I know that borders if not crosses the unfair line to her. As a TMI, our intimate life has also had its struggles, and while I absolutely would never ever cheat, I sometimes find my eye wandering and wondering what it would be like to be in a relationship with a better intimate life. And yes, we’ve had many conversations about our intimacy that have sometimes led to marginal improvements. Transparently, in the worst moments I have the intrusive thought of breaking it off, and she’s even asked if I’ve ever thought about breaking up with her and I feel horrible lying and saying no, but I don’t want her to have a panic attack and slide into depression if I say yes.

I worry that these poor times of mental health, or lack of the ability to handle certain things (caused by her OCD) may rub off on any future child of ours and cause mental health issues for them too.

There’s so much nuance and context I don’t feel like writing out and you probably don’t feel like reading, but I just don’t know guys. It feels like she’s the one, or is supposed to be, but I worry that one day my slight feelings of uncaring might come to a boiling point. I want the absolute best for her, I just don’t know if that’s me. 

Thanks for hearing me out, I’m so confused and just need some advice.

TL;DR how do I know she’s “the one”? If I even have to ask, is that a bad sign?

ANSWER: >how do I know she’s “the one”? If I even have to ask, is that a bad sign?

If you feel like you have to ask a bunch of strangers on reddit, then yeah, that's a pretty bad sign.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [18F] have liked a guy [18M] in my school for 2 years and I don’t know what to do. “How can I ask him out without embarrassing myself?”

I’ve liked this guy in my school for about 2 years now. We’re both 18. I sometimes catch him staring at me, and other times he acts like I’m not even there. We’ve had a few moments where it felt like he might like me back, but I honestly can’t tell.

My friends keep telling me to just ask him out. They say that if he says no, I can play it off as a dare. I don’t know if that’s a terrible idea or a smart one, and I’m scared of embarrassing myself.

I don’t know what to do, so I’m looking for advice.

TL;DR: Liked a guy my age for 2 years. Mixed signals. Friends want me to confess. I have no clue if I should.

ANSWER: Ask him out, I agree that is good advice.

If he rejects you though, I thibk playing it off as a dare would be lame and immature. 

Just accept that not everyone is compatible or ready to date at the same time and dont take it too personally. If someone doesnt want to date you its nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed over even if it does sting a bit in the moment.

Logically, you dont want to be in a relationship woth someone who doesnt want to be with you, so if they reject you, its like they are saving you from wasting more time.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Walk or Run ? I [49M] have girlfriend [40F] with extreme jealousy and insecurities coupled with unrealistic and unhealthy boundaries and expectations

49 M divorced father of 3. I have been in a new relationship for 8 months with 40 F For the most part she has been a good partner we share almost complete common interests. 

We have considerably different pasts I was married for 17 years and then entered a new relationship for 5 years following my divorce that ended last year . 
I don’t drink I don’t party I don’t sleep around. Never had a “hookup” ever my entire life and not because I didn’t have offers I just morally don’t believe in that stuff. I’ve only been with three women in the last 23 years by choice. I’m a dedicated father and good man 

My partner comes from a more party past lots of mistakes failed relationships etc which led to her making choices to become sober embrace the Bible make positive changes which I respect however this woman does have a history of recreational drug use and heavy drinking she has been involved in casual relationships in the past. She was in a 3 year relationship ironically with a pilot since I am a pilot but as she explained he was a heavy drinker and “ we are completely different “ 

She describes her last relationship as traumatic and explains that she believes he cheated on her. 

Maybe this is harsh but I kicked her out of my home the other night after she saw on Facebook that I was friends with the new “ married with children neighbor “ that moved in next door and started her rhetoric of me being predatory or trying to fuck her and seeking out random women. 

The truth is her package was missing she posted on the community page , it was on my
Porch I advised her she retrieved it and she sent me a request simple as that . 

Might seem harsh right? 

This is not the first or even tenth time 

- searched my tik tok out of 400 pages found one person I followed who had a video of her in a bikini and accused me of being a creeper 

- set a personal boundary that prohibits me from any interaction with the opposite sex fir example I fly with a female first officer that fine.. we grab lunch between flights that’s cheating 

- searched my follows on instagram there were a couple hundred found 1 page out of hundreds from years ago that was a fishing page with a guy and girl that fish she wears a bikini . Hadn’t been on instagram in over a year .. I was accused of lusting and cheating 

- accuses me of projection. That story about the guy with the hooker? That must secretly be me lol 

- analysis of people liking my posts on Facebook. “ why are you friends with this woman who is a nurse in Tampa“ ? 

- neighbor across street his grandson is living there 9yo no dad mom is possibly an addict nice kid loves planes comes over all the time to talk about planes . Being a male role model to this boy has resulted in me being accused of trying to fuck his mom. 


The list could go on but I think you see the big picture

ANSWER: Why do you choose to have her in your life? It says the same about your unprocessed attachment trauma from childhood as it does with her behavior.

QUESTION: I don’t know whether I’m [F 31] being used or not [M 33]

Been talking to a guy I met OLD since late August.

Met up with him end of September for a date. We both have kids and jobs so see eachother around 2 times a week.

We’ve had some good dates, going for walks, drinks, sleepovers. Slept together like 4 times.

Both not seeing other people.

I’m new to the dating world after my last relationship ended in 2022. Ex was abusive and I’ve had to work on myself.

We speak daily and this guy says he likes me, hopes for a relationship with me however it’s something that he wants to “let happen naturally but hopes we do get to that point” He has told friends and family that he’s dating me. I’ve also said to him I don’t want to just be someone’s fuck buddy. He agrees. 

I have never heard this term before. Am I being strung along for an FWB or is this the reality of non toxic dating? I’ve only ever known love bombing so it’s all new to me.

ANSWER: It sounds like everything is going well, maybe take your time to see how you feel with this new dynamic.

QUESTION: I 21M, struggling with overthinking and anxiety in a new relationship with my GF 21F.

I 21M, I’ve been with my gf 20F for a few weeks now, and things are going well. We call almost every night, spend hours talking, playing video games, and she’s caring and consistent. The relationship itself feels healthy.

My problem is the anxiety. When she takes a while to text back or sends a short message, my brain jumps straight to old fears. I start worrying I’m repeating past mistakes or that I’ll get abandoned again. Sometimes the panic attacks is so bad that I feel sick in my stomach.

She’s told me she’s busy and dealing with a lot, and I believe her. I’ve seen it myself. Her actions show she cares. I feel like something’s wrong even when nothing is.

I want to handle this better.

# URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1p24uyb/my_22m_gf_21f_has_started_to_treat_me_differently/
================================================================================

QUESTION: My (22M) GF (21F) has started to treat me differently because she met a close cousin (24M) of hers who she hadn't met before due to a divorce.

So my GF of almost 2 years recently (about 2-3 months ago) got the opportunity to meet her cousin ( Dad's elder brother's son) who she hasn't met for long due to her uncles divorce. 

Recently the cousin and her family got in touch and met up with each other. And few weeks ago it was her birthday and he came to their house, and I was there too for the birthday (we live in different states). I was there for about 10 days and me and her cousin had fun and hit it off nicely and everything was good but after I returned to my city for college things changed. 

My gf barely talked to me, her texts were dry and short  and she was supposed to help me with my exam prep as I had stayed till 2 days before the exam and she ensured me that she'll help me (she was 1 year ahead in my college). And she just left me whenever I asked for help just handed me her notes and basically said good luck I'm going to go spend time with him, quite honestly I had to do most of the work myself and somehow scrapped by the exam. Honestly I was busy with exams so I didn't really notice much of her behaviour change but after my exams it became more jarringly obvious.

He stayed for almost a month so 20 more days since I came back and after my exams I started to notice how she was less open, less talkative, less interactive, less intrested in spending time with me. It honestly felt like I was just a stranger pestering her. Now, it made me jealous initially that she spent all the time with him, talking laughing and just the kind of person I knew and loved was with him while I got a dry husk. And the time that she did spend was almost meaningless coz she didn't really talk much, just played wordle with me and then just did her own things or left. 

So we discussed about my feelings both jealous and FOMO I felt due to her and her cousin hanging out, the first time we talked about it was after my exams and she was angry at me for treating him in a weird way, ( whenever he and her were there together, talking to me it would always be awkward. I'm a jolly sunshines kinda person by nature but whenever they were there together I'd have a seldom look and just overall very depressing state coz of how I felt)

I told her about it all and she understood it but still kept treating me the same way for the reminder of his days there and then after he left me her and her mom talked about it and her mom told her that it was wrong of her to push me aside the way she did and obviously he behaved the way he did because of it.

And since then my gf has been treating me as she used to but it still feels fake. That she's only doing this coz she was told and not because she feels like it. And she still spends a lot of time talking to him over calls and sometimes still treats me like that but it's every now and then and I don't really blame her for it. But now the initial feelings of jealousy has turned into an insecurity. I'm afraid that she'll treat me like a stranger like she has for the past month. And I feel like I've started building a wall around me to expect it of her to be cold and ignorant of me again. 

She talks with him a couple of hours (3-5) everyday and it makes me feel an ominous kind of feeling in my stomach and I don't know what to do to stop feelings this, to feel secure in this relationship again. My mind keeps wishing  that she would just stop talking to him so much but that's not possible and I don't really want to have a relationship where I am stopping her from holding conversations with people she loves.

So yeah I need help or rather advice on how do I approach this? How do I let her know what I'm feeling and how can I approach this from a mental view to help rid of my insecurities so that I could improve my relationship with her.

ANSWER: I'm honestly very confused about this post, so you're going to need to clarify some things.  At first, you say your girlfriend stopped talking to you after you left, but then you later say that you talked to her so many times about her cousin from the moment you left until now.  Maybe there's just a communication breakdown here (between you and us), so please help us understand the deal.

Regardless, what exactly are you jealous about?  I'm further confused when you say "time with him" and "none with you" when you're talking about after you left.  Do you mean time spent with you virtually?  Again, help us understand the situation, and further, what are your expectations with her in terms of time spent together when you're not physically together, and separately, what is the actual situation in terms of time spent?

Moving on, I just again don't understand how your insecurity translates into a discussion about keeping a good relationship with him?  I know I'm a broken record here, but I feel like you need to re-write this with significantly more details.  Just help us understand.  Good luck.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My new bf for 4 months 35M had a bad break up with ex 25F and still has her on social media- read all details

I 33F met my current bf 35M back in June of this year. We met off fb dating. Treats me extremely we’ll communicates great. When we first started talking his ex 25f still lived in shared 2 bd apartment. They broke up September of 2024. They dated for 5 years and were engaged. His side is that in feb of 2024 she started hanging out with new ppl (hes a homebody) and started going clubbing at first just on the weekend then every couple days to never being home, would start arguments to go cheat and then asked him for a open relationship he did it because he wanted to make her happy claims he didnt seek out to date anyone else outside of her and then she said didnt want a relationship and left for spring break ghosted him came back broke up with him again. So they were broken up almost 7 months when we started talking and about 3 weeks left of her being on the lease. It was time for her to move out and it was delayed a week after move out day allegedly her mom was “bedridden” and lives out of town and needed more time to move since dad was helping take care of mom and unable to help move. My bf as you can tell is somewhat a push over and i asked why is she still there and he said her things are mainly packed and he finally talked to her said she needed a couple more days i said absolutely not she has until this weekend she knew when she needed to go and also causing tension in our relationship so she moved out come to find out she moved in with a new bf so all of that she allegedly lied to him about. He said he started drinking during the break up and never wants to drink again and always keeps her old bedroom door closed so i can feel the trauma. My issue is my bf birthday was last weekend my bfs exs mom tried to reach to say happy birthday THREE TIMES and he ignored it like he is no longer your son in law get over it. I feel like a healthy step of moving over the past is removing it from sight so I plan on having this conversation with him tonight because why would you still want to see someone who caused so much emotional and mental damage also i want a understanding of why shes still on his social media and her family if thats the way things really ended? He doesnt bring her up much so i dont think its a attachment thing i just don’t understand the logic and ive been boofoo the clown too many times i feel like maybe he hasnt let go all the way and this may be the only thing holding on to? Opinions appreciated

ANSWER: are you sure you want to be with someone who can’t untangle themselves from a toxic past?

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (28F) forgive my boyfriend (29M) for texting his ex.

For context my bf (29M) and I (28F) just moved in together in September. We have been dating for almost 2 years.

We’ve hit a few roommate road bumps but I didn’t think it was anything other than moving/growing pains.

This weekend in particular was a really rough one. We fought almost everyday. I was feeling disheartened but I was under the impression it was just a phase we’d come out the other side of.

Something happened yesterday that made me do some social media deep diving…and I found out he texted his ex: “do you ever miss me”

This was after a minor argument and I had gone to bed.

I confronted him and he owned up to it. He explained he was looking to her for an answer on “what is wrong with him that this always happens” ie why their relationship fell apart and I just feel like that doesn’t add up.

I can’t imagine ever texting an ex, especially after an argument with my partner. I knew he kept in touch with his exes as he is platonically close with a few of them, but I told him the only way I’d be comfortable with that is if he told me every-time one of them texted him. I also asked him earlier in the day before I found out and he said to my face “No, I told you I would tell you if they ever reached out.” So he lied to my face.

The most embarrassing part is she read it and didn’t respond.

I loved him so much we went through so much together he has always been great up until now. He owned up to everything and apologized profusely, and assured me there is no excuse. I am just not sure where to go from here. I moved 1.5 hours away from my job for him and I just feel so stupid.

Has anyone came back from anything like this? I just feel like I am too old to start over.

TLDR: How do I (28F) forgive my boyfriend (29M) for texting his ex.

ANSWER: You shouldn’t. The writing is on the wall. He misses her. That’s why he wanted to know. What do you think would have happened if she said yes? That’ he’d leave it on read? No. He was putting out feelers. It would have either lead to an emotional (or even physical) affair or he’d have ended it with you for her.

QUESTION: My mental health is putting a strain on my relationship ‘21F’ and ‘22M’

me and my boyfriend ‘21F’ ‘22M’ have been dating a year and a half, of which 6 months has been long distance. my boyfriend doesn’t communicate with me because he’s cautious of my mental health. i have PTSD, anxiety and depression. he has been there for me through all my ups and downs and has loved me throughout it. i know he doesn’t tell me stuff bc he’s afraid of how ill react and he tells himself it’s not that big a deal. fast forward 2 years, and all the things he doesn’t tell me comes up, all at once because he feels he has to get it off his chest and it’s a huge burden. my reaction was intense, i had multiple panic attacks and cried for many hours. i understand my mental health is bad but i try very hard, i go to therapy and im very open with him about how i’m feeling day to day. i wish he bought up these little issues before they consumed him. i know feel like an awful person i didn’t realise how much he was carrying until now. it is understandable he has not bought this little things up to me in fear of my reaction, as i often sit on the boundary of falling into another wave of depression. and in the past i have certainly overreacted to little things he has critiqued about my role in our relationship. i guess i just want some advice about what i can do to manage my emotions when he gives me constructive criticism and what can i ask my boyfriend to do?

ANSWER: If you know you have mental health problems then seeking professional help would be my advice. They are more trained in the area and you'll have to see them more than once

================================================================================

QUESTION: my boyfriend M18 and his girl bestfriend F18 cross my boundaries, am I dramatic by questioning our future?

okay first some background information, me (F19) and my boyfriend (M18) have been dating for 3,5 years. when we met he already had a girlbest friend for around 6 months, in the beginning they were very close he had her as his background on his phone. He then changed it and made his phone background to a picture of me. This made me really happy, but after some time he changed it back to a different picture of her. she would send snapchats with a cleaveage showing and It would get me uncomfortable. One time when I fake kissed my female friend for a tiktok trend. Where you kiss but your thumbs are covering your lips, so they dont actually touch. he did the same with her. I only met her a few times, so I dont really know what shes like. around that time I already showed my boundaries and some things stopped happening over time but he never showed the boundaries with her. now they see eachother a lot with other friends (shes the only girl) and a lot of time I see pictures of videos where they a unnececary close, im not the jealous type but do show that it makes me uncomfortable. She also posted a pic on her instagram of them where he has an arm around her shoulder. This picture looks like they're an actual couple. I told him many times that I want that he takes a little distance from her. but he never talks to her about it and I told it him many times. we are thinking about moving in togheter but with these situations I am not so sure because I dont need someone who doesnt respect my boundaries.

ANSWER: He doesn't respect your boundaries. Which means he wants to keep the door open for him and his best friend to start dating. Don't move in with this guy, he's not committed to your relationship

QUESTION: how did your parents meet your partner’s parents? I (F23) my bf (M26)

I met my boyfriend in 2021 (I was 19 and he was 22). we’ve both met each other’s families many times (I've been invited to his family gatherings for holidays, he was invited on trips with my family) but our parents never met each other. we tried to plan a joint birthday dinner so both families could finally meet, but our fav restaurant got closed and also I was out of town, so it never happened. now it feels awkward to suddenly invite everyone somewhere and anyway restaurants are super expensive where we live (4 days of salary for 7 average meals). we’re planning to move to another country together next year and I’d really like our parents to meet before that. any advice or how did it happen for you?

ANSWER: >but our fav restaurant got closed and also I was out of town, so it never happened

>and anyway restaurants are super expensive where we live

I don't get why you think it has to be some big, expensive event. Invite them over for dinner, or even just coffee and dessert. It's the gesture that matters, not the price.

QUESTION: Me (27M) When is the right time to ask her (27F) to be my girlfriend?

I’ve been talking to this girl for about a month now. We see each other pretty often, text/call every day, and the vibe is solid. She’s consistent, opens up emotionally…I really like her and I can tell she’s into me too.

She mentioned the other day that “it’s been a month now since we started talking” and I wasn’t sure if she meant that as a hint. I’m trying to move mature and not rush anything, but I also don’t want to move too slow and look unsure.

My question is:
How do you know when it’s the right time to make things official?
Is one month too soon if the energy and consistency are there?

ANSWER: This seems like a pretty easy conversation to have with her. You don't have to do a formal proposal. A month is long enough if you've seen each other frequently.

QUESTION: I 19M am too low energy for my boyfriend 20M

Me and my boyfriend have been together for over a year now and we've recently moved into a unit together away from any of our family now. At the moment I'm the only income for the both of us, working 40 to 50 hours a week starting at 5:30 in the morning and I have so much trouble finding the energy after work to do much of anything but I'm generally forced to in a sense. If i dont take the initiative and find us things to do or take us in dates he gets upset with me even though we live paycheck to paycheck and complains we dont have enough. I feel like most days I never get any time to myself to recharge at all, and i cant bring it up without him shutting down and being dissisme. Ill say things like "we should make a kind of plan so we can find time for hanging out and make some time for us to do our own things" and i was just met with "are you not happy? Ive been happy" and then he told me to go do whatever and got very dismissive of me. Ive seen here people say that 40 to 50 hours shouldn't make me this tried and there could be something wrong but I dont know, i just feel like i dont get room to breathe and im not allowed to have me time. How should talk to him about this? I've tried many times before but it just feels like I'm not allowed to get any me time

ANSWER: So why is he not working..? He needs a job, you're sponsoring a grown man and obviously that's gonna breed resentment

QUESTION: Homeownership 34F and 40M

I 34 F and my husband 40M. So my husband wants to save $78,000 for a home. He absolutely refuses to take advantage of Ohio's first time homeowners program because he believes is for poor people. He also expects me to save $50,000 as well because he doesn't want to be the only one buying the house. Now around where we live a decent house could be less than $200,000. To me I don't think he really wants to buy a house because number one I only make around $53,000 a year and if I were to say that amount that he's requesting then for the next couple of years he would have to pay all the bills to make that happen. But he doesn't want to pay off the bills. Either he is terrible at math which I know he's not or he doesn't really want to commit to a house.  How do I explain this that what he's seeking to do it doesn't make sense?

ANSWER: It’s not for “poor people” lmao, it’s for people who aren’t fcking stupid and their head isn’t full of little stupid rocks. It’s for people who know how finances work.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (20F) force myself to like my housemate (20F)?

Hi, so a bit of context: I met Elle (fake name), two years ago in my first year of uni. I met her through my boyfriend at the time's friend when we went to have a bonfire on the beach on bonfire night. That night my boyfriend and Elle started an ongoing joke about having a foursome with me, my boyfriend, Elle and the other person that was there. But a week later, my boyfriend tells me we're going over to Elle's flat that night and it isn't until I get there that I find out that it was supposed to be a threesome. I wasn't told beforehand, they both knew and on top of that they were both drinking a lot and I wasn't allowed to (that boyfriend was a bit controlling). That night ended up being very traumatic and led to things that some might consider SA, but the threesome never ended up happening because when they were both naked and Elle was sucking my boyfriends dick in front of me, I freaked out and ran down seven flights of stairs. 

I ended up breaking up with that boyfriend about 2/3 weeks later, but I still stayed friends with Elle's friend, which meant I had to hang out with Elle, who I was now terrified of. I sort of got an apology for it when she was drunk and in the middle of a group of our other friends, but the apology was "I'm sorry, I was in a bad place mentally, my bad". She also admitted that she knew I didn't want to be there and that she could tell the whole time I was uncomfortable. 

So fast forward to second year (last year) and I'm living with some friends, Elle is living with her ex, so she comes round our house all the time. I find out very quickly she still has an issue with boundaries, considering she never listens to me when I say no, she gets very handsy when she's drunk and also that one time she broke into our house. And I do mean break in, she jumped the back wall and climbed through our bathroom window. 

But despite all of this, my friends knowing all about my history with her and the fact that she makes me incredibly uncomfortable, they still invited Elle to live with us for this year. I didn't get a say in this matter, I was more just told because 'she lives with her ex, we want her to be in a comfortable home environment'. So, I had to learn to get along with her. I tried having another conversation about That Night, but all I got was her telling me I need to stop talking about it cause she doesn't want to think about it. 

Now I live with her, and she's everywhere. She walks into my room without knocking, she is still very handsy, but now when she's just tipsy (and also sober sometimes!), she also flirts with me constantly and keeps making comments about being a homewrecker (I have a new boyfriend, this one's better), and talking shit about my boyfriend all the time.

So, how do I cope with this? I can't move out until at least late May cause I need to finish my course and any time I try tell her to stop she gets worse. I've talked to my friends about it but none of them (within the friendship group) are really taking me seriously? They've more just told me it's a me issue to figure out. Which is crazy to forgive someone for SA, claiming she's just 'weird about boundaries' like it's a quirk. 

Please help, I just want to be able to focus on work and graduate next year.

ANSWER: It sounds like none of these people are your friends, I hope you can get away from them soon. Until then... if you feel like someone assaulted you, consider reporting it or talk to a legal worker if you're uncertain. Don't compromise on your boundaries, and look into other options like online school, finishing your course later, living with new boyfriend, etc. It's not worth staying in an environment like that just to to save money or graduate by a specific date.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (24F) ex boyfriend (40M) will never leave me alone.  Is there anything else I can do?

I hope you all are great. 
My native language is not English, so I apologize in advance for my silliness and my unorganized telling. 

I started a relationship with my ex boyfriend when I was 18 yo. We were both from different countries, living in Buenos Aires.
We have been together six years and most of the relationship we lived together in my country. 
Months ago, we moved to the USA, where he has citizenship and I do not. 
He was always controlling and pretty abusive, but once we got here and he was the one sponsoring my visa, he decided I should be locked in the house and he would take control over my whole life. He would threat me with my immigration situation. 
I feel guilty about it, but I was to scared to scape. 
It was really common he would let me locked in the house, with no clothes, no shoes, no passport or money, no food or water and dissapear for days. 
He was physically and sexually abusive. 
Luckily, I could overcome the situation and I run away and got help. 

He moved to a different state, but he would still threat me through email, the only communication channel he had.  
I have a restraining order but he doesn’t care.

Today, he appeared on my house while I was about to get into my car. He did not punch me, but he grabbed my hair and thrown me on the floor.  I fell and lost consciousness. 
I have reported it. 
I’m certainly really scared. I don’t want to be difficult, but I don’t trust he will stop and I’m afraid he would hurt himself or kill me. I don’t feel safe with the restraining order. I’ve been thinking in moving to another state, but  I have this idea that he will come back to his country and then find me anywhere in the world. 

I’m sorray because I know this is really unorganized and it may be difficult to understand, but I’m just lost in fear and I don’t know what I should do.

ANSWER: Keep reporting. If you see him, call the police. Did he find you because he knew your address?

I think you need to talk to the police and find ways to protect yourself. If you have any friends, could you have someone escort you around, or have the neighbors aware of the situation?

QUESTION: 41M / 37F struggling to make friends as an introvert, my partner wants me to be more social.

Hey everyone,
I’m 41M  an introvert and I’ve struggled with making friends pretty much my whole life. Lately it’s become a bigger issue because my partner 37F, really wants me to be more social and build friendships outside of our relationship. She means well, she wants me to feel supported and not rely only on her, but it’s been weighing on me a lot.

I want to do this for myself and for her, but tbh, I feel a ton of pressure. Meeting new people doesn’t come naturally to me, and even when I try, I get stuck in my head or I feel like I’m not interesting enough to connect with anyone. It makes me feel like I’m letting her down because she thinks I’d be happier with more people in my life.

For other introverts or anyone who’s been in a similar situation:
How did you start making friends when it didn’t come easily?
How do you handle the pressure of trying to change something that feels so hard?
And how do you talk to your partner about it without sounding like you’re giving up?

Any advice would mean a lot.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (20m) partner (19nb) cheated on me, and I don’t know what to do help me?

Tw drugs, SA

My partner have been best friends for 3-4 years, and dating for 1.5 years. We were proper pining in the beginning, “they’ll get together or they’ll die single” type style. I know we’re young and stupid but this is the first healthy relationship we’ve had. 
My last bf cheated on me and sa’d his sister (right???). Their last gf manipulated and abused them.

The other night they got really high (they struggle already with substance abuse) after we had a phone call. They said they would call me back in 20 mins but didn’t and I fell asleep. They instead downloaded grindr, and messaged a bunch of older guys. One came over for about 3 hours and they had sex. My partner was really high, but could obviously make choices. They said the entire time the guy was there they were regretting it, but never told him to stop. 
They told me the next day in tears, and I stayed with some family. It’s been a week and obviously I’m still heart broken. But there is so much they have to fix for us to work. We’ve had a lot of chats, we both know what we need to work on to be healthier (all this done with my parents aiding us, who have been through their fair share of relationship issues). But I don’t trust them anymore, which is to be expected. I’m so scared I never will. 
I talked to my (large) family to get an idea of what to do, my aunt said “I got divorced from him” (her ex husband), another said “take a break for a couple of months” and my mum said “I married them”. So now I’m really stuck because that’s a lot of different advice. 

I don’t want to be without them, I used to feel so safe in their arms, no matter what problem hit us, we would have an open discussion holding hands or cuddling. It would always be resolved eventually ending with a hug and a kiss. But this is different. I don’t know if I’m able to wait it out, but if I don’t am I able to deal with the consequences of not having them in my life?

QUESTION: I (23M) don't know what to do with my almost 5y LDR with my girlfriend (23F)

TL DR: 5Y long distance relation, little communication and intimacy.



As per title I feel lost in this relationship. We've been together for almost 5y and the long distance started 9 months into the relationship when she went abroad to study. It's been hard, but i thought we found a way to make it feel like we're still together (movie nights, dinner dates, etc.). We see each other about every 2 months for a weekend and during breaks, so in total around 40 days per year.

Recently we're both going through a rough patch. We enrolled in hard Master's degrees and have to work a lot to be on par with everything. The last 2 months our conversation became almost non-existent. We call and it's always the same:

>How are you?  
I feel terrible i have lots of things to do and don't want to talk about it.  
I'm sorry  
\insert talking about our day for 1 minute because we're both overworking and nothing really happens in our life\  
Ok bye

After 5 minutes i feel like I don't want to talk with her anymore, it's draining me instead of making me feel better and the same happens to her because we talked about it, although it just lead to a: it is what it is. When it happened before everything went away as soon as we saw each other, but this time it's the hardest i 've been hit.

The passions we had in common and could foster together are impossible to replicate long-distance (eg. hiking. doing sports) while the few we could do long-distance are neglected because there is no time.

To add to this the little intimacy we had before (basically just foreplay performed only by me because she said she was uncomfortable doing it on me but wanted to do it) has become non-existent. She said she would work on this by talking to a psychologist because she also wants to have sex (or get close to doing it) but actually ended up ghosting it.

Lastly when se comes back home se wouldn't even stay over for a night because she wants to stay with her family, but this severely limits our time together.



I love her deeply. She is still the most beautiful and amazing person in my life and we have grown together these past years, but now even though the qualities that made me fall for her are still there the relation has become more of a deep friendship rather than partners.  


I will travel to see her in 2 weeks but I don't know how i feel anymore.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (20m) deal with flatmates (20m) being gross in the kitchen when they make it about class?

Currently in a bit of a spat with a flatmate about his cleanliness in the kitchen. It’s many issues compounding each other, but the latest one was around rinsing off the plates before putting them in the dishwasher. It’s happened a few times now that I’ve found a smell in the morning and every time it comes from the dishwasher. It happened again last night and I watched it live, after talking with the other flatmates I decided to ask him to rinse off dishes before they go in the dishwasher. He got mad, said I was ‘pampered’, and was expecting too much.

To be fair, I have been very, very vehement about the cleanliness in the kitchen cause frankly an unclean space is unacceptable to me. And it has worked with most things, I’ve gotten the boys to wipe down the counter, put things away, clear trash when they see it, yk, basic things. For the most part they understand and respect my wishes, but this guy is making things into an issue of class. For like no reason. 

For context I come from a relatively affluent background, I am an international student and I pay international tuition, whatever whatever. These are all things my flatmate is aware of and very fixated on. I don’t think it is an upperclass thing to, yk, clean your kitchen. Cleaning supplies are not expensive and we share them anyway, so I think the issue for him is deeper. I don’t know how I can decouple my desire for a clean space with his conception of me as a pampered international student, frankly it often flavors a lot of our conversations and it’s a bit disrespectful.

This morning he apologized for being rude, but then said he’ll rinse the plates “just for me”, which I took a little personally.

Last year I lived with a bunch of teenage girls, there were no issues. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to hold grown men to a higher standard than a bunch of 17-18 year olds.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My F31 boyfriend M32 proposed and his mum isn’t happy.

I have known partner for 20 years through school and mutual friends, and fell madly in love with him, but I was too shy to approach him, he then moved away for work and came back 5/6 years ago. We have been together for 2 years now and I absolutely adore him and his son. Despite the challenges we face, such as children from previous relationships, including my disabled child he embraces as his own, and me studying at university in my 30s, we’ve built a strong foundation through communication, therapy, and commitment. We take each disagreement and figure out the tools to better our understanding for a healthier way of communicating that we both partake in.

We’ve had tough times, but always come out stronger. We have a lot on with kids (no intention for more), work, uni, and constant meetings for my son, but we are a team. We’re best friends, something I never thought possible in a partner.

I’d made it clear I didn’t want an elaborate engagement; my past relationship used expensive gestures as control, particularly an over the top engagement with equally over the top engagement ring. I only want something genuine, I just want him. We went away to explore a new city for a couple of days with all of our favourite pastimes (while the kids were with their respective parents); wine, embracing the cities culture, museums, architecture, walking the streets with no intended destination, cosy pubs with board games. So, after a roast dinner, pub quiz, a glass of wine or two, he knelt in the living room of our stay… no ring, just us. I was overjoyed.

Yesterday, we went to our local outlet and stumbled upon a sterling silver ring with a pink stone, quirky and perfect for me. We had no intention of even getting a ring, but I’d absolutely fallen in love with this piece, I’d never seen a pink stone. The stone is fake and holds no value, but I loved it. He pulled me in and bought it.

The first person we approached was his mum. We are more like friends, we go on trips, go to the theatre, have dinner, FaceTime when we’re not with her, all with or without my partner.

However, when we told her yesterday, she questioned why he’d propose. She’d told him how stupid he is, and got very upset. I am a rational person, I didn’t get angry, I told her I understand and her feelings are valid, but I needed to set and respect my own boundary by not being in a place I felt uncomfortable. I insisted my partner stay with her to comfort her, but  I was going home as I needed a minute to gather my thoughts and feelings. Maybe that was wrong of me to leave and should have had a united front.

Her reaction broke my heart, I’m unsure how to handle it and now, I am broken. I don’t want to tell anyone else in fear of this reaction and don’t think we should be engaged. Any advice as to why she reacted this way, or, on pretty much anything?

ANSWER: I mean you known each other for 20 years  like you mention so why do you think she got upset?

================================================================================

QUESTION: F24 doesn't know what kind of relationship they have with M26

I’ve been with this guy for almost two years.
Not in a real relationship, just… whatever we called it. We lived in the same house once, shared a bed, shared conversations, shared a little bit of feelings without admitting it.

After he moved out, we still saw each other once in a while. Not often, just enough to keep something going. I knew there were other girls at his place sometimes. I said nothing, because technically, I wasn’t his girlfriend. Yet he still came to me for advice, comfort, even money. And I showed up, because a part of me believed I was important to him.

One day I finally asked him,
“What are we?”

He looked at me and said,
“You’re a special person to me.”

And I didn’t know if that meant I should smile… or walk away.

So tell me,
Is “special” enough?

ANSWER: It's not a relationship, it's a FWB if you two are even friends.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (20M) feel super guilty about ending multiple long term relationships (19F,21F)

I’ve been in a couple long term relationships and recently exited another one and somehow i’ve always been the one breaking up but that aside, I have always tried to be amicable and everything but after the breakup, my exes always seem to contact me saying that they’re doing horribly and everything is going badly and that makes me so anxious and makes feel so guilty. I am just trying to do what’s right by me but I feel so bad because i am hurting someone else in the process and i’m not good at living with that reality. I cant even face my friends who are from the same group because i just feel so guilty. How do i work through this?

ANSWER: I think this post needs some clarification. 

You are 20, what does long term means to you? Because details will make all the difference here.

Apart from that, every breakup is painful for both parties but if you decided to part ways it is probably because you were not having what you needed from that relationship and the pain will go away for you and your exes after a while. 

I would honestly try to use the break up to grow up and have a healtier relationship next time. Ask yourself "what did i do right? What did i do wrong?" and start from there. Also use those past relationship to understand what kind of person you really want at your side so, in the future, if you find the right one you will know.

I’ve brought up the situation and I felt disrespected when he said “I’ve given you more money to your mom than you ever have.” He’s been living here for way over a year. When we first began dating he had an apartment and I would stay there every day until he didn’t have the apartment of Easter 2024. He also uses that against me. There was a point where there was a verbal agreement that he would pay rent if he lived at my moms. Then I found out he was texting an ex girlfriend so I kicked him out. Now he’s just all mad and angry all the time when I bring up he has to put some contribution if he’s sleeping here, doing laundry, showering, etc.. I don’t even know what to say anymore just seeking advice on what I can do??? I’m to a point where I’m mentally drained and can’t deal with his attitude or behavior. I feel like I’m being used and so is my mom saying it’s her house and she’s been bugging me about him paying rent.

================================================================================

QUESTION: F 29 Uninvited to my friend’s (F 28) is wedding. Has this happened to anyone before?

I (F 29) had been friends with this person (F 28) for a couple of years (~4-5 years) and we kept in touch regularly. There were a few years where I moved to another state but we still kept in touch and saw each other regularly. She had sent me a STD when I was still in another state and I was excited and texted her happily. I have since moved back and we hadn’t had the chance to hang out in person since I’ve been back, which has been ~2 months, but our schedules have just been a bit busy. 

Then she asked to do a phone chat since she wasn’t going to be free until the next few months cause of holiday travel. During this phone chat, we caught up and that was when she told me that they invited more people than expected and had to downsize the wedding guest list. I feel hurt by this as we have a lot of mutuals and they are still invited to the wedding. She told me it wasn’t me as a friend just that they need to downsize the wedding. 

I can’t help but feel hurt about this. I guess it was good she called and didn’t just ghost me but I still don’t feel happy. Maybe I misread the depth of our friendship. I did feel like me moving away for a few years kept some distance but I didn’t think we drifted that far apart. Is it weird for me to feel like I no longer want to invest in this friendship? If this did happen to you before, were you still friends with the person after? I am trying not to conjecture beyond what she told me but I still feel hurt.

ANSWER: Not weird at all. It's definitely risky when you have to disinvite someone from an event that you've previously extended an invite to. It can damage the relationship and make it hard to bounce back from. 

Now that being said, its really dependent on what you want to have happen here. 

I was disinvited from a friend from grad school's wedding after STDs went out. They had more family pressure to add cousins and what have you to the guest list and some people had to be cut. I was living abroad at the time so while it hurt, I did understand. 

We're still friends and she will admit that she shouldn't have caved to the pressure but things happen.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How to avoid misunderstandings causing conflicts? 42m with 37f

My gf and I have been in a relationship for about a year. We have often long lasting (often a whole day) arguments that were in hindsight caused by misunderstandings. How do you approach this to establish better communication? 

Example 1: invitation on a date night: we both have kids so date nights are precious. One time, we had plans to meet after work, have a drink and enjoy the city a bit. A few days before, I get an invitation to a friend's place. I tell them, it's my date night so I'll only come if we're both coming. So I tell her "if we want, we have an invitation on Friday". She gets super upset about how important the date night was for her, because she assumed, I agreed to the invitation already, forgetting about our date night. It took almost the whole day to resolve that which ultimately ruined the date night. 

Example 2: meeting others for the first time. It was a festival and we're going there together. I get a message from friends of my kids that they'll be there so it would be fun if the kids could meet. I tell my gf that we might see them there. She asks me if they know about her. I tell her I'm not sure but we're going there together so they'll meet her today. Again she gets upset because apparently I want to act single around them. I tried to tell her that I have maybe exchanged 2 sentences with them outside of coordinating meetings with the kids but I've never made a secret or of her. She has met all my close friends and family, so it's not like I'm keeping her secret.

It feels like in both cases I could've avoided it by starting the conversation with a kind of introduction. Like "I know we have a date night, and..." Or "I'd be really happy to introduce you to them because I don't think they know you yet...". I just know that I don't want to be too careful about how I phrase topics just to avoid a fight.

ANSWER: It seems like in both cases she wildly overreacted before asking any clarifying questions because she assumes the worse and creates situations in her head. Then stays mad about it for hours.

The purpose of dating is to see if it’s a good fit. People are typically on their best behavior early in a relationship meaning…this will probably get worse not better.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (F33) need advice on how to confront my family and especially my brother (M31) about still being friends with my abusive ex (M36).

I (F33) need advice on how to confront my family and especially my brother (Mark M31) about still being friends with my abusive ex (David M36).

 

TLDR: I dated an abusive ex from age 20-24. Back then my family adored him. Almost 10 years later, I’ve moved back near my family, and my brother is still friends with him. This is very difficult for me, and I want to talk to my family about it.

 

  
I dated David when I was 20-24. He wanted us to spend a lot of time with my family, and he was extremely pleasant, likeable, and hard-working around them. In reality, he had darker traits that he successfully hid from most people. He was a strange combination of independent and admirable strength and emotional fragility. The latter side was something he showed only to me. I felt special because he could open up to me and reveal his weaknesses.

So yes, this is when the relationship turns sinister, and I’m going to tell you a couple of examples of what it was like to be in a relationship with him.  
When we met, he told me that he was depressed because his sister had died, and that he was taking antidepressants and something else to help him fall asleep. He told me  that those medicines had a side effect of giving him seizure-like cramps during the brink of falling asleep. If those cramps progressed to his chest, they could cause his heart to stop. That’s when I became his “saviour.” My role was to watch him closely when he fell asleep and make sure he wouldn’t go into cardiac arrest. He did have those seizures he told me about. His legs and lower body would cramp and shake, and then he would eventually fall asleep.

I remember being so scared. I sat next to him in the darkness, looked at him, and repeated the names of those medicines in my head. I had my phone close by so that I could call the emergency number right away if needed. He didn’t want anyone else to know about this, because in his words he didn’t want others to pity him, so it was our secret.

That’s how our relationship started, and after some time it was revealed to me that his sister was actually alive, not dead. They just didn’t get along, and that was his excuse to say that she was dead. After four years of being together, David confessed to me that he had faked those cramps as well, and that he had completely made up those side effects.  
He was extremely jealous. He thought that I had cheated on him once because the sheets in our bed were messy. He constantly and secretly read all of my text messages. If I was seeing my friends, he would text and call me, and if I didn’t answer, he would find my friends’ phone numbers and call them. He got easily extremely angry, and that’s when I hid in the bathroom and cried. He’d scream like a wounded animal. His face would turn red and all the veins and tendons became visible in his neck. That’s something I still remember vividly. He would punch holes in the walls and break electronic devices, etc.

But during all of this, he was so sweet and polite to my family. My family was shocked when I eventually managed to leave David. I took my distance from my family as well and started a new life. During this time, David managed to wiggle his way into my brother’s life, and now Mark and David are good friends. It took me years to comprehend all of the abuse and the tactics he used, and during the breakup and right after it I didn’t know how to describe it. My family and brother know something about it, but not everything, and I think they have had a hard time trying to combine the things I have told about him to the person they knew or know today. Since David was and probably still is so talented at maintaining his carefully crafted image, I’ve been afraid to tell them more. I’m scared they won’t believe me.

Now I have moved back closer to my family, and I feel the trauma getting closer to me. I can’t stand to hear about my ex from my family, and I don’t want to see him in my brother’s social media. A couple of months ago I finally told Mark and my parents that I had a problem with it, but we haven’t talked about it afterwards.

I need help on how to talk about this with them. I want to be closer to my family, and I know that my brother is a good person, but I’m also afraid because my ex has had so many years to manipulate him as well.  
How do you bring these kinds of things up? How do you even start this kind of conversation without making the other person feel defensive?

ANSWER: It's really difficult to convey how deeply sinister and traumatic coercive control can be. I personally have chosen not to try to explain it because I believe it won't be understood and will just cause further issues for me. 


What do you actually want to achieve here? 


Can you rebuild relationships with your family but simply ask that they don't mention him, and warn you if he's coming to events? That way you don't have to hear about him and can not attend? 
For social media, can't you just block things yourself? 


Regarding the trauma resurfacing - that's something you should work on with therapy, EMDR, whatever other interventions you need to pursue.

My girlfriend recently told me she hasn’t been happy “for a while,” but she can’t fully explain why. I was in a car accident not long ago and developed PTSD, so I initially thought the stress around that was the main issue. She told me it’s not just that, it’s “a lot of things.”

For context:
We’ve been together for nearly 4 years and have a life and a flat together. I have abandonment fears, I can hit low moods, and I can be unintentionally passive-aggressive at times. I know these things have impacted the relationship, and I’m working on them. I’ve had an abusive childhood which she knows about so we are both very open about this stuff. I’ve been in therapy for a decade, but obviously these things do linger. She said she needs a few days of space so she can work and then “assess how she actually feels.” We had a few heated arguments the other day because I was really upset about how vague she was being. 

Right now we’re not talking. I don’t want to overwhelm her or chase, but I’m scared because this is the most meaningful relationship I’ve ever had, and I really think she will regret it quite quickly if she decides to throw it away. Genuinely, I know her. I want to handle this in a healthy way, not a panicked one.

What’s the best way to respect the space she asked for?
And how do I show up calm and steady when we talk again?

ANSWER: Go no contact for a few weeks and see if that helps her come back around. Generally though when a girl ask for space she is ready to walk away. It may already be too late. If she agrees to a few weeks break let her go stay somewhere and have a catch up date set to when you two will talk again. You need a few weeks no contact so you both have time to think things through.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My bf (23M) thinks I (22F) get hyperactive and he doesn't like it

After giving a 3 hours long final exam, I am usually very energetic and hyperactive bcz of all the rigorous answer writing. I am particular about my answers and my exams. He is not.

So he is like why do u get all hyperactive, calm down...not just this, other scenarios also
I usually get hyperactive, energetic very quickly and then start babbling. 
Then he points it out like this then I get weird out and I feel little disheartened bcz I was actually excited about that thing

He thinks I talk too loudly sometimes...he is fine with it, finds it cute 
But sometimes he just points it out in middle of my sentence and then I just feel like not talking that much 
He just points out that rest all people are quite....it's not like we are disturbing anyone.

Is being hyperactive, loud, energetic that bad?

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (30M) get over comments my partner (29F) made?

To start off I think I do need personal growth. My partner of 1.5 years seems to be shallow. She judges people based on their appearance and assumes they have shitty personalities solely because they're ugly. 

It's come up and here and there but most recently while discussing a particular film she was seething over how the female protagonist picked an ugly nerdy guy. We argued about this - I suggested that personality and non physical chemistry matters much more than appearance. She said my views were an exception and that any normal human being would have picked the conventionally handsome person over the ugly nerd because the main things that matter are looks (and to some extent money).

So I think a normal person might get over this and it's not really a deal breaker. But I've struggled with self image until college (but the scars of it are still here). I kind of always was the ugly kid and was extensively bullied by my peers/isolated because of it (even teachers made jokes about it). It's the most vulnerable part of me that's still here/something I try to protect.

Her comments completely destroyed my image of her because of that. I understand looks play a role but I wanted to believe that morals principles, having a good heart etc were far more valuable to her than appearance. It genuinely hurt and I'm usually the type to protect myself from being hurt. And self-reflecting I think there's also an insecurity part where I feel as though our emotional bond doesn't mean much to her and if my physical appearance isn't good enough in the future, she'd just leave.

So how do I get over this/bring this up to her? I've never opened up to anyone about my past so I can't blame her for not knowing how it impacted me.

ANSWER: This is how she feels, she cares more about looks than anything else. 

I would be wondering how much she would still love me when my looks have faded. Which could be because of aging but also because of sickness.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I 32f am slightly concerned my bf 29m is trying to control me

So ill try and explain as best i can with the most recent thing thats happening and then give further details of how he acts.

Yesterday and the day before my bf had expressed that he wanted me to vape outside and no longer in the flat, this is because he is due him putting it up for sale soon. first of all i did a couple of times but then was like ok well why cant i compromise and vape (like i always have) by the window and when i know we have viewings go outside that day/day before etc so atleast its meeting him halfway. I tried explaining this to him and he completely flew off the handle and said multiple things like no its not just selling, i dont like it at all, this is my flat not yours(i do pay bits towards living here with him) then said you're now crossing my boundary. When id replied to him that my concern was that he had not minded me vaping at all by the window (I've lived here about 7 months) and he basically just says its irrelevant what was the past etc, then kinda shouted are you gunna do it yes or no. I then also asked him when we ended up in our own house together what would he do. His reply was well i dont want you vaping at all in it but you probably will. So i just replied that we'd have to come up with a compromise. He just went silent after this. Then wandered off. Extra info: about a month ago he also kept commenting and saying i shouldn't vape, dont do it etc, so when i asked him what would he do if i wanted to carry on and not quit, hed replied that he would "make life harder for me". 

So now to give context of what other things he's said to me lately and I've just been trying to watch his actions/words. We had a discussion where id told him i wanted to spend more time with him as i dont zee him much(he is on his pc 90% of the time) and we pretty much see eachother for eating food and thats about it. I also expressed that i didn't like a comment hed made about my stomach as at the moment im self conscious and am trying to get myself a bit fitter again(for my own health) when this happened he flew off again saying that im trying to change his character and that he'll have to "force" interaction, he also said in that moment "do you have bipolar because im getting shitty shitty vibes because well from my ex" obviously by this point we were talking back and forth but i was purely trying to address my concerns. Eventually that argument stopped and he agreed to spend more time with me and to stop the rude comments etc. Fast forward to now, hes spent one evening with me which was for about 2ish hours maybe then he went straight to his pc again and has done that since the conversation last week with minimal interaction unless he wants sex. 

I also want to add that it feels like things have to be on his terms or he doesn't like it. Id expressed to him 2 days ago "could you change the duvet as i have done the other cleaning/tidying today" he then got funny about that and was like no cmon we'll do it together etc so i explained that id done a lot so was just asking if he could do that one thing. His response was "well yea but i work more than you" by this time i was doing it with him but pissed the fuck off because it was like he was throwing in my face i dont work as much. I have had issues the last 1-2 months with my job letting me down and did manage to get part time work for now(which he knows how hard its been)

Any bring us to last night, hed offered to make food again(we take it in turns) but ended up trying to wash up/then got half distracted by a wall at the same time. He went on to say well you could carry on with this, its your turn anyway (so he could do the wall) so i piped up "well you offered" and laughed, then he pretty much said i only offered because i thought you were upset (this is when id told him earlier that day my boss of the other job was letting me go) i dont think much was said in that moment, but i ended up having to "help" because he started washing up and asked me to stir etc so i ended up partially doing the food anyway. 

Thats the gist of whats happened recently, there is far more that is to do with something serious that happened 2/3 months ago but its sensitive so i wont mention that but yea wanted to give an insight of our general conversation and how he tries to twist things (hoping i got that across by the typing anyway) 
So i have been watching him lately and at some point i will have a very serious chat with him but just wanted some insight really and am slightly worried this could be control behaviour starting to creep in? im not sure

================================================================================

QUESTION: How To Support My 43M Partner 's 44F Mental State at Work?

TL;DR 
My partner is frustrated with her new job to the point it's affecting her mental state and I'm at a loss as to how to be more supportive.

My 43M partner 44F of 3 years recently started a new role at a new company about three weeks ago. Since commencing, she has felt out of her depth, useless, frustrated, and has become increasingly angry, both at herself and the situation she has found herself in.

Prior to this new role, she was employed in a contract role as, and before that, she had years of senior experience and success at other companies. All in all, she really is amazing at what she dies, but this new role has left her in despair as she's been thrown in the deep end very early on.

I won't say what industry or what she does as the city we live in is small (in her field, everyone knows everyone).

At the same time, her beloved cat of 18 years (strong innings) has become unwell and it's devastating both her and I. It seems she can't catch a break, and when things finally start to go well, something else happens that throws her right off course.

She is an amazingly resilient woman, strong and ridiculously intelligent, but I feel that lately her mental health is suffering and she's at breaking point.

I'm doing all I can right now to support her. Picking her up from work, checking in on her cat during the day, helping her clean her place and generally stay on top of things. In addition to that, I always make myself available every lunch time when she calls me to vent about the latest issue at work and about how she's feeling.

Today she messaged me to tell me that she's over life right now. Something I've never heard from her before.

My question is, what else can I do to support her best? How can I help her through this rough period? She has acknowledged that therapy is on the radar, as she was seeing one previously, as do I. 

What can I do to bring her back from the brink?

ANSWER: You're already doing all you can. I've had a very similar work experience as your partner, and can wholeheartedly say: when she is ready to move on to another role, she will. Sometimes, it takes some time to "click" until you are ready. In the meantime, try to be there for her to the best of your abilities and capabilities. Sounds like right now is a very trying time for her (and you, by extension). Wishing you all the best!

================================================================================

QUESTION: Any advice for me 29F to help with my crush 32M?

I have a massive crush on my (single!!) neighbor. I have tried in the past to bump into him many times but we always seem to miss each other. We have had a few brief chats. I see him on the apps and I know he must see me too.

The problem is its been so long since I have talked to him that I get so overwhelmed when I see him.... my brain freezes and I cannot think of anything to say. I run to my car incase I bump into him in the morning. I know he is a bit shy as well but it has made me become shy too.

I do not know how to get over this. We always wave in passing but I would very much like to talk to him like a normal human being!! Any advice?

ANSWER: Girl don't overthink it too much. Although I am not sure whether getting involved with your neighbour is necessarily the best idea (because if things go wrong, you have to see each other regularly), it won't hurt to engage him in more conversations step by step. Try to feel out whether he might be into you as well.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My GF(F18) just broke up with me (M18) and immediately changed her mind. How can I move forward?

We’ve been dating for about 2.5 years now and had our ups and downs, but this is the worst one yet. Long story short we haven’t been able to hang out much recently due to college, and for the past four weeks she doesn’t know if she’s losing feelings or feeling something else. They’ve been taking a massive toll her on emotionally and I don’t think I’ve ever seen her so distraught.

We had this long discussion (video call) about what to do, culminating in her saying we have to break up. Upon seeing how sad it made me, she immediately changed up and said we should stay together and see if hanging out with me more would help. She said she wants a few minutes to think and she’d call me back. Currently it’s been an hour and I haven’t heard from her. 

I feel massive tonal whiplash and I’m not sure how I can carry this relationship on after tonight. I’ll constantly be worried about this just happening again and that wouldn’t be good for my mental health either. I don’t know if she’s staying out of guilt or because she really cares for me still.

TLDR: Girlfriend broke up with me and changed her mind after a month of feeling like she’s losing feelings. She wants to carry on like nothing happened.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (20F) boyfriend (20M) doesn’t “know” how to do boyfriend things. How do I approach?

To keep it short, he just doesn‘t do boyfriend things, that being plan dates, buy flowers, pay for stuff. 

It’s not that he should be doing these things constantly, i feel like I’m more than understanding with the fact that we’re both hardworking college students. For that reason I try to be clear about what I want and meet him in the middle, like always sharing date ideas and sometimes planning them to where all he has to do is agree to plans (”Do you wanna get takeout and watch a movie at my house, on this day?”, “I’ve been wanting to watch this movie in theaters, these are the showtime, which ones work for you?”) To these, they always “sound good” but never come to fruition and he sure as hell hasn’t brought any ideas to the table either. 

he has ”planned” dates for the kinds of occasions that you HAVE to like birthdays and valentines, but I’m never happy with them because he makes them feel like obligatory and never romantic, always a walk-in to a local restaurant I would usually only get takeout from. And for “flowers” which we’ve talked about he brought me one of those single bunches of 4 flowers with the $4 tag on it instead of a bouquet. Can these things be taught? I truly believe he cares because he goes above and beyond in every other aspect of our relationship but this is getting to the point I feel like I need to call it quits out of self respect. 

How can I teach him to do better in these areas, if it’s even something I should do in the first place? I don’t want to come off vapid and I dont think I am bc his behavior is egregious at this point lol, but I want to communicate and get to a better place as effectively as possible. My birthday/V-day are coming up in the next 4 months, would a conversation about stepping it up work?

ANSWER: >I truly believe he cares because he goes above and beyond in every other aspect of our relationship

Like what?

I think early on, people put their best foot forward. Lots of couples notice that romance dies off once things cool down and months turn into years and decades together. You are STARTING pretty much at zero.

Can these things be taught? Sure! But how long do you think you'll give it before calling it done?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend got really weird about his phone. F18 M21

I (18f) was laying in bed with my boyfriend (21m) and scrolling on tiktok. I came across one that was talking about how men view women and a tiktok comment said to always go through your boyfriends comments or whatever. I thought she was being overdramatic, genuinely. I asked to see his phone and he gave it to me (we’re very open with our phones usually and this has never happened before). I followed the instructions the girl gave me to see his comments on Tik Tok and said “oh hey I can see your Tik Tok comments haha” and he immediately tried to grab his phone back. I asked why I couldn’t look at them and he said because they’re cringe, so I offered to let him look through mine and he flat out refused. 
We then wrestled for maybe 10 minutes of him trying to get his phone back, he physically hurt me multiple times and I had to ask him to stop sometimes. All that just to get his phone back. He eventually got it and I asked why I couldn’t see, he said the same thing again; what if it was cringe. I called him out and told him he was lying and that he wouldn’t care about something like that and he just ignored me. I kept repeating why to him and he kept ignoring me and my voice started breaking and I was obviously crying. Not ONCE did his eyes leave his phone. I eventually grabbed my phone, got dressed, left my room and got in my car and drove to a random parking lot. I was crying as soon as my car left my driveway all the way here, almost having a panic attack. It’s 2am, he hasn’t even messaged me. I saw a few comments before he tried to take his phone out of my hands of him calling someone beautiful so I already got the jist. 
I started my period today and it really could just be hormones messing with me. Please tell me if I am insane. This is my first serious relationship and I’m unsure what to do. Am I insane?

ANSWER: This is a red flag moment. He's showing you who he is. He physically hurt you to hide from you things he'd written to other women. Him hurting you is the concerning part.

If you don't show him that you will not tolerate that kind of behaviour, then he will just do it again and the assaults will escalate. I get that this is your first relationship, so you are probably incredibly conflicted, but in 10 years' time, this is the moment when you look back and think, 'I wish I had made the decision to leave him, right there in the parking lot'.

There are 2 roads out of that parking lot. One leads back to him and possibly years of drama and abuse. The other road leads to something better, something more emotionally mature because you cared enough about yourself to leave and not tolerate this toxic behaviour.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 26M, 26F. Been with my husband almost 10 years, and I think I want a divorce?

Husband and I have been together almost 10 years and I think I want a divorce. I am unhappy in our relationship, and it’s gotten to the point where EVERYTHING he does annoys me, or pisses me off. I can’t stand his touch anymore. He tries to kiss and love on my and I just feel like screaming to leave me the hell alone. I’m constantly trying to find ways to put some space between us without hurting him, bc he’s a genuinely good guy. But I don’t think he’s the guy for me anymore. And it’s hard, we’ve been together since we were teenagers and we’ve grown so much… but I feel like I’ve grown apart from him.

He was what I needed when we were younger, but honestly, he’s not enough anymore. And I don’t know how to go about this. We have a trip coming up, and then it’s the holidays, and I don’t want to ruin those things for him. But I’m not sure how much longer I can stick this out. 

Advice???

ANSWER: Get a divorce. You don't have to stay in a miserable relationship. You got together at 16. You were still children with no real idea who you were or what you wanted out of life. You've grown apart. Don't stay together because of Sunk Cost Fallacy. it's called FALLACY for a reason. This relationship has run its course. Time to walk away. 

Stop "waiting for the right time". There isn't one. Walk away now. Let him spend the holidays with his family ALONE. It will help him start healing. Stop stalling.

QUESTION: Not sure if i [21f] should ask him [24m] if hes going to ditch me after sex

Been talking to the guy for a bit now he’s the first guy I’ve ever been with romantically (been with all girls my whole life) we’ve done basically everything except sex. i know he wants to he makes it quite vocal, we even tried but I’m a very nervous person naturally so that mixed with the fact I’ve never done it before and he’s pretty big down there he couldn’t really get it in plus it hurt 

I want to ask if he’s going to stop talking to me after this? i don’t know his intentions really, i want to trust him but i cant and i don’t want to lose this relationship. i also don’t want my first time to be with someone who just used me so they can brag that they took some girls virginity. I’m usually vocal about things that bother me but my friends always say i shouldn’t say certain things and to stop being so transparent with him.

now that i think about it i have mentioned it once very briefly but not in a serious way and he just said he would never. i can tell he’s getting impatient and i am pretty sure I’m ready i just don’t want it to ruin things.

If anyone has any advice please give as im thinking of doing it when he gets up and hes asleep under me right now

ANSWER: Honestly if you’re making a post like this I don’t think you are ready. And there is nothing wrong with that. It sounds like you have a lot of insecurity around abandonment, that you may need to work through before you’re ready or some part of you feels unsafe around him. Either way do it when that voice is silent and you feel safe.

QUESTION: I’ve been in a relationship for 6 years 46 M and 40 F.  If your partner was paying an all-expense international trip, business class on a long 10+ hour flight, and you have not flown that long, what would you do?

I have been in a relationship for 6 years.  I can count on my hand (5 times lol) the amount of times I’ve asked my partner to show up for me. They were things I may find easy for me to do but much more to ask from my partner.  Every time I have asked, it became a huge fight or stressful that something may happen to ruin the excitement that came with whatever I asked.  I was being honored for something and he came to the event visibly showing he did not want to be there.  I am asking him to come with me on a trip that is a big milestone for my family.  We love to travel and I personally am making this more about vacation than the milestone.  I rented a huge beautiful airbnb with good plumbing since we would be at the countryside.  I could’ve stayed with family but I wanted to make it special for him and his first time.  He had told me he was going to go.  

Granted he is not one to celebrate even his own family and friends’ milestones regularly.  I have offered to pay everything because it is my family and my ask.  Now, he is saying he can’t go and that he’s working.  This is not the first time I have been disappointed or let down.  And it may just be me overreacting but I think I am at a point where I am just tired and realizing this just might be the reality.  I wonder if I am asking for too much, do I let this go and of course go by myself, or do I let him go and be on my own?  Thanks for your help.

ANSWER: Does he even like you? Being single would be better than this, right? What are you asking?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (F20) best friend hates every guy I (F18) date, how do I approach her with this?

Okay, so for some context. I've known A since I started high school, her sister and I became fast friends. And she's been with me through some rough stuff, and I know it's only been a few years, but she's definitely one of my closest friends. Through her and her sister P(F19),  I met B (F18), this will come in handy for later. 

So, starting all the way back in sophomore year, I got into my first little summer fling with a guy. P, would cheer me on, and for some reason A couldn't stand it. At first, I thought maybe she was jealous. This was exciting for us, as we did not get play. As high school summer flings go, it ends, and she almost seemed relieved. 

Going into the next year, I meet another guy. This guy and I got a little more involved than old Sophomore. But, at last, did end, this time around her patience was more noticeable. I thought all of the drama with the first guy was done and gone, and that it was a one time thing...

Well, this guy I've had a thing for, and I, recently started going out. And compared to my track record, he's been a proper gentleman. I know I'm young, but this one is actually treating me right. We've gone out a few times, and recently made it official. But after my first date, I couldn't help but notice how annoyed and pissed A was about it. Every one else was so happy for me, except for A. I brushed it off, figured it was nothing, until B called me. 

B, is so excited for me, and currently is the only one who knows about me and my guy. But, she was telling me, that when me and him first went on that first date... A called her, and told her about how she has a bad feeling about him, and how she's had a bad feeling for the last few guys as well. A bad feeling she could have told me about, as the last two guys were bad news. Sure, I'll give that to her. 

But, I've known this guy for a pretty long time, and have been friends with him for a bit now. She told B all about how he just got out of a relationship and this and that... For some context, both me and him both went on a failed date (with others) this summer. Hearing this, I was pretty upset, and B said she just wanted to let me know. Because A was trying to keep it between the two of them. But when you are friends with sisters, you quickly can become the outside. Meaning this would have sat behind my back from all of them, if B didn't tell me anything.

I want to tell my best friend, but at the same time, I don't think she'll be happy for me. I ended up speaking with P just to see if maybe she had heard anything about this. P talked with A, and A's best response was about some rumor I heard when I first met him. This rumor wasn't true, and I wouldn't go off and date him if it was. I feel like this was a bs attempt at grasping straws, P agreed with me. 

I guess I just want some advice on how to handle it for the future. Am I being dumb for even getting upset? I just wish that if she had concerns, she'd go to me, and not behind my back like we're in grade school. Do I even bring this up to her? I can't fathom a way that wouldn't upset her, that's not what I want. But I also don't want a future where she's pissed at my wedding for no reason.

ANSWER: Does she date guys? It does sound a bit like she wants you for herself.  If she had a bad feeling about one particular guy that would be one thing - but it sounds like she doesn't want you dating anyone at all.

================================================================================

QUESTION: What’s an effective way to talk to my boyfriend [21M] about his “When I say 'Jump' you ask 'How high?'” mindset? [24F]

this link contains two screenshots of the conversation we were having about our boundaries. Included is what he said in my response.
https://imgur.com/a/PDlX0Dk

TL;DR For context at the end there, he broke up with me a couple months ago, we were separated for about a month and we've been together for a year outside of that. There's a backstory, so buckle up. My best friend had asked me for a favor because she believed that her situationship was potentially hiding a girlfriend and this would obviously pose a moral issue. She asked me to message the girl on a burner account because she was nervous and I agreed as long as she would tell me what to say (obviously I gave my input as well). She didn't want to do it from her personal account because if her theory was false, she would blow her spot as it would probably get back to him. We messaged the girl, it was a pretty smooth conversation until the very end when she became hostile after she told us she wasn't the girlfriend, we trolled her a bit because she was being ridiculous and then left the conversation at that. Yes, i'm aware this is childish, I thought it was for a good reason. Fast forward to a month or two later my boyfriend asks me to watch a video he sent to my spam account so as I'm switching my profiles, he sees the burner and he gets noticeably uncomfortable. The first thing he does is go into the DM's and I immediately explained the situation. I showed him the text messages with my best friend to prove it because he didn't believe me. He proceeds to get very mad at me, asking me why my best friend couldn't do it herself, asking me why I am inserting myself in other people's drama, why I didn't tell him and what have you. I obviously get defensive because I don't really see the issue, I didn't put my relationship at risk in any way - nothing came of the situation and my best friend got her peace of mind. He ultimately ends up telling me to leave his house after us bickering for like 10 minutes and I told him how immature he was acting because the situation was literally irrelevant and I left. The next day, he breaks up with me because this was just a nonegotiable for him, i triggered some trauma he has and he felt like I was being sneaky. I really don't know if we're compatible at this point, I think he's becoming too controlling and possessive to the point where he doesn't even see me as a person with autonomy. Is there anything that could help him understand that his perception and outlook on relationships is very toxic and unsustainable?

ANSWER: 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
I think he’s made it very clear where he stands and it doesn’t seem like you’re interested in that dynamic(probably because it’s super gross and misogynistic). I’d communicate it something like “it was a mistake to ever get back together and we’re over for good now.”

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (18F) am extremely sensitive. My boyfriend (18M) knows this and still makes me cry. Help?

I take things very personal from my boyfriend. I am embarrassed to admit but my self-confidence and validation comes from his perspective. He thinks I look great in a hairstyle? I’ll wear out for an entire year. He thinks my music taste is great? I’ll milk that playlist for years!
It’s really bad, it’s horrible, I know.
Lately every single one of his words have really made me feel a tingle in my heart that hurts. If he tells me to shut up playfully? The stick is up my ass.  I can’t seem to make him believe me either! He thinks I am constantly hurt or on the verge of crying. He JOKINGLY calls me manipulative or annoying and London bridge falls all the way down. I talked to him once about how I never know if his words have a double meaning or not or if he is ruminating. (Not directly asked if he’s ruminating but I politely asked if he could communicate his needs because I don’t know them for godsakes!)

Am I too sensitive or something? How can I stop it? I’m crying right now!

Also, before you immediately jump on him. He’s a great boyfriend, we’ve been friends for years but he’s just so avoidant and doesn’t know how to describe his feelings while I feel big! I love him so much and I don’t want to break up with him, I want to make it better!

ANSWER: Honestly and I say this from a place of love, but this is a you problem and not a him problem. You need help learning how to emotionally regulate, professional help. Small joking comments should not be causing this strong of a reaction in a secure relationship. It's not feasible for you to continue thru life like this- you are very young and have a bright future ahead of you that should be based around YOURSELF and what you want, not what comments your partner is making about you. Therapy is the way forward- best of luck 💕

QUESTION: I (26M) don't like to share my bed with my girlfriend (27F)

 my current girlfriend has been around for about 7 months, she is always asking to spend the night with me but I always send her home. The honest to God reason is, I just don't want to share my bed. I like to roll around and adjust the blankets and get up at 2am and cough and fart and not worry about somebody else being involved. Cuddling is only enjoyable for around 30 minutes before my body begins to experience progressive pain. I have several permanent injuries which cause parts of my body to go numb very quickly, any party who would like to join me for a nap will not enjoy themselves as I wake up and make major adjustments every hour. All of this is to say my girlfriend is growing progressively displeased with my refusal. How can I explain to her/convince her of my true reasoning?

ANSWER: People in this subreddit are truly spectacular. Mud you legit told us what is wrong and why its bothering you. Get off reddit and just tell her what you told us, if she doesn’t understand you have chronic pain then she needs to move her ass on. You also need to realize this might be something she wants in a relationship ship. Communicate doofus talk to your girl not us people on reddit

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (18F) and I (18M) boyfriend are debating when to move in together?

I (18F) and my boyfriend (18M) have been together for 1.7 years and have talked about moving in together for a few months. We are freshman in college and have discussed moving in together about 85% of the time sophomore year since I will be an RA, and he will have an apartment (I won’t be on call everyday max 1-3 throughout the week). So I’ll pretty much be over there all the time anyway, and I would feel bad not contributing or paying rent (Of course I would pay rent and do chores).

On week days we spend about 3.5-4 hours a day talking and spending time with each other, and weekends we spend completely together. I help him with medical stuff and we also cook, and do some chores together.

When we move in together we will be 19 years old, but we feel that the age itself is way too young and unserious. It’s weighing on our minds. We have discussed finances, responsibilities, and odd quirks (which we do in front of each other anyway), but feel off put because we feel like those red necks who move too quickly and have children and get married straight out of Highschool (We know a few). 
We know it varies between couple, but would like some advice on everyone’s experience with this. Thank you.

ANSWER: Honestly living separately is really underrated. Having your own space to return to when you want it is amazing, even if you spend most of the time with your partner. And it keeps things fun because you still get space to miss them. That’s not to say that moving in together isn’t also lovely, but considering that you’re 18 I do think it would be smart to wait one more year

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (22M) gf (20F) goes hysterical over me not wanting phone calls and its freaking me out. What am I supposed to do?

I've been on a relationtip with my gf for 2 and a half years now. We have been through a lot over these years.

She constantly deals with adhd and depression caused by not getting along with her classmates at uni, despite this rough circunstances I love this girl so much, she is just so nice to me and love going on dates with her, it hurted me so much watching her struggling with depression, luckily she's been doing better this last months or at least that's what i thought.

Lately she's been asking to have phone calls just to chat, (just for you to know we, only see eachother on weekends bc we both deal with uni, the rest of the week we only do messages) the thing is I don't really like casual phone calls so I just told her I didn't wanted to, she just got so mad and depressed the whole week.

Anyway that week sucked so I just gave these phonecalls a chance while I was bussy doing a uni project, due to being bussy I couldn't give the phone call enough attention and that week just went even worse.
I gave it one more shot, but actually saved some time of my day just for the phone call which lasted around an hour or so. Ngl it was kinda tiresome for me, but at least she was happy. I thought that she would be satisfied now but no, she only asked for more phone calls, I didn't have enough time for more phone calls and talked about that with her (by chat). 
She got mad at me and instantly ruined her whole week, this happened a lot, every single time when this happened I just begged her to get in a better mood, but this time, I was tired of this so I just told her that despite how much I loved her, I really hated this phone calls. And oh boy.

She went nuts over this, told me about how much this hurted her emotionally and that she was feeling lonely. I insisted that phone calls are just not for me and instantly sent a bunch of messages telling me that she was going to hurt herself.

This wasn't the first time she did that to me tho, when her depression was way more severe she hitted me up with selfharming messages, naturally at that time I panicked and called her parents to be with her. But this time, it just felt like bullshit, idk why she reacted like that, but that really freaked me out and not way she intended to, I'm having my doubts about this relatioship now, but I'm not really sure if I help her in some way. wtf

ANSWER: I’m a phone call person. I almost never text anyone for more than 2-3 messages and the only one that gets more is my fiancé when he’s at work. Everyone knows to call me if they want to talk because I don’t text. 
They also know I call once a week to catch up and put 30-60 min aside so we can. It’s not that hard to set aside 20min once a day or 30-40 a few times a week for a significant other. 

But this doesn’t seem to be a phone call vs text problem. It’s a, she’s threatening to hurt herself and blaming you for it, problem. 
That’s a totally different can of worms. 

There isn’t much you can do besides excuse yourself from the toxicity and block her. 
She wants your attention. All of it. You don’t want to/can’t give it. Let it go. 

Tell her you’re sorry she’s feeling this way but you have other priorities right now and she’s putting you under too much pressure. Break it off and block her. 
If you feel like she’ll actually go through with anything after the conversation reach out to her parents and let them know you really care about her but she’s spiraling and it’s too much. They’ll take care of it. 
She sounds too unstable and you’re too young to take on that amount of crazy

================================================================================

QUESTION: Need advice on this pressing relational issue; 22/M, 22/F

I really love my boyfriend, and he genuinely treats me so well. I've been with him through many of his ups-and-downs, and he makes it clear that he appreciates me for that. We've been broken up once before as he was struggling mentally and didn't want to "drag" me down. After months of separation, he did come back to me and we got back together. During the separation, I also worked on myself because I had my shares of flaws in the relationship as well. Coming back together after months apart was difficult at first, but I would definitely say we both matured so much, he got more emotionally healthy, and we are happy together. 

There's real growth, but also recurring challenges. He still struggles with emotional baggages and mental health stuff that started to emerge. Whenever he's down or tired, he would pull away, be "colder" (ex. less "i love you" or less enthusiasm) and sometimes we would argue since he would bring up things that bothered him, then in retrospect, he would apologize that he was having a hard day. 

I want to be a supportive partner for him because I know in relationships and with people you love you should be there when they're going through hard times. But the emotional inconsistencies are creating unintentional rollercoasters. It's getting harder for me, and I am hurting... I genuinely don't know what to do because I don't want to seem like I'm leaving him when he's struggling - that's not how I love or who I am. I want to be there for him, but it's coming out of the expense of myself to ride through the rollercoasters.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (21F) do not feel comfortable with my boyfriend (20M)'s female friend, I don't know what to do?

hi everyone. My boyfriend and I have been dating for over 1.5 year, we broke up for a month and then got back together. He has quite a few female friends, and I like most of them except for one in particular. They met at the beginning of university and were part of a friend group together, eventually the group drifted apart and it would be more hangouts just the two of them.

I have met her a couple times and instantly didn't get good vibes from her. To me she didn't feel like a girl's girl and particularly respected our relationship. I have heard stories from my boyfriend that one time when they went clubbing together, she had left her very drunk friend at the club by herself despite promising to go home together and went off to hook up with a guy. My boyfriend had to handle the mess and send the girl home and he too was very frustrated. We had gone on a trip together where the entire time she was acting very strange, ie constantly on the phone with her other friend, random mental breakdowns and etc. It honestly ruined a lot of the trip that I planned for both my boyfriend and I. During this trip, there was a particular instance where she got mad at a joke my boyfriend made and hit him hard and was even trying to get me on her side?? It was just really odd, I didn't appreciate the tone she had which sounded she was trying to be playful flirty. After this trip, they fell out of touch for a while and didn't talk at all. Later though, apparently she apologized to my boyfriend and they became good friends again. This is when we were broken up for a bit and apparently she had a part in convincing my boyfriend to get back together with me. Anyways, everything has been great since we gotten back together. We were on facetime when my bf received a call from her, she was whining to him about school work and her tone was giving very much "i am complaining to my boyfriend" rather than I am venting to a friend. I cannot describe it exactly outside of the fact it was hard to listen to for me.

That was kind of my last straw, I realized I really heavily had an issue with this friendship. I doubted whether I am being too jealous but I don't feel this way about any of his other female friends. I told him about it and he says he doesn't see the issue because this is how she talks to everybody. Anyways we tried to have a conversation about the issue today.. he said it seems like the issue could only be solved by them stop being friends. I said, I don't really want to tell him what to do because that feels controlling and that I just wanted to express my feelings. He says this puts him in an unfair position because I am asking him to stop being friends with her without really admitting to asking for that. We had this exchange quite a few times until I finally said, yeah I guess I don't want you to be friends with her. I understand that saying that cannot end well (either he says yes but potentially resents me or he says no and I feel heartbroken he cannot understand my feelings) but it has already beens aid and he says he needs to think about it and the conversation didn't end well. I dont know what to do now.

ANSWER: sometimes, sadly, shitty friends can be a deal breaker. I think you’re valid for not liking her, I also think he’s valid for not wanting to cut her off (assuming he genuinely is not interested in her.) It’s good that you were honest about your feelings

================================================================================

QUESTION: I Lied to My Crush(F22) About My Feelings to Protect Her (and Myself M22) Did I Do the Right Thing?

I (M22) am part of a friend group of four at work. We’re close more than just colleagues. I’ve developed a massive crush on one of my friends (F22). She’s genuinely sweet, funny, and incredibly mature. Initially, it was just a nice feeling. I’d look forward to her texts every day and getting to see her at work made my day. But lately, I’ve become too attracted to her, and that's when things got complicated.

I started getting intensely jealous. She'd often interact playfully with our other friend in the group, M22, and I'd find myself thinking, "Why him and not me?" especially since she and I were friends long before he joined our circle.
It wasn't a problem before, but now, seeing them together felt like a punch to the gut. I was dying inside every time.

The tension got so high that I almost confessed my feelings. I started to tell her something, but stopped midway. For a few days, she kept asking what I was trying to say. Eventually, she even seemed to figure out that I was trying to admit my "love" (I don't know if I can use that word, but it was strong feelings) for her.
I kept dodging her because on that exact same day, she had been ranting about another guy a friend outside our group who had admitted to being sexually attracted to her in the most vulgar way possible. I panicked. As a man who respects her, I absolutely did not want to be even slightly compared to that creep. So, I didn't confess.

A few days later, while talking to him (the guy I was jealous of), he dropped an absolute bomb. He told me that she had admitted to him that she has a massive crush on him.
Suddenly, it all clicked into place. She wasn't just being playful with him, she was expressing her feelings. This is where my internal conflict peaked.

On one hand, I hate the feeling that she likes him, but on the other, I genuinely want her to be happy. I know she wouldn't be if she found out I was trying to confess, and he is a great guy objectively a perfect match for her. Though he admitted to me that he actually has a crush on the other girl (F22) in our group.

The very next day, I had to fix the situation to ensure I didn't lose her friendship. I made up a story, twisting a very small complaint I had into the "thing I was trying to tell her before." It was a complete lie.

To sell it better, I kinda guilted her into believing that I would never fall for a friend and that I consider such a move to be "misusing the space she provided" in our friendship. I made her believe that it hurt me so much she even thought I was capable of that (which is exactly what I was doing 😭).
It worked. She believes me now, and our friendship is safe, but I don't know if I did the right thing by hiding my feelings and lying.

I chose to lie because every time I've tried to be completely truthful (I imagine myself as Captain America or someone), it hasn't ended well. This time, I just couldn't risk losing her friendship.

Did I do the right thing to protect the group and our friendship, even if it meant lying about my genuine feelings?

ANSWER: Yeah, honestly, when you’re into somebody, their friendship is just a sad consolation prize. 

You should really be honest, and you still have an opportunity. Worst that happens if she turns you down and then you can choose to still be friends. Also, you can tell her about your feelings respectfully. If she has a problem with that, then she’s just a jerk.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (24M) is confusing me (23F) after 5 years together. Needing advice or insight on similar experiences?

For context, my bf (24M) and I (23F) went to highschool together. By no means did we run in the same circles, but our final year we got together. Our first 3 years were great, we went through a lot of hard times together and prevailed. All of the sudden around 4 years his personality changed. He lost his drive and overall happiness for life. He use to be very funny, outgoing, and social. It all changed. Now I had to move cities for a job and he is super sad and does nothing. He sometimes going to the gym, sometimes played basketball with his friends ~2 per month. I feel like his only source of happiness/ planning activities with friends  is me. Meanwhile I have made new friends, played in new adult lacrosse teams, been promoted etc. I get he’s having a hard time and hasn’t moved out of his childhood home, but I don’t see much of a growth mindset. I do feel like he loves and cares for me, he just doesn’t care for himself and it’s making me question if we should be together. I need someone who will push me to be a better person. Seeking advice? I don’t know if I want to break up but also don’t want to date someone who is having a fixed mindset. Also, I don’t really look forward to having intercourse with him. He tries but I just don’t know if he truly has what satisfies me.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I’m a 26F and my boyfriend’s 22M parents didn’t let him go with me to the beach just the two of us, how do I handle this?

I met him a year ago at college, we both are from different cities but we were studying in the same, we started our relationship 6 months ago and we graduated this summer. 

But after graduation each of us returned to our respective cities and started a long distance relationship. That’s not the case and that is not that bad.

This weekend is my birthday and he’s coming to see me, last weekend I was in his city and we planned to go to the beach to celebrate. 

But his parents said no, not to come to my city but to go just the two of us alone there. 

My boyfriend doesn’t have a job yet, obviously he is still living with his parents and they said that our relationship is still young, but is too risky for us to go alone and that we can do it later, but for now is not wise. 

And I kind of understand it but I just can accept it and get over with. 

I mean, he’s very transparent and obedient and I would never tell him to lie or hide, or whatever, we already cancelled the trip and our reservations but, is this going to be like this forever?

ANSWER: In my opinion: 

He needs to stand up to his parents and or you need to leave. This is fucking ridiculous.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Wondering if my boyfriend (M36) and I (F27) are the right fit..

As the title says…. I feel like I am in a very complicated predicament. I love my boyfriend with everything in me, more than I thought I could ever love anyone. And, honestly, he loves me even more. Sometimes to the point that I feel guilty that I’m not able to profess my love for him the same way he does me. 

Anyway, while we match on all fronts, same humor, same interests, same values, great sex, great communication. I feel like he sometimes doesn’t realize that I carry much of the emotional weight of our relationship. Yes, I have communicated this. He feels terrible but doesn’t really “change”. If he has a bad day, he’ll call and ramble on and on and on about it. I support him. Offer advice. It feels like he’s not even listening to that or acknowledging my support. Just talking to talk. So allow him to ramble and just get it out. Then he says “you’re getting quiet, am I annoying you?” I say no, I don’t feel there’s much to say because it’s not changing how you feel. He understands. Proceeds to ask how my day was. How am I supposed to go on about how great my day was after that? I can’t even think about what happened in my day at that point, let alone having the feeling that if I talk about sunshine and rainbows, I’m making his situation worse?

Then, if I have a bad day it is completely glazed over, he says “I totally get it because in my life xyz…”. Always feels like he’s sort of one-upping my problems with his own. Sometimes I just want him to hear and see me. When I can’t snap out of my negative feelings, he automatically assumes I’m upset with him. I feel like I can’t ever have a bad day or negative attitude without our entire days being tainted. However, I’ll support and turn around his bad day into something enjoyable for the both of us.
 
Now I’m rambling….

Not really, completelysure what I’m trying to get at here. Just feel like these situation really weigh on me. He’s going through a really tough time right now, which is fine, I’m there through it all and there are times he expresses his gratitude. But, I feel I’m being sucked dry. I know that when he is through this rough patch, this will all go away, but it is hard right now. 

I love him a lot. I want to marry him. I just want to know if you all think this is as deep of an issue as I do? Would it be a deal breaker for you? I don’t want to leave him, but I’d like some guidance on how ti maybe gran a new conversation around this? I don’t feel that I’ve clearly articulated the way these situations make me feel. I know it is not intentional on his part. Really, any and all advice is appreciated. Hurt my feelings, just want to truthfully know what outsiders think!

ANSWER: It’s not a deal breaker. Men communicate differently than women. 
They want to fix or relate to something they’re feeling. We just want to vent. 

When I start venting and I’ve been going on for a while he’ll ask, are you at the I need to keep talking about it stage or the I want input on the solution phase of the problem. 

Just tell him that. You’re at the frustrated venting stage and just need him to hang in there and listen. I bet he will. 
When you’re done venting tell him thank you for listening and move on. 
Or tell him you’re done venting and still feel shitty. 
 
He’ll likely tell you he loves and will try to lighten the mood. You’ll have to put in a little effort to bring yourself out of the funk but if he’s as great as your making him out to be, a couple of jokes that you make yourself laugh at will bring you out of it. 

If he wants to empathize because he’s been in a similar situation it’s most likely him trying to provide you a solution. 

You can’t let your bad day drag down your relationship. 

You can also just tell him, hey, sometimes I’m having a rough day and know you’re going through some shit but I am too and I need your support too. I’m here for you and just like when you’re feeling bad, my mood isn’t about you and I need some grace to deal with things in my own way.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 21M Sri Lankan Tamil & 27F Tamil in Europe — need advice on managing long-distance and planning a future while I’m still studying

Hi everyone,
I’m a 21M from Jaffna, currently studying for university in Sri Lanka. For the past 8 months, I’ve been in a long-distance relationship with a 27F who is also originally Jaffna Tamil but now lives in Europe as a citizen.

I’m trying to understand how to plan this relationship realistically while considering our different life stages, physical distance, and my current commitment to university.

I’m not asking for moral judgment. I’m looking for practical, specific advice from people who have handled similar long-distance or cross-country situations.

Here are the specific things I need help with:

1. For those who were still in school or university during a long-distance relationship,
how did you balance your studies with maintaining the relationship?


2. If one partner lives abroad and the other is still building their career,
what steps did you take early to prepare for future relocation (skills, money, documents, career path)?


3. For couples with an age difference where one partner is further ahead in life,
how did you manage expectations and timelines so both partners stay aligned?


4. When you eventually told your families about your long-distance partner,
what communication approach helped them understand the seriousness of the relationship without causing panic?


5. For people who planned to move abroad for a relationship,
what challenges came up, and what would you recommend preparing for in advance?



I want to build a realistic plan, not rush anything, and would appreciate experiences from others who have successfully handled similar cross-country relationships.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I’m M21 and she’s F21. Got out of this really toxic rlsp but she doesn’t accept her mistake and pls help me if I made a mistake

So we’ve been in this on and off thing since April and it’s been really draining. She used to breakup with me after 4-7 days of being together and then we used to get back into a situationship and this kept going on for the longest time and everyone she blamed me or some stupid reason “I saw a dream u did something really bad”
I’ve been nothing but nice to her especially when she was bitchy and she said this herself her exact words. Recently we got out of a relationship again and she started saying she’s lost feelings and she’s done this before and then spirals back everytime and says she’s never lost feelings and that she’d always love me. Even rn she was doing the same and said “if I was to date anyone it’d be u” and I even asked her if she lost feelings and she said I don’t like u I love you. I saw her hanging with this other guy a lot recently who she claimed to be just a friend and kept ditching me to hang with him 
I lost it yest and removed her from everywhere and called her seeking validation from males who once liked her (she’s done this before too become friends with ppl who liked her especially when she was in this thing with me) and then when I called her out she started blaming me and didn’t accept anything she did wrong and said she kept saying she lost feelings and kept denying the liking part with the guy she hangs out wd now. I get that she may not have feelings but I just don’t know anything anymore 
She says “ur never hearing from me again and that no guys ever spoken to me like this” which is so double standard considering so persons ever treated me the way she’s treated me-like absolute shit
Did I do make a mistake?

ANSWER: Your mistake was continuing to care after the relationship ended. What she does is none of your business. Her opinion on what went wrong and who is to blame is none of your business.

================================================================================

QUESTION: my 19M gf 19F has an abusive/manipulative family whom she has to depend on. how does she make her home life reasonable?

Hi all, I'm writing this post on behalf of my girlfriend.

Let me preface this by saying these are very first world problems, but it affects her strongly so please hear us out. Its very important to both of us.

Her family is manipulative to the point of abuse. She frequently breaks down in tears because of their actions.

Her older brother is the golden child, despite doing less for the family and achieving less. He lives away, and whenever he is at home he is showered in attention and praise. She lives at home and doesn't even get an 'I love you' back, just a laugh and an eyeroll. She does all the housework on top of her studies and work. What she gets in return is them taking out all of their stresses from life out on her verbally. When they can't find something to complain about they make something up. Recently they've been yelling at her for misunderstandings on their part over their communication. They keep her trapped with financial support and a roof over her head. When she comes to stay with me, they yell more the next time she sees them.

For years she has been trying to let them know she needs to be treated like a daughter. Essays sent by text since she struggles with communicating in person with them (likely trauma fuelled), conversations through tears, yelling. They say she's emotional, then (without actually listening to her thoughts), give their opinion on whatever situation. 

They're clearly very unempathetic and childish.

I'm sure this is not a fully original experience, and am wondering how you might've escaped this type of childhood? Or any other advice is very much welcome and appreciated.

My thoughts are rudimentary so far, including just staying with me full time (this will likely result in full non communication and cutting of financial support), and somehow getting through to them by forcing a proper conversation (maybe that needs me to be present, but she isn't happy with this as it would potentially destroy their relationship with me).

Please help, I thank you all in advance.

ANSWER: Thank you for the thoughts

She found her period of separation in a year of time at residential college at uni, unfortunately its just not sustainable (financially). She was certainly happier during this time, but it didn't have the perfect effect we wanted, they still found ways to torment her. I'm thinking the solution is multifaceted, with short term being working on herself and her mind and allowing for the long term which would be moving out permanently and potentially cutting most communication.

What do you think?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (20F) feel like I may have made a mistake about leaving (22M).

I, F 20, had a summer fling with a coworker, M 22, a little over a year ago. It was probably the best relationship i’ve ever had and we truly fell for each other. Unfortunately it was seasonal work and so we live far apart and decided to break it off when we left, even though we still very much were into each other. I can’t speak for him but I was definitely in love and I think about him all the time. Shortly after we went our separate ways I met my current bf, M 22, and we’ve been together for a year. i really love my boyfriend and can see a future with him and am very close with his family. but i can’t stop thinking about if I am making a mistake, i thought i would get over the summer fling but i can’t fully and don’t think i ever will. we are still friends and have seen each other here and there since then. it was just such a deep connection something deeper than anything i have ever felt. idk what to do, i cant just break up with my current bf for something that i may be fantasizing over in my head, especially since me and the guy have completely different lives and live far away. idk i need advice or any related stories please?

ANSWER: Never look at it as a mistake but a choice. If you're happy with your current bf then enjoy that moment because this fling can just be all the fantasy you built up in your head but it won't reflect to real life

QUESTION: 30M and 29F, married 10years how do I know if my husband is serious about rebuilding our relationship?

30M and 29F, married 10years how do I know if my husband is serious about rebuilding our relationship? 

I found out that after traveling out of town for work my husband was messaging a bartender that he met at a local bar. When I found the messages I had moved to be with him across states. When confronted he looked like he’d seen a ghost. He instantly apologized and said he thought I’d never find out. 
 
This is not the first time he’s fumbled in our relationship. 3 years ago while working out of town he wrote me a letter saying he hated our lives and that he was suicidal. But shortly after, he told me he meant known of it and that it was mistake. I could never really get him to break up with me. 

I forgave him for that time in our lives, however I never thought he would become involved in a relationship with another woman. He swears nothing physical happened and that it was only messages and seeing her at the bar. This completely crushed me. I mean my self worth is at an all time low. 

He swears that it meant nothing to him and that he was just in a bad place, trying to push me away. 

On one hand he seems genuinely disappointed in himself for the pain he has caused me, and has been a completely different husband than before. On the other hand I’m not sure how I’m able to trust him ever again. How do I know if he is genuine about rebuilding our relationship or if he is just lying to me?

ANSWER: It keeps on happening, he says the right things, you love him more than you love yourself so you hang on to the crumbs he gives you, and then it happens again. The answer is obvious you should be done. However, if you think I'm wrong, forgive him again, and see what happens.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (24M) have been with my girlfriend (24F) for about 3.5 years. We’ve always tried to be practical about money and make decisions together, especially with trips and big expenses.

A couple months ago, she asked if we could take a New York trip for her birthday, but the dates fell in December. I told her it wasn’t realistic financially, and she agreed. We talked again later and mutually decided we would plan a New York trip for March 2026 instead giving us plenty of time to save and do it the right way.

Fast forward to now…

She gets invited by a friend to go to New York this December, the exact trip we agreed not to take. She said yes without talking to me, asking me, or checking in about the plan we made.

Then today she texted me saying she did her budgeting and realized she won’t have enough money to cover her bills because of this trip. She told me that the trip in total was about $1600 on her part. She asked if I could send her $700 to bail her out for her bills for December. 

I’m honestly struggling with how to feel.
I care about her deeply, but this situation makes me feel:
	•	Hurt
	•	Disrespected
	•	Ignored
	•	And financially taken for granted

We made a plan together. She went against it on her own, and now I’m being asked to fix the fallout. It puts me in a position where I feel like no matter what I choose, I’m doing something wrong either bailing her out and creating a pattern, or saying no and feeling like the bad guy.

I’m trying to navigate this in a mature and healthy way, but I’m stuck on how to communicate my feelings and set boundaries without turning it into a huge fight.

How do I approach this? Has anyone dealt with something similar? How do you set financial boundaries with someone you love without it creating resentment or blowing up the relationship?

ANSWER: Money is tough man. My fiancé and I still fight about it once in a while, and we’re about the same age as you guys (25). 

People make dumb financial decisions at our age sometimes. I think the more important question here is why this trip was important enough for her to deviate from your financial patterns. That’s how I would open the discussion if I were you. Is she feeling stifled? Missing out on things because of money/not able to be spontaneous? 

“Hey, I wanted to talk about the trip. I thought we had a plan in place and I’m confused/hurt that things changed abruptly without you discussing it with me. Why was this trip so important to you? What’s going on?” 

My other question here generally would be about savings. $1600 isn’t a huge amount of money if you’re both building individual savings funds. $700 should be able to be pulled from an emergency fund and rebuilt if need be. Why are you able to bail her out but she doesn’t have $700 in savings?

================================================================================

QUESTION: He (20M) Tells Me (22F) That I’m “the one” Then Pulls Away?

I (22F) have been involved with a guy (20M) for only a few weeks. He first messaged me on Instagram at the end of September, saying he’d seen me around the party scene. From the beginning, he pursued me intensely. Constantly wanting to see me, dropping everything for me, reassuring me, acting emotionally mature, and showing a level of devotion that didn’t feel casual. Things felt genuinely mutual until a fight involving another girl happened. it was a girl that I had seen in his friend group with him at parties and she seemed a little too comfortable. I had mentioned it earlier on and he did everything he could to reassure me about it. She’s been a friend of his since high school and they’ve always been in the same friend group and he promised that was all it was. But on Halloween night, she was together in the group with him again, and she was entirely too comfortable. Admittedly, I started an altercation and it became physical. Violence is incredibly out of my character, but I honestly think it was a mixture of the drugs the alcohol and the pain lol. afterward he said he needed space. Then he started acting inconsistent. Avoiding meet ups, promising to see me but not following through, watching my stories but not responding, giving excuses, and emotionally pulling away. 

This went on for a few weeks, but fast forward to this weekend we ended up at the same party after weeks of barely talking. He was in a car with a mutual friend doing cocne. I was on a Mlly capsule. When everyone left the car, it was just us, and he immediately apologized for everything. He said I’m the person he wants, recorded a video on my phone saying he doesn’t “play about me,” said he would “kill someone about me,” and that we were basically picking things back up. We spent the whole night together, he came home with me, and even though he couldn’t get hard lol(likely from the coke), he kept telling me he was in love with me, that I’m his person, that I’m “the one,” and that the only reason he avoided me before was because he knew he’d fall right back into things. We had sex the next morning, he repeated again that he loved me, and we spent the morning with my friend and my brother. Later he promised he would see me again that night at another event but said he was too exhausted to go. I understood that so I offered to come by instead. When I asked to come over instead, he said no but “maybe tomorrow or Monday.” That same night I posted a picture of our friend group from the party and tagged him. In the picture I was kissing his cheek and he had his arm around my waist. he told me to delete it because it was “too soon,” which confused me given all the things he’d just said about loving me. We argued. The next day he called while my friends were over, cheerful and acting like everything was fine, saying he’d come over later and even asked me to save him some food. He promised he would be there, but didn’t show. I called, and he said he “lost track of time” with friends but would still come. I told him I didn’t want a late night hookup. I wanted to talk. We argued again. Eventually I told him I’d wait outside his apartment, and he said “alright,” so I did. for hours. I fell asleep and woke up around 1am. I texted him and asked him if he would even be coming back that night. He responded with crying emojis (😭) and asked if I was really there. Then he said showing up uninvited was not OK, and we argued again until he said we couldn’t work. I drove myself home feeling really empty and very rejected. 

he still watches my Instagram stories and hasn’t removed himself from my group chat and we’re still following each other..

I don’t understand how someone can cry for me, say he’s in love with me, say I’m “the one,” spend the night with me, make future promises, and then immediately pull away, avoid me, and refuse any real conversation. I’m trying to understand the psychology behind this kind of behavior. Why would someone do all of this? What explains such an extreme emotional flip? Is it immaturity, drugs, insecurity, fear of commitment, something else, or was it all just words?

This has been eating at me for days. I want to move on from this. I sometimes think it would’ve been easier had he just rejected me out right and told me he didn’t want me from the beginning. Because at least then I wouldn’t spend my days convincing myself that he does care. I just don’t understand. I just don’t understand and I want to move on, but it is so difficult.

ANSWER: Girl if this is even a real post, it’s the drugs. He said he loved you while coked out. That isn’t real. He wanted to hit it and you let him. He said what he needed to say to get what he wanted. There’s a reason he didn’t really want to see you outside of parties and hookups. 

Instagram story views and groupchats and whatever else aren’t representative of a real relationship. They aren’t real. I say this as someone who met my fiancé in the party scene at my college. You know how we built a relationship? Sober dates. 

He’s a playboy loser and you need to grow up and have a little more self respect. Harsh maybe, but true. Starting fights? Really? Saying it’s because of the drugs isn’t an excuse. It’s immature to get physical over an imagined slight/insecurity. A woman with self respect would not wait outside his apartment for hours in the small hours of the morning after he’s made it clear he isn’t truly interested.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Former “situationship” (45F) ready to commit after I (33M) lost weight. Is this worth exploring?

Hi all. This will be a decently long story, so I’m sorry in advance. But context is important.

I (33M) met a woman (45F) a little under 2 years ago after she moved into the same property. I rent a home from a family friend that’s on a big plot of land. The main home is huge, but they have a separate small guest house that’s further down on the property and that’s where I stay. My landlord is very friendly, and looks to help people out so she is frequently moving people into her main home who need a transitional place to stay. Around February of last year, she moved in a family of 4 (one mother, 3 kids). I usually keep to myself, but they invited me to a bonfire on the property one night and I ended up meeting them. The mother kept staring at me, and she was very pretty, so I took the hint and introduced myself. She ended up telling me she’s “down for anything” that night. This culminated in a 2-3 month active situationship where she’d frequently come stay with me in my house. I really liked her as a person, and obviously the sex was a nice bonus. 

However, I say “situationship” because of her pattern. She asked me to be her boyfriend within a few weeks, and I told her that I’d be happy too if we got to know each other just a little bit more. The reason I said that was because she was extremely push/pull. So our dynamic was a week or two of extreme intimacy (sex, cuddling, kissing, her texting and calling me 24/7, pet names) followed by a week or two of complete withdrawal (won’t reach out, won’t respond, leaving the property for days at a time). The fact she had been in many long term relationships before, but seemingly wouldn’t commit to anything with me; the push/pull caused me to become emotionally exhausted; I was becoming insecure, anxious, and depressed. 

I’m a very straight forward guy. I’ve spent a lot of time working on myself to be patient, kind, and caring. So this kind of dynamic unsettles me because I need consistency to be secure. After a month or so of it, I told her I was uncomfortable and we needed to end things. She cried, begged, and told me it’s just her diagnosed BPD that makes her on and off. I told her that if she needed a few days of space, I can give her that easily, but completely disappearing off the map for a week or more makes me not trust her. She said she’d make an effort. Fast forward another 2 months and nothing changed. Same push/pull, same heavy intimacy one week followed by me being depressed and anxious when she’s gone for 2 weeks and won’t respond to casual check ins. By this point, it’s been a total of 4-5 months of this, and I’ve had enough. I told her we need to stop whatever this is because I am uncomfortable and insecure and I don’t expect her to change. She cried again, but I didn’t change my mind. I stuck with it and denied her advances.

The next few months were followed by the occasional reach out text from her looking to rekindle things. Telling me I’m unlike every man she’s been with, and she needs someone patient like me in her life to help regulate her mental state. I really did (and do) care about her. My attachment deepened once her kids began to love me. I felt like a valued member in their lives and it gave me a sense of purpose. Also, our personalities and tastes are a lot alike. Same music taste, same sense of humor, when things are good with her; I feel like I’ve met a kindred spirit. So it was hard for me to let go of something that had so much potential. I cried every time I had to cut it off because I simply couldn’t trust her. I told her if I keep staying on the sidelines, she’ll eventually find someone else while I’m deeply attached and I’ll be truly destroyed. 

That’s the backstory, so here’s the current issue: 

I have lost a lot of weight since we first met. When we met, I was roughly 320lbs. I gained a lot of weight in my late 20s because of depression and laziness. I’m 6’4 and athletic so I wore the weight better than most, I didn’t resemble a blob, more like a wider block shape leaned out by my height, but I still didn’t love the way I looked. Early last year, a friend got me into a gym routine and diet plan that’s sustainable for me and I am currently 215lbs and very shredded. I look better aesthetically than I’ve ever looked even when I was playing sports in my very early 20s. 

I went to her new house a month ago because her kid (who is now 19) invited me to check out his new car. (Remember her family adores me) This was the first time she saw me in around 9 months. She kept staring at me, and was instantly was all over me in the most appropriate way possible, which I was flattered by. Deep down, I really do care about this woman even if I could never get consistency out of her. 

Since this day, she has been obsessed with me. But there’s no inconsistency like there used to be. We’ve had sex several times, made out countless times, and she texts me every single day without fail. I never have to initiate. She is always there, wanting my attention in some way. It’s no longer in 1-2 week intervals like it used to be; it’s day in and day out. And I can’t help but remember how different she used to treat me in this regard when I was overweight.

Some of the positives I keep harping on are: She never asked me for money when we were involved. She had sex with me repeatedly when I was overweight and was generally very intimate when in her “pull” phase. She is exactly like me personality wise. I love being around her.

So I don’t think she was using me in a traditional sense, but I think it’s likely that she had several people she was using for emotional/physical comfort back then. But I think now she sees me as more of a status symbol/eye candy which makes her enthusiastic about committing to me when it seemed literally impossible just a year or two ago.

What do you guys think? I really do care about this woman, but I’m not looking for someone who would only be a decent partner if I’m in good physical shape and look “hotter”. That kind of superficiality makes me resent people.

ANSWER: Neither your weight loss nor you as a person will magically cure bpd. Hornyness is not a sufficient base for a relationship but it is what's making her check in right now. 

Push/pull is a very lightweight version of what a relationship with a person with bpd can mean and I'm afraid you're about to find that out the hard way.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Is my boyfriend (33M) checked out of our relationship? I (28F) feel like I’m no longer worth the effort.

Hi everyone. I’ve been with my boyfriend “Greg” (33M) for a little over a year. 

Over the last couple of months, it feels like we’re not on the same page, and it’s starting to seem like Greg doesn’t really want to be in this relationship anymore.

For our one-year anniversary, I had an extremely exhausting workday, but I still pushed myself to get dressed, do my makeup, pick up dinner items, and even grab him some snacks I know he loves. I’ve also told him several times how much I love having flowers in the house because they make me happy. When I got home, I realized he hadn’t gotten me anything…not even something small. It hurt, especially on a day that was supposed to feel special.

This wasn’t the first time. At our six-month anniversary, I told him I had a gift for him… but again, I got nothing because he “didn’t know what to get me.” Afterward, I explained that even if he wasn’t sure, he could ask or try something small. Instead, it felt like he just didn’t want to put in the time.

Then came my birthday. Some friends organized a dinner for me, and Greg chose not to come because he was “too tired.” But he still hangs out with his friends even when he’s tired. Birthdays are really hard for me due to childhood trauma (I’ve been working on it in therapy) and having the person I wanted most to be there just… not show up… really hurt.

There have also been smaller moments that make me feel uncared for. For example, we were at a party recently where all the food was gone. I told him I was hungry, and he just didn’t care. He didn’t offer to leave with me, find food, or even acknowledge it. It’s a tiny thing, but moments like that add up and make me feel like my needs don’t matter to him.

I know I’m not perfect. I’ve tried expressing my feelings calmly and clearly, but he often reacts like I’m being impossible to please. I don’t want to nitpick or demand perfection. The truth is, he makes me happy in many ways, but lately he seems distant and comfortable to the point of complacency. I’m starting to feel like I’m just not worth the effort to him.

I just needed to vent because I do feel like I am confused and spiraling.

ANSWER: Sis, its okay to quit on a guy who isn't trying. You deserve effort.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (F22) lost feelings for my partner (M21), and am debating on breaking up, is this impulsive?

I (F22) entered into a relationship with (M21) in August of 2025. After several issues with his ex interjecting herself into the relationship I’m not sure I still love him and haven’t been sure for around a month now. I’ve tried to regain the feelings I had for him at the beginning but I don’t think it’s possible or I don’t know. Right now we are on a break because I told him how I felt.
DETAILED CONTEXT/DETAILS BELOW

CONTEXT: We met at work, both work at the same state park just different jobs. We went on a few  dates, and things seemed great. He’s super sweet, kind, excitable, handsome, basically everything you want in a potential bf. The catch was that I found out early on from him that he was a month out from his last breakup (which I later found out he never actually told me the truth about how messy the relationship was and it actually ended 3 months prior but they were still basically dating till our relationship). I told him we would take it slow because I didn’t want to get hurt and he needed to heal. At this point he also told me he was friends with his exes because he doesn’t enjoy losing people he cares about even though he lost romantic feelings. I was thought that was okay, since we are adults and I trusted him. 

But as we kept hanging out, his ex would call and text him begging to get back together with him. He’s a chronic people pleaser and didn’t want to upset her or cut her off completely so he would tell her he wasn’t interested in her anymore and that he was with someone else. But she would persist. I chose to not voice much opinion or act in order to gauge how he would handle this despite me not being okay with it. The final straw was when he told me that he was going to drive 2 hours (they go to the same college and could do this in a few weeks when they went back to school) to exchange and drop off their stuff and get a birthday present from her. I lost in and almost cut things off but didn’t. We talked it out and the next day of his own volition he blocked her on everything. Incidents no longer happened and it was fine. Until one day I had a bad feeling, probably a month after the visitation drama, so I looked in his phone to see their last text messages. 

I found out that he told her he loved her 6 days before he asked me to be his girlfriend. I was devastated and confront him, we talked about it. TLDR he said that it was just to appease her and he hadn’t felt that was about her for months. I believed him because he genuinely loves me and treats me so warmly. We make up and I try to push through it because he’s so sweet. He bakes me cookies, rubs my back, looks at pictures of me when I’m not around, if I would forget my lunch he would bring me something to work, he would constantly say such sweet and kind things to me as well as help me work on my body issues. 

He truly loved me for who I was but the problem was is I wasn’t so sure I felt the same way. I slowly realized that I didn’t feel genuine telling him I loved him and I’m not sure why. It hurt a lot and for a month now I had been trying to rekindle the feelings for him because he’s an amazing SO but I finally reached a point where I couldnt lie anymore. I told him and now we are on a break. I don’t know if I just gaslit myself into feeling the way I did or not. Are you supposed to feel incredibly in love with your partner for the first 3 months of a relationship? I’m so confused and sad and I really don’t know if this was the right decision because marble I’ll never find someone as good to me again as him. 

Compatibility wise: He is a little slow, but very kind and treats me how I’ve always wanted a BF to treat me. But he doesn’t have any interests besides the gym and doesn’t have much about him that is interesting, he doesn’t plan dates or outings, I do and he would if I asked(but he’s also a broke college student and I work a full time job post graduation). He’s very passive and does anything I would like but doesn’t initiate as much as I’d like.

TLDR: I went on a break with my SO of 4 months because I felt like I did not love him the way I should this early in a relationship but I am worried I made the wrong decision.

You get the idea with the title. My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly a year now and he is so excited for our anniversary coming up and I’m just… not. We have been long distance for the past 6 months and I still call him every day and we find things to do together. I do this voluntarily and I like spending time with him it’s just whenever he comes to visit me I am kinda aloof and I get frustrated with little things and I don’t want to touch a lot. I don’t know what’s up with me I love him and I love talking to him but he asked me today if my love for him has changed and I said it hadn’t but I don’t know if I was telling the truth. I do have ADHD and depression so I don’t know if it’s related to that but whatever it is I would hate for him to feel like I’m just dragging him along. I don’t know how to fix this and I don’t know what to do. He’s my best friend and I don’t want to lose him but I don’t feel like I’m making his life better right now as a girlfriend. Please help

================================================================================

QUESTION: 37F and my 35M boyfriend: Feeling conflicted about long-term relationship and financial stability

I’m a 37F, and I’ve been with my boyfriend, 35M, for almost 7 years. We’re not engaged, don’t have kids, and he’s not financially stable. I want to be clear: he’s a good person, an ideal partner in many ways, kind, caring, and supportive. But I can’t ignore the financial side of things.

I was raised in a household where my dad provided for the family, and that set an example for me of what I value in a long-term partnership. I’m not saying I want to be a trophy wife or that I expect him to fund everything, but I do hope for some financial stability if we’re planning a future together.

I also can’t ignore the reality that I’m not getting younger, and I’m not really sure if I can still bear a child because of my age. I find myself wondering if I’m being unreasonable for wishing he were more financially secure. We’ve been together for almost 7 years, and sometimes I don’t know if I can keep waiting for stability or a proposal. Does he even have a plan for our future? Am I going to grow old with him, or alone?

I know he’s trying, and I don’t want to disregard that, but I also can’t help feeling concerned about what this means for marriage, children, and building a life together. I just want to figure out if my expectations are realistic and how to navigate this without resentment or pressure.

How do you balance love and financial stability when thinking about a long-term future? Is it okay to consider this when deciding whether to stay in a relationship?

ANSWER: Hmm medical stuff can take time although I think he is on the later side. Don't have much visibility on how long it takes to establish careers in medical field to be more precise. But I will say this - and I think you know it - that if you want kids the hour is late at best. If you can somehow accept that he will take a while to get his bearing and are willing to support both of you financially for now - I wouldn't waste any time.

================================================================================

QUESTION: how do i (20F) break up with my long distance girlfriend (19F) if i already had the talk with her?

to preface, i already brought up the big convo over a month ago now that i wasnt comfortable being in a relationship anymore but id like us to stay friends if we can. my girlfriend of course broke down on call, this being her very first relationship she was utterly devastated understandably. i did my best to soothe her and support her best i could, explaining my pespective of our relationship and why i thought we'd work better as friends anyway, that it wouldnt be very dissimilar to what we have already.

for context, we started started as friends long before we started going out several months ago and even in the beginning (which i should have listened to my gut instinct) she never explicitly showed desire for me in a truly romantic nor sexual way. and the couple of times she did it was very selfish intent, our sexual encounters all catered around her, which felt like her being so enamoured with the idea of being desired herself by someone else, which she wasnt used to being in her first relationship, that she used me for that alone. not to mention pushed me towards a more domming position than i was comfortable with despite me stating on several occasions im more of a switch, leaning on sub, and she never once reciprocated the same interest for me. she hadnt even really been interested in photos nor videocalls (in general) either, despite me bringing this up to her 3 seperate times. 

she has a tendency to dote on me constantly since we've been going on, message spamming me incessantly, which i havent neccesarily minded besides for the fact that its all seemed like mindless lovebombing, and not inherently specific to me, which is another thing that bugged me. she will message me 40 times in a row within the span of an hour about how she loves me and wants to do everything with me and cuddle and hug and cook dinner with me and watch movies and live together and all of these things. constantly saying youre so cute and youre my teddy bear and youre so wonderful and nice and comforting to me. after several months it has only come off as borderline infantilizing me at this point considering she has never once complimented me besides how nice i am to her and never uses the word pretty with me. she doesnt treat me like an equal as much as someone she's desperate to get attention from because she enjoys that i tend to be a bit of people pleaser without realizing, and she certainly uses it to her advantage.

not to mention the several instances of her being incredibly insecure and scared ill leave her. i think this is why ive been so hesitant to break it off early on because shes been really good at manipulating me not too even if maybe unintentionally? shes developed a nasty case of jealousy because ive gotten closer with one of our mutual friends, despite me hanging out with her nearly every single day already, at her request. which isnt a complaint because i do sincerely enjoy her presence and we get along really really well when we are quite literally just acting as best friends like before. and not to say she has been cruel or nasty towards me or our friend at all but her remarks about my hanging out with anyone else has been very selfish. she seems to like the idea of having a girlfriend more than me specifically and very scared of losing that status. even on social media she shows off that im hers on random posts of mine/hers, completely unrelated to anything about the post itself.

she is geniunely a great person, we work amazing platonically and i think her excitedness for being in a new relationship and being able to call someone her girlfriend is understandable, considering i have definitely been there before too. but its at a point that is clearly selfish to be so possesive of me when shes offered so little interest in me outside of the attention i provide her and nothing more. so im fed up with it but i really really dont want to lose her in my life. our bond is so wonderful outside of this and i truly do think its possible to change the parameters of our relation to esch other without having to  completely lose each other in our lives. 

the issue is even after our convo about how i wasnt comfortable being in a relationship anymore, she has continued to call me her wife, girlfriend, even though shes messaged slightly less spammy now. shes been seeking more attention on social media now than me so much. i do think she took my saying i dont want to be in a relationship as just keeping us as "unlabeled" for the time being, because in the moment she kept repeating how she didnt want to not call me her girlfriend anymore and didnt think she could go back to just friends. and i said thats fine but i dont want to lose you in each others lives if we can, though i dont think itd be very different considering how we hadnt been very romantic/sexual to begin with. 

my question– how do i word it to her both firmly and resepctfully not to call me these things anymore and i only want to be friends in a way that will make her more receptive to the idea of just friendship? 
and would it be okay to ask this over text as an addendum to our previous convo considering i already talked with her over voice, or would it just more appropriate to hear with finality over call? 

thank you and sorry for the wordy paragraphs!! 🫶 appreciative of specifially help in wording what to say!!

ANSWER: Let her get thru finals and then crush her. Hopefully her fam is supportive and will nurse her thru the holidays and by the time school starts again she will realize what a favor it was and she can quit telling men to F off when they hit on her.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (40M) think I found the love of my life (F34), but we’re struggling with long-distance and it’s scaring us. Need advice.

Hi guys!

We fell in love 3 months ago, and I (who already had two long relationships, 7 and 5 years, but also spent many years single) felt for the first time that I had found the love of my life, and she told me many times that she felt the same. It was different from anything we’ve ever experienced on every level.

When we met, we already had trips booked: I (M 40) was going to Asia for four months, she (F 34) was going to South America for four months as well. Our trips didn’t overlap, which could mean 4-5 months without seeing each other. The connection was so strange and deep that it felt like we had known each other for years, and we ended up doing something crazy, living together for a month at my place. We both said it was incredible. But I recently realised that maybe it wasn’t the way she ideally imagined getting to know someone. She would have preferred to keep dating slowly. I’ll be honest: I loved the way it unfolded because it was different from the classic beginning of a relationship. We never made future plans, I think we both understood that things were happening that way because we were about to be apart for a long time.

Until recently, I thought we had met at the perfect moment in life. We were both in a good place after past relationships (mine ended four years ago, hers six months ago). Neither of us had expectations or was actively looking for someone. We fell in love spontaneously, sincerely, authentically, even crazily.

I knew distance would be hard, but I thought we could still be free and grow even without physical presence, while still being part of each other’s lives in a lighter way, with small gestures.

But during these first three weeks, I realised that even though our love languages seem to match perfectly when we’re together, words, quality time, touch, emotional connection, at a distance something feels different, and it has made the separation difficult to manage.

I like sharing my day, sending a good morning or good night message, and I think that creates pressure and anxiety for her. She told me that before meeting me she would look at her phone maybe once a day. I was like that too. But I feel more at peace with this change in me because I do it naturally, without thinking. I think she experiences it as pressure. I don’t need constant communication, but it comforts me to know there’s a safe place on the other side of the world. Now I try to hold back on purpose, but I’m not sure if that can also end up being too much in a different way.

I’ve formed a very strong bond and an intense emotional connection, and I don’t feel it takes away my independence it just added a new layer to my emotional life.

She’s coming to meet me in Asia in a few days so we can spend two weeks together, and we’ll need to make the most of it and decide our immediate future during that time, because we don’t want to do it from a distance. In our last conversation, I felt she’s under a lot of pressure from the relationship. She talked about the possibility of ending things and seeing where we stand in a few months, and whether it still makes sense. She’s as lost as I am, and she told me for the first time that she’s not ready for a long-distance relationship. Until now, we had always believed we would make it work. I think she had made plans for her life, to be free in South America, to enjoy it fully, and suddenly she finds herself in a relationship that is causing her pressure and anxiety.

It’s important to say that we are both very intense people, we feel everything deeply. I think that’s part of what made us fall so madly for each other.

We talked about making a list of pros and cons for both scenarios to discuss together: trying to keep this going long-distance, or ending it and figuring things out later. I’m completely lost…

Has anyone gone through something similar or can help me think through the pros and cons? So far, I have this:

Ending it: protects the memory, avoids emotional exhaustion, but cuts the emotional bond and brings uncertainty about the future.

Continuing long-distance: keeps the connection (even if less intense) and the plans, but demands huge effort, trust, and patience, with a high risk of frustration, anxiety, and damaging what we built.

ANSWER: Imo, she’s already checking the emergency exit, man. just enjoy the meetup and don’t force it.. she’ll show you where her head’s at without you dragging it out

================================================================================

QUESTION: My 28M girlfriend 27F is hurt that I need and value my alone time and prefer to go to the gym alone. Am I being insensitive?

To preface I feel I should mention that being at the gym consistently helped me get through a depression from my first heavy heartbreak and it became part of my daily routine



when I first started dating my current gf she showed interest in going to the gym so every now and again I’d take her and show her my routine 

  
this became a daily thing and she told me that she always wants to go to the gym with me 

  
I told her that I enjoy going to the gym by myself because it helps me lock in and focus on what I’m working on. this made her upset and said that maybe we shouldn’t do anything together anymore or even be together because this isn’t her ideal relationship.

  
i feel our difference is that I enjoy doing things by myself while she wants to do everything with me

  
I don’t mind sharing my hobbies with her, we go hiking, camping, fishing, biking, and even do photography together. But I just can’t focus on my workout when she wants me to train her as well



am I being insensitive?

how can I express this to her without hurting her feelings?

ANSWER: Her codependency isn’t healthy and saying “if you don’t do this with me, we can’t be together” to guilt you is manipulative.  Don’t set a precedent that you’re ok with that. 

Say “my alone time at gym is important for my mental health.  If you don’t want a relationship where we can’t do things apart, thats your choice.  Let me know what you decide.  I’d love to take you to ‘dinner, movies,’another time if this is something you can move past”.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Am i delusional? F/24 & M/23

Me and this man are not in a relationship. We never have been. The reason im making this however is because I have this feeling thats just been driving me absolutely crazy for the past several months and i need someone to give it to me straight. So me and said man (i will just refer to him as Bee) have known each other for roughly 5 or 6 years now. Every single time i've ever been around Bee in any setting at all, I always find myself speaking to him 1 on 1, regardless of how many other people are present / who the other people present are. I feel like Bee and I, just click so perfectly. It sounds ridiculous but i swear it feels like our souls just are two completely matching perfectly fitting puzzle pieces. I kind of feel like he feels the same way. The reason I feel like this is because he gets just as lost in conversation with me as i do with him. And i feel like both of us constantly gravitate towards each other everywhere we are. Good example would be, him leaving a room to do something and me following instinctively, and vise versa. He is always laughing and smiling so big when we talk, and even in silence just when I look at him i feel like we communicate with our eyes. Something silly happening and us giving each other a knowing glance and a big smile. The issue at hand though, is unfortunately. Bees best friend is also my ex of 6 years. and Bee loves him. So i feel like he will never tell me if he loves me too. But at the same time I dont even know for certain that maybe he loves me or if im just being delulu? I dont know what to do. He sort of knows i love him, i have briefly mentioned it to him before but it was like slipping in a quick sentence and brushing past it due to the circumstances i just explained. help meeeee plaayyyseee

ANSWER: If you've managed to have a relatively civil relationship with your ex you might ask him if he'd be upset if you made a play for "Bee". If you're not even on speaking terms with your ex maybe don't worry about it and just ask "Bee" if he'd want to see you in a one on one situation, like for coffee or a walk or something.

QUESTION: Me (19M) and my girlfriend(19F) have been having a rocky relationship since she’s moved in with me

So me and my girlfriend have been dating for about 6 months now, at the start everything was good and great but let’s say about 4-5 months in we started to get into it wether it be on small stupid stuff we’re let’s say one time she called me and I couldn’t really hear her since I had my headset on (over my ears) and she got really upset with me with that as she felt I wasn’t listening while I was playing the game while she was ranting about her job. Now since that I’ve taken measures to stop that by just stop playing the game entirely but now since we live together it’s just been weird today it was her car has been having troubles recently and today it started shaking while she was driving and she called me and I said well I’m not sure try to put in coolant as the night before her car was low on it her car is also missing a sensor too so I brought up that these are the only things I know and she replied “Don’t worry about it, I’ll find a way” then she gets home and acts all distant and gives me the silent treatment. I feel she take what I say sometimes and reads it past what I meant and then it turns into something that it isn’t. I don’t know how I could have approached that differently maybe with like a sorry that happened to you but I hate when someone says that. And she also reposts videos that kinda shoot at me like today it was a TikTok about my boyfriend doesn’t call me beautiful anymore and it’s like I always tell her everyday I love you and she also says “you don’t love me “ but it’s like how can she say that about me and I’ve invited her to live in my home at no expense I feel my actions and gifts even though I can’t get her much gifts as I’m a student, 99% of the time I pay for her food so I thought that of course I love her and thinks she’s beautiful.  I maybe think is it the way I say it sometimes, do I come off as an asshole ? What’s something I should work on / pay more attention too ?

ANSWER: 1. 19 year olds

2. dating 6 months

3. Living together already?

4. Sounds like heavy gaming and social media use, guiding behaviors.

Are you trying to torture each other? What exactly do you expect to happen? You are children playing grown ups.

1. Your priorities are all wrong. 

2. Your hormones are raging. 

3 You aren't finish with school, or have stable incomes

4. You don't know who you are yet, what is important, or how to deal with conflict, or communicate properly

I mean, you should consider this all practice.  But, really, you should be focusing on finishing school, and/or building up your careers. Not playing house with someone you aren't likely going to be with for very long. It is a distraction.

Anyway. Didn't mean to sound harsh. But, my dude. With some really hard work on both of your ends, you could maybe pull through this. But, really. It is just going to take time. If you met again in at least your later 20s. You would have a much greater chance.

QUESTION: Me (M30) and native Puerto Rican (F27)  culture questions and her expectations?

I’d really like to talk to somebody that is between 25-35 years old. I need early relationship advice on what a typical Puerto Rican expect out of a relationship.  It’s so different from dating a Chinese woman for five years the expectations Seem so so different. I’m so used to giving everything and all from day one and that doesn’t seem to be the case. Here I’ve been going slowly but I’m just so lost. I’m a 30 yo male. I just want her happy and to feel comfortable. I’m willing to do whatever it takes. We talked 24/7 for the last month and a half. I started learning Spanish and practicing daily to help better communicate with her family, etc. I can go into way more detail with whoever response to me. We literally have shared everything about our lives. There’s not much there that we haven’t talked about.

ANSWER: Is the problem that she wants to go slower than you’re wanting? You’ve talked a ton which means she definitely likes you a lot. If it’s a sex thing, everybody has their own timer with that and it’s not as simple as her being from a specific culture, kinda just depends on what she wants from the relationship

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (19M) seem to stress out in my relationship with my girlfriend (20F) when things are going smooth

Hi everyone! I have recently gotten into my first relationship, with a really great and caring person. I care about her a lot and I enjoy the time I spend with her. I am learning a lot about myself, even in the 2 1/2 months we have been dating. I am a natural overthinker, so I’m always trying my best to find the best way to handle situations. I am very independent and enjoy my personal space, so I find myself not missing my girlfriend, but not in a bad, because I know I will always see her every weekend. This idea of me not missing her all the time stresses me out and makes me feel like I might not be a good person to a degree. Recently, my girlfriend felt like she needed some space because she was overwhelmed from her own personal pursuits. She seemed dry and kinda stressed out when I talked to her. This made me miss her a lot and made me think about her a whole lot more than I usually do. When I noticed that she started to feel better, I went back to not really missing her that much, even thought I still think about her throughout my day. Are feelings like this normal, and is this all part of being new to dating? This is all very new and confusing. If anyone has experienced anything similar, please share! I would greatly appreciate any guidance!

ANSWER: If, at 19, you've managed to mature out of the teenage yearning to be together all the time, then you should probably take it as a blessing. Unless she's complaining about it. This is the more normal early dating schedule for busy adults. So if you she are both pursuing education or work, those things take priority over your social life. That you've found someone who shares those priorities is great. When if things start to get more serious you and she might work an extra day or two into your meeting schedule. But it's totally standard for people to work on their own stuff during the week then meet up with their romantic partners on the weekends. It shouldn't necessarily be until you're actually living together (something that would happen much later) that you're together every day.

QUESTION: Boyfriend (21M) Leads Me (21F) On A Lot

Hello! So me and my boyfriend have been together for a little over three years. We’ve had some ups and downs sexually, some due to personal things, medical, etc. but still hold a pretty okay sex life I would say, at least for the circumstances. But every so often my boyfriend does this thing where he leads me on sexually and then doesn’t follow through with it. And I don’t mean like sexting and then not having sex or changing his mind halfway through, I mean he will fully, unprompted start foreplay with me, enough to fully turn me on (sorry TMI) and will SAY his intentions out loud about having sex with me, and then just, drift out of it subtly by slowly stopping kissing me and then getting up and suggesting we do something else. He doesn’t even acknowledge what happened. Is this normal, like am I totally misreading the situation or how men flirt?

ANSWER: this sounds odd to me, as a male i couldn’t fathom initiating foreplay to the point my partner was ‘fully turned on’ then just stop, unless it’s some sort of power move to assert dominance or he’s fulfilled himself already, have you had a conversation with him as to why he does this?

QUESTION: My girlfriend hates her Job and i don't know what to do to support her. We live in a remote town for my job. 27M 26F

Hi everyone, im in a tricky situation and i need some advices.

M 27 and F 26 2 years together

I had to move to a remote town for my job and my girlfriend followed me. We have been living there for about 6 months. She loves the place but the jobs possibilities are scarse and she hated the job she found and there's is not many other options.

Sometimes she comes home crying and i know its really hard on her. I work often on weekends and nights shifts so im not with her often. She feels lonely far from her friends and family and feels like she's wasting her time here. I took a 3 year minimum contract.

Its been getting toe lately and I'm heartbroken because i know she's here for me and I can't seem to help her out with this.

I've tried to help her the best way i could. Ive listen, tried to give her advices, tried to find a new job for her.

I feel sad and powerless right now and i need some advices

Can i help her more?

ANSWER: You can help her by looking for a job in the area she comes from, remote living is hard. Even though she is there for you its actually unfair on her. Or let her go back home and do an LDR where she visits you from time to time. You're neglecting her because of the times your at work and she feels isolated. Its really unfair on her to expect her to stay there when you're not around anyway.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My(F28) BF(M29) wants to shift his career to mine with no savings

hi everyone! needing advice for a dilemma, sorry this will be a bit long.



my bf (m29) and i (f28) have been together for almost a year now. i work in a creative field while he worked in tech. he lost his job a month ago, but he has been hinting at me that he wants to shift his career to mine. that’s fine by me, although i’m a bit disappointed because i know working in tech could be more beneficial financially in the long run.  


don’t get me wrong, my career path has great money as well, but it’s in the creative industry that heavily relies on skill. i’ve been practicing and self-studying this skill for over 10 years now (and i’ve been working for around 5 years in my field). he wants me to teach him this skill and i guess he is expecting to gain the same amount of money as me. i’ve set it straight that my salary now is because of my years of experience in the industry, but he’s still set on changing his career because he’s tired of working in tech.  


as much as i love him and support him in any way i can, i can’t help but feel burnt out because while i’m teaching him this skill (and he’s not really doing any self-studying), i’m also contributing more financially whenever he visits (we’re LDR). i’m also frustrated that he’s not really doing anything career-wise other than wait around for me to teach him. in my head, wouldn’t the best move be to at least get a part-time job in tech so he still has income while he’s switching careers? because he doesn’t have any savings, no emergency money. i guess i’m disappointed in how i don’t see any initiative from him in that sense.  


aside from this, he’s the perfect boyfriend, treats me the best and we get along perfectly.  


just wanting advice about this, especially from people who went through this. thank you!

ANSWER: Relationship aside, I couldn’t be bothered to teach anyone that wouldn’t invest their own time (which he apparently has oodles of being unemployed and LDR) learning on their own. Way to demonstrate a lack of passion or initiative there.

If he starts freelancing or gets a job in this field is he going to rely on you to do his work too!?

QUESTION: Texted after date saying had a good time but acting weird (29f) (27m)

I went on a date a few days ago and it seemed like it went well in my opinion. It was around 2 hours long. We went and did what we planned and then he suggested food after so we did that. I thought there was a mutual attraction (it seemed) and when we parted ways I asked if I could give him a kiss. Literally was a peck on the lips. Have been over thinking that MAJORLY. Anyways he texts me shortly after saying thank you for going and that had a good time. I said thank you as well and then he took a while to reply back and was a straight up convo kill. I am wondering do you guys text that they had a good time if they actually didn't?

ANSWER: Maybe it was nothing about what you did but he wasn’t feeling it. This reminds me of “he’s just not that into you.” 
When guys are interested, there is no mistaking it. And if they aren’t responding strongly, I’m super grateful- NEXT! 
Bottom line: you deserve more. 🎉🎉🎉

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (23 F) feel like my chronic illness is ruining my relationship with my boyfriend (23 M)

Hi all, 

I (23F) have recently been diagnosed with Hashimoto’s (hypothyroid), PCOS, and endometriosis after a long time of wondering what was wrong with me. My (23M) boyfriend has been insanely supportive and helpful. We recently moved in together and it’s been great. 

The problem is because of these issues I’m either always insanely tired or in pain. We don’t go out because I am so exhausted, we are rarely intimate, and even when we do spend time together I feel like I can’t be 100% present because I’m so exhausted. I’ve been really open about this and our communication is great, I just can’t help but feel like both I and our relationship will never be the same. Even though he says it’s okay I can’t help but feel this immense guilt that I am not the person he started dating two years ago. And I know the lack of intimacy right now is because of me. 

My question is if anyone has these issues how do you keep your relationship healthy and if you feel the guilt I’m feeling, how do you manage it? If anyone is with a partner who is chronically ill, how have they adapted to keep the relationship happy and healthy?

Thank you all <3

ANSWER: My conditions were managed when I met my husband he did some research on his own to learn. I told him my day to day on good days and bad and he didn’t run. A year into our relationship my arthritis started first my right knee and I fell a lot. I fell onto my back and was diagnosed with facet joint arthritis. I also lost a significant amount of weight only to get diagnosed in my other knee and both hips. I have issues with mobility and intimacy. We are still affectionate hugs kisses cuddles we touch each other as we pass each other but with my pain as bad as it is I’m not up to much more activities. He never complains he still married me this year. Some guys are just good we have fun on good days we relax on bad days.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (20F) recently discovered that my boyfriend (M21) was texting an escort while on vacation. Is this cheating?

Back in October, my boyfriend along with two of his friends (20M) and a friends cousin and boyfriend went on vacation to a beach. I had no problem with this, we have a stable relationship for 1.5 years and cheating has never been a worry for either of us. I was glad he was doing something fun with his friends and taking a break from his job. This vacation was from October 9th through the 12th and my boyfriends birthday is 10/12 so we were a little bummed that we wouldn't be able to celebrate his birthday together but it was no fret. Between my boyfriend and his friends, a lot of drinking took place on this trip, especially on their last night there (10/11). Their last night there my boyfriend had called me (drunk) and explained to me how his two friends were unhappy in their relationships and they were basically trying to find any possible way to get laid. Later in the conversation he begins telling me how much he misses me and describes a few things he loves/misses about me which he typically never does. He tends to be more affectionate in that sense when he is drunk. Anyways, a little later we call again and he's in his own room away from his friends. He tells me his friends were trying to hookup with girls in the downstairs hot tub and that they were trying to find a way to a strip club but he was choosing to stay out of it and let them do their own thing. Eventually, we end up having phone sex, which was a first for us, and I go to bed not long after midnight once I had told my boyfriend happy birthday and that I couldn't wait to see him. However, in the beginning of being on the phone the second time I could really tell he was wasted, especially because he paused to throw up multiple times throughout, but I felt better knowing he was throwing up because I could tell it began to sober him up. To my knowledge, I had thought that he went to bed shortly after I had because he had a 10+ hr drive home in the morning. 

  
Now, fast-forward to about a week or so ago I had gone through his phone and found incredibly displeasing messages. Not long after he came back from his trip, I saw a nude picture of a woman that was obviously not his type in his phone and I had asked him about it. The response I received was that him and his friends were looking at different escorts in the beach area but he had no intention of being involved I guess?? I found it weird but just brushed it off and didn't think much of it for the days to follow. However, when I went through his iMessages I found recently deleted texts from a random number so I recovered the texts and found he was texting an escort at 2 a.m. the day of his birthday, the same woman whose nude photo I saw. When I had asked him about the texts, he claimed he was doing the texting and that it was his friends and he had found his phone in the living room of their rental when he woke up. Now, truly, who the hell would use their best friends phone to text an escort for themselves? Red flag one. Then, within the texts he says he "just turned 21" (two hours into his birthday) when the escort never even asked about his age. When both of his friends are 20 years old, that would be an oddly specific statement to make if it weren't actually my boyfriend typing these messages. Red flag two. After seeing these texts I head right over to his search history to see search after search of escorts in the area, if buying an escort is legal, and how to tell if an escort is a cop. Now, later in the searches he used the website beenverified to check if the escort he is texting is legit. When I asked him about this, he claimed he searched it in the morning when he woke up, but that doesn't make sense to me because after the beenverified searches, there are also more searches of looking at different escorts. Every time I would analyze the evidence I had and explained to him how his story didn't add up, he would get kinda angry and defensive. 

  
Eventually, I told him I believed him because I just found that easier in the moment instead of repeating myself over and over again. Ever since I found the messages this has been eating me alive because my intuition tells me that there is more to the story than he is letting on. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you for listening to a stranger! <3

ANSWER: I think you know the answer here. Do you really need strangers to weigh in when you:

1. Felt compelled to look through his phone. I have never felt the need to look through my husband's phone. I did once feel the need to snoop through a bf phone. He was cheating. 

2. Found evidence that he deleted messages. 

3. Know he deleted those messages despite creating a convenient story to tell you if he got caught.

4. Know that at best he associates with cheaters (you are the company you keep). 

I really hope this is shitty karma farming because, really? None of this is believable and I would be insulted if someone told me this and expected me to believe it.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 33F/31M: My ex reached out after 2.5 years while in a relationship and I think he was trying to cheat with me. Why would he do this?

My ex and I were together for almost 5 years, but the relationship was very toxic and he broke up with me almost 3 years ago. We had zero contact for about 2.5 years. Out of nowhere, he reached out through a loophole on an app where I hadn’t blocked him yet.

He sent me a long apology for how he treated me. He said he wasn’t trying to get back together, just wanted to apologize. I later found out he already had a new girlfriend when he sent this apology, and I highly doubt she knew he was messaging me.

A little after that, he messaged me late at night on the same app asking if I wanted to hook up, but he deleted the message the next morning. I ignored it, but a month later he sent the same message again, saying nobody has to know and that he wanted to hook up one last time. I was furious and told him no and to not contact me again. Then I blocked him. It also negated the apology he sent, it felt like he was trying to use me and never really cared about apologizing.

Recently, he contacted me again, this time he somehow found my phone number. He blamed the hookup messages on an ex who supposedly had access to his social media accounts, which made absolutely no sense. But the lie unintentionally confirmed something he had been with his current girlfriend the entire time he was messaging me.

I calmly told him I felt disrespected and didn’t want drama. I ended the conversation politely. He immediately got defensive and said he was blocking me, deleting my number, and wished me the best as if I was the one reaching out to him. I blocked him right after.

It honestly felt like he was trying to erase evidence of contacting me, probably because he’s still with the same girlfriend he’s been with since we broke up. I never thought he would be capable of cheating or fabricating these weird lies. I saw a side of him I never saw before, and I feel disgusted. Why would he reach out for this after years of no contact while being with a new partner? I also feel bad for his new partner, I don’t think she knows any of this.

ANSWER: You're probably only one of many women he's tried to hit up, and now you know what he was probably doing when he was in a relationship with you. His GF deserves to know.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 26F asking for input on approach to dating and friendships after dating 32M

I exited a relatively short term relationship (4.5 months) a few months ago that seemed to have quite an impact on me.

I’ve had quite the journey and have gone from being alone and friendless (especially when I was younger and still in school) to opening up, having more friends and a more balanced life as an adult.

My kind of sort of ex (it was supposed to be a casual relationship) grew up in the US and is older and someone who definitely had several other interests (more like passions because he was very knowledgeable about different things). He sparked a desire to grow in me and at times, I felt like I had more balanced, but also more bland, passionless energy compared to him.

I believe I am a very open minded individual who likes to learn new things and generally show high emotional acuity in the way I treat people. I’ve never been able to define myself based on my interests the way others do because I grew up in a different country where these things were implicitly treated as secondary. Engaging in different activities /pursuits have always been fleeting for me (I have ADHD and tend to hobby hop). I had lessons outside of school when it came to performing arts when I was younger but I moved with my family every few years. This, combined with academic pressures to excel in every endeavor, including extra curricular activities, made some of those interests not much more than checkboxes to get into a good college and appear more interesting as a person.

I have realized that people like and respect me because they perceive me as someone who is kind, respectful and empathetic. I have worked hard on my people pleasing tendencies this past year and want a better sense of self. I think my ex and some of my friends (unintentionally) sought/seek my company when they need something from me. What advice do you have as far as my approach to new relationships is concerned? I’ve actually never done this and have really only been friends with people who share my attitude towards life or just seemed nice lol. Idk if I should even care really but at times I feel taken for granted when I try to seek out companionship with the people I know and I wonder if it’s because of this. I don’t know if I am the sort of person who can spend hours doing one thing or is “passionate” about things. I love plants for example but I’m probably not going to read a book about them or start a club. And I don’t know if I’m the type that can feel that drawn to any one thing. 

Other interests for me tend to be more like optional, restorative things that I will eventually get bored of. However, I feel like I deserve to have fun, light hearted interactions with people rather than just be a source of emotional support.

TLDR: I bond and form relationships with people who seem to appreciate my ability to remain open minded, listen and respond with emotional intelligence rather than through a shared interest or activity I’m passionate about out (unlike others for eg: a friend of mine bonds with many people who love video games like she does). I don’t have deep interests as such and like to keep trying different things, but want friends /partners who respect me intellectually (I think my ex got bored of me?) and also meet my need for companionship (not just come to me when they’re struggling). I need input on if if this is something worth changing and if so, how I should go about it. I’ve felt the need to adjust and adapt to new environments my whole life and can’t work out if this approach would be better or limiting?

QUESTION: I (M18)and gf(F18) relationship is struggling

So for context me (M18) and my gf(f18) have been dating for almost 2 months. It’s been long distance as I’m in college and she’s in high school. I feel as though it’s not gonna work out because she’s never communicating her problems with me directly, she always complains to her friends and then I find out days later from her friends. She had one of her friends blow up on me because I wasn’t talking to her as much one week, and her friend said I’m a horrible person and that I’m not trying. She’s had other problems she hasn’t told me about and I’m kinda over it. I feel like this isn’t working for me anymore and I don’t know if I should end it or keep it going to see if things work out?

ANSWER: Thank you, that actually helps me feel a little bit better about it.

================================================================================

QUESTION: my bf (20m) stopped paying attention to me (19f) since we moved together. how can i fix it?

hii so ive been in a relationship for a year now but recently i couldn't get my mind off of this. we've met on a dating site 4 years ago but only started dating when he came to see me (at the time we lived in different cities). it was great at the start, we've spent 3 months constantly talking, playing together, watching movies and all that and eventually i moved in with him. i worked constantly, left before he woke up and came back at night so we didn't see each other much.....at some point it started feeling like imjustw living with a roommate. he stopped texting me and i eventually got tired of trying to initiate things, stopped talking constantly, stopped spending time together. 
since then we maybe went on 1 or 2 dates in 8 monthsh haven't watched anything or played together. everytime i try to bring up some couple activities he jokingly brushes it off.....a week ago i saw him talking to a new girl (not romantically, she has a boyfriend and i asked him about her, he didn't try to hide it at all and showed me their texts) and he spent a whole day, literally 10 hours on a dating site (its mostly used for friends but...still)

im currently not working and he fully supports me financially since my job drained the life out of me, i do everything around the house and try to be positive, but it feels worse than working now since i lost all my hobbies and can't do anything in the small city that we moved to. 

i don't know how to talk to him about it to be taken seriously and if i should move away cause even tho this lifestyle isn't the greatest, i will feel like a disappointment and feel like im gonna lose him....

(p.s. im autistic and medicated but still have severe depression and bpd which he knows about and i get quite unstable and obsessive when im  in a relationship, im also bisexual and it's my first time dating a guy as well as im his first gf) 


i still love him a lot but im tired of not even feeling like i have a boyfriend and those recent situation throw me off by a lot

# URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1p1p749/how_do_you_get_over_a_break_up_20f_and_25m/
================================================================================

QUESTION: How do you get over a break up? (20F) and (25M)

I (20F) just got broken up with a couple of hours ago. We have been a year and a half together. I've seen it coming, but it's still so painful. He (25M) told me that he fell out of love with me, that he loves me as a person but not as a partner anymore. We didn’t have a huge fight leading to this or anything, just normal things. It’s as if my brain can't comprehend that he's not my boyfriend anymore, that he doesn't love me despite everything we’ve shared together. That I can't just text or call him whenever I want just to tell him about my day anymore, because he doesn't care now that he doesn't love me.

He said that it was because we were so different, that we're going in different directions in life. How? Like, we don't like the same music or believe in the same things (I'm more of a science person while he believes in spirits and energy). He said he needs someone more "open-minded," but I honestly feel he's just not capable of accepting that I'm different. He made himself feel responsible for me (like what I eat, what I do with my life, etc.), which he admitted was wrong.
Still, we both don't want to get married or have kids, and we wanted to travel someday.

I honestly think he got so hung up on our differences that he made himself stop loving me, but I honestly don't know. It's so painful.

He was my first everything btw.

I know that I'm going to be okay, but right now my heart hurts like hell.

ANSWER: I'm sorry you're hurting right now, OP.  Breakups suck, but sometimes they are necessary.  If your BF lost his feelings over time, he did the right thing for both of you by breaking up rather than pretending  he was still all-in on the relationship.  Once your heart heals, you are in your prime dating years and you will have no trouble finding someone equally or even more special to you - although you will always be able to cherish the memories of the good times you shared with your first serious BF.

Please stop trying to analyze what went wrong.  It may not have even involved anything you did or didn't do.   All that matters is that a one-sided romance is really not a romance at all, and thinking that way will just keep you emotionally stuck in the past.  It's best to try to practice acceptance, and go no-contact with your ex so your heart will heal more quickly. I wish you well.

QUESTION: M/29 27/F

I normally do not give my heart out to others. Last October, I was finishing my second semester of nursing school, and one of my co-worker's, who I had known for 3 years, invited me over and we had sex. He was staying at his mom's house sitting, and his wife and him were separated at the time. In December, the wife found out and he came to my place. He had bought be Christmas gifts prior, and calling/texting me everyday before she found out. After she found out, he told her he wanted to be with me. (I saw the text to her). it feel very real. We were saying "I love you" and I thought he and I were in game. They have a 2 year old together. In July of this year, we had been off and on and he eventually decided to be with her, due to the child. He told me he grew up in a separated household and does not want that for his children. I am so conflicted because it was so easy for us and we did really love and care for each other. Since then, he has told me he thinks about me all the time and cares for me deeply. I don't know, I feel like an idiot for believing everything would work out but I have a little hope that he would make his way back....I think he believes that you should stay in an unhappy marriage for the child. do I wait for him or no?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend 21M barely sees me 20F. It happens maybe once every two weeks, what can I do about this?

I am a university student who is currently on break. I work part-time and I study full time as a law student. My boyfriend on the other hand works as a manger ( part time again) and only studies part-time because he says he can't juggle work and studies simultaneously. he doesn't really like studying so he never shows up to uni but does work. 

Anyway, my exams are finally over and if anyone knows law students, exam times are the worst. Naturally I did not see anyone during this period. Now I am finished and I have been wanting to hang out or spend time with my boyfriend but he is really busy all the time with either work or he's having his day off which is fine as well. I kinda act like I have accepted it but deep down a part of me feels jealous of other couples who see each other atleast once a week or are happy. I had this friend of mine literally say how impressed she is that I am so independent because I barely see him and it made me sad because obviously it's not about choice.

We have spoken about this. He just said he's insecure. A part that made me upset is him saying how it's so easy for me to make plans with my friends ( I told him about how I am planning to hang out with my friends) as he is too busy to hang out. He also mentioned he doesn't like to be the one who has all the weight when it comes to planning dates but I really didn't think he thought of it like that. He seems to hate planning dates and I think I will start doing that instead or contribute. He just seems tired about work which I understand. I just don't know what to do. 

For context, we do not live together and he doesn't own a car, or has a licence. I don't either and being a girl means I am not allowed past a certain curfew time. So it's tricky.

What can I do? Is there any advice?

ANSWER: If he wanted to see you he would. once every two weeks is basically nothing and that easy for you to make plans with friends comment is telling - yeah because they actually want to hang out with you.

QUESTION: Where Do I Draw the Line, My Wife's Faith or My Childrens Life? I 24M and my Wife 22F

This is really hard for me to write since I have no idea how I am feeling. I'm 24M and my wife is 22F. We now have some issues that have arisen, mainly on my end. Before I continue, please be open-minded when you read this.

​I married my wife when she was a Jehovah's Witness. I'll be honest, at that time I didn't even know what that was. I've heard of them, but I thought they were some kind of crazy cult people. Well, they kind of are actually, scratch that, they are.
​Anyways, I was the reason my wife got "disfellowed," which practically means kicked out. Her family cut contact with her. She was not my girlfriend yet, but we liked each other. One thing led to another: she got pregnant. By the way, she was 18, and I was 20 young, I know, stupid brain. At this time, we moved in together. Her family had no contact, and only my family was supporting her. Her family would reach out and say mean things, like I would leave her and make her a single parent.

​But time passed, and we had my daughter. A couple of months after that, my wife wanted to get married. I loved her, and I decided to pull the trigger and get married. I learned my wife was interested in getting back with her religion. Now, I'm not religious in any way.

​Obviously, I was like, "Why would you want to go back? Your family abandoned you." But she wanted contact with her family because she felt alone and hurt. I was hurt myself that she was feeling this way, but I let her join because to me, I believe you're allowed to do what you want, if you wish to be religious, then go ahead.

​We've been married for three years. I did make a rule that I didn't want my daughter practicing that religion that I wanted her to make her own choice. But my wife and her family influence it regardless of my wishes, and I've stated this multiple times.
​But this isn't the reason why I wrote this. Recently, my child had to get surgery,  just there tonsils. The doctor spoke to me and my wife about the process. Once the doctor finished, he said, "There can be bleeding, and if so, would you want to give blood?" I said yes, my wife said no. We looked at each other. The doctor said, "Do you want your daughter to die by bleeding out?" My wife's response was, "I'm a Jehovah's Witness, and I'd rather you use the four components of blood as a substitute."

​I was stunned by this, and I told the doctor if blood was needed, I'd gladly give mine. The doctor seemed confused and said, "OK," and left. Now, I knew about this already it wasn't brand new to me about blood. I brushed it off, but it hit harder when it was my own daughter, and I genuinely got scared.
​Now, this is the first time she did this, a year ago, I fractured my femur pretty bad an eight-month recovery. At the hospital, when I was taken by an ambulance, I passed out. When I woke up, I saw my wife. My doctor came by and asked me that if there was a complication with the surgery, was I okay to get blood. My wife interjected and said no on my behalf, and she said the same thing, "I'm a Jehovah's Witness." I told the doctor I wanted blood if it was possible and not to listen to my wife, and I signed off on it.

​That scared me, I could possibly die due to her beliefs being pushed onto me in the hospital, and it scared me more when it was my daughter. I don't know what to do. I truly love my wife, she's smart, funny, and beautiful, but I don't know if I can do this marriage.

​We're having another child, and I'm happy about having another baby, but I'm afraid if I leave that she will push her religious teachings on my children. My wife, her family, and friends tell my daughter, "No, birthdays are bad," "Holidays are bad," etc., and I get angry and tell them to stop. I feel so bad for my daughter and my next child to deal with this.

​My wife tells me about her life, she was raised in it, and it sounds like she was in a cage her whole life, and I don't want that for my kids. I don't think I was ready for all this in a marriage, and I know we are young, I just find this extremely hard to deal with. By the way, at this time, I'm extremely close with her family now, but they didn't like me beforehand. 

Has anyone been through this? 
does anyone know how to navigate this?

ANSWER: Being worried that your partner's beliefs are going to harm your children is 100% a valid reason to leave the relationship. And you're right to be worried about them shoving their religion down your kids' throats. Many religious people think that they're cause is of ultimate importance and therefore they can ignore any and every protest to them converting someone. It's extremely annoying. You need to get in contact with a divorce lawyer and ask them about ways you ca get custody of the kids if things go south. Once you do that, I hate that I'm about to say this, but you may need to give your wife, her family, and her friends, an ultimatum. Let your kids discover religion on their own terms, or no more access to the kids. Or in the case of your wife, divorce and you'll be fighting for custody. 

Good luck, and god speed.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife (F30) and I (M35) cannot figure out how to communicate while she is in the midst of a PTSD trigger. There a lot of nuances but the one we're stuck in is how do I tell her to back off when shes overwhelming me without 'tone policing'. Is what I'm doing tone policing?

She has complex PTSD from a series of things that happened when she was a child but also from her family who is pretty toxic. Her parents are currently going through a divorce that was long overdue from everyone who knew them and the whole situation has been incredibly exhausting and damaging to everyone involved. Her dad left the family last thanksgiving for the head cheerleader at his highschool to relive his glory days and the whole thing has been messy.

Her mom is visiting this coming week and this is a trigger for my wife. Every family vacation, every holiday we visit, sometimes even knowing one of her parents wants to make a phone call is enough to cause her a decent amount of stress. If we're visiting or they're coming here she has a hard time not being stressed out for usually at least a week. This leads to fights almost every morning where she is so irritable that anything small thing will set her off and cause her to pace around the house complaining about anything her mind can think of. She is difficult to calm down and often times her irritability leads her to making remarks about our relationship and any problems we are currently working through.

One of the biggest problems we have is that she grew up in Texas and comes from a culturally mixed background. Her parents taught her to voice her discomfort as loudly and boisterously as she needs to. Growing up she told me this lead to fights that would last several days but her and her siblings would eventually work things out (this sounds insane to me and from my perspective seems to have caused a lot of damage and arrested development but she swears it worked when they were growing up). I grew up amish adjacent in central PA and come from a background that is emotionally stunted. Even my grandparents don't say "I love you" back when I say it to when I leave their house. The combination of the two communication styles is oil and water.

With her mom visiting this week the fights have been as I expected. I even told her last week after we had gotten into a fight that I suspected she was so irritable because her mom was visiting and that as the day got closer it she would only get more stressed and more aggressive. We are on day 4 of fighting every morning. Her mom arrives Saturday.

My big question with all of this background is: 'when she barks at me and has a hard time communicating what she's going through in a way where I feel safe and respected is it tone policing to tell her I need her to back off her tone and volume?'

I make sure to reinforce that her emotions are valid and that I'm not disagreeing with anything she says. I make sure to reinforce that I would like to hear what she is saying. I simply cannot handle the intensity of her communication while she is in the midst of a PTSD trigger. I grew up with an abusive parent myself and I get triggered when I am yelled at by a loved one so I can't handle the several hours that it takes for her to reach homeostasis.

Am I being a dick by telling her I cannot handle her tone? Do I have a right to tell her that even though I would like to hear what she is saying, I cannot handle the way she is currently communicating?

ANSWER: People need to stop acting like things like tone policing or being selfish are always bad thing. I would be asking her why her trauma and triggers are important and should be catered to but yours shouldn’t? Because if my partner said I was triggering their PTSD by yelling and being emotionally disregulated my first reaction would be “oh shit, I don’t want to do that to the person I love” and book a therapy appointment to better manage my emotions. Not to tell them to stop tone policing me.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Healthy Relationship after Cheating? (25F/25M)

Can relationships recover after cheating? 

My ex and I (25F/25M) broke up after 8 months because of emotional cheating although I believe there was nothing physical. Up until that moment, things were perfect and we were extremely compatible in every other way. He was my best friend and it felt like a once in a lifetime connection. We're no contact right now because the discovery was so recent and painful, but I keep wondering if I should try to make this work. 

How do you rebuild trust after something like this? Can people truly change if they take accountability, go to therapy, try couples counseling, etc.? 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How long did it take and how has that worked out for you?

ANSWER: Don’t do it. I know it’s tempting and it hurts to think about what ifs and an idealized version of the future, but it’s a complete waste of time, trust me.

Yes, you can try to work it out. It’s a challenging road and you’ll suffer with very little payoff. There will be really good days, but it will never be enough to undo a betrayal. Once trust is broken, it takes a lot of effort to rebuild it. You might be so hypervigilant and distrustful that you’ll end up breaking up anyway down the line. He cheated and got away once, so he’s likely to do it again.

As for my own experience, it’s similar to your situation in that I’ve never been outright physically cheated on in past relationships, but there were boundary issues that resulted in me not trusting my partner.

My most recent ex straight up lied to me, told me he didn’t have history with a “friend” of his that I met and had given me weirdly aggressive vibes. He assured me that it was nothing and gaslit me into thinking I was misjudging the situation. But when I pressed him, he admitted that they dated and had sex before he met me.

It felt like emotional cheating to me when he actively deceived me and made me feel crazy about him spending time with this woman. He apologized, I forgave him. He went through the motions, but he never truly took responsibility. We went to counseling (I paid for it). We bought the books, did all the exercises and trust rebuilding. He promised me he’d never lie to me again, and I believed him. And yeah, he kept his promise for a long time, didn’t talk to her anymore, etc. He was an amazing boyfriend who showered me with love and gifts and was my cheerleader for all my goals and ambitions. He genuinely wanted the best for me and told me I was the only one for him.

But after months of that, I still didn’t trust him deep down. I stayed with him for three and a half years when I could have left him right after I discovered the lie only a year into dating. I would have been free of that BS much sooner, but I refused to let go and felt that he truly changed.

A year and a half after the lie incident, I snooped on his computer because of a bad gut feeling happening (I’m shitty for the breach of privacy, I know). I ended up finding that the friend sent him nudes and a link to her OnlyFans six months into us officially dating. He never told me about it, and didn’t delete the pictures either. It was old news, but it made me look into other messages.

He was also spending a lot of time and effort to get close to his coworker. He’d regularly buy her lunch and eat together. He planned her an elaborate birthday celebration outside of work and would Instagram DM her randomly complimenting or telling her how much brighter his day is when he gets to see her at their workplace.

He never did anything outright damning, but I monitored his messages for months. Each time I snooped, I felt bad but justified when I saw he was clearly pushing what was appropriate. He said he felt like he wanted to be a big brother and take care of her. She was 18, he was 43. Creepy.

He broke up with me after I insinuated that if he wasn’t lying to me, he was lying to himself about his intentions with his coworker. He said I was being insecure, and I totally was for staying with him and tolerating this bad behavior.

Yeahhh. Respect yourself. Don’t do what I did which was delude myself into thinking he was the one. My ex felt like he was my best friend, we had so much in common, and I felt genuinely happy when things were good. He was my person and I thought I’d spend the rest of my life with him. But I’m now glad I didn’t. Liars will lie, cheaters will cheat.

I’m engaged now with a completely loyal, loving guy I trust completely. Even my historically crazy jealous ass never feels insecure with my fiancé, so I 100% believe the right partner will always make you feel completely safe and reassured to the point no doubt comes up in your mind at all. I mean, it does for sure take work on your part to heal and become secure without using your partner as a crutch. But a trustworthy person makes it infinitely easier to do that.

You are so young, find someone new who won’t even think about cheating.

That once in a lifetime connection with your ex should be just that. Once. Never let it happen to you again.

Good luck, OP. Wishing you all the best.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (F21) explain to my mom (F46) that it isn't about the money?

Hello! Today's subjects are Me F21, my sister F18, my brother M16, and my mom F46.

Some backstory: My mom homeschooled me (until 8th grade) and my siblings. My sister has since graduated. Ever since my brother has been young, he's been difficult with school. He's a good kid, but he can be hard sometimes. My mom would often let him skip school any time he felt sick (at his word). My sister on the other hand, would have to fight tooth and nail for the same, even of she was genuinely sick. I won't go into too much detail for the sake of brevity, but this extrenuated to other things. 

Most recently, my mother bought a car ($1000) and a set of car repair tools ($1000) for my brother. This was after she said she could barely afford my sister's birthday gift (a piercing, $70)

I understand that obviously, these things are gifts. My siblings aren't owed any of that stuff. But recently my sister has expressed feeling as though she always comes second place to my brother. That he gets whatever he wants, but she has to fight for the bare minimum. 

For Christmas, she asked for a switch (the older one) I let my mom know what she wanted. My mom then told me she wasn't going to spend thar much on her, and in the same breath mentioned buying my brother an electric ratchet set (one of those fancy complete sets) for christmas. 

I tried explaining to her that it seemed unfair, since she had also bought $2000 dollars worth of things for my brother, (not his birthday or anything) and that she may be hurting my sisters feelings.

This devolved into an argument where my mother was defensive, and then went to argue with my sister. 

How can I explain to her that this isn't about the dollar sign? It's about her feeling forgotten, or "second to". 

I decided to buy her the switch, and my brother offered to buy her a case (he doesn't make a ton of money right now, but it's the thought that counts.)

Advice is appreciated. Thanks.

ANSWER: Your mother overtly favours your brother, she doesn’t even try to hide it. You’re probably not going to be able to make her change so best you can do is lower your expectations of her to zero. She doesn’t have your back or your sisters, just your brother.

================================================================================

QUESTION: The guy (M28) I’m (F27) becoming serious with has been seeing his ex while seeing me

 I’m having trouble comprehending what to do in this situation. I have been seeing this guy for the past few months. He’s been taking me on dates, I’ve been taking him out, we have been spending a lot of time together, getting serious to the point of talking ab future plans, talking ab love, texting daily, calling, etc. 

 A couple of weeks ago, he decided to tell me that his ex has been struggling mentally and that he is a support system for her. I asked when they broke up, and he told then that it was at least six months ago. I told him I’m not comfortable with him being a support system for her, and that it still seems a bit fresh. I left the decision up to him, but a few days later he told me he had blocked her.

 So, jump to a few nights ago. He got into bed with me and opened his phone to old messages with said ex. I was kinda like, cmon man. He said he needed a reminder of how bad it was because she’s been spam calling him lately. ???

 I straight up began questioning him pretty much, and somehow it came out that while taking me out on dates, he had also been having sex with her. He wasn’t clear on exactly how long, he said he can’t remember. Bullshit btw however, he said that he had went to see her a few days before blocking her. He said there was no sex involved and it was just speaking. Lol and then you wonder why she might be struggling mentally. :|

 He started crying and telling me that he isn’t this type of person. He acknowledged that he made a mistake and that he is serious about where we are heading. I’m just not sure if I can really fully trust him at this point, honestly. I don’t believe that he didn’t do more than speak literally 2 or 3 days before I showed up again. So sickening. 

 Really, I have been feeling conflicted. It’s early with us, and we haven’t really talked or established a label on our relationship. Writing and reading this back now, it seems pretty bad and I should run. It just sucks, because I really like him. At the same time, this seems like an awful foundation to start with. Idk, wondering what some of you would do in this situation, especially if you really like the person? I really don’t wanna call it quits, but I know I’m gonna have a hard time trusting him after this. How could I move forward? Like are there some boundaries I can set moving forward, or really is this doomed atp. Spiralling a bit, sorry if this is incomprehensible.

ANSWER: Honestly... I don't know why you haven't yet walked away. How can you be with someone who uses you like a second option while still clinging to his ex?

He does not love you. He loves his ex.

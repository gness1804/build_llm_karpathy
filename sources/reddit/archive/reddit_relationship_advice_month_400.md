QUESTION: I (30F) Found my husband's (29M) second phone.

I (30F) found my husband's (29M) second phone yesterday and I am in shambles. We have been together for almost 12 years, married for almost 10. I am 7 moths postpartum and have been struggling with postpartum depression and anxiety since I had my wonderful baby boy in March. I see my therapist weekly and a psychiatrist often for medications. It hasn't been an easy battle and I know its taken a toll on my little family, but I've been trying and was getting better. My husband (let's call him Jax) has been very supportive but his work schedule moved him to the night shift so we barely see each other except for a few hours on the weekends. He tends to keep the same sleep schedule those days so I end up sleeping on the couch while he stays awake in the living room just to be close because I miss him. Well, fast forward to yesterday. I was looking for his car keys to move the car and I was looking in his work bag when I found his old phone. I immediately felt my stomach drop because I thought he got rid of it and it was fully charged so it had been used recently. I went to wake him up and had him unlock it for me. He swore there was nothing on it and he was just trying to download pictures off of it to his laptop. He lied. There was a second reddit and email account on there that had messages, posts, and comments all being sexual and flirting with other women. I messed up and locked the phone when he tried to take it so I dont know the PIN to get back into it to take screenshots and he refuses tk give it to me. When I ran out of the room he deleted the reddit account and the email account. I am sick to my stomach. I dont know where to go from here. I quit my job because he wanted me to be a stay at home mom. I'm a homebody with pretty much no friends. And to make things harder his family lives with us. Where do I go from here?

UPDATE: He came clean and told me he was sexting 10 different people over the span of a month or two. He also admitted to doing this four years ago. All through his primary and secondary reddit account. He said he wants to fix this and will do whatever it takes to do so. I'm at such a loss. I am broken. I told his mother and she is on my side and said it is my choice on what happens next and not his. Thank you for all of your kind words of advice. I have requested to see my therapist twice this week and going forward until I can come up for air. I am still trying to figure out what is best for me and my baby boy. I have been applying to jobs all day as well to establish my independence again.

ANSWER: At this point you don’t need to gather the evidence the damage has been done. Don’t stress getting the “proof” back because he will have permanently deleted by this time.  Now, it’s up to you with how you’d like to proceed, but he has shown you that he’s comfortable being sneaky and deceitful. The only reason you found out is because you found the phone (not like he’s tell you anyway bc he knows it’s weird and wrong to have that device)

The best thing you can do now is take some time away and clear your mind to make an informed and clear decision.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend suddenly insisted on using protection and I don’t understand why (26F/39M)

I need mature perspective on something that happened. My boyfriend has always hated condoms. We have never really used them, except our very first time together when he wore one for about two minutes and we both agreed to take it off. Since then, we’ve always had sex without one.

Yesterday, out of nowhere, he insisted on wearing a condom and was very serious about it. When I tried to take it off because we both prefer without, he literally held my hand to stop me. That has never happened before.

When I asked why, he said he didn’t want to get me pregnant because he’s about to leave the city for six months for a short-term contract. That surprised me because he knows my cycle very well and I wasn’t fertile at all. We've also had sex on peak fertility days in the past with no protection and he has always talked about wanting a baby someday. I’ve told him I wanted to give him one, too.

For context, he was married for 15 years and his ex-wife never had a pregnancy scare. So seeing him suddenly become strict about condoms just feels strange and very sudden. And when I asked him three times why, and he redirected the conversation instead of explaining. 

On top of that, he asked me to wait for him during these six months. So now my mind is going in circles. I don’t want to accuse him, but I keep wondering:

Is he suddenly unsure about our future and doesn’t know how to say it?  
Did something happen or did he get involved with someone else?  
Could he be worried about something health-related and doesn't want to talk about it?  
Did he change his mind about wanting a child with me?

These are uncomfortable questions and I don’t want to sound like I don’t trust him, but this was such an abrupt shift that I don’t know what to think. I want to approach this like an adult and communicate clearly.

Could this be a red flag? And how do I bring this up in a calm, non-accusatory way while still getting clarity?Or maybe I am not understanding his "vision"?

ANSWER: I agree. I think it's likely std related.  If not that, it could be cheating related, or both. 

My.best guesses are:

1) He's been cheating with someone else and having unprotected sex. The AP recently notified him that they have an STD? 

2)He's cheating, and his AP notified him that she's pregnant?  

3) He currently has active herpes blisters.  He may have known all along, but since there wasn't an outbreak, he never told OP?

4) He's planning on breaking up with OP so he can screw around while he's away and really doesn't want to risk getting her pregnant?

Whatever the reason, I hope Op comes back and lets us know.

================================================================================

QUESTION: [FINAL UPDATE] My (M28) Fiancée (F28) randomly ended our relationship, is this abuse?

I tried to post this a week or so ago, and it didn’t go through because how close the posts were, but I knew there were a few people who wanted updates.

Fingers crossed this time it’s works.

First and foremost, thanks to everyone who messaged me offering advice and resources. It made a huge difference.

I have a lot to update on, but I’ll try to keep it short.

Once I was out, the pattern of abuse became more evident. The emotional rollercoaster she always had me on was one I didn’t really realize I got on, until I finally got off. I went into the apartment with my sister (F36) while my ex (F28) was at work to clear out all my stuff. I was initially going to go with my brother (M34), but in the calls to my mother (between 5-20 a night on weekends) she sometimes physically threatened people, and my sister wanted to be there in case she did get physical, since my brother and I wouldn’t be able to do much if she did. Obviously, neither of us would hit her or anything, so this made the most sense. (The police also didn’t seem to want to accompany us) We cleared the bulk of my stuff out but unfortunately, she did come home early, because… well, that’s been my luck lately.

She yelled a bunch, which we ignored but unfortunately, my sister spoke to her before we left because a bunch of my stuff was missing. I didn’t care about a lot of it at this point, but my sister was upset the PS5 was missing, so she told her she didn’t know where she put it, but she needed to get it because she wasn’t leaving without it. Tensions were obviously high, as my sister is currently living with my mom taking care of her, so she’s been present for the nonstop calls on the weekends. When my sister kept pressing her about it and ignoring everything else she was saying, my ex pick up a picture frame and threw it at me “for bringing her here”. At this point, everything boiled over.

My sister got between us and when she slapped my sister, a fight ensued. Long story short, police arrived, and my sister told them she wanted to file another report, which made my ex surrender the PS5 and admit she had thrown a bunch away.

Because of all this, the landlord was made aware, and I’ve  been taken off the lease.

A few days after, her mother called me. She basically wanted me to reconsider the reports filed because she was worried my ex would have charges that would follow her around and she didn’t think it was fair after I “called off the wedding and abandoned her”. I told her that she needed to have a conversation with my ex about the lies she was telling and her harassing my mother before I hung up.

Thats the long and short of it. Hopefully, I‘m done now and there won’t be any more updates. Thanks for listening to me and helping me through all this.

I don’t know what came from that conversation, but her mother did send mine flowers, so I’m guessing at least some truth came out.

Anyway, I’m hoping to put all this behind me at this point. Now that I’m done with the apartment headache, I am going to grief counselling with my family and working on starting over.

ANSWER: Do not drop the charges. Assuming that you are in the US (was just told that you are in Ontario, and looked and they do similar things with different titles) and she has no previous record, they are probably going to put her on probation and require her to do some type of anger management, community service, and pay you back for what she took from you. They will then give her as set amount of time where if she behaves (maybe a couple of years), they will clear her record. This does not always happen, but in a case like hers would happen almost all of the time.

Glad that her breaking up with you helped you get out of this relationship, and that she has now been held accountable for what she did.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Me(38F) husband (39M) marriage of 18 years. Should he have a girlfriend on the side?

This is pure insanity. We have 3 kids together 3, 4 and 17 yr old. I am constantly busy with the kids all day doing the whole thing. My 4 yr old and 17 yr old are both in school. I stay home with my 3 yr old during the day. My husband works 7-4 every m-f. Some days he gets off at 4 but doesn't make it home until 5 or 6 pm for various reasons. We haven't had sex or any form of sexual release in about 2 months. Our schedule doesn't always line up because I work from 7pm -12am Sunday -thursday. I get 5 hours of sleeping I'm constantly going all day with my 3 yr old. My 17 yr old is a senior she's got all kinds stuff going on. My husband is upset and thinks this is a normal thing to ask if his wife isn't giving it to him for him to seek it other places. He seems to think if he pays for everything he is owed this one small act that shows him I love him. I feel as though this is ridiculous I'm exhausted by the end of the week. He doesn't really help with the kids. He's physically present with us and the kids just not active with us whenever the kids want to play or interact with their father, there's always an excuse as to why he needs to excuse his from the situation after about 5-10 minutes. It's too loud he can't handle the kids all over him, he has to think about paying bills. I feel like I'm just his lil doll for his pleasure that he can use whenever he feels the desire and I'm left all alone and used. I've expressed these emotions and feels to him he laughs it off as to "those are silly". He will show no interest in me until the kids are down for the night and it's "his" time. I emailed a divorce attorney and I'm through with this disrespect. Almost 20 years! maybe I should just take it and just deal with it.

ANSWER: I love how you’re stretched so thin & he’s bored. Can’t even begin to see the actual problem here. Honestly, he sounds pathetic.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (27F) broke up with my boyfriend (29M) partly because of his relationship with his sister (25F). Help me understand if I was appropriate please

I need some perspective because I’ve been feeling confused and invalidated about this for a long time.

I recently broke up with my boyfriend of almost 2 years, and one major reason was his relationship with his sister (who he lives with) and mom. I’ve always felt something was “off,” but any time I tried to bring it up, he acted like I was crazy, jealous, or just didn’t “understand their closeness.” Now that I’m out of it, I want to check if my concerns were valid or if I was truly overreacting.

Here are the behaviors that made me uncomfortable:

1. His sister acted territorial toward him, especially toward me.

She made comments that felt competitive or protective in a weird way. Examples:
	•	When she showed me a picture of a guy she was talking to, I said, “Oh he’s cute!” and she immediately responded with something implying I needed to “respect” her brother  even though I wasn’t talking about him at all.
	•	Another time when we were talking about men in general, I said some guys “don’t know what they’re doing in bed,” and she instantly said, “Are you talking bad about my brother?” in a defensive tone. (I only said that in response to a comment she made. She is always for some reason talking about sex. I never start talking about that to other people)

She always gave me the feeling that she was ready to defend him from me even when I wasn’t attacking him.

The sister was overly concerned about the brothers’ girlfriends, going as far as going to a witch to see if a girl had good intentions with her brother, she’d verbally fight them, & stuff

In front of my ex she would as weird questions such as “have you had other boyfriend’s in the past? why did you break up?” and make comments trying to make me look bad in front of her family.


2. She constantly called him for attention even when he was with me.

If he came to see me, she would call him:
	•	to show him where she was
	•	to show him who she was with
	•	to gossip
	•	to involve him in her drama
	•	to FaceTime him into hangouts with her friends

It often felt like she needed his attention or validation in a way that wasn’t normal sibling check-ins.

I always felt she would compare herself to me. I am thin and she is not and she would randomly start talking about how she used to be thin like me in the past and would make suggestions on how i can be prettier like “i just bought these fake lashes that would look good on you too” even though I never wear fake lashes. We have very different styles. We also had different taste in music and preferences like dancing etc & my boyfriend would always push for me to be more like his sisters in these areas. Or he would see a sister wearing something and moments later would suggest I do the same. He’d also be like “ do you wear dresses?” my mom likes it when girls wear dresses. & would ask me to be more affectionate with his family like hugging every time i saw them (which I already greeted the parents that way) & wanted me to be more extroverted like them (I lean more introvert). I feel like he wanted me to be just like them.

If I asked him to come to a room with me to help me with something, she’d call him minutes later to pull him back to her.

It started to feel like I was competing for basic emotional space.

3. She and the family made sexual or inappropriate comments about him.

I would find this weird because my family doesn’t really joke about sex and I dont talk about my sexual experiences with my brother.

His sister would:
	•	comment on his butt and slap it 
	•	say stuff like “if he wasn’t my brother, I’d date him”
	•	make sexual jokes around him
	•	talk about sex openly and directly with him

The whole family had this boundary-less dynamic I just couldn’t understand. It didn’t feel like normal teasing or sibling joking  it felt like they didn’t understand where the lines are.

4. He minimized everything, even when it clearly made me uncomfortable.

Any time I brought up my concerns, he’d say things like:
	•	“She didn’t mean it like that.”
	•	“You’re overthinking.”
	•	“You’re being weird.”
	•	“She’s just close to me.”
	•	“That’s just how we talk.”

He never acknowledged how inappropriate some of the interactions were. Instead, he made me feel like I was the one with the problem.

5. I felt constant pressure to be accepted by his family.

He told me repeatedly:
	•	“They don’t know you.”
	•	“You should try harder.”
	•	“My family’s opinion matters.”
	•	“I want you to be close with them.”

His mom and sister were disrespectful and dramatic with other partners in the family too. With most recently making his older brother’s new wife cry in a family reunion. The mom calls me to gossip and talk bad about her but i dont engage. They’ve had problems with nearly every girlfriend his siblings have brought home, and I honestly didn’t want to be the next target. I did try to befriend the sisters in the beginning before I noticed how toxic they were & I was always respectful to everyone. I’d even buy them Christmas and bday gifts. 

But he acted like it was my responsibility to win them over not his responsibility to protect me or create boundaries.

6. I didn’t want to marry into a family dynamic that felt intrusive and boundaryless.

When I finally said this out loud that I didn’t want to marry into this dynamic and that I found his relationship with his sister weird he didn’t believe me. He thinks their closeness is normal and that I’m misinterpreting everything. The reason I’m posting is because I feel guilt or something feeling weirded out about their relationship since they’re siblings but it just feels off to me.I dont know if I am wrong or TA for telling him he has a weird relationship with his sister and that I dont want to marry into that.

edit to add more context

ANSWER: Bf to OP: You don't “understand \[our\] closeness.”

Op to Bf: "You're right, I don't. This doesn't work for me. Cheers."

The End.

If something doesn't sit with you, it doesn't. You can break up for any reason. It takes two people to be together and one to leave, and the only reason needed is 'This is not making me happy anymore.'

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend (25M) finished inside me (22F) without consent for the 4th time and lied about it. Am I going too far by ending the relationship?

We live together, have traveled the world together, and genuinely get along so well. We’re each other’s best friends. But this is now the fourth time my boyfriend has finished inside me without my consent.

The third time it happened, I told him very clearly that it was the last time I was going to tolerate it. He was apologetic and said, “it just felt so good, I couldn’t stop,” but he promised me it wouldn’t happen again.

Last night, it happened again. I asked if he finished on himself and he kept insisting: “I don’t see anything.” “I did, just a little.” “No, I didn’t finish inside you, I finished on myself, you just can’t tell.”

But I could obviously feel that he did, and there was a lot inside me.

I don’t know what to do. I told him the third time was the last time, and months later it still happened again. Half of me feels like I’m overreacting or giving up on our relationship, and the other half feels like this is a major boundary and consent issue that he keeps ignoring.

Yes, I’m on birth control. He keeps saying he’ll wear a condom from now on. 

I’m really torn. Is this something I should end the relationship over?

ANSWER: Right!? Like, girl. He’s lied to you and crossed your sexual boundaries three times already… And you stick around to let him do it for the fourth time??? What’s it gonna take? A baby?? The fuck?

OP, leave this man. He has no respect for you and he’s a liar. Plain and simple.

ETA: one more thing. what’s gonna happen one day when you ask him to stop because it hurts? Because you don’t feel well? For any reason at all? He obviously has no self-control. I’m sorry, but I full heartedly believe he would just ignore you and keep going. Which would 100% be rape. And yes, I believe he would be capable of that. 

“Oh but baby, it just felt so good. I couldn’t stop myself.” 

Pshh… GTFO of here with that bullshit.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My fiancé implied I was hiding something and then gave me an ultimatum when I asked for space. We’re supposed to get married in 8 months. I don’t know what to do? (32F, 30M)

I (32F) just came back from a 2-week work trip. My fiancé (30M) and I are supposed to get married in 8 months. Something happened two nights ago that shook something in me, and I don’t know how to move forward.

I was finishing work and my manager asked if I wanted to grab a drink. I texted my fiancé and told him I was heading out with her, but my phone was still in “work mode,” so I didn’t see his messages come in.

He called me about an hour later. I didn’t want to answer in front of my manager in the middle of a conversation, so I declined the call with the auto-text “I’ll call you back later.” He immediately called again within seconds.

When I answered, he sounded upset and started with, “Why are you cancelling my call? What is this new behavior?” The accusatory tone surprised me, and honestly, embarrassed me, because my manager could hear.

I stepped outside and explained:

1. I wasn’t ignoring him
2. I was literally with my female manager and he knows about her.
3. He already knew I was going for drinks
4. And I’ve declined his calls before when I’m talking to my mom

Instead of calming down, he made a comment about how it seemed like I didn’t want him to see me.

That hit me hard. Because to me, that implied that he thought I was hiding something.

For context: We’ve been together for more than 5 years. I have never given him any reason to distrust me. Both of our locations are shared. If he was worried, he could’ve checked. But instead, it felt like he jumped straight to suspicion.

I told him that comment hurt me. He apologized for his tone, but refused to acknowledge the implication. When I asked him directly what made him think I didn’t want him to see me, he kept saying he “doesn’t know.”

I asked for some space to process because I didn’t want to escalate the fight. And his response was:

“If you need space for “small things” like this, then how will you handle real problems in marriage? If you don’t give me an answer soon, I’ll tell my parents to cancel the wedding arrangements.”

It felt like an ultimatum instead of a conversation. I told him I won’t make any decision while I’m feeling pressured, and that we can talk when we’re both calm.

We tried talking on the phone later, but it ended with me crying and him hanging up on me.

Since then, no calls, no texts and he posted a story drinking alone in a bar.

And I don’t know how to read anything anymore BUT I do know this: the trust issue he projected onto me did not come from anything I did.

And I’m scared that if it surfaced now, it will surface again during marriage, during bigger conflicts, during harder times.

So I’m here asking strangers because I’m too emotionally flooded to trust my own judgment:

Is this something that can be worked through with emotional maturity and communication? Or is this showing me that we are not ready for marriage?

ANSWER: I would meet up with him in public and point blank ask him what has he done when you were gone for the 2 weeks to project so hard on you and demand to see his phone. Normally when someone comes up like that with accusations out of nowhere they are cheating

QUESTION: UPDATE: My (30M) best man (31M) stole my wife (30F) and I think he’s back to take my girlfriend (29F)

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/1od1thu/my\_30m\_best\_man\_31m\_stole\_my\_wife\_30f\_and\_i\_think/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1od1thu/my_30m_best_man_31m_stole_my_wife_30f_and_i_think/)

Didn't expect to get as many replies as I did, so I figured I'd reply to all here rather than individually. 

I've read all the comments, and first of all I'd like to thank all those people that gave me genuine good advice. Secondly there seems to be a few things I need to clear up; 

 I am from the UK, when I refer to 'camp' I literally just mean base. I don't HAVE to stay there for the whole week, but it is a 90 minute - 2 hour drive back home (I know that doesn't seem far to you Americans as you have to drive two hours to get off your streets, but it's long for me). 
 Nobody remained friends with Judas, I did put that in the original post, but a lot of people skimmed over it. Him, Leah, and Andrew all left the group around the time Judas and Leah's relationship was public knowledge.
 When I wanted to spend time with the friend group, Leah would've been there too, so I wasn't completely neglecting her.
 For those asking, Judas kept his teeth because I literally have not seen him even once since I found out.
 Another point a few skipped over, Judas and Andrew are cousins, so they were always going to remain friendly, and take each others sides.
 I didn't immediately demand to see her phone to check the FaceTime because I panicked, I went into fight or flight and clearly chose flight, not really what you want from a man supposed to defend your country but hey. 
 No, I don't know who Kel Knight is.

Anyway, back to it; After leaving and going to my mums, Phoebe had been messaging/trying to call, basically just asking to explain herself, I'd said I'd be back later. After posting on here and reading/replying for a while I managed to get some sleep, I'd been up all night. 

First thing I did when I woke up was call Phoebe's brother, explained to him my plan to propose (pureply so he could be the one to break that to her when I chose to leave her). I also asked if he had been in contact with her recently, he said no. The FaceTime can't have been him then.

I get back home, ready with everything I need to say, ready to call Phoebe out on her bullshit, but before I can speak she hands me her phone, tells me I can look through, that she's deleted nothing, and that she'd like to talk and explain rather than shout and argue. 

There's nothing in the FaceTime call logs, but in her regular call logs there's a Snapchat video call from Judas. I was kind of relieved that I wasn't just being a paranoid mess. But obviously my heart sank. She said that Snapchat was the only place she could find him because he was in her blocked list, so she'd just unblocked him. Sounds to me like Phoebe was the one that had gone looking to contact Judas.

I read through a bunch of the saved messages on there, to be fair it was mostly just boring chit chat and talking about musicals. Stopped reading when I got to a message from Phoebe to Judas saying 'I miss you'. Clicked on his profile to delete and block him for her, and saw at the bottom of that page when they became friends on there, it was dated just a week before. So at least they haven't been talking again for very long I guess. What also caught my eye, was in the saved pictures, there was a picture of her feet. Phoebe claims that's from a long long time ago, apparently Snapchat still saves all the previously saved pictures when you unblock someone. Does anyone know if that's actually true? I'm not too familiar with it. Either way, I deleted and blocked him for her.

She then explained that she only readded Judas because she was always feeling lonely with me away 4 nights a week, and she'd just needed a friend. I don't know why our current friends weren't good enough for that, but whatever. She was making all the same complaints my ex wife had been making before we separated. 

I've told her for this to work she needs to keep Judas out of our lives. I've told her I'll look for work outside of the army and leave. I'm a mechanic there so I assume I can find work in a garage or something easy enough. We spent the week together and it was fine.

I'm now currently back at base, and I'm deciding on if I follow through on that promise to leave and look for work elsewhere, or if I completely jump ship and literally just move elsewhere in the country, probably still look for work as a mechanic somewhere too, start brand new, and not have my career keep costing me relationships.

  
TLDR; Phoebe had started speaking to Judas again because she was lonely, I'm either going to leave the army and stay with her. Or I'm going to move cities and cut all ties with everyone, and start again, I'm still figuring it out. I think I've lost a lot of trust in her.

Thanks for reading, thanks for the advice. Any further advice is always appreciated.

ANSWER: Speaking to the dude who took up with your wife because she was 'lonely' and has no one else to talk to? This is....very naive.

Link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/S8DnCLF7l6

I debated posting an update, because now that everything is resolved I feel kind of silly about posting in the first place, but maybe this can find someone in a similar situation and help.


I should add that I am an over thinker and anxious person, and this is probably why I got here in the first place. After 8+ years of relationship, I started doubting our future only because of the lack of initiative on his part, and it's like all the algorithms decided to feed these feelings with similar stories that didn't end well. So I started over thinking everything, and basically ignored all the signs that we were doing great, like his constant reassurance that he loved me and was happy with me, when he would look me with mesmerized eyes while just going about our daily life. I felt so loved and cared for, but the lack os a proposal had to mean something was wrong, right?


A week before our big trip, while introducing the topic of marriage, trying to start a conversation like I was advised here, he was really dismissive, trying to change subject, and that sent me spiraling down on anxious thoughts. When he realized that hurt me, he immediately back tracked, started apologizing and said that he was only avoiding the subject because he had something planned and wanted it to be a surprise. 


When asked on other occasions, months before, he had confirmed his intentions of marrying me one day, but this time was different. It was enough to lift any doubt I had, and I also didn't want to ruin any surprise so I dropped the subject.


Then, as expected, during our trip, in a beautiful place, doing what we always loved doing together these past 8 years, he proposed! It was one of those moments that I felt really seen, like everything was thought out to make me happy, without me having to ask for it. He even managed to record it in the most unsuspicious way, so I'll always have something to remember it.


So this uptade is to say that every relationship is different and every life has a different timeline. There isn't any amount of years that automatically tells you the other person doesn't want to get married. Obviously I'm not saying to ignore any signs, but you have to look inside the relationship rather than compere to others and seek external validation. 


Even though most comments on the original post went in a different direction, I probably wouldn't have started that conversation with him when I did, and wouldn't have been so relaxed during our trip when he proposed. So I appreciate you guys for that!

ANSWER: I just read a post earlier about a guy who’d been trying to propose to his girlfriend - he kept offering to pay for her to get her nails done and stuff kept getting in the way. I felt so sorry for him because he was trying to do it exactly how she wanted and she kept accidentally sabotaging it! 🤣

As soon as you said he was dismissive before the trip I knew what he was planning. I’m glad it all worked out for you. 🫶 Congratulations 🥂

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (30F) am planning a drastic breakup with fiance (39M)

Hi all!

This is an abridged version. 

I’ve (30F) been with my fiance (39M) for 4.5 years and the last year has been bad. We’ve lived together for around 3 years. We barely talk, he is not interested in me, we haven’t had sex this year, we don’t sleep together, etc. You get the picture. We both work full time, earn similar money, but I do 90% of the house chores. He also has quite bad anger issues that got worse in the past year - lots of yelling, accusations, etc. I stopped engaging some time ago but it makes no difference. When angry, he calls me names, say borderline threatening things, gets in my face and scream at me.

Recently I went to stay with my parents for 2 weeks and they were really worried about my state. I looked tired, depleted, grey and seemed depressed (still do). It was a wake up call being around people who care about me.

I decided to leave him. However I am afraid of his reaction, so together with my parents (my mums first marriage was to a similar man who was very explosive) we decided to move me out while he is away and later explain it to him via phone call or suggest a meeting in a public space.

So now this is supposed to happen this weekend. I am battling a lot of guilt, but I know this is the right thing (to preface your questions, we tried couples therapy, I tried reconnecting etc, several people suggested anger management sessions for him as well). I feel myself losing myself, I barely have time to relax between work, house chores, etc - mostly cleaning after him and being told I’m not doing anything.

The question is - how does one deal with the guilt of leaving, especially in such a cowardly way? Can I leave a letter? text him?

My heart sinks when I imagine him coming to a half empty house. But I do not see any other way.

I have my parents with me and they will stay with me in my new place for as long as needed, my friends are really supportive. I know once I’m out and I have the conversation with him, I’m going to be fine?

Thanks for reading!

ANSWER: I'm sorry you feel guilt about leaving in a "cowardly way," when the reality is you're doing that to ensure your safety. I think you should see a therapist to find out why you don't value yourself, learn why you put up with this for so long, & ensure you never put up with this treatment again.

P.S. he will demand to talk to you for "closure;" that's just because he wants to manipulate you into getting back together with him, because he will miss his maid. Don't fall for that, or any promises to change. He has shown you who he is.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife [54f] and I [56m] argue about this, and I would appreciate your insight?

Which direction do you think the TP roll should face? I was raised to have the paper cascade forward, like a waterfall to make it easy to grab. My wife doesn't like to see the ragged end. So, she prefers to load the roll "backwards!" She stayed in some fancy hotel in London that had backward rolls, and that's how she justifies her obviously misguided opinion.

I looked up the US patent license for "rolled toilet tissue." The inventor's drawing of the TP roll shows it facing forward with 2 squares hanging down for easy access. 

We don't disagree about much, but this has been a running battle for 26yrs! I would like to settle this and flush our troubles down the drain. Can ya help a brother out?!?

PSA: To the spider ladies, my wife spoke with her coworker at the museum who works with spiders. She said spiders are more likely to be on the floor than behind the waterfall on the tp roll. They're hunting, if they're out. Nothing to eat on the roll...you're safe!

FINAL FINAL: There were a dozen or so recommendations to get a bidet...some of whom thought they deserved mention. While this was a TP question, I did include the divorcemongres. So, 13ppl think tp is generally stupid and prefer a mini butt shower...because that's what smarties do. K? I think that's everyone! Except the lady who uses a "butt knife." I almost Googled it, but it could fuck up my algorithm. 

FINAL EDIT: we have a clear preference for the waterfall, P over q, bangs over mullet in regard to the tissue issue! 84% of commenters prefer forward. 3% hold no preference. 10% have cats. 2 people are backwards to rebel against societal norms. 4 people are backwards because spiders live behind the waterfall. A full 3% of commenters skipped the tissue issue and prefer divorce.

My wife decided to switch teams a minute ago. We heard from a woman who was head of marketing for the UKs largest tp company. The company paid for a study to investigate the tissue issue. The scientists proved backward is unclean due to incidental wall contact xferring urine and feces (not you, everyone else). That convinced the wife. Yay!!!

We also heard from the inlaw of a descendant of the inventor of tp! He said the inventor had actually drawn the roll in both directions for the patent. However, everyone in the family is forward. Nope, they don't receive any money in tp royalties...that was disappointing.

Das ende.

EDIT: We don't have little kids or cats. It's possible she does this when she's angry to fugg with me...and I've been oblivious for 26yrs. It seems to happen every time she replaces a roll. I'm not THAT hard to live with. We are not adding more tp holders. We are not getting divorced over her backward ass tp hanging style. We are going to all use all bathrooms.

You cat ladies have a lot of cats. Just a reminder to spay or neuter your pets. Thank you for the cat stories! I enjoy hearing about their silly antics.

Thank you for your kind funny and serious replies. I had no idea so many people have the "tissue issue" (stole that from a reply).

ANSWER: I thought I'd give her one more chance...stupid to expect a different outcome. We've been to a counselor, who puts her rolls on correctly, but wife is adamant. The other morning she asked me to hand her a new roll, and put it on backwards RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME! I immediately left...because of the smell, but c'mon!

================================================================================

QUESTION: My 26m girlfriend 26f came home drunk and now I can't look at her the same way.

Hi everyone.

So me and my Girlfriend have been together just over 2 years now. Generally the relationship is okay, we go through periods of arguing a lot but always seem to come out the other side. I had a rough relationship with my ex (we were together for 7 years) during which she isolated me from most of my friends and would often call or facetime me randomly to make sure I was at home if she wasn't with me. This relationship has led to troubles in my new relationship, primarily if my girlfriend gets angry or really upset I'm not sure how to respond so usually just shut down until she calms down then I can talk about it. This has led to her saying she feels like we don't connect much emotionally even though I make consistent efforts to be there for her as much as possible and be open about my emotions and thoughts. I have pretty severe depression at the moment and struggle a lot with anxiety so this is hard for me but I do my best to be the best I can be for her, however admittedly I'm not always great at it. I do however show my love and affection by way of acts of service. If she wants or needs something I'll get it for her or do it for her no questions asked. This divide has led to a very inconsistent sex life. We have in the past gone more than 4 months without sex, but commonly its maybe once every month or two and even when we do have it she tends to just lay there, opting exclusively for missionary or doggy whereas I have asked on multiple occasions for her to be on top, to receive oral (She gets oral just doesn't give it back) etc. She always says no.

Now to the other night. She went out drinking with one of her girl friends at around 2pm and called me to pick her up around 11pm. I went to get her, took her friend home and then took her to McDonalds. Multiple times in the car she was telling me about all the men who tried to get with her but kept saying she didn't go with any of them because she's loyal to me. We got to McDonalds and she used to work there so recognised 2 of the workers and began talking to them through the drive thru, before asking me to park and she went inside. She was in there for about 20 minutes before coming out and starting an argument with a group of boys outside. I had to go rescue her because she was being quite aggressive and there were maybe 6-7 of the boys there. She got back in the car and again on the way home was telling me about other guys trying it on with her. We got home and she immediately went super affectionate but in a kind of aggressive way, Pushing me and biting my lip and neck very hard. I told her this hurt and to calm down with it which she did for a little while. We ended up having sex and when she drinks she finds it hard to finish so I finished first. I offered to help her with toys which she agreed but ended up falling asleep not even 20 seconds into it so I stopped, put the toy away and went to go to sleep myself. She woke up as soon as I did that and began asking for another round. This was less than 5 minutes after the first round so I was not ready and told her as much. She proceeded to touch herself and tried to put her fingers in my mouth to which I told her not to. This prompted me to get the toy back out and she decided she did not want that and wanted me instead. I still was not ready and told her that but she didn't give up and proceeded to bite me, scratch me and attempt oral on me. She was very rough and it hurt. I said ow and stop multiple times but she didn't, and she ended up climbing on top of me and engaging in the full thing. I was still not ready and told her again she needs to wait and it's not been long enough yet but she didn't listen. She was on top for a little then tried reverse cowgirl which is something I have asked her to do a few times but being as I was uncomfortable and not recharged yet she gave up almost immediately and just got off me really annoyed. I told her its just nature but she didn't respond just went to sleep pretty quickly afterwards.

I was very confused and upset at this situation so didn't sleep much the rest of the night, I actually had a cigarette which I haven't smoked in months but felt I needed it and almost cried but I'm also not quite sure why? She has been acting normally since the event and I'm not sure whether to talk to her about it or not because I'm worried if I tell her I didn't like it she'll cut off sex altogether again and it'll be months until we engage in it or she'll get mad at me and tell me I can't make up my mind or I'm trying to make her feel bad for something. But since that night I can't look at her the same way, I've felt very off emotionally, my depression is definitely getting worse and I didn't really know that I had much worse to go. I'm struggling to understand even my own thoughts on this situation and really don't know how to proceed with it.

ANSWER: Dude she sexually abused you. No amount of booze justifies it and yeah you're going to see her different than you did before. 

Her whole obsession with how she's shutting down guys left and right also seems to be saying something crummy about her, but I don't know why it's rubbing me as badly as it does. I get you've got a lot of sunk cost here, but these red flags are bad and you shouldn't ignore them.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend (29M) gave me (27F) an ultimatum: him or my dogs and I don’t know how to handle his rigidity anymore.

Hi everyone,
I’m looking for perspective because I feel completely stuck.

My boyfriend (29M) and I (27F) have been together for about 10 months, but we’ve known each other for over two years as close friends and dance partners. Our connection has always been deep. We communicate well, care for each other, and when things are good, it feels like we’re genuinely a team. But there’s one issue that keeps coming back, and it’s now become an ultimatum: my dogs.

He’s made it clear that he can’t live with them. He says he can’t stand the smell, the hair, or the idea of mess...even the possibility of something like scratches or accidents stresses him out. He also says he doesn’t want to “feel guilty” when I’m tired and need help, because he doesn’t want to go against his “principles” and help with them at all.

At first, he said he was open to trying and wanted to see how it would go. We came up with compromises or solutions like: building an outdoor space or sunroom for the dogs, keeping them mostly outside, me taking full responsibility, even having them stay with my parents part of the time. Every time, he agreed for a while, and then later, he would pull back again and say it didn’t bring him peace.

He told me he wants a “simple life,” and the thought of dogs adds stress. But the pattern goes deeper than just the dogs. Whenever something happens that makes him feel restricted or out of control, he becomes uncomfortable and distant. If plans change unexpectedly, or I ask for small favors, he gets frustrated. Even little things like wanting to stop at home before going somewhere, can make him feel “trapped.”

He admits that he feels bad when he sees me tired, because he knows helping would make things easier for me, but he “doesn’t want to do it out of principle.” He says if he does it anyway, he’ll resent it, so in his mind, it’s better to not do it at all. So he also said he knows in both cases he's feel bad. He even said something like if I broke my leg, he wouldn’t walk the dogs, because a “deal is a deal.” But he also knows it would then fall onto him and he doesn’t want that. It’s like he’s allergic to any situation that requires flexibility or emotional labor.

What hurts most is that I can see how hard he’s trying to feel in control of his life, but I wish he could see that life isn’t controllable. I think the dogs are just the biggest trigger for a deeper discomfort, they represent unpredictability, responsibility, and the need to rely on others. And instead of looking at why that scares him, he just tells himself, “I can’t do this, I don't like it.”

When we talk about it, he tells me he’s been thinking about it for weeks and can’t find peace with the idea of living with dogs for years. He says it’s not me, but that he doesn’t see how we can work long-term if our lifestyles are so different. But I’ve tried every compromise I can think of, and he refuses them all.

I love him deeply, but I feel like I’m walking on eggshells around his discomfort. I can’t express too much emotion or he shuts down. I can’t ask for help without him feeling trapped. It’s exhausting, and yet I keep trying because I can see the person he is underneath the fear. Someone who is warm, loving, and gentle when he feels safe.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t imagine giving up my dogs, but I also don’t want to lose him.
Has anyone ever been with someone like this...who’s so rigid that compromise feels impossible? Can people like that change, or am I setting myself up for years of walking on eggshells? I don't need him to do anymore work for them. I would take the responsibility, but I don't feel like I can be with someone who can't accept that and be a bit flexible and help me out as a partner when needed. Also people around have been telling me to live him because if he truly loved me he would've learned to accept it.... 

TLDR:
My boyfriend (29M) and I (27F) have been together for 10 months, but he gave me an ultimatum: him or my dogs. He says living with dogs makes him feel restricted and takes away his peace. We’ve tried coming up with compromises, but he always changes his mind and refuses to help “out of principle.” This same rigidity shows up in other areas too. He struggles whenever life feels unpredictable or out of his control. I love him, but I’m always the one adjusting, and I don’t know what to do. 

Edit for clarification (since this post blew up a bit!):

To clarify the broken leg example: I don’t mean he would literally refuse to help me. He’s a caring person, and he would help, but he’s said he wouldn’t like it because it would go against his “principles” about not wanting responsibility for the dogs. Which then he is afraid he would resent me because of it.

We’ve officially been together for about 10 months, but we were best friends and dance partners for about a year and a half before dating. There’s a lot of history, trust, and care between us which makes this situation harder. We would be seeing each other if we broke up and we'd still dance together.

I would never give up my dogs for him. And he would rather break up than have me get rid of them. I love them deeply and they are my responsibility, but I am willing to compromise and have tried to find every possible middle ground (outside space, part-time at my parents’, etc.). When I say “outside,” I don’t mean literally outdoors 100% (even though they enjoy that) we even discussed building an enclosed veranda or connected room where the dogs could stay, so they’d still be part of the home. And my parents love them as much as I do, so having them stay there occasionally wouldn’t be neglect or “dumping them.” The dogs are family dogs, so my parents are just as involved as me.

I understand how some people might see me as trying to “force solutions,” but I realize now I probably didn’t present the situation clearly enough. I’ve genuinely tried to balance everyone’s needs here.

I do realize his reactions likely come from deeper fears around losing control, being restricted, or feeling trapped. I don’t think he’s a bad person. I think he’s struggling with something bigger internally. I have probably overanalyzed it a lot since I'm an intern psychologist and working towards my master's degree in clinical psychology. I understand how my bf could seem like an asshole, but I have the tendency to look past surface behavior. But I am also aware that I am not a person to give easily, which can be good or bad. My previous relationship lasted 7 years and even when there were signs, I still was stubborn as I saw easy solutions. But I also realize that the other person needs to be willing to change or work on their issues. 

And lastly...He loves animals, just not having them himself. He’s actually great with my dogs when we’re together. He plays with them, cuddles them, and they love him too. It’s not that he dislikes them... it’s more about what they represent to him: responsibility, restriction, and less freedom. And the idea of them potentially getting in the way of him doing what he wants when he wants is the reason for his discomfort. 

Thank you all for the comments and messages. I can't reply to everyone, but I hope the edit gives some more insight.

ANSWER: > principle 

He keeps using that word.  I do not think it means what he thinks it means.  Ironically, I’m not sure it means anything to him at all, except as a convenient catch-all for “thing I don’t like and don’t want to deal with.”

> I also don’t want to lose him

Why?  Seriously, why?  You haven’t been dating a year yet, and you’re already contemplating major sacrifices to placate a guy who you yourself admit is incapable of being satisfied unless the universe is willing to arrange itself exactly according to his expectations.  You won’t even be alone if you dump him now; you’ll still have your dogs for comfort.  So how is this even a question?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I, 48m, realized I probably need to leave my marriage with my 48f wife because I have quite a strong crush on a woman (45f) who I've known for a few years. Am I an idiot? A massive jerk? Monkeybranching?

I've been in a roommate-style marriage for a decade or so, married for over 20 years. Sex once a year or so, no affection, I tried to initiate both sex and normal intimacy for most of these years but about a year ago I was just done, a 10-20% percent rate at reciprocal (non-sexual, primarily) affection means 90-80% of the time I feel rejected and my self esteem is in the fucking gutter. I don't try anymore and to be honest I'm beyond wanting to have sex with her anymore. Why haven't I left? Two kids, our finances and retirement funds are all tied up in the house we live in, and we were both born and raised in the US and now live in a foreign country. An aging relative lives in a small apartment attached to the house. I'm frankly not sure how well my wife would manage without me financially and/or emotionally speaking. I'm not particularly happy in my job but I have these 4 people who's lives would likely be worse if I changed to a more fulfilling but lower paying job, or left my wife.

About 5 years ago I worked closely and on a daily basis with a married woman who I had a lot in common with and found very attractive but that was that. It was basically just the two of us in a small room all day for a few months. As is often the case in this situation you end up taking quite a bit about your personal life and you get to know each other pretty well. I enjoyed the time I spent working with her and that was that. There was no flirting, nothing that I wouldn't have done had she been a guy or a 70 year old woman that I connected with. We still occasionally run into each other for work, and we don't work at the same company anymore but our professional lives are pretty intertwined. We'd meet up every six months or so for lunch or a drink. We talked about our respective relationships and our issues. A year or so ago she separated from her husband.

Recently we met up after work, talked a bit about some projects we were working on. In the course of the conversation she told me that she had such a crush on me when we were working on together and how could I not have noticed, etc. I had no idea. I told her that I felt the same at the time.

Since then I was basically broken. I couldn't stop thinking about her, about what could have been...We both had to travel a bit for work and vacation after this and we weren't writing back forth or anything during that time. I was aware that I was likely blowing this all out of proportion in my head, and was frankly hoping that I was because it would be easier than the alternative. Last week we met for coffee and I basically told her how I felt and how conflicted I was. She basically said she felt the same and that she felt bad for sparking this. I assured her that whatever I decided I didn't want her to feel responsible for it, if I left my marriage and she decided that she wanted nothing to do with me, that's fine.

I tried to act as normal as possible during this time, my wife and I had our usual arguments, but one relatively minuscule thing was the final straw. She wrote a grocery shopping list as she often does, and I added about 10 things to the bottom of it (I cook more than half the time, for both the family and my work lunches). She cut the grocery list in half, and said she'd only get the stuff she wrote down because the other stuff is "me" stuff. I took both grocery lists and bought everything. It struck me that our marriage is really, really bad. My wonderful 16 year old told me she basically wishes we'd split up.

I'm aware of the fact that I could have headed this off much earlier. Talking about my relationship issues with her left me open to this. And the worst thing I did was not communicate more clearly and set my boundaries earlier before my marriage deteriorated to the point that it has. I also know that I'm high on the feeling of someone actually liking me and that my judgement is clouded, and that red flags will likely be ignored and before long this woman may very well be taking shits with the door open or express a desire to collect 27 cats or tell me about her side MLM business...I

Clearly my only option is telling my wife. I have zero desire for a physical affair. The problem is, I don't want to move past this and continue with the marriage. I have absolutely zero idea how she'll react

ANSWER: Leave for you, not for an imagined relationship that may or may not happen. Figure out how to make everything work financially, but it sounds like everyone, including your kids, would be happier for you both to divorce.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (M33) new girlfriend (F26) and I had sex for the first time and now she’s “changed her mind” about us.

⬇️UPDATE⬇️

_She just texted me and wants to know if we can talk tonight, I’ll post an update tomorrow_

My (M33) new girlfriend (F26) and I had sex for the first time. We were dating for about a month, really getting along great, and sharing a lot of moments together. The timing felt right, for me, and it happened naturally. 

Last Saturday she came for dinner. We had a lovely evening, dinner, movie and she stayed the night. Shortly after the movie was done, we were both all over each other on the couch, and had sex for the first time (in the bedroom). It wasn’t a quickie by any means; I was really focused on her and took the time to make sure she really enjoyed it. To me, it was an extremely passionate and mutually enjoyed experience. 

Sunday we woke up, had a late breakfast, relaxed in the couch for a while and everything seemed fairly normal. I gave her a ride home in the afternoon but a couple hours later, she sent me a text message that said, “I’m sorry, but I think I’ve changed my mind about us and I need time to think”. I just said, “Okay, I enjoy being with you and I am open to talking about it when you’re ready.”

I decided to give her space, but it’s been three days and I have heard nothing. She hasn’t called or text since Sunday night. I was thinking of trying to call her after work, but afraid it will come across as too pushy. This happened to me once before too, so now I’m taking inventory of all the possible things that could be wrong with me, and I just can’t seem to figure out what it could be. 

Without the full context of the relationship I suppose it’s really hard to provide commentary, but everything seemed to be almost perfect and suddenly it’s not. 

What is going on here? Is this just a matter of the relationship progressing to fast and her getting scared? Or maybe she felt like she made a bad decision?

I’m curious what women out there are thinking, from the perspective of a woman.

ANSWER: I'm guessing she didn't enjoy it or maybe the sexual chemistry wasn't there. 

It could help to ask for feedback but only if you can be receptive. Sorry bro.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My husband (48m) said something to me (43m) in frustration and I can't get over it.

How do I get over what my husband said in frustration earlier this week?  

After a particularly frustrating day for him he'd come home from work early. I greeted him as I work from home. When I asked why he'd come home early he mentioned that he hadn't been feeling well. I offhandedly mentioned that it could have something to do with him staying out late for the northern lights earlier in the week, implying lack of sleep. 

He lost his mind, saying I was blaming him for being sick, that I didn't care about him, that I was being unsupportive. I let him know that wasn't my intention, I was just suggesting it could be a contributing factor. 

He went into his home office and slammed the door. About 5 minutes later he came tearing out yelling that he knows his life is miserable, that he hates it, that he's alone in the world with no one who cares about him. It was such a wild and bizarre escalation. No matter how much I tried to reassure him that wasn't true, it didn't matter. 

The next morning he treated like he didn't yell that he hated our life. He's seemingly moved on but I can't. 

For context, we've been together 14 years. 

Edit:
I know that most don't or won't believe the tone of my question was more out of concern than accusatory. I was essentially asking it to suss out whether it was a cold, general not feeling well, or stomach bug. 

Regardless, after space and time, we talked. The issue was due to work stress compounding and an issue with a coworker who has caused problems in the past. 

I went to the store and bought stuff to make him homemade pizza and pizza fries for dinner with homemade dipping sauce. We each apologized in our own ways.

ANSWER: OP, I think you’re missing a major point here. Either there’s a lot you haven’t shared with us, or you’re unaware of your partner’s actual emotional state.

His initial reaction and subsequent comments sound like someone who may be experiencing depression. This goes far beyond just having a hard day or a lack of sleep.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (35 F) am angry about how friends (33 F and 32 M) behaved in my home. Do I say something?

My spouse recently had a birthday, and I decided it would be nice to fly a couple friends and their two children to visit. They couldn't have afforded it, so I thought it would also be fun for them. We've been talking about having our children meet, too. They have a one-year-old and six-year-old. We have an eight-month-old. I was admittedly annoyed as soon as I brought up the topic. The woman, we'll call her Alice, made demands about seat preferences and insisted on a seat for her one-year-old. I always buy a seat for my baby, but I'm not asking other people to pay for it.

Anyway, the time comes, and they're staying in our guest room. They make an enormous mess in our living room and kitchen almost immediately. They leave garbage and their stuff everywhere. Their kids are dumping food all over the place. The older one is a nightmare and is constantly demanding I push in her chair or get her ice when it melts in her glass or find her a snack or read her a book. The parents said nothing. The younger one just sits there and screams. They're both very noisy, and the parents didn't do anything even when we would tell them we're putting our baby for a nap. We eventually told Alice she needs to keep the baby in the guest room while our baby naps. 

They expected us to pay for takeout for every meal but made demands about what we could order. No fast food because they eat that all the time. I don't eat much fast food, but I'd have preferred to buy that for them instead of paying $200 to feed them every time they were hungry. I know I should have put my foot down here.

The worst part was that on the day of my husband's birthday, the reason they were here, they said they forgot it was that weekend. They didn't have a gift for him. I usually wouldn't care, but I paid over $1k for them to fly out, hosted them, and paid for everything while they were here. What was supposed to be something fun for my husband turned into a free vacation for them and a nightmare weekend for us.

Finally, when they left, we found that their older kid hid candy wrappers under her bed. There was chocolate smeared all over the sheets of both beds. Paper was everywhere. They moved things around and didn't put them back. We found two dirty pull ups that the 6-year-old literally hid. I was so angry that I texted about the sheets. Alice just said "I'm sorry 🤦‍♀️"

What do I say to them? If anything?

ANSWER: I don't think there's anything to be said — they showed you their true colors. They were inconsiderate and used you. I would not want to be friends with people like that. 

What is your goal in saying something? Do you want to mend this relationship, or do you just want to vent?

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I, 42F deal with my Husband's, 43M compulsion to turn off the breakers in our house instead of turning off lights?

My husband and I have been married 10 years. We've been living in our current apartment for the last three where the breaker box is conveniently located in our bedroom. For the last year my husband has decided that it is easier, and saves money, to just turn off the breakers to the house instead of turning off the lights. Now if we were leaving on a trip and we're going to be gone for a few days I actually have no problem with this because it saves us money however he does this everyday. I leave for work before him and when he leaves for work he turns off the breakers in the house so that when I get home before him I'm walking into a dark house with no wifi. Now that it's getting colder, I'm also walking into a cold dark house with no wifi. This frustrates me to no end. I hate walking into my own home and not being able to turn on a light switch and being able to see. I hate walking into the house and have to turn on the breaker before the wifi or heater will work. 
My husband has OCD, although not officially diagnosed, so I try to be sympathetic that this compulsion stems from that. But my patience is wearing thin. I've brought this up before and he said that it's just easier for him to turn off the breakers than to walk around the house and turn off the lights. I told him to make the kids turn off the lights but he doesn't. On the days when I take the kids to school in the morning I make a big effort to have all the lights off so that he doesn't need to turn off the breakers, he still does.
I don't know what to do to help him to stop doing this. Any advice on how to approach this topic with him? Anyone else with OCD have a similar compulsion? Is this something that I will just have to learn to deal with for the next 40years?

ANSWER: So is your refrigerator just off for 9 hours of the day? That doesn't seem food safe. 

Have you tried telling him, "Stop turning off the breaker."  
If you have and he still does it, it's time for some good ol' duct tape to tape over the breaker box. Not enough to seal it in case of actual need of access, but enough to remind him to stop touching it.

================================================================================

QUESTION: GF (31F) has forced me (32M) to take her penalty points. How do I proceed?

Hi! to keep it short my partner of 3 years (& baby) was caught doing 34mph in 20 zone. She already had 6 points & it would have been a potential further 6 points leading to a ban. I explained to her that if her face hadnt been caught on camera & if it wouldn't be potentially 6 points, court appearance etc I would have taken the points for her but also people have gone to prison for such "preventing course of justice".

She came into the room just now & gave me a letter from Merseyside police. She had forged my reply / signature on the initial letter confirming it was me and not her as the car is under my name. It is £100 fine & 3 points I assume as I have a clean license. I don't care about a 3 points but I just don't know how to deal with what she has done & is very messed up. She told me she was angry and upset when we had an argument & did it. Now I am questioning everything about her and have lost all respect for her that she has done this.

ANSWER: If it gets out they will BOTH be in trouble. This happened to an MP and his wife, Chris Huhne and Vicky Pryce, they swapped points, ended up going to prison, lost their jobs and ended their marriage. It's a really big deal and OP needs to get out of this. If they can see her face this will be found out.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I 26M am Buying a house with my gf 27F and she invited her mom and brother to live with us.

For starters, using my burner account.

Me 26M and my GF 27F of 4 years are in the final steps of buying a house, it’s an exciting time and journey but everything changed today.

Her home life has never been easy, her father has always been an agressive man to the whole family, and has hit her mom before. It has been a few years since it had last happened, but a few days ago it happened again.

Her brother just turned 18 and suffers from anxiety, he never leaves the house and quit school all together and her mom works minimum wage.

Well, she told me a few hours ago that she found out what her father did and said that they could come live with us when we move to the new house.

I dont know what to do here. I love her to death and I feel awful that I even feel like this, but this is not something that I want for us, we haven’t even started living together, it was supposed to be the next step for us, and all of the sudden this happens and I might have to share a house with her family as well.

I know that this might sound selfish, but I feel sad that she didn’t even speak with me first about this, it’s our house, these decisions should be made together.

I don’t know, just want some advice on how to take the next steps, feeling a little lost and conflicted right now. Has anyone been in this situation or similar before?

Edit: I see a lot of concerns about the legal aspects of buying a house with a girlfriend, we live in a European country, some things work differently here and this is one of them.

Edit #2:
Some more clarifications, I have talked today with her in person and expressed my concerns.
first, we have lived together in a rental for about one year, my phrasing may have been a little off, English is a second language, but this opportunity came for the house, and we decided to advance on that.
Additionally we are not based in the US, and yes, married couples do have a set of rules different than non married couples, but in my country, when it comes to buying a house, it’s the same as if we were married. In addition to that, we also signed a contract made by our lawyer, that in case we break up, the down payment on the house which was with only my money, is still mine, so I would have that percentage of the house in addition to the 50% that is used as basis.
Her mother is very nice to us, she also calls me son, she has never used any power plays or anything like that with us, she is a lovely lady that always offers me soup when I go to her house. Of course her mom doesn’t want this to happen, none of us do, and if it does, we will set an appropriate time until they have to move out.
It’s an unfortunate thing that has happened, and I’m not cancelling the purchase, nor do I want to end the relationship.
It hurt and it was concerning that she didn’t consult me before saying they could move in, but it was in the heat of the moment, and she was in shock, after talking with her it was made clear that it’s something that will only happen if we both agree to it, if we don’t, then we will try to find other solutions.

Thank you all for the comments, I’ve read most of them even tho I didn’t respond to any.

ANSWER: You definitely aren’t selfish, she cant just ask someone to move into your home without checking with you. Buying a new house is already stressful and may strain your relationship. Adding other people into the equation will make it even worse. I’d talk to her from this angle. If she insists, I’d back out of the sale, which would probably also mean the end of your relationship.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I 18F find my 18M boyfriend’s face during sex a big turn off. How do I go about this?

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year now and we’re in a semi-long-distance relationship. We can only see each other on weekends sometimes, as we’re both seniors in high school and attend different schools. This leads to late-night phone calls and as horny teenagers are these calls sometimes get ✨spicy✨. Which I personally enjoy it over the phone but the one thing about it is his face while we're pleasuring ourselves. It's such a big turn-off for me. He bites his bottom lip and flares his top lip into an almost “m” shape scrunching his face like he's taking the biggest shit of his life. Now my partner is an attractive man, with curly hair pretty blue eyes and a nice body all around it's just during these moments his appearance is a turn off.  We’ve had sex in person but it was always dark or from behind so I’ve never properly seen his face in person. I feel so bad and don’t want a nonchalant partner he’s goofy and fun but I can’t help but just swipe over my camera when he’s pleasuring himself. How do I communicate with him so we can both have a good time?

ANSWER: People seem to think it's a good idea to tell your partner his face is weird during it. I can guarantee that'll make him hurt and extremely insecure about his face during sex in the future. It definitely needs a more gentle take than "ask him why he looks like he's taking a shit" as another commenter put it.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (37F) best friend (38F) of 15 years went no contact unexpectedly. 5 years later, she wants to talk.

Read the update [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/W2I3S1rHd0)

My best friend of 15 years went no contact with me five years ago. We are supposed to reconnect, but I'm feeling unsure.

She was the most emotionally intelligent, loyal, communicative person I knew. We'd been like sisters and stayed in touch no matter the distance. But when I moved far away to pursue my education and she had babies back to back, she told me that she didn’t have time to maintain a long distance friendship. I told her I understood, that her kids and self care should obviously come first, and that we'd pick up where we left off someday. I never dreamed she'd go NC. Tbh, I'm not sure she knew at that point, either.

I stepped back, invested in other friendships, and gave her space. I'd call every now and again, and text on birthdays and Christmas. She stopped answering the phone and responded to texts every six months or so. I couldn't shake the feeling that this was about more than being busy, especially when I saw distant family and friends mention talking on the phone on her fb. A year and a half in, I sent her a message asking if I’d done anything that hurt or upset her, and that I wanted to make amends if that were the case.

She left me on read.

I took it as a sign to respect her obvious, if unspoken, boundaries. Reaching out without hearing back also hurt like hell; I couldn't do it anymore. I tried move on, to not obsess over the reason. I talked about it with friends and in therapy. I also fell into a deep depression, withdrew from my other relationships, and became increasingly self-isolated. I'd clearly hurt and lost the person closest to me, but didn't know how or why. Five years passed with no contact.

A few months back, I learned her father died unexpectedly and reached out. We spoke for a while and she apologized, saying that she'd never meant to "let it go on this long." I apologized for anything I had done to hurt or upset her. She got quiet and said that we could talk about it later. We spoke a little while longer, but once I got off the phone I became flooded with anger. I let the feelings fade and gave her space, then texted a few weeks later to offer support & condolences, crickets. Gave it another month before messaging and saying that I was up for sorting it out or leaving it be. She said she wanted to chat, but we've been trying to hammer out a time for months now, which is telling...it seems we're both hesitant. Now she wants to talk next week, and I'm not so sure.

Part of me wants to cancel, bc fk this pain (hello, avoidance), a smaller part of me wants to fawn and make it all better (hello, trauma and anxiety), and every cell in my body wants to protect my broken heart. I tend to be really hard on myself, and given the pedestal I placed her on (it’s not just me, she is loved by literally everyone while I am a quirky ND who’s loved, but more of an acquired taste) I've blamed myself, especially in the absence of a reason. But in reality, I feel that this was a fked up way to treat a best friend, and that it isn't all my fault like my brain and lingering trauma would like me to believe. I need advice on how to approach this. 

Part of me wants to meet with her, even though my nervous system wants to flee. Part of me wants to heal this rift now in case we never get the chance to. Logically I know that I should hear her out, but I am just so damned hurt and angry. I don't even know whether to express that to her before or after she says her piece. I know I need to make space for both of our feelings and grievances, but how? I missed her so much, but I gave up on her a long time ago. I don't know how to move past this. Tbh, I'm not even sure I want to.

Is talking to or trying to make amends with someone who ghosted me for five years even worth it, if only to find out why?

TL;DR  
Moved away from BFF/almost sister of 15+ years. She said she couldn't do a "long distance friendship" bc of her young children, but still made time for other people. I got the sense that this was about more than just being busy, asked if I'd said or done anything hurtful, & offered to make amends. She left me on read for five years. We are back in touch after a death in her family and she wants to hash things out, but I am unsure.

ANSWER: I would meet, hear her out and then take some time to process. 5 years is a very long time to go without talking. Especially if it was something that bothered her. She didn’t air the problem when it happened and let it fester.
Hear her out but stay reserved till you know why

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (38F) husband (41M) left me over cheating assumptions

I posted back about 3 months ago about how my husband (41m) was convinced I was cheating. He hid recorders and cameras without my knowledge. I wasn’t allowed to shower or shave without being questioned. He inspected my pants when I got off work (I just started working within the last few months when I really hadn’t been allowed to for years because he thought I was cheating then) he has taken me through lie detectors, monitored MY cell phone and spending accounts which I could care less about because I know I’m innocent and still swears I’m cheating. Which fyi I’m not and never have. I couldn’t even imagine cheating on anyone especially someone I loved so dearly at one point, even if that love was gone today. I’ve been in the shoes of being cheated on and it’s HEARTBREAKING. I get it. 

Anyways. This is something I’ve dealt with for 6 years so it’s become the norm for me. We have a 5 year old special needs kid together. I have no money to my name because I just started working part time and no way to afford the house I’m in now. My husband has benefit retirement money so he can afford it although he doesn’t work. 

My birthday was Monday. Every birthday for 6 years I’ve at least cried once. Over the years I’ve lost so much love that I just don’t have it in me to cry anymore. Anyways my birthday was Monday. Super sweet day. Unlike the others. I should have known then. 

The next morning when our child goes to school he presented me a birthday “surprise” saying to choose him or not to choose him. He had a video playing on a little photo display of his “proof” of me cheating. (I can’t post that here but I’d be happy to share that in the messages with anyone that wants to see it.)

The “proof” is a 15s clip out of 5 hours of him recording me and I’m literally sitting on the barstool on my phone playing who knows what game to pass the time and he says that’s proof of me cheating. It’s insane honestly and again I wish I could post it here. 

Needless to say I didn’t admit to cheating BECAUSE I DID NOT CHEAT and I’m not admitting to something I sure didn’t do. He’s told me dozens and dozens of times if I tell him the truth we can work past it and get through it. So if I truly was cheating why wouldn’t I just tell him to keep our house and family together. Probably because IM NOT. He has hours and days of footages and recording and all my search and phone history with NO proof yet still accuses me. 

Yesterday we were driving around town and a phone ringer went off. Not our phones. He had a second hidden phone that went ringing. He’s the ONLY one that’s been hiding and lying. So after I confronted him about that he dropped the bombshell. He said he got another place. Leaving me and our son without a place to be able to afford. 

I am getting “punished” for something I didn’t even do. I know he’s honestly probably the one cheating because stigmas point in that direction AND I’ve been cheated on so many times I know it to be true. And that’s fine. I don’t care truly. What I care about is no warning, no money and no where to go. I don’t have family here. He’s moved me across the country and back running from only God knows. But to up and leave your kid who NEEDS that routine, who’s special needs, without allowing mommy and daddy to talk to him and mommy to figure out a plan for a place is heartless and cold. I truly wish I never met this man. I’m blindsided over false assumptions.

What do I even do from here?

ANSWER: You jump for joy. You celebrate. You are now free off that garbage husband.  


Sue him. Take half his shit. And go find a real man who is not insane.

================================================================================

QUESTION: People keep warning me (28F) about my bf (40M). What would be the best action forward?

My bf and I have been officially together for almost a month now. We both really like each other. Everything is going well between us and he treats me really well and is serious about me. We get along perfectly and I personally haven’t seen any red flag coming from him.

I met his family a week ago and they instantly liked me. Turns out we’re distantly related, but he’s lived abroad all his life until recently, so I knew nothing about him and meeting him was by pure chance and unrelated to family connections. He’s the nephew of my uncle (aunt’s husband) and a coworker of another aunt. We’ve shared the news with my family too. But both my aunts keep warning me not to date him saying he’s disreputable and has a history of lying and womanizing, and have begged my mother to do something about this situation because nothing good could come out of it. Meanwhile he thinks he has a good relationship with my aunts and thinks my aunts like him as a person.

My mom has asked around about him as well, but nobody has anything good to say about him. Now my family hate him and want me to break up with him as the general consensus among both people I know and strangers is that he has a bad reputation and doesn’t deserve me. 
I’ve tried to have a conversation with him about this, but he denies everything.

Tldr: I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one hand I don’t want to break up with him seeing how we get along great and we both have strong feelings for each other, on the other I would have to be dumb to ignore all these warnings.

ANSWER: It is unusual for someone to have such a bad reputation for no reason. People can change, but generally if they are lying about it; it usually isn’t a good sign. It is possible your aunts are being over protective; the only advice I can really give you is asking your aunts more about it and possibly reaching out to any women they tell you he has had a bad history with.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (23F) told my boyfriend (25M) that I won't get a job to make him feel less jealous of my financial situation

English isn't my first language and I'm not good at writing but I seriously need an advice from people not connected to us.

I have been dating my boyfriend for a little bit over a year now. We met through mutual friends and had a pretty usual relationship until now. It wasn't perfect but we never fought much. He works as a manager in a restaurant while I'm still in university. 

His life was pretty difficult from the start since he grew up with alcoholic parents and not much support in general. Since day one, he had to work hard for even the most basic things. He couldn't allow himself to get higher education; he had to continously work since he entered adulthood.

I, on the other hand, have a big family that always supports each other. When I started going to university, they continued to financially support me. My parents help with the bills and give me some allowance. Grandparents, aunts and uncles also often send things here and there. I'm on the campus for my lectures most of the time but I also tutor three times a week, getting enough money from it for groceries. I'm good at living below my needs and saving so I don't need that much cash.

All that background is needed for you to understand where our conflict started. Around a month ago, my boyfriend started making little comments about my financial situation. He would say "It's nice to spend someone else's money" or "You wouldn't survive if you had to work for all that money the way I do". I immediately caught onto those comments but I didn't think it would grow into something more. I thought that maybe he's just fussy because he's overworked.

I tried to be understanding, knowing it must be difficult for him to work as much as he does. I proposed that maybe we should move in together to lessen the burden of all the bills on him. I even said that I can help him with some groceries from time to time. He called that insulting and said that he could never agree to either of those ideas.

Unfortunately, it got worse. It feels like almost every day we fight as he calls me lazy, a trust fund baby or says that I don't know what real life feels like. He also started sending me random job listings, telling me to apply even though I don't have any time for those jobs. The biggest fight was yesterday. He came over to my home for dinner and while I was cleaning, started talking about another job listing. By that point, I was at my limit after seeing like a hundredth random job offer. I blew up at him, angrily telling him to stop telling me to get a job. That university is my job and my main focus. I must admit that I said some mean things along the lines "You only want me to get a job because you are jealous of my situation, of my family's support". He stormed out and doesn't really talk to me now. He sends short messages back but he doesn't pick up his phone. I tried apologising but he tells me that he needs time to think everything through. 

Was I truly that harsh? How do I make him see my point? Or maybe he has a better point and I should deny my family's support, filling my schedule to the brim with uni and work? Is there even a way for us to reconcile? Please, help, this is my first serious relationship and I don't want to mess it up.

ANSWER: He's seeing you succeed and wants to bring you down to his level. Don't allow it 

I also don't think this is the man for you. If he feels bad about you helping with groceries, how will he feel when you have a uni degree and will earn more than him?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I’ve (30F) been lying about my son’s father for 12 years and I want to finally tell the truth to my parents (55F) (60M) and son.

When I was 16, I was in a relationship with a 26-year-old man. I’m 30 years old and now understand how wrong that relationship was. To a large degree, I even knew it was wrong back then. I don’t feel that he groomed me or manipulated me into it. I don’t feel like I was naive or talked into doing anything I didn’t want to do. I still believe I genuinely loved him and a part of my heart still loves him. He refused to have sex with me for a long time, but I pushed and begged, and when things finally happened between us, I felt like I’d gotten what I wanted. I was too young to understand any of it, but I understand that he was the adult and he should never have given in I matter how much I begged. I know he felt guilty about it. 

When I was 17, I got pregnant. He asked me to marry him, but I said no. He had severe mental health issues, clinical depression to the point of hospitalization at one point. By the time he asked me to marry him, he was really spiraling and I think just grasping at straws for things he felt would make him happy. If we had the baby and got married he’d be happy. But I knew that wasn’t the case. I was scared of what was happening. He took his own life less than 2 months later.

I’ve never told anyone who my son’s father really is. My family has no clue that this man ever existed. Only my best friend knows. I lied back then and said I met someone at a party and didn’t know who he was. It was a terrible lie, because as crazy as it was for me to have been involved with this adult man, it was even crazier to imagine me going to a party and having a random one night stand with somebody I didn’t know. That’s not something I’ve ever done and I don’t know how anyone who knew me back then would ever believe that lie. I was the studious little straight A student who didn’t do anything wrong. I was desperate and scared so I lied. My parents were already crushed that I was pregnant at 17 and I didn’t think they could handle knowing the truth about who the father was. I thought I’d get in even bigger trouble for doing something so dumb, and I wanted to protect him.

My son is 12 now. He’s smart, kind, and starting to ask questions about his dad. I’ve kept this lie up for so long that I don’t even know how to start unraveling it. I want to show him the pictures I have of his dad and tell him where his eyes and hair color come from. I don’t want him to believe his father is some random stranger out there who doesn’t even know he exists and who he might be able to find through a DNA test. 

Telling my parents the truth after all these years might destroy the peace we’ve finally found. They were disappointed for a long time after my pregnancy, and it took years for things to feel normal again. I’m scared I’ll lose that.

At the same time, I can’t stand lying anymore, especially to my son. It makes me sick every time I repeat the lie anytime somebody asks me about his dad. He deserves the truth, even if it’s messy.

I don’t even know where to start. How do I tell my parents? How do I tell my son, in an age-appropriate way, who his father was and how he died? How do I handle the fallout of all this?

I just want to do the right thing, but I’m so scared it’ll blow up everything again.

ANSWER: There is absolutely no way a reddit thread is going to give you good advice here. You need to work with a licensed professional in family therapy. Whatever you end up doing will have consequences. You need to have someone to help you understand the consequences and how to engage with your family members if and when these actions (or non-actions, as the current case is) will lead out.

================================================================================

QUESTION: He (M20) literally won’t let me (F21) break things off after one week of dating. How do you step away from someone like that?

I need to get this off my chest because I honestly don’t know what to do anymore.

About a week ago, I started talking to this guy. He seemed like such a nice person. He was patient, gentle, funny, and genuinely easy to talk to. We texted all day the first day, and that same night, I agreed to a call. It felt natural in the moment, but looking back, that was probably where I made my mistake. After that, it was constant. We started talking every single day and texting from the moment we woke up until we fell asleep, and calling for hours on end. Sometimes six, sometimes eight. Every single day, without pause. It’s like the moment we started talking, I became his entire world.

He calls me out of nowhere now. He gets anxious if I don’t respond right away. If he makes a joke, he’ll ask me ten times if I’m offended. If I sound tired, he assumes something’s wrong. It’s like he’s clinging to me for dear life.

Eventually, he opened up about being cheated on by his ex, and suddenly, his behavior made sense. He’s still deeply hurt, still haunted by that betrayal, and I think he’s trying to find safety and validation in me.

But what’s concerning is how quickly it’s turned into something more. He tells me how much I mean to him, calls me his girlfriend, and posts TikToks about “us,” quoting things I’ve said and romanticizing every little interaction. He acts like we’ve known each other for years when it’s barely been a week. It’s intense, too intense.

So, I tried to talk to him. I told him that we should slow down, that maybe he needs space to heal and find himself again. The moment I said that, he completely fell apart. One minute he was blaming himself, then apologizing, then saying he couldn’t lose me, then accusing me of not caring. It was like watching someone spiral.

It honestly felt like I was asking for a divorce after twenty years of marriage and not trying to take a break after a week of talking. He just wouldn’t accept it. He kept trying to talk about it, to fix it, to make me stay. He said he could “heal while having me by his side,” but I really doubt.

It’s now seven in the morning, and I haven’t slept because we were arguing until three. I’m emotionally drained. I can see that he genuinely believes he’s fallen in love with me, but his attachment has become overwhelming. He’s trying to heal through me instead of healing for himself, and it’s become too heavy for me to carry.

I want to step back and let him heal on his own, but he won’t let me. He keeps holding on tighter every time I try to pull away.
I don’t know what to do.
How do you step away from someone like that?


Edit: 

The reason I haven’t just cut him off completely is because I don’t want him to feel like opening up about his trauma pushed me away. He trusted me enough to share deeply personal things about his past, and the last thing I want is for him to associate that vulnerability with abandonment. I don’t want to add to his pain or reinforce the idea that people leave once they see the broken parts of him. That’s why I’m trying to let him down slowly and to step back with kindness rather than disappear abruptly.

ANSWER: “Hey you seem like a great guy, but we aren’t a match and I hope nothing but the best for you going forward!”. And just stop replying.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I(28F) am seriously considering divorcing my husband (32M) because of how he treated my dog and what comes after it

Background on my story: my husband is never mean to my dog, but he's very much not a pet person. I knew about that going into the marriage, I was fine with him not interacting with my dog or helping me with dog duties. I accepted that. His only duty is to open the yard door to let my dog out to pee when I work 10 hour shifts. Even with this simple task, he complains that this is a lot of work for him and makes him stressed out. His reasoning is that having to let the dog out means that he has to constantly keep this at the back of his head and it's one extra thing that he has to do on top of his busy work, which stresses him out. Anyway he still did let him out to pee most of the time, and I kind of just accepted that. 

Recently I had to travel out of country because my mom needed surgery. I was gone for a total of 3 weeks, the first week I asked my friend to take care of my dog but they were busy for the last 2 weeks so I asked my husband to take care of him. He did not complain and said ok(which I appreciate). I got back from my trip and found that my 17lbs dog has lost 5lbs under his care. That's 1/3 of his weight. My poor puppy is depressed that I am gone, and god knows whether he's being fed twice a day per my instructions. My dog always loses weight when I'm gone due to stress, but losing a third of your body weight in 13 days? So obviously I was very unhappy about that. I was debating about whether I should have an argument with him because technically he did "do me a favor" by taking care of my dog, but he also did a really poor job. It also feels like this is weaponized incompetence(which isn't, he's still a person of good nature he would never purposely hurt my dog). I just can't get over the fact that he's casually making jokes that oh well he's skinny now at least he's easier to carry. Again I am ok with him not caring about my dog(I know I shouldn't), as long as he doesn't hurt him I was already ok with that. All I wanted to do was to have a conversation with him, telling him that he did not do a very good job taking care of my dog, and that he should know better. He then started complaining about how taking care of a dog is extremely stressful for him, that he has to constantly think about whether the dog ate or peed for the whole day and it's stressing him out. I said that I already gave you the bare minimum instructions, all you have to do is feed twice a day, make sure water bowl isn't empty, and let him out for bathroom every few hours. He said these tasks are incredibly stressful, why can't you understand? It's so much work that it's like a second part time job, I have to constantly think about him all day, did he pee? did I feed him? That's incredibly stressful. Obviously anyone would not agree that these simple tasks are stressful, so I disagreed. He then started YELLING at me, saying that I don't appreciate anything that he does, that I'm not being understanding about how stressful it is for him to take care of my dog for 2 weeks, that he's under SO MUCH stress for the past 2 weeks and I'm still complaining. 

The argument ended with him saying that he doesn't want to deal with this and told me to fuck off(yelling). 



TLDR: husband thinks taking care of my dog for 2 weeks is super stressful and I am not being appreciative and understanding that this is a stressful task, therefore I should not be complaining that under his care my dog lost a third of his body weight in 2 weeks. He then YELLED at me for not being understanding even though I was the one that is supposed to be mad. (I was calm the whole time when I started the talk).



I still want to try to fix this somehow, but I don't even know how to fight back to his arguments. Can anyone help? 

Edit to add: I’m not putting blame completely on him for my dog losing weight, because stress is also a big factor. I’m just pissed that he yelled at me simply because I pointed out that he did a poor job taking care of him. All I wanted was for him to learn that he should be more careful and ask me questions if he’s not sure about dog care. It’s the yelling that makes me consider divorce, not the dog care. So I think this might still be fixable, but I’m not even sure how to go about it? That’s why I’m looking for advice…

Another edit to add: he fed my dog for sure, because the food bag did get less full. I had a full bag before I left and it was definitely used. Now I believe he did sometimes forget to feed him twice a day, but I don’t know how often. Not saying this is acceptable, but for people that think my dog was not fed at all, that’s not the case. But he did neglect my dog, and I just wanted to bring that point across to him that this is not acceptable, you don’t have to like him to feed him twice a day.

ANSWER: I hope you don't plan to have children with someone who's this stressed for having to care for a dog for about 10 minutes total a day.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (23F) keep having sleepovers with my friend (24M), but nothing ever happens… and I’m so confused.


I (23F) have this friend (24M), let’s call him Matt. We’re both international students. We met during a welcome event for new students in August 2024. We’re from the same country, so we started talking and became friends instantly. 
He’s conventionally attractive, and honestly, I was into him the moment I saw him. But at the time, I was in a relationship, so I never acted on it. I eventually broke up with my boyfriend around the end of the year because long-distance just wasn’t working anymore. Matt has been single since we met, and he is attracted to women, just to clear that up :)
 
Anyway, we’re part of a small friend group (three guys, including him, one other girl, and me). We used to hang out almost every weekend, cook dinner, drink, and chill. So, it’s pretty normal for me or Matt to go to each other’s places. One night (this happened around March 2025) everyone left early, and it was just Matt and me. We kept drinking and talking until like 3 a.m., and since it was too late for him to go home, he crashed at my place. My apartment is super small, with basically just a bed, a tiny couch, a closet, and a desk. So we ended up sharing the bed. It was super awkward, but nothing happened. He left in the morning, and we never talked about it. I was a bit confused because he didn’t even try anything, but at the same time, I felt really safe and respected.

What I didn’t expect was that it wouldn’t be the last time. We’ve had multiple sleepovers since then, either at my place or his, and still nothing happens. Like, literally nothing. We just talk, drink, play card games, and sleep. After a few nights like that, I asked if he’s ever done this kind of thing with another girl, and he said no, which made it even weirder. Of course, I haven’t had these kind of sleepovers with my male friends either, but as I mentioned in the beginning, I am attracted to Matt, and I wouldn’t mind if something did happen with him. However, I’m really shy and never make the first move. 

At this point, it feels like we’ve slipped into this weird brother-sister dynamic. He doesn't even step out when I change my clothes or shower, like it’s the most normal thing. So… what’s going on here? Are we just… really close friends? Is he not attracted to me? Or is he just being respectful and waiting for me to do something?

For context, I’d say I have a cute face and an average body. He’s definitely more attractive than me, but I don’t think I’m unattractive either.


Small Update 

Hey everyone! This was my first ever Reddit post and my first time doing an update to. So, sorry if I mess something up 😅

I just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone who commented and took the time to give me advice. I honestly didn’t expect so many thoughtful responses. They really helped me see things more clearly.

The general consensus seems to be that I need to stop overthinking and actually talk to him. So that’s what I’m going to do. I’m planning to invite him over for dinner at my place later this week, and I’ll try to be honest about how I feel and see where it goes from there.

I’ll update again once that happens.

ANSWER: Expecting a post from him tomorrow: 
“I keep inviting this girl for sleepovers but we still haven’t done anything I’m confused??”

QUESTION: My (28F) boyfriend (31M) replied to a Redditor's post saying she was seeking cock

Hi everyone, I would really appreciate your thoughts/advice on this. My boyfriend who I've been with for 9 months now was showing me his Reddit comment history and we were laughing over some of the funny comments/jokes he's made when I saw 23 days ago he responded to a female Redditor's post where in the title she was saying she lives in LA and is looking for cock. The post's content itself had since been deleted, but in his comment he wrote about how his medical residency is ending in a year and he plans to move from the city where we live to buy property in LA and if they're both single by then, he'd love to connect.

This was a huge breach of my trust, and I do consider this cheating, but I'm not sure if I'm overreacting because he put the disclaimer of if they're single when they both live in LA. He apologized for it and said it was stupid, but said it's anonymous and he probably posted it when he was horny and he doesn't even remember posting it.

I ended the relationship then and there and kicked him out of my apartment. Was that the right thing to do, or am I blowing it out of proportion given his stupid disclaimer? I feel like I'm losing my mind after seeing his awful comment... Please, someone tell me if this is something that can be salvaged or if I made the right choice, because right now I'm just feeling really heartbroken

ANSWER: Don’t over think this.  The guy was already planning on what he’s going to do after you break up.  You saved yourself a headache.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (23F) boyfriend (24M) won’t leave me alone after seeing a photo of me kissing another guy.

Hi everyone. I never thought I would be posting on Reddit. I never seen an actual post before and usually just listen to these on TikTok with Minecraft in the background so here I go trying to type this right. So sorry if I don’t. 

My (23f) boyfriend (24m) has been at me every single day for a week over a photo he saw while I was out with my friends. I thought everything was fine before this but I guess I was wrong and honestly I have no idea why he’s acting like this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

This all started last weekend when I was out with my friends who I hadn’t seen in a year due to moving very far away. We went to an outdoor concert for cheap in our small town after I moved back just so we could have fun and dress up in costumes so we could hang out and see each other. One thing to note is the friends I was with barely drink (two to three times a year) and they never go out. So of course I was very excited that they wanted to go out with me for once. I would also like to mention I hadn’t been out more than once within the whole year I had been away since I do not like going out without my friends so I do not normally do this either. 

A few days after we had went to this concert my boyfriend texted me a photo of “me” saying I look like I was about to kiss someone in the background of one of the professional photos that were taken there. I told him many many times this was not me. This girl had curly hair, she was wearing what I thought was a big black coat, and her face shape did not match mine. I thought he was joking. I was wearing a skin tight black long sleeve dress, wavy hair, and I had a headband with bunny ears on my head. I laughed it off thinking it was a joke and told him it wasn’t me while pointing out everything that was proving it wasn’t me. 

The next or couple days later I don’t remember, he texted me again bringing it back up. I again told him it wasn’t me and explained everything that was different between this girl and me. He did not believe me. He kept calling her my twin and saying it wasn’t normal how defensive I got the first time he brought it up (I immediately started telling him why it wasn’t me the first time because I knew where it was going) but I kept explaining how it was not me and I didn’t know what else to tell him. He pretended to believe me but that was not the end of it. 

The next time I saw him, he brought it up again but in person, I proceeded to laugh and say “why would I cheat on you in a place where all of your friends are, a photographer taking photos, and in a public space where I know everyone.” I then proceeded to tell him how I am 5 feet tall and the person this girl was “kissing” was shorter than her. There is no one in our small town who is over 19 that would be in the 4 feet. I sort of giggled when I said this because i didn’t think it was that serious. 

The issue ended up being brought up a couple more times and I was getting so fed up. Tonight it was brought up again for what felt like the tenth time and I was so mentally drained and exhausted from this conversation I just started telling him to prove that I cheated on him. He wouldn’t stop calling me a cheater saying I was with other men when I didn’t answer fast enough and accusing me of so much. He never acted like this before. He then freaked out at me for telling him to prove it and going on and on and on for hours and hours to the point where I had to stop texting him to keep myself mentally sane. 

Eventually I was so desperate I started scouring the Facebook page to find all of the photos of that night to figure out who this girl was to show him once and for all it wasn’t me. I found her. I sent him all of the photos of this girl and put them with the blurry photo he sent me thinking it was finally over. But he responded with “I can’t see her makeup I can only see your black eyes”. I was done at this point. I never ever ever do my makeup. I only wear mascara because I don’t know how to do makeup and make it look good on my skin. I got ready with my friend who went to school for makeup and she helped me and gave me tips so I felt confident enough to try it for once. I did not wear black eyes. The photo was too blurry to see the makeup it was just a blob but apparently he could. 

I then proceeded to stop answering him because I was over it and he gave in and apologized telling me he was wrong and what not because I gave up. I thought it was all fine until I was playing video games with my same friend who’s good at makeup and he messaged me a new photo. This new photo was a completely different girl and he said “this is you going into the corner. Good job taking your ears off that’s a good cover.” I had no idea how to respond at this point because it seemed like he just wanted to prove me wrong and was making up stories about how I cheated on him. 

Anyways I found the girl who he was talking about (she was wearing a penguin costume) and she looks absolutely nothing like me so I’m not sure why he thinks it’s me. You can see her hood which has a beak and an eye on it which doesn’t look like my costume at all. I did not leave any of my friends side all night and I have no idea what to do in this moment. This has gotten so frustrating that my relationship I never speak about and keep private is now known by my friends and family over this fight. I couldn’t mentally handle it alone and told everyone about it and sent them all the photos and everyone agreed right away it was not me. It wasn’t me. We’ve been together for 8 years and I’m so sick of it and over it and it only took a week. 

So if anyone here has some advice about this situation could you tell me what to do now ? I haven’t shown him the photo of the penguin girl because I don’t think I should be the one proving I didn’t cheat and he should be proving I did cheat. I think he should trust my word like I do his but I don’t even know who he is anymore. He’s acting insane.

ANSWER: Girl stop, he’s not a man worth staying with he’s a jealous and controlling waste of space 
He probably knows it’s not you but he loves tying you in knots 
He will use this to ruin any more girls nights out you have so you stop doing stuff to just be with him

================================================================================

QUESTION: UPDATE: Is my (30F) partner (45m) trying to sabotage my job?

You can see my post history for more details about this situation but I'll put the TLDR here in case you dont want to:

My partner (we will call him Bob) and I got into an argument on Monday. Context: on Sunday I was feeling so sick and, was up since 2am with my 2 babies and had nausea and the worst headache. I told my partner I needed to sleep and he took the babies along with his mom (she's been helping). I couldn't really sleep so woke up around 930. Partner was playing video games while his mom had the baby and toddler was wondering around. He played video games for most of the day.

The next day, he told me he was starting his paternity leave. I said that was great and asked him if he could watch the babies for a couple hours while I had meetings for my new job. He agreed and seemed okay with this. I cooked him breakfast and he went out to do some work on his business around 930am.

At 115pm (my meeting started at 2pm) I called him and asked where he was. He said he was surprised that I hadn't called "as I typically would" and I told him I was busy. This comment rubbed me the wrong way because it seemed like he was intentionally taking long to come home and was trying to upset me. 

I asked him when he would be home and told him I needed to test my microphone with him. He said "I cant do this every day, if every day is like yesterday and today it will be catastrophic " and I just got angry because i literally asked for 2 hours and felt like he was giving me a hard time about it trying to sabotage my job. He threatened to turn around and not come hime. He yelled at me and hunhome.

He did come home, and I stomped down the stairs grabbed my toddler and told him "I dont need you i can take care of my own children" he said "get out of my house" and I said "I dont care". He came upstairs, upset that I "disrespected him in front of his mom" and threatened to cut the wifi. 

Instead of watching tbe children while I did my meetings, he napped and left them with his mom. She couldn't handle them and hurt herself trying to bring them outside.

UPDATE: He has been giving me the silent treatment all week which he knows triggers me. I should have just ignored him too but he knows I had to get a surgery today (Friday). He said he will watch the kids but will not support me or pick me up from my surgery. He also said he will  be taking me off his medical insurance. (He told me in the past he gets joy talking to his ex wife, who is suffering from heart problems because he would be able to help her out but chooses not to and likes to see that she's struggling). Hes also said he wouldn't care if his mother got so upset about something that she died 

Fast forward to today, apparently im unable to get an Uber home from the hospital and he is not responding to any calls from me or the hospital. I have nobody else as all my family amd friends are in my home state across country.

So now im stuck in hospital as they try to figure this out. Im so embarrassed and made plans with my sister to come home and leave him once I can, I just dont Know what to do with my babies because we have a custody agreement in place and I won't be able to take them with me until its amended.

ANSWER: Girl you know you’ve been doing more than enough, you shouldnt looking after a 45 year old man child too. Just out of interest how long have you been together?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My 24F girlfriend is leaving me 24M because of finances.

My girlfriend and I met in high school when we were 16. We started going out when we were 17. We were together for almost 3 years, when she left me. This was due to a variety of reasons. We went to separate colleges, we grew apart, and it was also COVID, so we didn't spend that much time together.

Fast forward two years later and we got back together. Things were going really well, and we spoke about issues in our previous relationship, etc. We are now 2 years together again.

She started working last year, and I started working this year. Unfortunately, my parents lost their jobs last year. They were both working at the same company. COVID put a big strain on the company, and my parents had to be let go eventually.

This year when I started working, I started paying the rent of the house my parents live in. They have no money and also nowhere to go. My girlfriend recently asked me how long this will continue. I explained to her that my parents have no qualifications, and they are also 57 years old, so getting a job is not easy. I feel obligated to at least put a roof over my parents' head, as they have provided me with one all these years.

Now it seems she wants to leave me, because she thinks I won't be able to provide her financial freedom or she won't be able to life out her dreams. I do earn more than 2x her salary.

I really want to save our relationship as we were high school sweethearts. I still love her very much after all these years. I feel miserable right now.

Do you have any advice for me?

Edit: Some people in the comments are accusing me of karma farming, or that this is a misogyny post, because my post and comments are hidden on my profile. I've made them public for now. Sometimes I just want a bit of privacy! 

Update: Hey everyone. Thanks for all the replies. There are way too many for me to respond to. She decided to break up with me.

ANSWER: I’m not saying either of you is right or wrong, but I am saying “we were high school sweethearts” is not a good reason to hold onto a relationship that isn’t working.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My girlfriend (F24) gave me (M27) an ultimatum. Did I fuck it up?

So, I (27M) was always an extrovert. My girlfriend (24F) is more of an introvert. When we started dating, I slowly stopped talking to a lot of my friends because she wasn’t comfortable with it. I even stopped talking to my female best friend just to make her feel secure.

Over time, I started feeling really lonely. I told my girlfriend that I feel like I don’t have anyone in my life anymore and I stopped talking to everybody because of you and you still end things with me and always leave me alone and that it’s taking a toll on my mental health since I already deal with anxiety and depression. Instead of trying to understand, she said something like, “Because of your nature, I don’t have anyone in my life either, Everyone has left me” in a really insulting way.

After a while, me and my best friend cleared things up and started talking again. I told my girlfriend that we did and gave me an ultimatum!! 
Either her or my best friend. I told her that this kind of behavior is toxic and that I can’t keep cutting people off just to make her happy. She ended things with me right after that.

I begged, pleaded her not to leave and she still did saying you chose her over me. 

She has a pattern of ending things whenever we argue, leaving me to deal with everything alone. I still care about her, but this situation really messed me up.

I just want an honest opinion please who’s actually wrong here? Did I do something wrong by talking to my best friend again, or was the ultimatum too much?

ANSWER: The greatest gift she could give you was to leave your life.   Be happy, call your friends, go out, be social, quit longing for the person who made you lonely in your togetherness.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Snooped on my gf phone and I didn’t like what I saw. Not sure how to proceed? m28 f28

I know I shouldn’t have done this, and it’s something I’ve been super mindful of avoiding. I’ve been having dreams that I was going to break up with my partner, and maybe I manifested it.

We’ve been dating for a year now, and it seemed to be going very well. She was super affectionate, saying loving words to my face about the relationship and how lucky she was.

We’ve had a couple of arguments during the relationship, but we’d always say we came out stronger because of them and enjoyed the journey together.

I’ve given her an out before and she said no she wants to stay with me and be committed in this journey. (She once redownloaded a dating profile to show her friend how she attracted me. I found that inconsiderate and was angry about it, hence giving her an out) 

Last week, I went through her phone as it was left unlocked, and I read awful things about me that she’d sent to her friend:

“I find him annoying.”
“I don’t enjoy his company.”
“I’m going to break up with him on NYE.”
“He’s a perfect BF, but I can do better.”
“My mom said I can do better”

However, to my face, she’s so affectionate and endearing. It’s ripping me up inside because I know I’ve done wrong, but reading such hurtful comments when I’ve been a great partner in my eyes… I just don’t know how to act accordingly.

We’ve still been physically intimate, and whenever I ask about our relationship, she says she’s super happy with it.

She even says I love you to my face and sends me love emojis and things like ‘you’re an amazing bf and I’m so lucky, I love you ❤️’


TLDR: I went through my girlfriend’s phone and found messages where she said hurtful things about me and planned to break up, even though she acts loving to my face. I know I was wrong to check, but now I’m confused and hurt because she still says she’s happy and affectionate with me.

Edit: completely agree going through the phone is a breach of trust. I’ve been getting therapy for it and can understand how that can be damaging. I did trust her 100% however the temptation to see was there and it’s something I’m working on. 

It was the first and last time I’ve ever did it.

ANSWER: I’m so sorry you’re going through this , I do believe that you should just break up with her. She’s basically lying to you and dragging out the relationship

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (38f) Husband (39m) just admitted he hasn't gotten me anything for our 10yr anniversary...

Wait... It gets worse. He didn't get me anything for Mother's Day or my birthday this year either...

Money for us has been tight due to several factors, but I have still made sure he got something when it was a special day for him.

On Mother's day, he said " I just didn't know what to do" and so I told him that morning and went and got it for myself.

For my birthday, he gave me a letter stating he didn't have anything to give me but his love and apologized for not having money. A week before my birthday he drove 4hrs to pick up a $100 item from an auction site for one of his hobbies...

And now our 10yr wedding anniversary is on Friday... I ordered him customized items. Two items arrived over a week ago and one more should have gotten here last week but it's lost in transit. I had to call the postal Service to investigate and he walked in when I was finishing up the call. He asked what the call was about and I told him part of his anniversary gift might not get here on time. He said "oh I forgot that anniversary's mean gifts. I just don't know what to do for those things"

Wtf... We have been together for 17yrs. Married for 10. He used to be so freaking romantic and gave amazing gifts and made me feel loved and important... Made it obvious that he that he put time, effort and thought into his gifts and now... I get nothing...

I feel hurt, forgotten, unimportant... We have been through so much in the last 10yrs and we're still together. It's worth celebrating and recognizing. We have plans to go out to eat and I've been talking about it for over a month so it's not like he forgot. He just didn't put in any effort. 

How do I explain how this is making me feel without sounding like a I'm whining?  Like this is serious and it hurts, I don't think it's an over reaction to be upset about it. But I also feel a bit silly about being hurt I didn't get gifts...

TL:DR Hubby didn't get me any gifts for Mother's Day, Birthday or our upcoming anniversary. I'm hurt by his lack of effort. How do I talk to him about it without sounding like a whiny baby?

ANSWER: Hope you looked at him and told him that you aren't surprised since he hasn't prioritized you in years.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Update: my family’s reaction to my [M29] engagement to my fiancée [F27]

Hey everyone - thanks to everyone who read and commented on my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/LYzqFoutr0) about my family’s reaction to my engagement.

It’s now been over three months since that happened. I wish I could say things have improved, but unfortunately, they’ve gotten worse. My fiancée and I have continued building our life together and planning our wedding, but my mom and sister have not reached out in any healthy or supportive way.

After months of silence (other than random texts not addressing the elephant in the room, and even then that was more recent), my sister finally messaged me recently. She wanted to have a conversation with “just her brother” and wouldn’t entertain a conversation to start with my fiancée included. Instead of accountability or a real attempt to make things right, she sent a guilt-filled text accusing me of “treating my family like they don’t matter,” saying I was being controlled by “outside voices,” and closing with, “how you’re treating the only family you have left.”

That last line hit hard - our uncle recently passed away, and it felt like she was weaponizing that loss to hurt me.

The message was manipulative and avoided any responsibility for the way they reacted to my engagement. I realized that responding would only pull me back into the same cycle that’s existed for years: where I’m expected to smooth things over while they refuse to reflect on their behavior. So I didn’t reply.

Even when well-meaning people (including my fiancée’s mom) suggested I might try a one-on-one talk to ease the tension, I realized that doing so right now would mean betraying my self-respect. There’s been no apology, no ownership, and no acknowledgment that the problem began when they turned my engagement announcement into something about them.

At this point, I’m maintaining silence until there’s genuine change. I’m not closing the door forever, but I’m no longer willing to carry the emotional responsibility for people who won’t meet me halfway.

Any thoughts? Advice?

ANSWER: So sorry your sister and mother are pathetic. Live your best life with your new family. Congratulations

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (24F) boyfriend (30M) wants my baby to take his last name, how do i approach this?

My (24F) boyfriend (30M) and I have been together for about three months, and got together when I was about 5 months into my pregnancy (he is not the bio dad). He has honestly been a massive help so far in helping me prepare my house for the baby, and always makes time to take me to any appointments even where I already have help arranged, just in case. We often used to get into spats regarding what will happen once the baby arrives as he wants to move in ASAP and fully step into the role of a father, whereas I just don't feel comfortable letting him contribute to me and my child more than he already has, especially on the financial side as it just is not his responsibility and we are still early days.

Generally though, we are at some level of understanding as to what is going to happen once the baby is born, and I thought we were finally at a place where I could relax a little bit and worry less about him and more about my baby until he asked me if i would give her his last name.

For context, my plans for her last name has always been to use my childhood friend's mother's. It sounds complicated but both my parents walked out on me when I was 16, and she took me under her wing and treated me as one of her own. She has always wanted a grandchild but my friend is gay, and doesn't plan to adopt anytime soon. She doesn't know i plan on giving my child her last name yet, but my friend and my boyfriend have been aware for a while and have actively supported the idea. Which i guess is another reason as to why I'm confused about my boyfriend asking this of me.

When i reiterated my plans to my boyfriend in response, he blew up at me and said that he felt the effort he was putting into this baby was going underappreciated, and that he wasn't sure how comfortable he was sticking around when I won't commit to letting him be the father to the baby, but will let him commit to spending money on us. I honestly had no idea how to react, because whilst I feel bad that he is with me in spite of my pregnancy, I also was not sure why he was bringing up finances when not once have I ever let him spend any money on my child, even as going far enough to pay for fuel costs when driving me to appointments because (as mentioned before) it's not his responsibility to financially support me and the baby. I kind of panicked and told him I didn't know what to say, and he told me I had to think over my plans with this baby if I wanted him to stick around.

I did feel bad about it, so I later told him I would reconsider it, and he's been fine since, but I'm due soon and my heart is set on the last name I had planned, and I'm just worried about telling him that. I just really don't know how to navigate this situation whatsoever and really need some advice haha. And before I get questions, bio dad is not involved as per his own request.

EDIT: i've gotten a few comments asking this, but I am planning to change MY last name to that of my friend's mom (this has been arranged for a while, even before my pregnancy) so please do not worry!!

  
EDIT 2: thank you for all the comments. i am going to inquire about getting child support from her biological father, and leave my boyfriend as ultimately i need to put my baby first. please be kind.

ANSWER: >My (24F) boyfriend (30M) and I have been together for about three months

It's actually baffling that you're even asking this. You've been together 3 months, and he blew up at you when you told him your plans? Not only should you not give your baby his last name, you should reconsider the whole relationship because he's throwing red flags left and right... I'd go as far as to say it seems like he has a very creepy possessiveness over your child and may have started dating you specifically because you were pregnant.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Found out my (36F) partner (33M) used to have sex with best friends wife while husband watched

Six months ago I found photos and videos that confirmed my partner (33M) had sex with his friends wife. Apparently the couple are into group sex and I assume they asked him to join after his last relationship ended around 3-4 yrs ago. I am not into this kind of stuff and when I found out I honestly was in shock and had a trauma response that involved hyperventilating and shaking. my therapist told me this later. I haven’t been able to talk to him about it for fear of things going badly. I looked at his phone once before and he found out and got very upset. It’s been a while since that happened and I’ve not looked again.  But one night something was bothering me and I only looked at his photos to see if he had saved some of his ex but what I found was unimaginably worse.  Just now I looked again and found recent texts from his friend sending him nudes of his wife and talking about how she wants to do it again and still thinks about him. He doesn’t reciprocate the sentiment but welcomed the photos. I feel so disrespected and I so badly want to come clean and talk to him about this but I’m scared. He is the man I wanted to marry. Is this grounds for breaking up? Can we work through this? Some comments from the women’s side and men’s side or anyone who has dealt with something similar would be helpful. 

Update: I ended up talking to him about it because I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I tried to stay calm but asked if he was feeling unsure about us getting married (we’ve openly talked about wanting to already). Initially I tried to just ask him if he had any past with her but he could tell I knew more. After some back and forth he finally admitted it and he wasn’t as upset about me looking at his phone this time. He apologized and said it was something he did one time with his ex gf when things were in a bad place because his friends asked (she was into that stuff). He apologized for the texting and said it was really  bad judgement on his part. He said he wouldn’t want to hook up with them again even if we broke up and wants to be with me and no one else. On one hand, it does feel good to have it out in the open because I hated keeping this secret from him but, Im also extremely hurt. I guess a lot of men won’t understand the phone checking. I don’t have an issue showing my phone or wouldn’t even be mad if he looked at mine behind my back. I’d more just be curious about it and want to reassure him
if something was making him worry. Anyways, thanks to everyone who gave thoughtful responses. I appreciate it because I can’t really share this with my friends or family. As much as it sucks, I’m trying my best to find a way through. At the end of the day, I’m trying to view it as just a  fantasy which was unpleasant to know about but ultimately not an indicator that he doesn’t love me or that he plans on cheating.

ANSWER: Whether it happened before you or not, the real problem is that it’s still active now. A married friend sending nudes of his wife and your partner “welcoming” them crosses a boundary in most relationships. You’re allowed to feel disrespected and you’re allowed to expect exclusivity. You can bring this up calmly and clearly when you feel safe, and his response will tell you everything. Someone who wants a future with you will shut that door immediately and take steps to rebuild trust. If he minimizes it or flips the blame, that’s your answer too. You deserve a partner whose past doesn’t intrude on your present.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (29M) caught my girlfriend (32F) with something that I don't know if I'll ever be able to move past.  I just really need some advice on what the right thing to do is.  How can I make these terrible feelings go away?

Thought I'd share a quick backstory before getting into it, if you want to get straight to the important part it'll be right underneath the underscore line.

A friend of mine from work, who I've hung out with quite a bit outside of work, told me that he has a friend who's single and looking to find someone to hook up with.

I told him that I'm usually not the type to do a FWB type of thing, and he thought it would be good for me to help get over my recent breakup.  I decided why not just give it a try.

Fast forward to a few weeks of casual hookups, and I started growing feelings for her.  Even though we both told each other that we didn't want to jump into a relationship, especially considering the both of us went through a recent breakup but it just happened. 

About a month and a half into the talking phase, I asked her to be my girlfriend. We've been dating for about three months, and I know, that's not a lot of time to really get to know somebody.  But I really believed that when you know you just know.   In about a month into dating I told her I loved her, yea crazy. 

I let her meet my family, I met hers, even aunts/uncles and grandparents.  Everything about us seemed perfect, almost too good to be true.  I knew we were moving very fast, and I mentioned that to her, and she told me that it's scary but now she wouldn't want it any other way, and I agreed.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This Monday that just passed, the friend who set me up with her randomly called me early in the morning.  I hadn't spoken to him in a while.  He asked how everything has been going.  And I told him that it's been going great.  Before I started talking to her, he explained to me that they had a "small fling" way back in school.  It didn't bother me in the slightest, especially considering that it was many years ago. 

Monday night that just passed she was over my house,  I had fallen asleep and she took a funny horrible picture of my face.  Tuesday she came over again to watch the baseball game.  We joked about the picture and I told her I wanted it off her phone.  Innocently I wanted her to even go into her recently deleted messages and fully delete it so it can't be recovered.  I assumed she knew about recently deleted messages because most people do, but she genuinely didn't.

When she went into her recently deleted, right underneath my name, was a random phone number that said 33 messages.  She quickly exited the folder.  Jokingly, I said to her what were those messages from the random number?  I truly didn't think anything of it at first.  In the past if there was ever something I raised an eyebrow to she wouldn't hesitate to show me, and that made me feel confident that she never had anything to hide.

It's when she started getting stressed out with me asking and was reluctant to show me that it began to get me worried.  I said to her babe now I'm worried and you need to just come clean if there's something you're trying to hide.  She started crying, and said to me there's nothing to hide.  I said well then if there's nothing to hide then why are you so scared to show me?  She said because I'm scared if I show you you're going to get mad at me.

I told her straight up that it's basically a lose lose situation and if she keeps it from me, then I'll never know what the truth was, and probably overthink myself to being sick and most likely never be able to trust her again.  She showed me the chat and that's when my heart sank into my stomach.

It was my friend from work, the one who initially hooked me up with her.  and he messaged her Monday morning with his work phone, about an hour after he called me.

I took a copy of it and I'm going to just share the chat word for word, I figured that's quicker and easier.  I'll put "-" for him and "#" for her.  This was in the morning on Monday, about an hour after he called me asking how everything has been with me and her.

When I read this my heart sank right into my stomach.  I felt betrayed by two people in the same night.   My friend who I trusted, wants to bang my girlfriend behind my back.  My girlfriend, hid this from me and tried to delete it, knowing this was someone who I work with and trust as a friend.  She never shut it down, and she never defended my name when he disrespected me the way he did.

Yesterday my phone got flooded with messages from her.  Saying how sorry she is and that she has never cheated from when we started talking to when we started dating up until now.  Telling me that she thought keeping this from me was to protect me.

I told her straight that I think you're only sorry you got caught.  That had I never came across those messages,  she would have never told me. That I would still be friends with a guy who wants to sleep with my girlfriend behind my back.  And she knows I never go through her phone.

Mind you, this guy is married with 2 kids, and I know his wife.

I got her to spill all the beans to me that night.  And she told me the truth is that they were still hooking up well after school.  That the most recent was around 6 years ago.  But that's not the worst part.  In the last few years, which he's been married, he's been contacting her from his work phone wanting to hook up with her.  She told me that she always said no to him (but what am I to believe).  Instead though, she had been sending videos and pictures to him on snapchat during that time, with the most recent being in April/May of this year (I wasn't taking to her at that time)

When she was flooding my messages yesterday, she said that she hates the fact that this irrelevant person is the reason why this is happening between us.

I told her straight, he's not the reason why this is happening, there's no one to blame but yourself.  Had you came to me about this rather than getting caught, this would be different.  Had you shut it down the moment he made it clear what he wants, this would be different.  Had you put a foot down when he disrespected me, this would be different.

I told her even the fact that you lied straight to my face multiple times about your history with him, and I believed you whole heartedly.  You told me "'I've never lied to you about anything, I don't lie." That's scary to me.

After a whole day of flooded messages she called me on the phone and was hyperventilating in tears saying that she doesn't want to lose me.  I told her that we can talk about this in person.

She came by the house yesterday night and we talked for 2 hours in my car.  I didn't hold back, and I laid it into her and made it very clear how upset I am about this situation.  She just sat there in silence and nodded her head.

She kept telling me it was a mistake and it never will happen again.  I said to her this was no mistake, you knew exactly what you were doing.  And you didn't feel guilty when you were doing it.  I said if this was flipped around and I had did this to you with someone you were close with, I'm sure you would feel the same way, and she agreed.

To conclude

By the end of it she told me how bad she wants to start fresh with me, that for the 100th time she's so sorry from the bottom of her heart and wants nothing more than to be with me.  I told her that I love her enough that it's scaring me to walk away from this, but how trust is very hard to build back.  She agreed and told me that this is going to take time and she wants to prove to me that I can fully trust her.

What should have made me feel better, I still went to bed last night feeling so horrible.  I woke up in the middle of the night feeling like my world is collapsing, exactly how I felt the night I found out.  I hate feeling like this, I got people in my life who I love and count on me and and I have no motivation or energy to want to get through the day.

I want to forgive her, I genuinely wanted this.  I just don't know how I can bounce back from this, and if it's even something worth fighting for.

I'm 29 and I'm scared that my time is slowly coming to an end to find someone I can settle down and have kids with.  

I don't know why I'm sharing this online, but I just need to talk to someone cause I haven't spoken to anybody about it in fear that they're going to think differently of her, and I don't want to do that to her reputation.  Any bit of guidance is going to go a long way for me today, I just really need to talk about it.  Sorry for the long read.

ANSWER: My brother you have: 

- a married “friend” who wants to bang your gf behind your back. 
- a gf who is seemingly okay with violating the sanctity of marriage (if she wasn’t she wouldn’t have responded) 

Drop em both and move on. Tell the wife too, she deserves to know what kind of person she married. You’ll be okay but neither of those people are people you need in your life.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Wife (33F) and I (35M) disagree over the idea that our youngest (1Y 4M) has autism. She's obsessing over it and only sees the negatives, won't see any positives to say he doesn't have it. It's causing arguments.

My wife keeps obsessing over the idea that our youngest has Autism. It's day in, day out. "Oh, that's autism", "He's stimming again" and "Don't mind him, he's clearly being autistic again" comments in front of our other child as well as other people.

It's, frankly put, hacking me off. 

Socially, I'd say he's doing pretty well. Eye contact, plays with toys, interacts with adults and has a few words down. He plays with his older brother (4) well along with some friends with young children.

Physically, he is walking well, climbing up stairs and has just started sussing coming down properly.

  
What my wife see's is that he likes to play with balls, spin wheels constantly, likes to walk up and down hills, spins on the spot from time to time.

My thought track is that, while different, our eldest also used to do things repeatedly, would spend hours chucking a ball down the stairs, took a little while to start getting words (car being his first), but she won't see that. She will not see anything past her own negatives. She keeps saying he won't have a life, he'll be a nightmare & difficult. She keeps accusing me of not having her back here, which then escalates to "if you don't have my back, then we don't work as a couple" comments. My response is that on this one subject, we disagree fundamentally and I cannot have her back. It's too early for a proper diagnosis but she keeps watching \\ reading online things like "is my child autistic" etc. etc. which is something every professional will outright tell you not to ever do.



I'm not after "my child is autistic and is wonderful" type comments. How can I get through this with her? While she was concerned a little about our eldest, it was nothing more than a few blips and then moved on. This time around, it's nearly constant and has been for months.

ANSWER: You shouldn’t be arguing about a medical diagnosis without having first sought an expert opinion.

This needs to go to his pediatrician.

QUESTION: I’ve cared about a coworker (47f) for years, but with retirement coming, I (50m) don’t know if I should tell her

About 15 years ago, I (50m) met a woman (47f) at work who completely changed the way I saw people. I remember the first time I saw her, I actually told myself, that’s the woman I could see myself with one day.

Over the years, we’ve become really close. It took time for her to open up, but once she did, we started spending time together outside of work, late talks after closing down restaurants, a few adventures (she even took me flying once), and just a lot of quiet moments that built a deep trust between us.

There have been a few rough patches, times she was upset with me and stopped talking for a while, but somehow we always found our way back to each other. Once, she told me I “wouldn’t want her,” and I backed off for a while, but we still drifted back into being close.

She has a daughter getting married soon, and she asked if I could go with her that day to help keep her calm. I said yes, and I don’t plan to bring up any of my feelings before then, that day should be about her and her daughter, not about me.

I’m planning to retire within the next 6–12 months, and I can’t help but feel like that’ll change things. Once I’m gone, we won’t see each other every day, and I’m afraid the closeness might fade. She talks about wanting to travel the world, while I want to stay near my son and grandkids in the mountains. I’d be fine joining her for a bit, but we’re clearly on different paths.

I’m not sure if what I feel is love or just a deep, long connection built on years of trust and admiration. I don’t know if I should tell her, let it go, or just keep enjoying what we have while it lasts.

Any thoughts?

TL;DR: I’ve had a close connection with a coworker for 15 years. We’ve shared a lot, and she’s asked me to be there for her daughter’s wedding soon. I’m retiring soon and unsure if I should tell her how I feel before that, or just let things be.

ANSWER: You were the one she asked to go to the wedding with her.  You.  Not anyone else.  I think you should tell her how you feel.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I don't know if I (38F) can ever forgive him (45M)

Update 11/19/25 - I just got off the phone with my mom. I asked if my kids and I could move back home to VA this summer. She is completely supportive and said she is dropping a check in the mail for me to use to hire a divorce mediator. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I (38F) met my husband (45M) in 2015. We were both recently divorced and fell desperately in love. He brought with him a daughter (SD18) who was welcoming and sweet. We were married in 2017, and welcomed a daughter in 2018 (7F) and a son in 2021 (4M). 

I have always had a relatively high libido, while he has a low libido. He would be intimate with me in order to knock me up, but was very much uninterested besides that. This bothered me, but as long as we continued being intimate every few months, I was willing to let it slide.

I have always done the majority of the housework and all the cooking for our family. My husband always said he was too tired, or that he did enough by earning money, so the responsibility fell on me to cook, clean, manage the house, and raise the children.

I made a lot of excuses for my husbands behavior. I can confidently say that he never got up in the night even once with either child, saying that he was an electrician and needed to be well-rested to do his job safely. He rarely contributed financially to the children's needs like clothes and baby food. He needed his money to pay the mortgage and bills, but somehow also found the money to buy a Harley while I suffered with credit card debt and enrolled in SNAP to afford formula for our daughter. 

I began to resent my husband, but was embarrassed and ashamed by the idea of going through a second divorce, this time with a child.

In 2019, I landed a job making significantly more money and the financial strain in our marriage disappeared. This is one reason that, despite my growing resentment, we decided to have another child. 

As a result of several factors including division of labor, lack of intimacy, and the strain of two children, my husband and I spent less and less time together after the kids were in bed. He would shut himself in his man cave at night and I'd go to bed alone almost every night.

In October of 2023, I found a size small lingerie bodysuit in our Amazon cart. 

When I confronted my husband, he denied it at first, then admitted that he had been speaking with a girl in Only Fans and had been sending her gifts. I was heartbroken. He insisted it was only a fantasy and nothing had actually happened. He agreed to couples counseling. I asked to see their messages and he declined saying it would only hurt worse.

Between this and our first couples therapy appointment, I took it upon myself to steal his phone, log in to his account, and read their messages. 

I found out that it had been going on for about 6 months, and in that time he had sent her hundreds of dollars of gifts and tips. I also found out he discovered she coincidentally lived about 15 minutes away from us and he had repeatedly and aggressively tried to meet up with her. What hurt the most though is that he told her he was in love with her and wanted to be with her. 

At our first couples therapy appointment I confronted him with this knowledge and told him I want a divorce. He was irate that I had gone through his phone and absolutely caught off guard by my knowledge. 

After the appointment he begged me to reconsider. He said he loved me and would fight for me and didn't want to break the family up. He said he would do anything.

I told him that even if I forgave him, he could never be who I needed him to be. I told him I was resentful because he never helps around the house, is never intimate with me, and is always tired because of his job.

After a lot of back and forth, we decided to try to salvage our marriage by making the following changes: 

1. We would combine our finances so I would never have to worry about him subscribing to her again. 
2. He would quit his job and we would move somewhere we could survive on one income so that he could share the household and child care burden, and wouldn't be tired all the time
3. We would continue therapy indefinitely.

We have implemented these changes, and it has now been over a year. 

This is the state of things: 
He cooks dinner once a week most weeks, I cook the rest of the week. He takes the kids to school in the morning and I pick them up. He does laundry and takes out the trash, I do the rest of the household chores. He stays up until midnight, long after I'm in bed alone, then sleeps from noon until 3pm. We have not had sex in 21 months.

Crest-fallen does not adequately describe my mental health. I feel like a complete fool. I feel alone. I feel trapped. 

I don't know if I can forgive him anymore.

It's not that he has particularly done anything recently, I just don't know if I can forgive what he did when he has done nothing to redeem himself.

I have also put myself in a position that leaving him would financially ruin me.

Can I ever forgive my husband?

ANSWER: I can’t lie, I’m pretty shocked that he fucked up and in return you just shot yourself in the foot financially to keep a crappy husband 

But okay, that’s done and can’t be undone 

So, this is clearly not a loving marriage anymore and it’s time to start getting ready to separate 

It’s time for your kid to go back to daycare and your husband to go back to work

Once that’s done, then start the process of separating

================================================================================

QUESTION: I F22 get less attracted to my boyfriend M21 whenever he opens his mouth due to his politics. How do I break up in a mature way?

Tldr at the end.

I need help formulating how to break up in a constructive way. I don't want to do the classically "it's not you, but me" because I think he deserves the truth.

I met my boyfriend M21 about 6 months ago on a dating app and we hit it off immediately. We had the same background and a lot of the same interests.

Now none of my friends liked him from the beginning and that is not a rare thing. Apparently most people dislike him, something he admits himself and he dislikes most people but by then I didn't know the reason for it yet. he isn't the physically attractive person so I thought that was the reason since a few of our mutual acquaintances told me I could do way better but apparently that was only half of the reason.

At first everything was amazing. He was funny, respectful and committed. That was the part I liked the most. He saw me in his future and saw us having children which was an idea I loved. He did guarantee a future for me and treated me well but then slowly things changed.

Gradually he started making offhand jokes and comments about minorities and especially gay people which confused me because he is a part of a minority and at the beginning he told me A LOT about how he had gay friends but never mentioned them again later in the relationship.

He then started talking about the 'libs' and I had to remind him that I was one of them. His answer was usually that I was one of the good ones.

I met him as an exchange student to my country. He said in his country he is conservative but in mine he would be center or even left but the more he says the more it isn't true 

Whenever he says something about his political opinions be it his pro death sentence stance or anti trans stance even though he knows I have trans friends I become less attracted to him and honestly by now I get turned off by his presence.

I know he really tries. He showers me with gifts, attention and tbh money but all that is not worth literally fighting with him over human rights.

When he joked about things in general I thought "maybe it is jokes, maybe he is ignorant and I can educate him" but he has only gotten more extreme and when he talked bad about my trans friend a week back I think I lost the last bit of attraction. After the argument I couldn't bring myself to even talk to him for a while, especially since I asked him what he would do if our children were gay or trans and he said he wouldn't support it, only begrudgingly accept it and try to nudge them in a different direction. I am bi. He knows I'm bi.

I could ignore the physical part but whenever he brings up a political opinion again I cringe and honestly I have started feeling used if he made sexual advances already way before (like honestly almost the beginning but I actually thought it was because of the looks or because he literally tried to touch me anywhere and all the time, even pulling me into the woods for it and especially since I thought the main reason were the looks I thought I would get over it in time)

Honestly in this relationship I dreamed more of other people and yearned more for ex crushes than ever before. I never contacted any of them, even ignored their texts but I caught myself thinking about how they respected people and thinking that my boyfriend was a worse person than them and that's something I shouldn't think and he doesn't deserve.

I just can't do this anymore. I've been cold on him, he's been trying to give more but I can't accept him seeing the identities of people I hold death as grounds for a debate or talking down on people with my opinions or with the same sexual orientation as me

However as you can probably notice my thoughts and feelings are all over the place, especially as I have never broken up with someone so I'm asking: could someone help me sort and formulate my thoughts so I can break up with dignity because I think he deserves to know the reasons to do better next time.

Tldr: boyfriend is way more right wing than I originally thought by his betrayal, now I get turned off whenever he opens his mouth and I kinda wish he would never talk. Need help with breaking up.


Edit: guys. Neither of us are American, we're both middle eastern Europeans please stop arguing about American politics or accusing us to be part of certain parties or even telling me that I am what's wrong with America. I have no connection to the country.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (F45) respond to my fiancé (M46) asking if he should leave because he misses who I was?

I've been with my fiancé for 7 and a half years and he just asked if he should leave.

A couple of weeks ago I went to the doctor because my neck was hurting and I found out that I have 4 herniated disc's.

I've either been experiencing extreme pain or am a zombie from the medication I've been taking for the pain. On top of that I work fulltime, have 4 kids, and I'm enrolled in my final class I need to get my AA.

My fiancé is upset because he feels neglected and I haven't been spending time with him, and he even asked me to apologize for making him put up with me through all of this. He asked me where his fiancé went and if he should just leave because I'm not the same and if she's gone, maybe he should leave too.

Is there anyway for me to explain that I'm not being distant on purpose, I just physically can't do anything more than what's necessary right now?

ANSWER: The fact that you know this:

>I found out that I have 4 herniated disc's. I've either been experiencing extreme pain or am a zombie from the medication I've been taking for the pain. On top of that I work fulltime, have 4 kids, and I'm enrolled in my final class I need to get my AA.

and you still feel like you need to ask this:

>Is there anyway for me to explain that I'm not being distant on purpose

is actually genuinely sort of heartbreaking

================================================================================

QUESTION: Found a weird text on my boyfriend’s (32M) phone sent to his friend and I (30F) am now not sure about taking this relationship ahead.

 FEW MORE BITS ADDED BELOW

I (30F) is living with my boyfriend (32M) of 7 years and is now planning to get married in the next couple of months. Recently I saw a text on his phone sent to one of his female friends which said something like below:

“So… I think I’m actually in a relationship now. And honestly, since I’m done with the whole “things eventually blow up” cycle, this one might even end up going the marriage route. Everything’s been moving kinda fast.
Still super early, of course but after the absolute madness and just wanting my life to change, I basically went, “screw it, let’s do this.” I was desperate to get out of my own head, and this just felt like a nice, solid option.
I wanted to tell you earlier, but I was still figuring it out myself. And then by the time I got back, everything was chaotic. When I saw you the other day, I realized I was just stalling. Apparently this is harder to talk to you about than I expected. And yeah… I guess there’s still some leftover unresolved stuff on my end. Sorry, I know I said I wouldn’t bring it up again.
But seriously, don’t worry. We’re all clear. You’re way too important to me as a friend, more than anything else. So please don’t be bothered, even if you’re annoyed I’m digging up old stuff again. I just needed to be honest.
All that is behind me now or will be soon. I’m apparently still not a full adult. But I’m trying. This girl is really understanding, and it feels like something calmer and more grown-up, not some dramatic, starry-eyed thing. So yeah… awkward update. Don’t give me some overly polite response. I’m an idiot. I should’ve just told you, and you would’ve handled it in your usual disgustingly cool way. But I didn’t, and now I’m irritated with myself.”
(I have modified the message for obvious reasons).

For context, I know about this friend of his but never met her.  I know the fact that they had a history a couple of years before I met him. But after being in a relationship with him for 7 years and us talking about marriage shit for the last 2 years, this message looks like she has no idea about us.

(Also, our relationship didn’t start anything like what he described in his message. I felt it was something “spark at first sight”. He kissed me for the first time on our 2nd meeting or so and we weren’t even expressed our feelings for each other at that point. (I had a giant crush on him, at that point) it’s been 7 years after that, so definitely this is not early).

I also realised none of his female friends knew about me and now because this is getting official he is trying to make it public very gently. I haven’t still met any of his female friends.
Last year, I came to know that he lied to me one time and went out for a late night movie with another friend (F). When I came to know about it and brought it up to him. He just called her up in front of me and invited her for our “wedding” to prove me there is nothing going on between them. Then why the fuck he would lie. 

There had been issues 4 years back where he did break my trust but we have worked on our relationship throughout these years. We also have been in LDR for 3.5 years. I am not someone who controls his life. I have always been someone who wants him to live his own life and meet his friends, then why he has lie to me about meeting his female friends, if nothing is going one? I can’t bring up such stuff without him snapping or him thinking I am blaming him. 
Yes, he has been there with me emotionally and mentally and been my strength for the last 4 years and kept reassuring me. But now why to hide stuff about going out with female friends?

Whenever I bring up about calling his friends (along with his female friends to whom he has lied about us) to our house for dinner or whatever, he just avoids it saying they are not that close which I know is not true. You don’t share your family and childhood pictures with those who are not close to you.

This is literally bothering me and I am not sure how this marriage will work if he keeps lying about such things.

- Wow!!!! I wasn’t expecting these many comments and I am very overwhelmed with everything going in my head. Thank you all.

Just to add few bits here.(Not defending him. Just putting out the actual picture). 

Me and him, we both are very private when it comes to sharing personal stuff to people (that includes friends). His male friends (whom I met recently) are surprised to know he was even in a relationship for 7 years. 

While we were living in separate countries with different time zones. He was with me on the phone (FaceTime) most of the times throughout the day…so much that it never felt as if we were away. He even changed his schedules according to my time zones so that we can atleast eat and sleep at the same time. We video called every single day before we went for bed and kept the FT ON throughout the time till we wake up in the morning. Also, in the 4 years of LDR, he was the one who kept on asking me to come back to him, get married, start a life, blah…blah…. And that went for 2 years. For 2 whole years, he kept on bringing up about wedding and stuff. Hence, I left my job and moved back to his country. Even after moving back, he took care of everything. I started having health issues and he took care of me and the medical bills. Consoled my family and made sure I am comfortable. Recently, I had a surgery and he is the one taking care of me and is with 247 for the last 1 month.

So yes, this is a HUGE BLOW on my trust. I need answers and will definitely get answers. Guess, time to step up for myself.

ANSWER: You've been dating this guy for SEVEN YEARS and none of his friends know about you?  Am I understanding that correctly?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife F26 and me M28 want to have kids but after two miscarriages and a blood test showing she has the gene variant for spina bifida, I am hesitant.

We had a miscarriage in march and then another one a couple months ago. We got bloodwork done and it shows she has a gene variant that can cause spina bifida in the developing fetus. Her brother has spina bifida too. Knowing this we should’ve gotten the bloodwork done before we even started trying but I’m trying not to dwell on the past.

We had a tough conversation the other night. I don’t know if I want to take the risk of having kids if there is a good chance the baby will have spina bifida. We have an appointment with our OBGYN on the 18th and that should give us more info on the medications she can take (folate) that would lower the risk of the baby developing spina bifida.  She is already taking folate but I guess with the gene variant she has it makes it difficult for the body to process folate so she might need a different form of the folate. Let’s say the OBGYN says this lowers the risk to 10-15%. That’s still a number I am uncomfortable with and I’m not sure I would want to take those chances. 

I could see this being something that may end in a divorce and I am very stressed out about everything. She wants kids no matter what. I just know with seeing her brother and all the care he needs I am not prepared in the slightest to take on a monumental task like that. I know there is going to be differing opinions on this and there’s not one easy answer, but does anyone have any advice or experience with something like this?

ANSWER: You can likely do ivf and do pgs testing of embryos and not transfer ones that have the harmful gene.

Ive been dating this girl for about 1.5 months, shes pretty great and a few nights ago we had oral sex for the first time. 

Fast forward to today i was hanging out with her and her friends and they were all acting funny, her friends kept on referencing it but i ignored it. When we were walking home I asked her if she told them and she was avoiding the question until she eventually admitted it and it felt like a stab in the heart. I told her it was really disrespectful of her to do and it made me uncomfortable and she said she didnt know i wouldnt be cool with it even though i told her it should stay between us. 

I feel so betrayed because i trusted her so much and now I feel like that trust is broken and I dont know if it can be fixed and im considering breaking up with her?

ANSWER: Did she empathize with you? Apologize? Try to make it right somehow? Offer to tell her friends to forget they heard that and stop referencing it?

If you want to break up, you can. But those things combined may help you feel better.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (32F) had an abortion and didn’t tell my husband (42M). The guilt is overwhelming. How can I fix this?

I recently had an abortion, but I didn't tell my husband about it. The guilt has started eating away at me, and I feel like I've made a big mistake not being open with him.

I got pregnant almost exactly 12 weeks after our first baby was born. I found out I was pregnant when I was about 6 weeks along. I panicked and immediately decided to terminate the pregnancy without talking to my husband or even really thinking through the decision. I don't regret the abortion itself-as I honestly feel like it was the right decision for me-but I do regret not telling my husband about it.

Motherhood has been a huge shock to my system. It's really hard and I don't think that I could handle having a second baby right now. My husband seems to have adjusted to parenthood much more easily. He's involved and very hands on, but I'm still doing the bulk of the work. He really only takes over in the evenings when we both get home from work. I'm the one doing most of the caring. I even bring her with me to work since my workplace allows new moms to bring their babies for the first 6 months.

I didn't tell him I was pregnant because I was afraid he might want another child and don't understand why it's so important to me not to have one. Now I feel guilty for making this decision without his involvement, without being honest with him regarding the situation at hand and as to how I really felt. I didn't need his permission, but yes, it is something we should have talked about.

I'm terrified that by telling him now, it's going to make things worse. He may be angry that I made this decision without him, but what I'm really fearing here is that he'll be hurt that I kept it from him at all. If the roles were flipped and I found out later my spouse kept something like this from me, I would be devastated. I feel so torn between telling him and just finding a way to silently and privately move on. I just don't know how to move forward from here. How do I tell him?

ANSWER: A lot of the anxiety you’re feeling may be from all the hormones in your body. I had two babies thirteen months apart and while I survived, I barely did and the depression and anxiety haunt me 20 years later. I am concerned for your mental health and not just because of the secret or abortion or newborn. It’s all of it. Please seek therapy. I know it’s too much to handle on your own so you need to talk to a professional. Your husbands reaction will not be supportive (possibly and likely) - and you will not be able to handle that on top of  everything else. A therapist will be able to work with you to manage your emotions and plan how to tell your husband and when. I know that feels impossible on top of everything else but you need help to sort through everything. Peace to you and your baby and your husband.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My flatmate M19, and I F18 knowingly committed flatcest

Okay so for context, I F18 started uni this year and became really close with my flatmates. One of my flatmates M19 and I got really close in a platonic way, and are just able to chat about anything.

We both recently came out of long term relationships, so we’ve been chatting a lot to get over it.

The other night, he came back from a Wednesday social, and as we normally do he came into my room and gave me a debrief of his night. He accidentally fell asleep on my bed, and I couldn’t wake him up, so I just gave him a blanket and lay on the other side of the bed. I woke up in the middle of the night to him really gently wrapping his arm around my stomach, and nestling his head into the back of my neck. When we woke up in the morning he asked why he was there, and seemed really apologetic. I haven’t told him that he was cuddled up to me, and I don’t think he remembered.

Moving on, last night his friends from home came down for a night out. They were all really lovely and it was a good night. When we got home, one of his guy mates fell asleep on my bed, and another on my bedroom floor. The girl fell asleep on his bed. As a result, me and him were both sleeping on the floor in his bedroom.   
Bear in mind it’s 3am at this point, and I’m cold so I start shivering. He puts the blanket that he has over himself partially over me, and holds my hand so that the girl on the bed can’t see. This leads to us both snuggling up to each other, and him leaning over to kiss me. Initially I hesitated, because we both were drunk/tipsy, and I didn’t want to ruin our friendship. However, I did eventually give in, and it was a really good kiss. We spent the rest of the night cuddled up, making out and him grazing his hands over my hips/back. It felt right, I had butterflies and whenever we’d stop kissing my heart was beating so fast I couldn’t breathe. 

I had to wake up early - 6.30 - so when my alarm when off, he just cuddled up to me, and kissed my forehead..

I went back to my room to get my stuff and get changed, and when I came out he was sat on the floor outside “waiting for the loo”. I sat next to him, and he asked if I had to go etc etc it was really sweet.

Since this morning, he texted me saying “I shouldn’t have done that, I’m so sorry” and I replied and haven’t heard anything back despite him being active. I go back to uni tomorrow lunch but I really don’t want it to be awkward. We’re living together next year, and I really don’t want this will affect our dynamic. Any advice??

UPDATE
I hate to disappoint all of you. I spoke to him this evening saying that it gave me butterflies and that I enjoyed it, and he said he felt similar. However nothing more will come of it :(
We’re both super non-awkward people so we’re just gonna go on as before, and pretend it didn’t happen.. 
we’ve made many friends with benefits jokes to that’s how it’s gonna be I guess - not complaining icl
We’re going out again Wednesday and this weekend, so likely it might happen again 
I’ll keep you updated xxxx

================================================================================

QUESTION: After ten years, we (F36, M36) tried to open the relationship. It was horrible. How do we recover?

I think my boyfriend and me might have fucked up our 10-year-relationship by trying to open it. 

Long Post Alert.

He started dating someone else, but nothing except one kiss happened, because he knew I wasn't comfortable with the situation yet. He was dating her, trying to keep her interested, while we were at the same time working on me becoming comfortable with the situation.

He has had two serious relationships before me, the second one lasted three years and was open. He is my first real relationship, and I am way less experienced than he is, both in terms of relationships and sex.   

He explained to me that his plan was to sleep with her a couple of times and then slowly let it peter out. He said, based on his past experiences, that the third wheel usually loses interest quickly, because they realize they have the least amount of power in the arrangement. If she had not lost interest, he would have tried to turn the fling into a friendship if possible, or just respectfully break it off. Especially so if he had suspected her developing any romantic feelings. This had been his MO in his earlier open relationship in his 20s.

After about six dates in 2 months, he ended it with her because of how things were going with us. With me. I don't know how to sum up what happened to me, but I just kept feeling worse and worse about the whole thing. I started crying every other day, just while working at my desk or taking the train. I started resenting both of them. I started snapping at him, which is not a normal thing in our relationship at all. Basically, even though we had lots of talks, and in some ways I felt closer to him than ever because of all the communication we were having… I nevertheless felt like he was cheating. 

I know this is not fair to him. He was open about everything he was doing. He didn't sleep with her. He stopped dating her when I asked him to, although they met like two more times as friends after that because he did not want to make her feel bad. She is going through a bad divorce and really needed somebody to talk to. He did not want to leave her hanging. Or feeling used.

Why did I even agree to try an open relationship, you may wonder.

Well, for one, we never really decided that we were in an open relationship. There were off-hand remarks by both of us over the years that this might be a possibility for us. That was all. But we never had a serious conversation about it. Then one day he comes home after work and tells me that this woman has messaged him on Instagram and that he wants to meet her. And honestly, looking back I now realize what he was asking. But back then, I didn't know what he was really asking. He said he couldn't tell whether she wanted to be friends or more. So I agreed that he could meet her, because I didn't want to be a controlling partner. After their first meeting, he said that she definitely wanted more than friendship. When he said that, I BURST OUT CRYING. I cried for like an hour, couldn't talk or look at him. He tried to comfort me but I really couldn't tolerate him touching me. That was the beginning. THIS NEXT BIT IS INSANE, but after that, we agreed that he would meet her again, but that I didn't want to know anything about it, because I obviously couldn't handle hearing about it.

Does this sound insane, yes. I know that NOW. Let me pause right here.

How I understand myself now, in hindsight: I am a people-pleaser, I don't like saying no. I have pretty low self-esteem. I thought I could just pretend all this wasn't happening and wait until his little adventure would fizzle out. He had made it clear that he had no interest in a relationship with this person. There was no potential for anything beyond sex with this woman. 

I know looking back how stupid, unhealthy and unkind to myself all of this was. But when the person you love most in the world wants something, you want them to have it. And I also wanted to push through my discomfort. And to work on making this work, with him, as a team. But as time went on, I felt alone and betrayed and like they were playing on the same team, and I was all alone. The talks we had helped make me feel better and secure in our relationship again, but always, after a few days, I would feel like absolute shit about the whole thing again.

He did nothing that wasn't allowed. He didn't sleep with her. They messaged, he spent several evenings at her apartment, getting to know her. He was honest with her about being in an open relationship. There was sexual tension, but he didn't act on it. At one point, he was hugging her at the end of a date and she kissed him. I guess she was getting impatient and thought he couldn't take a hint. The next day, he told me about the kiss and we decided that he should stop dating her. Because at that point I WAS A MESS. 

The thing is… I agreed to all of this. Or, at least, I didn't disagree. I participated. I didn't draw a boundary, because, honestly, I didn't know it existed. But hoo boy, it exists. And it was crossed. And I just… hurt more and more every day. 

The whole thing ended about four months ago. But for the first 2 months after, I was still getting worse. Crying, sleeping terribly, losing my appetite, being irritable… we continued talking, spending time together, being us. 

A lot of this mess is my fault. I think my decision-making and behavior are deeply troubling. Did I mention this is my first relationship EVER. I just wanted to try this, to make him happy, to be cool, because monogamy is laaame, right, and maybe I wanted to kiss someone else at some point. I was very naive. I suppress a lot of feelings it seems. I have very low self-worth it seems. I probably depend way too much on my boyfriend and felt like I could not turn him down. I have realized that I feel… dependent on him to an unhealthy degree. That I think I won't find anybody else ever.

All very unhealthy stuff that has come to the surface. Well, I love learning, but dear God, I really didn't want to learn about myself like this.

Ugh, anyway, here we are. They are donzo. We are better. He says he has no problem being monogamous and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me. This fling was just supposed to be fun, it is by no means something essential he needs in his life. We have been together for ten years. He is my best friend. I love him. He is a very honest and trustworthy person. For real. 

I participated in creating this whole mess of a situation. I AM NOT GREAT AT FEELINGS AND COMMUNICATION YALL. He is sorry he hurt me. He thinks he did nothing wrong. Sometimes, oftentimes, I believe that too.

And yet… and this is unfair, but, I fucking hate him. Since his first date with that other woman, I wake up almost every morning and want to no longer be with him. I want to break his greedy little heart. I want to hurt him. I want revenge. Because he really loves me and it would hurt like a bitch. But I also want to break up because I just don't want to be with him anymore. Although I also want to be with him forever.

I feel betrayed, although he didn't betray me. I feel deeply disrespected. I feel ugly and unloved. I don't trust him like I used to, even if he was being honest the whole time. I used to trust him completely. I fucking hate him so much now some days. This will get better with time but it will never be like it used to. I am so mad at his selfishness, his vanity, his laziness. At some point during a conversation he complained how exhausting this whole thing was and I thought TOUGH TITTY YOU STARTED THIS YOU WANTED THIS YOU BROUGHT A THIRD PERSON INTO THIS RELATIONSHIP YOU FUCKING SELFISH ASSHOLE. 

Yeah, so… before someone comments on it, stupid games, stupid prizes and all that. To reiterate, I am not good at this relationship stuff. There is so much more I could have written as for background info, I know there are gaps, but this is already an epic block of text. 

I don't know what to do. For one, I probably need therapy, just in general. Because I was really not looking out for myself. And I don't seem to like myself. Or think I deserve to be treated well.

But, like, what now. There is just some resentment in me from all that has happened that is… huge and heavy. Our relationship used to make me feel safe and proud. Now I feel trapped and humiliated. Oof. 

I guess I just need some feedback. I am too close to see anything clearly.



Extended Version - free of charge ;)

First of all, he did not sleep with her, although I know Reddit finds this hard to believe. I am 100% certain of this. He might be downplaying some of their emotional intimacy, but nothing sexual happened. I know this because his father is a piece of shit, who cheated on his mother for years and he found out when he was a teenager. He loves his mom more than anything. One of his main goals in life is that he NEVER wants to be like his father. He could never sleep with another woman and lie about it, he wouldn't be able to live with himself. (Although lately, I think he might be more like his father than either of us can stomach.) This is the foundation of who he is. If he lied about that, I would have been living with an imposter for ten years. 

Will get checked out for STDs nevertheless, better safe and all that.

We are engaged, he proposed to me a few months before all of this happened. Great, right? It ‘took him so long’, because I have never been interested in marriage and only warmed up to the idea recently. (I just don't like weddings and never thought it was necessary to put a ring on it.) HE would have gotten married years ago. But he accepted that I did not want it and waited. Ironic? Maybe.

Yes, I will get therapy. FOR ME.

Yes, deep down I know that this relationship is doomed. Right now, I am only working part-time because I’m in graduate school and I am somewhat financially dependent on him. Which I regret IMMENSELY. Also, the idea of moving is daunting. Ugh. 

There are many things I resent him for. One thing is his incredible laziness. If you want an open relationship, you need to put serious work in beforehand. And since he was the one more eager on it, I expected him to take the lead on doing that work with me. Especially since he had done this once before. But in one of our later talks, he said he thought I was going to do the research. At some point, while he was already dating said lady, he said, “mmh maybe we should get a book or something.” The entitlement. I think in his previous open relationship, his girlfriend took the initiative and made him do all the emotional work. But that was because she wanted to open them up. During our conversations, I was quickly becoming the person more knowledgeable about how this was supposed to work, because I had taken the time to google for like half an hour.

The other woman… is interesting. At one point, I thought a lot about her. He was pretty honest with her in some regards, but also careful that she only knew what he needed her to know, I think. She definitely knows about me. She is concerned about me. I don't have contact with her but he told me this and I believe him. (She sounds like someone I would want to be friends with, tbh.) She consented that they would only ever be … a fling as he called it. The thing is, the ex she is divorcing is truly horrible and abusive, and my man must have seemed like a saint compared to that guy. I think more than a sexual relationship, she was relying on my man for emotional support. And he wanted to give that to her. And fuck her, of course.

The way he talked about the other people in an open relationship really troubled me as well. It seems pretty… transactional and cold. The thing is, he really needs to be a good guy for his own self-worth. He told me this one story from before we were together: He slept with this girl and she was clearly falling in love so they had a talk and stopped having sex. But afterwards, he would meet her for coffee for YEARS so that she would not realize he had only used her for sex. Even though she bored the shit out of him. He told me this story like it was a decent thing to do, but to me it just seems messy and disingenuous. Of course, fucking people and ghosting them is also shitty. But surely there must be a middle ground? This all gives me the ick.

Maybe people in the non-monogamous community can explain how they navigate that stuff.

It is probably useful to know that my fiance is very charismatic. People are drawn to him, especially if they have problems. He is very good at talking with people and does counseling for a living. This is kind of ironic, because the communication in our relationship has been terrible, as it turns out. 

I am way more introverted and have less of a ‘flashy’ personality than him. But I am deeply kind and loyal, also slightly odd and perhaps a little neurodivergent. (Yes, I finally need to go to therapy, I know.)

What else? THANKS FOR READING AND ALL YOUR COMMENTS, even, perhaps especially, the snarky ones. I have never posted anything this honest and personal online. I read every single one of your comments. 

I will update.

ANSWER: So he pushed through your tears throughout the whole process. What a prince. 

I can see why you hate him. Act on it.

================================================================================

QUESTION: (F/43) My husband (M/42) of ten years is on a work trip with his boss, but it's quickly turning personal. How do I confront him and be heard?

My husband and I have been pretty estranged for the past year. For the past few months, we had made plans for him to move out on November 1st, but he is still here and we are trying to work on making improvements. A few months ago, he had planned a work trip for this week. The night before he left, I found out this work trip is only with his female boss, and they had planned it together. They coordinated flights, and he rented a car for them both. Immediately after leaving the airport, they went thrift shopping together for several hours and didn't attend the first day of the conference. I have let him know how uncomfortable I am with this situation, especially given that I have felt she has had feelings for him for a while. He keeps dismissing me with anger, and telling me "it's all in your head" and that I am making things up. I called today and they were out to lunch together, not at the conference. I later found out that she is not married, like she said she is. I keep getting more upset with the situation and everything continues to get worse. Every honest fear I express to him is turned against me or dismissed. What do you think of his behavior? How can I speak to him in a way to get him to acknowledge the optics of the situation and my feelings? How would you react?

ANSWER: I’m a professional woman in a male dominated field. I’ve been on dozens of work trips with men even single men. I’ve never ditched my work to go shopping with them.

He’s crossed a line and having an affair. Sorry.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (20F) want to break up with my BF (20M) because of his best friend's girlfriend

So, me (20F) and my bf (20M) have been together for 4 years and 6 months and I''ve been having problems with his best friend's (19M) girlfriend (19F). It all started when this girl, we'll call her Ana, stalked me once when I was at the mall with some friends, took prictures of me, sent them to her bf and implied that I was out cheating on my bf. This got to my bf and we got in a fight because of that, almost breaking up in the process. I got so mad because of that, he fully believed her and freaking thanked her saying he helped him see who I actually was. Anyway, we somehow made up but I was rlly upset that Ana was still in our lives. The next time Ana tried to flirt with my boyfriend while all the four of us were out at the barber shop (our bfs were getting their haircuts) and she tried telling my bf how his hair would look better because she likes it a certain way. and another time while I was out with my mom (48F), Ana took a picture of me again trying to frame me because she thought I was with a boy. I was rlly fed up with her and the fact that I have to keep seeing her and acting like nothing happened, she's really like a plague and I've tried telling my bf that I don"t want to see her anymore but he insists he can do nothing because it's his best friend's gf and he has no say in it. I have come to the conclusion that if he would rather not speak up about it on my behalf, I would rather leave him then be forced to see her again and again and act like nothing happened. I rlly don't know what to do, any tips?

UPDATE: I decided to have a long talk with my bf giving him an ultimatum that if he values my presence he will cut her out of our lives completely, he has agreed to do so and that he will only be in the presence of his best friend and not in Ana's, decided to give him one more chance and see what happens. Wanted to tell y'all some juicy details tho, Ana's relationship with her bf isn't so rosy, so I suppose one of the reasons of her intervening is because she could be really jealous of me and my boyfriend or just straight up wants my man, there is more to it but I won't go into further details. Also wanted to edit this a little bit and say that my boyfriend has not reciprocated Ana's flirting (I should've added this sooner but I remembered to once I saw some of the replies)

ANSWER: This is very odd and it sounds like Ana wants your bf. I would address it head on with all of them in the same room. Why is she so obsessed with your relationship? Shouldn't she be focused on her bf instead of yours?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend of 10 years (26 M) has an issue “resource guarding” his phone from me (27 F)

 UPDATE 


Buckle up, it’s a long one.
So after being in the bathroom for so long making this post and reading some of the comments he knocked on the door. I came out and immediately gave him a choice. An ultimatum. I said “your weird behavior about guarding your phone is not something a normal person would do. People who are hiding something awful on their phone have the same kind of reaction you do. You’re hiding something and you’re lying to me. I’ve never wanted to be this person and I have ALWAYS respected your boundaries and given you grace and patience when you asked for it. And yet the way you react to me just simply offering to change a song on your phone when you already have the app up is pretty telling. So I’m giving you a choice. You either disprove me that you aren’t hiding something awful on there and/or cheating by showing me your phone or you leave and this relationship is over. I cannot be in a relationship with a person who has been knowingly lying to my face for almost a decade.” 

He was quiet, shook his head and sighed, pulled his phone out his pocket, opened something up and then shook his head and put his phone back in his pocket as he started to pace our living room back and forth. He repeated this over and over, the shaking his head opening his phone, then putting it back and pacing. He then said “it’s nothing”.  I said “well clearly IT is something. The fact you said ITS nothing and you keep opening up your phone and shaking your head is EXTREMELY TELLING that there is something you’re hiding and are at war with showing me.” He said “it’s nothing. I know you’ve respected my boundaries and privacy I’m sorry for reacting the way I did in the car” I said “it’s not even about just what happened in the car at this point. It’s about this repeated guarding behavior you have over your phone when I have never done anything to make you not trust me to not go through it or touch it even. It isn’t fair. I’m not letting this go. You show me what is on your phone that’s making you react that way and treating me like I’m not someone to be trusted or you leave.” 

He said “so you’re giving me an ultimatum?” I said “YES. I sure as heck am. We cannot go on like this anymore. You can’t have a relationship without trust and trust is a two way street. I have bared my soul to you, you know who I am in and out. Things no one else knows. You say you want to marry me and be with me forever, but you can’t extend me the same trust I have given you. You are currently breaking my trust and you of all people know that once that’s gone there is no going back. So either you show me what’s on there or you leave.” 

Things escalated. He just kept pacing and I had enough. It was clear to me that he was hiding something and the fact that he immediately just didn’t hand it to me told me everything. At this point I had decided in my head that just the mere act of him putting the phone in my hand would have been enough for me. I wouldn’t look through his phone because just him being willing to let me see his phone would have told me he wasn’t doing something or into something. I kept giving him chances and time to give to me and fess up but it didn’t happen and he kept resisting. I went into our room and starting throwing some of his clothes in a bag. 

I came back out in the living room with the bag and  said “you’re going to throw away everything all because you can’t show me that you aren’t up to something bad. Really?? 10 years. Just gone? If you actually cared about me you would see how much this is tearing me apart and you would show me. I have never done anything to make you not trust me or hide something and lie to me the way you do have I?” He said no. I said “what if the roles were reversed and for the first time in 10 years you were asking, begging me- like I am doing now to you- to see my phone because you thought I was cheating or doing something horrible? And I just said it was nothing and reacted the way you are now. Would you think the absolute worse of me? Would you even wanna be with me anymore?” He put his head down and shook his head and said “no I wouldn’t”. I said “so then WHY if you know your answers if the roles were reversed, WHY are you not simply handing me the phone to disprove my accusations??” He didn’t say anything. 

I said “you’re choosing to end this relationship then? All because you can’t show me. You’re throwing away our relationship. Our love for each other all because you refuse to prove me wrong. You will never kiss me again, hug me, hold me, touch me, or even talk to me ever again. This is what you’re choosing. You realize that??” I started to sob partially from sadness, partially from anger. 

I told him to get out and threw the bag that I had put some of his clothes in into his arms. He looked dumbfounded. I got angry. Like full rage. And told him through my teeth “I don’t know who you are anymore, you’ve lied to me for 10 years. Get out. GET. TF. OUT. I don’t want to see you, talk to you, touch you ever again.” He started to try and weasel his way out of it by trying to calm me down and get closer and I told him while backing away “NO. Do NOT touch me. You’ve chosen whatever it is you have in that phone over me and you have LIED to me for 10 years. We’re done. I’m breaking up with you right now. This is done get tf out or I will call the cops if you don’t go on your own.” He started to again try to get near me to hug me cause at this point my rage turned into a panic attack cause all I saw in front of me was this lying stranger who intentionally hurt/lied to me and broke my trust. He was saying “hey hey hey it’s just me” in a soft voice but I was not having it. 

Side note I see a lot of your comments about him possibly having C-PTSD. The irony to all this is that I am the one actually diagnosed with C-PTSD and have been in therapy for it since the beginning of our relationship basically. Because I knew that if I did not seek help that my trauma would leech into our relationship and I could project that on him. So for the sake of our relationship and my own mental well-being I got help and have been in therapy ever since. So it is a slap in the face that he is aware this is a “childhood trauma thing” and yet won’t get help for it when he knows it’s negatively effecting our relationship. He has not been willing to put in the work to better himself and our relationship as I have been actively trying to do since the beginning. Anyway thought Id put that in here regarding the panic attack and the comments I saw about c-ptsd. End of side note. 

We wound up in the bedroom cause thats sort of where he ended up walking me back into cause I was trying to get away from him. He kept trying to get near to hug me to ground me and I kept telling him “I will call the cops. I do not want you to touch me, I do not want you here and you can’t talk your way out of it this time.” He just sat at the end of the bed and said “okay, okay let me just sit here and at least make sure you’ll be fine and are calming down from the panic attack”. We sat there for a while and when I was able to be calm enough to talk normally I said “if you had just simply placed the phone in my hand that would have been enough for me. It would have told me you’re not hiding anything.” He turned around wide eyed grabbed his phone off the dresser and said “here take it” I said “no that’s not how this works. You had to have done it on your own. If you had nothing to hide you’d have immediately unlocked it and placed it in my hand and said here see, nothing. But you didn’t. You can’t go back now. We’re done, and that’s not sinking in for you.”

He started to say how it’s not that he doesn’t trust me it’s just that he does have things on there. Things of a fetish nature. Which is so stupid to me that he felt the need to hide so intensely because I’m already aware of this fetish. He said he just has photos he’s save off of some websites like Twitter, discord, deviant art, etc of other girls and he just didn’t want me thinking that he knew those girls and was being sent those directly cause he was cheating. He then opened his phone and handed it to me. Unlocked. I said you’re not going to flip out if I look through messages, phone calls, emails, and your photo gallery? He just shook his head. I went through all of it with him over my shoulder. Nothing. No calls, emails, texts that weren’t to me, his family, his job, or just plain spam. I went through his gallery. Yeah, fetish type stuff. No surprise there. I said “why guard it like you do from me? I’m aware of what you’re into. I’m aware that at one point you’ve questioned your sexuality. I have done nothing but support you in everything, fetish, sexuality questioning and all. Why would you react in such an extreme way to me just wanting to do the most basic things on your phone to help you while you’re driving or having your hands full?” 

He said he didn’t know and started to go into about how his family has always been I guess oddly private with one another about majority of things. We started talking more and I brought up the fact that I have told him everything about my life and I had to find out certain details about his family through his brothers high school ex girlfriend back when we were first ever in the talking phase of our relationship. I said “a lot of these things I found out through her and you either never told me at all, your siblings or parents told me, or you didn’t tell me until literally like 5 years down the line of us dating. That’s a problem. That’s not normal. I shouldn’t be told deeply personal things about your upbringing and family dynamics through other people. I should hear them from you. I always just thought you’d tell me these things in your own time, but again you rarely, if ever did.”

The more we started to talk about this the more he realized that yeah, it’s not normal. And yeah he does need therapy. He said he’s going to look into if his job offers some sort of counseling/therapy through his benefits. I’m holding him to that. I told him “this is over if you can’t or won’t get help for this. We can’t go on with only one of us giving trust.” He agreed. I still partially think there’s more he’s hiding honestly. My trust in him right now is broken and I’ve been crying on and off. He sept on the couch last night. 

Thank you to everyone who gave me good advice on how to approach something like this and a big thank you to those of you that offered advice that wasn’t just ‘leave him’. I’m going to give him a chance to work on himself. If he actually doesn’t seek help? We’re done officially. I told him he now needs to build back my trust now too. He broke it. I’m exhausted. Unfortunately this pattern of me wanting to break up with him and him finally coming around when I’m at a breaking point is the usual. I hate it. I don’t know why I have to be wanting to end things with him in order for him to come around on whatever the issue is. 

Anyways thank you again. Hopefully he will keep his promise of seeking help. 

Original post

Hi Reddit, I’m a long time lurker and this is my first ever post. I’m also sorry in advanced for how long this one is, but I need some advice/insight, etc on this issue we’ve had since the beginning of our relationship.

I’ve had enough of my boyfriend’s weird behavior regarding his phone. My Boyfriend (26 M) and I (27 F) have been together for almost 10 years (will be 10 years in February of next year). We are high school sweethearts and met in high school when I was a senior and him a junior. Throughout our entire relationship he has just been downright weirdly defensive/guarding of his phone. I have never once in the almost 10 years together tried to look through it, take it or even touch it without his permission or knowing. I respect his boundaries and know that he is particular about his phone and laptop. Yet he has access to my phone. He knows my password and even has access to hidden things if he so desires. I’m a fully open book.

We’ve had conversations regarding this in the past and he has told me he is this way because his parents and/or siblings used to invade his privacy I guess and go through his stuff without him knowing or asking him. I told him repeatedly during those conversation that I “am not his mother or his siblings and I have never, nor would I ever, do that to you” to which he agreed and said I know you haven’t and I’ll work on it, etc. 

Well cut to in the car coming back home from the store this evening, he was trying to put on a specific song that we were talking about while he was driving. I told him “Hey you shouldn’t be handling your phone while driving I can look up/change the song for you since you already have Spotify up”. To which he kind of quickly reacted and said “No never mind, it’s fine.” as he promptly turned off his phone screen and put up his phone. 

I blew up on him. I said “why do you still react that way when I have never gone through your phone or even picked up your phone without you knowing or asking? You literally already had Spotify up, you could have just handed it to me and I could have quickly typed in the song and be done with it. Are you cheating? Are you hiding something? That kind of reaction is suspicious and akin to someone who is hiding things or cheating. You have full access to my phone, how is that fair? 10 years. 10 YEARS together pretty much and you STILL don’t trust me and act like you’re hiding things!”

He didn’t say anything until we pulled into our apartment parking lot and he just said “I think you already know why, I’ve already been over this” referencing his trust issues with his parents and siblings. I said “no, this is just straight up weird behavior. No one reacts that way to their significant other offering to simply change a song on their phone quickly without there being something to hide”. We didn’t say anything else to each other as we went inside and this brings us to now. I’m in the bathroom typing this asking Reddit for help or insight. 

Is this behavior something to be wary of or be concerned about? Is this truly some childhood trauma based thing or is it deeper than just his childhood trust issues? Could he actually be talking to other girls or cheating? Could he be hiding some weird things on his phone? I mean this is making me question who the heck this person I’ve been with for almost a decade really is. I’m tired of it. I love him so much and we do want to get married, but I don’t want to be with someone who can’t trust me enough to just simply let me change a song on his phone. 

I realize this probably sounds ridiculous or like I’m over reacting, but like said this has been an ongoing issue for the entirety of our relationship with ebbs and flows of it getting better only for a tiny bit after bringing it up again. Is this something I should be really worried about? If it is how do I approach talking with him about this? How can we get over this if him ‘working on it’ never actually amounts to anything? Sorry for all the loaded questions, I’m at my wits end. 

For more context this man has been caught many, many times in stupid white lies. Which in and of itself is a whole other issue. So this is a person who has a tendency to be on the defense, lie, and hide even the silliest of things.

ANSWER: There's a lot of these "I'm 23 and I've been with my boyfriend for 10 years" kinda posts and I just want to point out that maybe a decision you made when you were a child probably isn't gonna pan out very well into your adulthood.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (30m) move on from my (28f) wife dating by best friend?

She decided she wanted a divorce and she thinks we “aren’t good together”. After trying to convince her otherwise for a month I just figured fuck it I’ll give her what she wants. So now that’s what we’re going through. And a month and a half after we have been separated she’s now dating my best friend of 17 years. I guess I should call him an ex best friend.

Who really needs enemies when you have friends like that? The worst part is I work with this “friend” on a regular basis. Everyday I want to cuss him out but I don’t want to bring drama to work.

My reaction was furious at first, but now I’ve just come to realize that no matter how long you’ve been with someone you truly never really know them. And no matter how long you’ve been friends with somebody they will stab you in the back at the first sign that it benefits them.

Parts of me want to scream at them both and tell them how I feel but I think I’ll fall on deaf ears. I also don’t really know how to start over. I was with my wife for 6 years. Feels like I don’t even know how to talk to people anymore because it’s just been me and her for so long.

ANSWER: Be grateful you don't have kids. You're still young, look for a different job with a payrise (you could move anywhere if there's somewhere you've always wanted to try). I'm sorry man, that's really shitty. If at all possible find a way to remove them from your lives completely.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My husband (31M) switched up on me (31F) after moving in together.

How do you know if this can be worked on or if he’s just shown his true colors and I’ve made a mistake in marriage? 

We’ve been living together for just over a year now and just got married a month ago. As soon as we signed the paperwork on our house together, all effort on his end to uphold our relationship was thrown out the window. I had to deal with the bills 100% and it was expected of me to handle all relationship responsibilities. It was on me to inspect if we needed any updates to the house, the cooking, the cleaning, the upkeeping - all me. I was so excited that we would have infinite time to spend with each other while working on the house, but it was the complete opposite. I was overwhelmed and tired out from painting the walls and maintaining the cleanliness to thinking about and buying what we needed for our house. After many long conversations, it finally got a bit better after half a year when it clicked for him that it was helpful to me for him to contribute to our house too. 

Fast forward a few more months and we get married only for his efforts to slowly dwindle. I think I am so afraid of conflict after everything that I was okay with solely carrying the weight of our relationship. But after a certain point I guess it’s taking a huge toll on me and I end up snapping. I hate it when I have to nag or repeat myself to ask for help and especially in a relationship when I’m supposed to feel seen and respected. He’s shown lots of micro aggressions throughout our relationship but somehow I’ve ignored them. It’s finally shed light on me who he really is this past week when my open enrollment for health insurance began. I was deciding on keeping my insurance or going on his and splitting it with him and which one would be best should we procreate. After a lot of reading and thinking, I just wanted to gather his opinions and reassure myself if I was making the correct decision by asking him if he could go through his benefits. Much to my surprise, he scoffed and made it seem like it was a huge inconvenience to his day and that “since I’m the one carrying the baby, that he has no responsibility to go over the insurance”. I was taken aback. The argument started there and escalated to him yelling in my face and me looking away. I’m still traumatized by that statement and haven’t spoken to him since then. It’s made me reconsider my whole existence and this marriage. If I have a baby with him, am I going to be a single mom to two children? 

Tl;dr my newly wed husband has flipped personalities on me and is taking zero accountability in our relationship while I am carrying the entire load of this relationship and navigating marriage alone. 

For context, we’ve been together for 5 years.

Edit: we split the bills but I have to manage all the issues and setting up that it comes with. 

Update: wow didn’t expect to get so many comments. I’m reading through every single one and processing.. thank you!!

ANSWER: Honey you're already a single mom, you're literally raising an adult male. You've been taking care of all the responsibilities by yourself and now this man is showing you that he doesn't care. 🤔 Did I miss anything else?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I 27 F just broke things off with my 28 M fiancé, did I make the right move?

We’ve been engaged for almost two years. Last night, after I came home from a trip, we got into a pretty big fight, a discussion that we have had multiple times. In the last year and a half, my fiancé has had 10 jobs. He doesn’t stay at them for more than a month and a half. The longest I’ve seen was 10 weeks. He either walks out on them without finding another job to back it up, or he gets fired for various reasons. I’ve needed a lot of help financially and in the last few months, he has not paid his half of rent or utilities. He sometimes pays for groceries, but you can’t live off of pizza rolls and taquitos. He also doesn’t have a car because he’s said that his doctor told his vision is too bad for it and that he was going to go blind in 8 years. This has been a big issue for me because I work all the time practically, 2-3 jobs, to make ends meet. I’m exhausted and ready to pull my hair out because the bills just pile on and Ive expressed to him that I feel like I’ve been taking on everything by myself. Here’s where I’m at a stand point: he’s had a couple of people in his life pass away in the last year, so the grief has been hard for him. I’ve made sure that I’ve been there for him and to remind him that he’s loved. And I’ve always made sure that he had an ear to listen to and support. It’s to the point where sometimes all he does is sit in a dark room and play video games. He sometimes will go a couple of days without eating. I have begged and pleaded with him to go get help, but he refuses every time and says that he’s fine. I had to go visit some family recently, and when I came back from my trip, all of the food in our house was gone, and when I asked if he had eaten, he said, “Not for two days.” This infuriated me. I’m not exactly sure why it did. But I was pissed. We got into a big fight and one thing led to another, I broke things off. He begged and pleaded to stay together, but I just can’t bring myself to say yes. I don’t want us to hurt each other anymore. I want to be there for my fiancé but I’ve hit my breaking point. I feel like the biggest jerk. 

UPDATE:
Thank you so much everyone! I’m sorry to a lot of you who I didn’t get a chance to reply to. Your feedback was very needed, I didn’t expect this much of a response lol. 
To answer some questions, before we got engaged, he held it together, a regular job that he had and was taking better care of himself, something I should’ve specified at the beginning, that is my fault. Hence why I came on here to ask because I was second guessing if this was normal with grief and that there was something that I was overlooking or I wasn’t being sensitive to. I have lost people in the past but it’s been years. I’ve been talking to some mutual friends and I guess he had a habit in the past of…over exaggerating his health problems? Something I didn’t clock in on because I never want to invalidate anyones health problems. I put research into some of the things he was saying and…yikes. He is moving out. His family (who lives in another country) found out about his job stuff (I didn’t know that they didn’t know) and were PISSED. I guess they blew up his phone😅. I’m starting therapy again soon, something I couldn’t afford for a long time. 

Thank you again everyone, I really appreciate the response. I’m taking some time to reassess my boundaries.

ANSWER: Good decision, cut your losses, don't fall for the sunk cost fallacy. You are young, get rid of this leech, stay strong, he might be a hard habit to break but you absolutely deserve better.

QUESTION: My (F30) mother in law sent my husband (M33) a message saying she is cutting us off. It’s been a few days and she’s now messaged and asked what we want for Christmas.

We have had a good relationship for years but there has been tension recently because my mother in law has meddled in my marriage. My husband made it clear that he and I stand together and have taken a bit of a step back from her. Due to the fact we haven’t messaged as much, my MIL said she is cutting us all off including the children. She said she’ll always love us but that’s as far as it goes. 
Now a few days later, she’s messaging asking what we want for Christmas.
How would you tackle this? It’s just such a ridiculous situation

ANSWER: I would just ignore her.  Ghost and no response.  She wants to be cut off, let her be.  If and when she is willing to start acting like a human, and not some crazy weirdo, maybe she can apologize and earn back the trust she broke.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Expanding my 30f and bf’s 29M sex life

Myself (30 F) and my boyfriend (29 M) have been discussing branching out in our sex life. He had several really good experiences with threesomes in his previous relationship and has expressed a desire to do that with me if I was comfortable. Right now I am not comfortable with that-  but the idea intrigues me. There’s definitely aspects of it that turn me on. 
I thought of the idea of someone giving my bf a blowjob in front of me. That seems hot and i could test the waters to see if that turns me on more. It would be a way to feel it out without intercourse being involved. 
My question is- it seems difficult to find someone to just want to give my bf a blowjob without any sex involved. We talked about getting a sex worker but we both didn’t love that idea if we didn’t need to. 
Any ideas of how to go about this?

ANSWER: So, say you find a person to just give a blowjob. It’s happening, you’re watching. He starts reacting to the blowjob in ways that you’ve rarely seen or heard him that turned on. He cums hard, and is wow’ed by the experience. How do you feel? 

Are you going to be envious that another person was better than you? If it’s a woman, will you start comparing yourself to her? If he brings up wanting to do it again, will you wonder you can’t please him?

If you think you’ll be totally secure, go with the sex worker. It will be more of a business arrangement & the chances of it somehow turning into more won’t be there.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Is it weird that my (22F) fiance (24M) won’t let me come to any work events after 4.5 years together?

We have been together for over 4 years. We own a house together, we own a dog and two cats together, we have been engaged for a few months now and plan to get married in April. Anyways, he’s been in the marines for over 3 years now. He has never once let me go to any military event, no balls, no hang outs with his military friends, nothing. I’ve never met them or talked to any of them. They might as well not even know I exist. The next marine ball is next month, and I asked him if he was going to invite me this year since we’re engaged now. He got very defensive and insisted he wanted to be able to party with his marines for the weekend and I was being intrusive. I was hurt by this, and vented to my best friend (23F), at which point she discussed it with her boyfriend, who’s best friends with my fiance.

During this, her boyfriend admitted to me that my fiance had invited HIM to the ball, but he declined because he “knows what he would be doing there and didn’t want to be involved in that”. He said military balls are comprised of three main things: a cake cutting ceremony, getting drunk, and getting laid. This has really concerned me. At this point I wonder if his marine friends even know I exist. I’ve tried bringing this up to my fiance and his response to my long speech was “it’s not that deep”, which made me storm out of the room in frustration. Why do you think he’s doing this, and am I being overdramatic?

ANSWER: As a FORMER Air Force wife the red flags are flagging 🚩🚩🚩😬. We were married for 12 years and I NEVER went to a ball - and in divorce I had over 30 affidavits from women he’d slept with. Save yourself from this trauma. I’d seriously start making an exit plan, even his best freaking friend talked shit About him.

================================================================================

QUESTION: [Update] My (33M) wife (31F) is having an emotional affair. Is divorce the right choice? Ty

I ended up having the confrontation early last week. It wasn’t exactly when I had planned it but she knew something was up as I had emotionally checked out over the few days leading up to it.

Some background info I learned/not provided in the original post. The texting had gone about a week total. It turns out I had discovered it pretty early on. Although they have texted a lot for the last few years (I’ve seen them in the past and there was nothing like this/genuinely just work related stuff). There was also a lot of remarks about the intimacy between us fizzling out indicating that it may be a sign of the affair being physical. Our intimacy has dried out for the last year or so. We had chalked it up to stress, work, hormones, depression up to this point. 

In terms of the confrontation, there was no arguing or fireworks. I laid out a lot of grievances about the betrayal and the incredible disrespect I felt. I also pointed out the rage I felt over the hypocrisy of accusing all men of cheating for years. She swore up and down that nothing physical occurred between them. I get it is naive of me to believe it, but for various reasons I do. When I initially threatened to tell the other guys wife, was when the first wave of defensiveness began. She begged me not to “ruin their family with a new baby and focus on fixing our marriage instead.” I was also told how the OBS will definitely tell all their coworkers and “now both her home life and work life will be ruined.” They are both contractually bound to working together for the next 5 years (residency). 

Her reasoning was that I have not made her feel desired/like a woman in a long time. That she “gave into hormones” as he was saying things that “made her feel craved.” Multiple times I did feel like the situation was minimized. Statements such as “nothing physical happened it was JUST sexting” have not sat well with me. I also felt like I was being blamed for this. To clarify, we have talked in the past about trying to be more “romantic” and stuff of that sort. I still feel like that does not mean doing this crap is acceptable. I admitted plenty of my shortcomings during the confrontation but also reaffirmed that what she did was so insanely wrong.

I also reached out to the guy. He was clearly panicked and swore up and down nothing physical happened. He begged me not to tell his wife and ruin his life. He claimed his son is “his entire world” which I rebuffed by saying all he did was complain about him to my wife. Not long after he blocked me on everything and was texting my wife to “not let your husband move out” and “is he going to ruin my life now?”

I wish I could say that I took my pets and stormed off and moved out like I dreamt up in my head. Sadly, all I did was move out of our room and demand time and space. She has been saying she will respect that, but has been persistently approaching me asking to talk about our marriage for the last several days. 

My emotions have ranged from complete rage to completely dead inside. I have just been right working or in the bed sleeping for 14 hours a day at this point. I know I’m checked out at this point. I’ve been fighting passive suicidal ideation wishing for a car to crash into me or just to not wake up. I can assure all that I have no active plans of self harm and that is not the point of this post. I feel like my entire life has been turned upside down. I recently established with a therapist for the first time in my life (plenty of childhood trauma for terrible parents) and she has been telling me that I am mourning a life I thought I had. Truthfully I am just over all of this and everything. I have definitely just got into self protection mode now.

A few days ago, she asked me if I would be willing to see a marriage counselor with her. I begrudgingly agreed. During our first session, I admitted I am unsure if I want to save this marriage or not. I was not a very active participant as I was quite checked out (it had only been like 3 days since confrontation). We have more appointments coming up. I have told her that I am unsure I will ever get over this betrayal. I have also told her it is clear we have significant incompatibilities. She has been begging me to try as we have been together for so long so clearly “something works about us.” She has been trying to be affectionate the last couple days and getting me to reciprocate (hold her hand, give a kiss, compliment her, etc).

I have not told the other guys wife yet. I have not decided if I will or won’t. Morally I know the absolute correct decision is to tell her. However, as mad as I am at my wife, I am not trying to just ruin her entire life. I am not out to get revenge on people. I grew up with enough confrontation and am definitely a non-confrontational person now. I have also not ruled out telling her yet but am just thinking on it.

I apologize for how much this post is just a rambling mess. All in all, emotionally I feel dead inside. I have lost all joy in my life and am just doing the motions. I do not know if I will be able to get over this to save the marriage and I do not know if I want to save the marriage. Our lives are just so intertwined that splitting will be such a difficult and miserable process. My closest friend is the only person who knows and they have made it clear that divorce would be their only choice if they were in my shoes. I am lucky to have had their support during this but I do feel guilty for just trauma dumping this situation. I know most replies will be that I should have already started the divorce process and I wish it was that easy. I will value advice and I know quite a few people had asked for updates. I definitely missed a lot of info and will try to reply as I can. Thank you. 

Edit: for clarification, yes I have a large chunk of these texts documented and saved. I do not know if I will ever get over this. When I told her that I don’t m know if I’ll ever get past this she told me how she knows that I “hold grudges against people” referencing my poor relationship with my parents these days. I definitely feel like there’s been minimizing of the situation but she frames it as “trying to move forward and learn from the situation”


Edit 2: I thought I had linked the original post but it’s not showing up for me so I have attached it below

Edit 3: I also just learned that he texted her last night to complain about some work situation to her. I was told they were completely done speaking to each other but it turns out the only person getting blocked is him blocking me after I confronted him

Edit 4: the sentiment is pretty clear. How intertwined our lives are makes the prospect of splitting that much more miserable. Our families are very close now, we share the same group of friends, work in the same hospital. I think the cowardice of dealing with all that is definitely affecting my thinking 

Edit 5: for the people who keep asking, we live in NYS. Also, for the people who are just messaging me super hateful stuff, I would appreciate not getting that crap. I recognize im not thinking straight right now

Update 2

I have received a lot of messages asking about updates. I will like the original post and the first update below. For background we have been together for 13 years and married for 4. No kids

She does seem to be showing true remorse recently. She has been very open about how badly she messed up and destroyed all our trust.  I can’t say whether this remorse has moved me at all. I still feel checked out.

I’ve just been coming home from work and sleeping the rest of the day. She tries to get me to cuddle or hug her but honestly I just feel so empty at this point it’s just going through the motions. I do actually feel bad about how I’ve been but this has just struck me so deeply at this point.

She has broken off all contact (it seems) with the other guy. She’s blocked him on everything and avoids him at work (according to her). I’ve told her that I am always going to have this bit of distrust in the back of my mind now.

We have been continuing therapy but honestly it still feels like it’s her trying to justify the circumstances that led to the affair. We have clearly identified a lot of huge incompatibilities in our relationship. She wants to fight to change and be stronger and I just don’t even respond still.

I feel like this affair validated so many self-doubts. My entire childhood was spent being screamed at about how everything I did was wrong. And not it feels like I’m being told what I did wrong to lead to being cheated on. Sometimes it seems like she understands the gravity and sometimes she’s trying to minimize it so we can “move forward.”

The last few weeks have been awful. I’ve been struggling between being completely numb and seething with self hatred. I have not felt this lonely in my life since I was a kid. I have been confiding with 2 friends, but at this point I feel like it’s just pushing them away so I won’t be anymore. I’m surrounded by a larger group of fair weather friends who can’t be depended on for anything. My family will never understand divorce as in this stupid immigrant culture you tolerate anything to stay married. I just am crumbling from the inside and don’t even feel like I have the strength to make a decision. I go to sleep every night hoping I don’t wake up as I just want out of this now. Swallowing the pill that essentially half my life is being thrown away is unbearable. I recognize how easy it is to say that divorce is the right choice but it doesn’t make it any easier.

Apologies for the rambling

[Update 3?]

I wanted to give an update about this situation. The last month has had me in a very dark place. I have continued to feel like there’s many many moments of minimizing what happened and many moments of true remorse. I became paralyzed by the stress and shut down.

This week I made the decision to move out. I packed the essentials and booked a hotel. (Her parents paid a huge chunk of that house so I’m not asking her to leave). I’ve begun reflecting on everything and I see that our relationship has been trying to get past some horrible incompatibilities. I finally have my answer that divorce is the right option. We are not happy together. She cheated and I’ll never get over that. She is begging not to but I will be telling her that I am done.

And for the APs wife. I will tell her too.

ANSWER: "Please don't ruin our lives," say the people whose actions are the sole reason why their lives would be ruined.

You have said yourself that you don't know if you'll ever be able to get over this betrayal. Is it still raw? Sure- but if anything, I think that's more of a push for you to at least have a trial separation from her.

I agree that it sounds more like you're mourning the life you thought you had than your actual relationship. At this point, don't keep going through the motions just to make HER happy. She sure as hell didn't care about your feelings when she started this whole mess.

And forget their begging and guilt-tripping. They made their bed, they can lie in it. The OBS also deserves to know. Who says the guy doesn't/didn't have other 'relationships' that would put the health of both her and her baby in danger?

================================================================================

QUESTION: (29M) My gf (25F) hooked up with someone 3 hours after our first date

Hey guys I’m just looking for some advice on how to proceed and approaches you’d take. Title says it all but I found out that she texted some guy she’d been hooking up with 20 minutes after we’d left each other to go meet up/fuck. I confronted her about it and she initially tried lying but the messages were pretty explicit and she eventually admitted/apologized. I know we weren’t “exclusive” but it really feels like I was the second choice and if the hook up would’ve committed to her then she’d choose to be with him. We’ve been together for 4 months now and I really want to move past this but I think with this hanging over the relationship is going to create a lot of issues moving forward. I don’t know if I can trust, especially when their first instinct is to lie and cover up. Does anyone have any similar experiences or advice for me please? 

Update for anyone interested: I broke things off, thank you all for weighing in. Definitely agree it’s too early to be dealing with this shit and no trust from the very first day isn’t what I’m going for. Appreciate and love you all.

ANSWER: Tbh you most likely won't be able to come back from this, its one of those sure no one really did "cheat" but feelings do not tend to care about technicality like that.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I’m (29F) no longer excited about marrying my boyfriend (29M) after asking for a year?


I’ve been with my boyfriend for 10 years, and over the past year we’ve had a lot of disagreements about marriage. These last three months I’ve dropped it and haven’t even mentioned it once. The big thing was He told me he wouldn’t get married until his debt (student loans and car) was paid off, which wouldn’t be until we were 35. We’re 29 now. I told him I didn’t want to wait that long and that I wasn’t sure I could keep dating him if our timelines were that different.

Recently, he suddenly said he’s ready to get engaged. It completely shocked me, and I didn’t react very excited. He noticed and said he didn’t understand why I wasn’t happy, and that I put pressure on him and now im not satisfied. 

I really love this person, but we disagreed about this for so long that now I don’t even know how to feel. I just thought if I was ever to get married it would be exciting and now I just feel sad? I never thought I would have to beg someone to marry me and I feel rejected because we argued about it for so long. I think I understand him saying that he’s giving me what I want and I’m still not happy so I’m confused on why I’m also not happy. 

How would you feel if your partner didn’t want to get married and then suddenly agreed?

ANSWER: I wouldn't marry someone that I had to pressure into marrying me. Hard stop. Also him saying "I'm giving you what you want" is a MASSIVE red flag. He should also want to marry you. It should be mutual.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I’m so tired of my mom (50F)?forcing “equality” between me (22F) and my sister (20F)

I’m honestly exhausted by how my mom insists on this “forced equality” thing between me and my sister. Why can’t I just have my own identity, my own things, without my mom making sure my sister gets the exact same stuff too?

I sell preloved items online including some of my mom’s stuff. I’m the one putting in the effort: listing, packing, paying for shipping, and going to the post office. Yet when I make money, my mom says I have to split it evenly with my sister. Like… why? She doesn’t help at all. At least let it be 70-30 if she’s not contributing. Plus, I give her 100% for her stuff.

It’s the same story with education. I got into a top college, and my sister didn’t. My mom went through insane lengths to get her into the same faculty and field as me, even though my sister wanted to study something else. Now we have different class schedules but share one car, so one of us has to wait around campus for hours every day. It’s absurd.

Even when we were kids, my mom made sure that whenever it was one of our birthdays, both of us got gifts “to be fair.” It’s always been like that.

I know wanting fairness between kids is normal, but this feels excessive. I just wish I had something that was mine for once, something not automatically shared or mirrored. I tried talking to my sister about it but is my mom’s number 1 fan.

ANSWER: Is your mom working out some issues from her own childhood? Maybe she had a sibling who was the "favourite" and she always felt left out? 

How does your sister feel about this - is there any chance you guys could work together as a united front to push back on this weirdness?

QUESTION: [Update] Is it fair or me 27F to tell my husband 34M that he can't move with us if he isn't employed

I wasn't honest in my first post. Just like I lm not honest and lie to most people in my life right now. I guess it is the unbelievable amount of shame I carry. 

It is true that my husband was fired in January. The real reason is bc he had a workplace injury the previous summer. He completely tore up his knee. Had major surgery. Rehab. The company was extremely helpful in his recovery. 

Then his prescriptions ran out. Found out later he started buying pain pills off the streets. Which, ya, isn't oxy-whatever. It's basically just fentanyl these days. 

So as a consequence of a ramping up addiction he could no longer hide, I had kicked him out. Then he got fired. He went through periods of in patient and out patient and AA and therapy and suboxone (maybe) and drugs for depression and drugs for anxiety and everything else we could think of, and all the while we were living separate lives because he was a danger to children.

Why am I still so attached? How the fuck was any of us supposed to forsee this happening. You fall deeply in love. You get the ring and the kids. Life is going pretty good, always with its challenges but that is just like life. It is fucking hard. 

I'm not even sure what the point of my post was. It didn't really make much sense because yeah he is an able person, why can't he just get a job, come on dude. Or be a stay at home dad. Yall… i would have loved to give him that privilege. If only. But people with substance issues can't really keep a job. Definitely cant be around kids.

A lot of people read my post. Took time out of their day. Most of it was just criticizing us but i mean that is what everyone does to everybody most of the time in real life too. Still, I have been feeling some type of way about it all being based on a lie. 

I want a life with him. He does love his kids. This isn't how it was supposed to go. 

Then to top it all off, he has, because of his addiction issues, caught slick 5 charges in the last 5 or so months. Been wrecking cars first his then whatever family was stupid enough to allow him to drive them. Legally isn't allowed to drive. After I posted this he got arrested for driving without a license. 

I already wasn't sure how in the fucking world I could salvage our relationship. Love was the only thing keeping me from cutting him off completely.

His family and I are going to push for him remaining in jail/then prison and hopefully get him placed in hopefully a more substance recovery based program, but yall know how fucked the US prison systems are. Most likely he will be general population, get even worse mentally, and God forbid it but may eventually be saying final goodbyes. My priority at this point has passed protecting him and moved on to protecting the general public from him. 

For now, at least he is safe? If you consider jail/prison safe. Which i sure as shit don't but at least he won't OD. Right?? Repeat to myself, it is out of my hands. Just like this whole experience has been. 

Fuck yall i don't even know anymore. My family says they are proud of me for holding it together. I'm sure they are disappointed in a lot of things ive done, not just keeping the door open this long. Ive been so dumb throughout my 20s. I know I can do better in my decision making. 

Most of all, I want stability for my children. I've decided that I will be serving him with divorce papers once he gets officially sentenced. It is just a damn shame. I loved the person he was before all this chaos so much yall don't even know. Him holding our two little twins in the hospital? The dad who cried when I gave him a card saying ‘Baby A loves you and will see you soon daddy’ (this was after something like after my 20 month scan i cant specifically remember now)… then I  handed him a second card that said ‘Baby B loves you too and can't wait to meet you as well.’

I cry every time I think about that. I'm crying right now. 

How do I accept that I can't have that life with him? I just don't know. I'm just so heartbroken. 

In short, yeah, we will be moving into the apartment without him. We will be moving on completely in life without him. 

Maybe one day he can join us again and we will have more special and meaningful days. Maybe not. It's out of my hands. 

I appreciate yall. Yall can tear me up for all this. That's perfectly fine. I deserve it too I'm not a saint. I've said horrible things to him throughout this time. I have been so angry and resentful from how this past year and a half has played out. 

But I'm ready to finally move on. 

I'm just gonna leave this here and probably not return to this account. For those of you out there that are dealing with anything like I have, I'm so fucking sorry. It destroys not just the addicts life, but anyone who cares about them. As long as you care about them. And it isn't ever, ever easy to say goodbye to someone you love. Not in normal circumstances, or the extreme. Just know that you are not alone. I tried al anon but wasn't able to establish a community. There are resources and genuinely caring people and support out there if you need that. 

Take care yall.

ANSWER: Thats a heavy and heartbreaking story! You are very strong! Also, suffering such an injury must be a heavy hit, we are all just people. I wish you all the best, even in those dark times when light is scarce! Be here for your kids and yourself, don't hesitate to ask for help whoever you can - you don't have to face this alone! Find therapy if you can. And if you still have energy, be here for your husband if you want to - as a person that worked with addict - having family that cares about you is an absolute game changer for such a person. But again, put yourself first.

================================================================================

QUESTION: The Worst Thing My Wife (24F) Could Have Ever Done To Me (26M)

There's a lot to explain but a quick backstory, my wife and I have been together since high school. Her Dad was never in her life but she's had a very supportive Mom. After high school we went to different colleges and while I was away at college, my wife had reconnected with her father. She was excited to find out more about him since he wasn't around while she was growing up, and I was excited for her to be able to get to know him.

Just before I finished school her father took a job several states away and she hasn't been able to see him since. They've kept in touch through email and sporadic phone calls to keep each other updated, but I've never met or spoken to him. After I finished my degree we moved in together and tied the knot. We had a beautiful wedding surrounded by friends and family, but her father wasn't invited because my wife hadn't told her mother that she reconnected with her father. I felt that it was wrong to keep it a secret, but I didn't say anything because that was her truth to tell and it was my place to say anything.

We've been married for 2 years now, and a month ago I couldn't imagine a life without her. Now I'm not sure if I can ever look at my wife again. (end of back story)

A couple months ago my wife announced that her Dad was coming for a visit, and possibly moving to be closer to her. She was ecstatic and her smile has always been the highlight of my day, so we were both happy to hear the news. We talked about the possibility of having him moving in with us short term until he could find a place of his own. And to give her credit in the situation, she seemed as if she was more concerned with how I felt and she wanted to make sure I would be okay with it. I told her that would be fine with me and I absolutely supported her reconnecting with her Dad, but I also said it would be hard to know for sure because I've never met him and don't know much about him. This was all pre-emptive conversation to see how we both felt about the situation and her Dad moving closer to us wasn't a certainty yet, but it felt like we were on the same page.

Well last month her Dad got into town and we took him out to dinner at a local Italian restaurant. Once we got to the restaurant she suddenly became distant and I immediately felt like something was off.  When she saw her dad she immediately ran up and jumped in his arms, except when she did this she wrapped her legs around him mid air and he proceeded to walk inside holding her like a child. This was completely out of character for her, and I had no idea how to even react to my 24 year old wife being carried into a restaurant like a 6 year old child. After that moment I felt like the third wheel for the entire evening. She never introduced me to him, which I thought was odd. When I introduced myself I don't think he ever even looked at me. Every time I tried to join the conversation, it's like I wasn't there. And my wife who doesn't normally drink was suddenly having several glasses of wine. 

I was trying best to not overreact because this was her dad that she didn't get to know growing up, and she hasn't been able to see him in a couple of years. But it didn't feel like we were at a family dinner, it felt like I was watching my wife while she was on a date with an older man. They were whispering to each other, holding hands, telling stories and laughing. The entire night felt inappropriate and maybe I was misreading the entire situation, but I just couldn't wait to leave. I figured we would talk about everything when we got home, but while walking to the car my wife yelled out, "Just follow us!" 

To my surprise and without conversation she had apparently decided that her dad would be staying at our house after all. When I said we hadn't talked about him staying there, she blew up and yelled that we definitely talked about it and agreed that he should. I was shocked because she has never yelled at me before. I tried to remind her that I also said it would be hard to know for sure if I was comfortable with him staying with us because I've never met him and don't know much about him. To that she responded, "now you've met him, so it's fine!"

We didn't talk the rest of the way home and as soon as we got there it was just a continuation of our night at the restaurant, except somehow worse. They decided to continue drinking and opened another bottle of wine. Her "Father" was now being slightly flirtatious and kind of handsy which was making me nauseous. At this point it felt like an episode of Black Mirror and I had enough, I decided I was leaving and would stay at a hotel. Without saying a word I packed a bag. When I walked through the living room towards the door my wife freaked out asking where I was going and why. That's when everything that I had bottled up from the entire evening came spilling out.

I told her how I felt they had been inappropriate all night, how overwhelmingly uncomfortable I had been, and how for the first time since we met I don't recognize her. She started telling me that I was being ridiculous and that I was overreacting. She said that I needed to "loosen up". While yelling back and forth I told her that I wasn't interested in being around her or her father if that's how they insisted on acting. After several minutes of us yelling back and forth her dad blurted out, "Just tell him!"

Both of us starred at each other and I was stunned by what that could have meant. That's when she began confessing to me that this man was not her real dad... I was shocked, and speechless, and somewhat relieved, and extremely confused. My heart was in my throat and a cold sweat engulfed me.

She continued telling me that while I was away at college, she had met Don (fake name) at a party and they were seeing each other off and on. And while cheating on me she had developed a kink for role play and would pretend that Don was her father when they slept together. She told me that Don did take a job in another state and that she had kept in touch with him, all this time telling me that he was her father. When he told her that he was moving back she had hoped that he would be able to move in with us. Permanently.

Suddenly a lot of things started making sense, things I hadn't questioned. The reason he wasn't at our wedding, the reason she never told her mother, the reason I hadn't met him or talked to him until now. I took the man that slept with my wife to dinner, then paid for it.

I didn't say anything to her. I just walked out, threw up in the yard, and left. I've been staying at a hotel for a month now just trying to process the entire situation. I haven't told my family anything, I haven't talked to coworkers, I just feel like I'm in survival mode. She's tried calling several times and she's left voice messages to come home to "them" and that we can work things out together. 

I've always tried to be rational and logical, but I have no idea what to do. 

Do I get divorced? Well.. Obviously I have to get divorced. But how do I explain any of this to friends or family? Would it be easier to just change my name and disappear? Do I leave the country? If I do start over how could I ever trust anyone again when I've spent a third of my life getting to know someone, and it turns out I never actually knew them?

ANSWER: This must be fake, but if not, tell her family and your family the truth.  Get a lawyer and file for divorce.  Have all communication go through the lawyer and never talk to her again.  When everything is done, move to be close to just your family and friends and cut her and everything about her out of your life.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (33F) husband (33M) nit picks and over reacts about everything and I am considering leaving him

My husband goes through phases where he seems to be angry or annoyed at me and nit picks the smallest things. We’ve been together 12 years.

Tonight, it was because I had left dishes in the sink and some used food packages when serving dinner (I was going to clean up after dinner!). I always clean up after dinner, tonight I had our toddler attached to me but still managed to make a really nice meal and simply didn’t have time to clean up/put dishes in the dishwasher before eating. I got upset and said he was being unreasonable but he said I ‘always do this’ and I shouldn’t be leaving a mess. I feel he should have been grateful for the food- he was more angry about ‘having to clean up’ (and made a point of doing so before dinner) than the fact I cooked dinner.

Some previous other examples include being extremely annoyed I took ‘too long’ to breastfeed our newborn, complaining and being miserable on our overseas holiday as he didn’t know it would be different to travel with children, making me feel bad for working on a weekend to make extra money for our family, being annoyed over little things to the point of not talking to me for a few days.

He is the breadwinner however I still work 3 x a week. I would also say I manage most of the household- doing the clothes washing, cleaning, groceries, meal planning, cooking, organising all childcare, all holiday celebrations and gifts for his family. There are many, many things I could nit pick too but I don’t.

After our overseas holiday where he was just awful, I did talk to him and said I was considering wanting to separate as I was not happy with how things were. He agreed he was a little depressed and he would change things. However, tonight I feel things have gone back to his moodiness/unreasonable behaviour. I wasn’t brought up to be treated like this and I’m beginning to think I would be happier being alone. It would be hard as we have a child.

I don’t know if it’s unreasonable to want to leave someone like this?

ANSWER: He complained you took to long to breastfeed ?! Wtf is wrong with the guy. The rest is just as bad. OP, you know this isn’t right and goes way beyond ‘nitpicking’. I’m sure he has good sides too, but literally nothing can make up for being this awful to you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (30F) older half sister (36F) has stopped speaking to me after I got married to my husband (32M)

My (30) older half sister (36) has slowly been cutting contact with me since I got married to my husband (32). Please be kind because I really don’t know how to handle this situation.

For background, I have had a really close relationship with my older half sister since I was around 12. I am no contact with my mother (we do not have the same mom) due to her complicity of physical abuse from my stepdad and my older half sister really stepped up to fill a role I needed in my life. She has been there for me for relationship advice, career advice, and always as someone to talk to. We share another half sister (all the same dad, different moms) and had a group chat where we all would talk daily. I got married in May and we haven’t spoken since the first day of my honeymoon. I really miss it and I don’t even understand what went so wrong.

Before you think this may have to do with the person I married - she never said anything negative about him nor did she ever even attempt to dissuade me from getting married. In fact, it was quite the opposite, she would reaffirm that she believed we were truly in love and a great couple. I would have no reason to think she was upset about the union itself.

On my wedding night, no one in either of our families or the wedding coordinator I hired got our gifts and they were later stolen along with an envelope with a large sum of cash. This highly upset me. 3 days after the wedding, when I realized no one got the gifts, I immediately asked my family in a group chat what they knew. I mostly received half hearted responses and this frustrated me even more. I then texted my older sister and expressed my frustration at the lack of urgency because my husband and I hadn’t received much, and what we did was stolen. It felt violating. She immediately responded blaming my husband and I’s friends in the wedding party saying that they had already stolen “an extreme amount of items” so we should ask them and not the family.

This response took me aback, because no one had even alluded to this to either my husband or I. For context, this was a backyard wedding and we got ready in homes my family lives in on the property. None of my siblings live there, only my dad and grandfather in separate houses. My husband and I had both mentioned during the wedding that the amount of caters and vendors going in and out of the home without any supervision was concerning and someone should probably supervise at least. I tried to explain this to her and said I felt my perspective was more likely, given that my husband and I witnessed the vendors having direct access and going into the room where items (not my gifts) were supposedly stolen.

She immediately dismissed this thought and asked if I thought her child (my nephew and ring bearer in the wedding) was a liar. Again, this took me aback because she never even mentioned that he witnessed this and just opened with your friends are thieves so start there. I responded no? You never said he witnessed that until just now so how would I have known? She then said that multiple other children confirmed this and then a few text messages layered said she herself witnessed it. She kept insisting my husband and I “have no real friends” and saying some really mean and hurtful things about their character, who mind you, she met the majority of that weekend. We both went to college out of state and most of the wedding party were college friends who have never

Her thought process just seemed very odd and not like the person I’ve known… I again expressed my frustration with her disparaging remarks about people she barely knew for a few hours, because apparently over 15 people that she’s never had contact with before are all “evil to the core” - and apparently all 15 stole gifts - one being larger than a suitcase itself - to get on flights the next day. The fees they would have had to pay in extra baggage would have been a greater value than just buying the items outright. She insisted that one of my bridesmaids was a cheater saying she slept with the best man (both are married) and kept repeating “ask that skank liar, thief, and whore and I bet she knows exactly where it all went”

These responses honestly astounded me because I have NEVER heard her speak so aggressively towards me in over 17 years of an extremely close relationship. I just kept expressing disbelief asking what she was talking about, and then she told me to “stop blaming family and blame both of your terrible friends.” I said no I just believe it was a vendor, I don’t think anyone in the family stole from me! And she went back into another rant about the above bridesmaid in particular.

At this point, I am visibly upset, crying, shaking because I don’t even understand where this is coming from. This was also as we are attempting to leave on our honeymoon. My husband has now noticed how upset I am and asks what’s wrong. My older half sister then calls me and continues her rant about how it was our friends and we need to confront them and “not blame our brother.”

Our brother (her full sibling, my half sibling) was a drug addict over 10 years ago. He has since gotten clean, married, and had two children. There was a point in his life that he may have done something like that, but I had NEVER up until that point said that he did it nor did I believe that he did. I still don’t think he did, I think. Things got so odd it makes me question everything. I’d like to believe he put that chapter of his life to bed many years ago as he really takes the role of a father and stepfather seriously because he’s never even hinted towards going back that way at all in the last decade.

At this point I start screaming I never said that to her on the phone. I’m pretty sure I started having a panic attack because my husband then took the phone out of my hands and began talking to her on speaker in front of me. She then starts screaming that we both need to stop blaming Alan when neither one of us even said that a single time. My husband was perplexed and asked what are you talking about? She then went straight into telling him how all of his friends are thieves and we are both bad judges of character from the people we assigned to the wedding party. He took this pretty seriously and defended his groomsmen’s character. Because despite saying there were “many witnesses”, when he pressed her he never got an account of what, when, or how things were stolen.

She then said f this, I’m getting my husband who she screamed at and said they’re blaming Alan for stealing. Her husband answers the phone with “why are you all blaming Alan for stealing?” My husband then laughs in disbelief and reiterates again, that neither of us said that nor do we think that. Her husband then states that’s not what she told him, and my husband says I don’t know why she thinks that, but we did not say that. They had a pretty civil discussion and I went on my honeymoon thinking she would reach out afterwards, hopefully to apologize for the misunderstanding. That didn’t happen.

In fact, she has now unfollowed me on all social media platforms, removed any photos of me, untagged herself from my photos, and I’m not sure how but our sister group chat is gone. I don’t know if she blocked my number or what, but it’s as if I was removed from a 3 person chat because one day it disappeared from my pinned messages. I searched and could not find it. I never delete messages so I didn’t do that. She also stopped sharing her location with me.

She has also spread the narrative that I’ve blamed our brother for this as one day our grandmother called me to ask why I thought he stole from my wedding. I have maintained that I never once said that, I believe it was someone working for a vendor as there were many of them with direct access.

From everything I’ve been able to confirm through cell phone photos and videos from that night, accounts from our photographer/videographer husband and wife duo and their 2nd shooters (we have worked with them for years and I doubt they would risk taking their reputation for a large towel warmer) none of what my older sister alleged has been confirmed.

What is weird to me is my dad has outdoor cameras. I’ve repeatedly asked for the footage from that night/next morning and every time he says he’ll get it to me, he doesn’t. I worry it’s not even available now. I’ve asked over 5 times and I’ve kinda given up.

I don’t even really know what to do. I don’t know what happened but now I question if my brother really did steal it. I really don’t want to believe that’s true, it’s just everyone in my family’s reactions felt out of character. I still haven’t spoken to her to this day. Both of her children, my nephews, have had birthdays since then and my birthday wishes sent directly to their phone numbers went unanswered for the first time ever.

I worry she is going no contact with me but I don’t even understand why in the first place. I also don’t feel in my heart like I should reach out to apologize first, because all I did was try to have a wedding day with the person I love and our closest family and friends. I never did the things she accused me of and even if she truly believes our friends are that bad - my husband and I go years without seeing them because of the distance. They don’t have the proximity to affect her directly so it isn’t like she has to be around them past that day.

It’s hard for me to understand her perspective because even if I thought our younger sister had the worst friends, I can’t imagine cutting her off in this way to drive her into those friendships even more. I love her and her family, especially my nephews, and I’m genuinely scared we may never speak again now that it’s going on over 6 months.

ANSWER: The more your sister protests and tries to divert your attention elsewhere, the more guilty she sounds. Your dad refuses to give you video footage so I'm guessing he knows what really happened as well.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (43M) MIL was confronted after my SIL (45F) found recorded calls where MIL privately vented about her. BIL (45M) says recording was a bug. How can I support MIL?

I’m a 43M visiting my wife’s (43F) family in India. We normally live in Europe. Her brother (45M) and his wife live here with their mother, my MIL, who is a widow and financially dependent on them.

A few days ago, my SIL claimed she discovered five recorded phone calls on a phone she had borrowed from my MIL for several days. These recordings were private conversations between MIL and her daughter (my wife’s sister), where they were venting about SIL over a pair of earrings.

My SIL played all five recordings to my BIL. He confronted MIL, shamed her, and MIL cried. She couldn’t deny anything – her voice was clear. She was completely humiliated and powerless.

When asked how the calls were recorded, BIL said it was a “bug” on the phone and refused to elaborate. I later looked it up and learned accidental call recording is technically possible, but it seems unlikely for five separate calls, all with the same person, to be recorded purely by mistake.

The calls themselves were about SIL asking MIL to give her one of her few nice sets of jewelry. MIL only has two left, while SIL has many. MIL didn’t want to give them up, vented privately to her daughter about it, and eventually gave SIL the earrings anyway. In the calls, MIL and the daughter used the word “khutti,” which I understand is an insult MIL freely uses about other family members as well, even to their faces. It sounded to me like ordinary venting.

MIL lives in her son’s home, with no income or real privacy. She speaks openly about other relatives, but apparently she cannot say a single critical thing about her daughter-in-law without consequences. My wife doesn’t believe the “bug” explanation either, but her brother insisted that this entire matter stay private, including not telling me. She eventually told me anyway, but she is hesitant to push back because she doesn’t want to upset the family.

I know I’m treated with respect here as the son-in-law, and I appreciate their hospitality. But I also know that my opinions don’t carry much weight because I’m an outsider to the culture and not seen as someone who should comment on internal family matters. I genuinely don’t want to insult anyone or misread cultural norms. At the same time, this situation makes me uncomfortable. From my perspective, MIL seems socially, financially, and emotionally cornered. The recording incident felt calculated, and the secrecy around it adds to my confusion.

How can my wife and I support my MIL in this situation without jeopardising her position in the household?

ANSWER: Sounds like your BIL and SIL were recording intentionally. I don’t know for what reason. Feels malicious to also gang up on your MIL. 

At the same time, you also don’t know how your MIL behave when around these family - for them to react in such a way. Seems like you don’t have a lot of information and no insight on the dynamics of the family. Which is something I would try prioritise finding out. 

I’m not sure how you can support your MIL other than taking her out of your BIL’s place - considering the whole toxic ganging up thing is happening. I would probably set aside some money for your MIL in case anything goes sideway. And also to tell your MIL to not bite the hand that feeds her.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Is it unfair for me (30F) to charge my boyfriend (30M) £800pm rent?

I (30F) have recently bought a two bedroom two bathroom flat in zone two (which is pretty close to zone one) in London. I bought solo as my partner (30M) and I have not been together long enough to commit to this together and I have been saving for this solo for a long time. 

We are due to move in soon and we have been having discussions about what is fair and what costs we should be responsible for. He’s mentioned he wouldn’t feel comfortable putting money towards the mortgage as he doesn’t gain any equity and I think that this was a fair call out.

I have been doing research across different sites, including Reddit about what other partners have done and what feels equal. I suggested he covers all bills (less than £650) and my groceries which should come to 750-800 a month. He believes this is too much. And he was expecting to pay less. 

My portion a month would be covering 70% of the costs so I don’t see this as unfair. And given the size and location of the flat, I think this is a steal. And allows him to save considering it’s much cheaper for him than our current rental. 

I would also like to add that we’ve had a bit of a rough year in our relationship so I don’t know if that is clouding my thinking right now. Which is why I’ve come here to see if I’m being reasonable or unfair.

ANSWER: Based on OP’s previous post about this boyfriend, it sounds to me like he’s entitled and self-centered. 

Per that post, he realized he fucked up and has a habit of saying shitty things (after she felt broken hearted in response to his unsolicited criticisms of her boobs). 

Look, this man has the right to a glorious home in a fabulous location at negligible cost to himself. He is equally entitled to boobs greater than or equal to a D. Why shouldn’t he speak his mind? He has a right to voice his opinions! 

What do you mean, OP would be negatively impacted by these dynamics? What’s that got to do with anything? /s

Here is my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/1xLzc51VPi

It has been about 3 weeks since my original post. 

Since then, my husband cut my mom a check for MIL’s formerly promised portion of my baby shower. 

Her bowing out of paying after insisting upon doing so (without being asked) has been gnawing at my husband, and he finally got the courage to ask his mom why she never let him know. In the gentlest way possible he said we didn’t need the money but she made such a big show of wanting to pay for half after seeing the total cost - if something came up and she couldn’t honor her promise he has 0 issue with that, but why not tell us directly? Well, she lied and said she never said that to my mom. She claims she told my mom she was capping it at a certain dollar amount, but never bowed out. 

My husband and I discussed their conversation and thankfully he understood my mom would never lie about something like this, and his mom was lying again. My mom swore on my deceased grandmothers life she never mentioned any sort of cap. It’s worth noting I had to pull the info out of my mom in the first place that MIL wasn’t contributing anymore, she did NOT want to tell us. My husband and I came to the conclusion his mother most likely wanted to get my mom and me nervous, feel like we really needed her contribution, and then she was probably going to try to swoop in last minute and “save the day” with her portion. Based on his convo with MIL, we knew she was already brewing some show up to try to get back in the fold and make the payment. We decided to lie to MIL and tell her one of my other relatives stepped in and paid the remainder, but thank you so much for the generous offer. 

Needless to say, she called my husband sobbing saying she knows we paid for it and not a relative. He thinks he lied to her well enough that she now believes it’s a relative, but was losing her shit over this. She called my mom extremely angry, gaslighting her saying “WHY DONT YOU REMEMBER OUR CONVERSATION WHERE I SAID I WAS CAPPING AN AMOUNT” my mom just killed her with kindness and said I’m so sorry for the misunderstanding even though it never ever happened. 

MIL mentioned to my husband that her feelings were hurt she was paying for half but I never invited her to see the venue. 1- we saw the venue prior to her offering to pay anything. Am I allowed to do nothing with just my mom? 2- turns out, my mom DID invite her!! So the lies continue. 

I know this seems minuscule compared to some monster in laws mentioned  on this sub, but I am so so so upset by all of this. I feel in my bones she has been trying to set me up to victimize herself to my husband, and thank god he’s not falling for it. I do not plan on attending her thanksgiving dinner, and I also will never have a conversation with her that’s not either in front of my husband or in writing via text. I thought her and I were insanely close before, and this is so jarring to me. Ever since I announced my pregnancy, she paints me as an angry woman she tip toes around. She has made everything about herself. She finds fault in everything I do, and feels comfortable mentioning it to my husband. 

She has made small comments to him like will DIL let me babysit - she just doesn’t want me around - she is excluding me from her pregnancy. None of these things were true until she did all this and I caught wind of her making those comments! And what on earth does it mean to exclude someone from their pregnancy?! She was apart of the baby shower planning committee, which she sabotaged. Every single ultrasound I’ve had she’s received a photo and an update. How else would I be expected to include her?! I truly hate her now. I will never get over how much she’s slighted me and made this about her. I don’t know how to move going forward, my feelings are probably palpable, and so far I have completely avoided her but will have to face her soon. I hate how rude she’s been to my mother, how manipulative she’s been to my husband, and how she’s tried to make my pregnancy about her and her perceived slights. 

Any advice is welcome. Thanks.

ANSWER: Any MIL shennigans needs to go through your husband. Do not answer any call or text. I mean it. My sister is pregnant with her first right now (coming in a month alrrady!!) and i sometimes lie awake at night because i'm afraid of some stressful situations she could have that would put her at risk. 

Pregnancy is a natural thing. But that doesn't mean it always goes smoothly. You need to prioritize your health. You are what matters the most right now, because you matter for 2. Stress like this can lead to physical or psychological conditions linked to pregnancy and none of them are good. So stop entertaining that Attention-seeking monster and take a step back. Your husband will handle her.

On another note, it kinda makes me think there's something medically wrong with your MIL. Like maybe she stopped her meds for Bipolar, or she has a brain tumor. My grandma acted this way when she had her tumor. It was ginormous, yet benign, fortunately. But whatever the cause, this is not your problem to deal with

================================================================================

QUESTION: he (m32) does not want to marry, I (f32) don’t want to leave him- how can I come to terms with this?

We have been together 9 years and I love him completely and have no wish to split up. The way I see it if I leave him then sure, I might get married but I wouldn’t be with him so what’s the point? If I stay then I’ll never be married but at-least we will be together. 
Reason I want marriage - being chosen publicly, the security of marriage, knowing that he is sure and certain about me.
I feel ridiculous calling him my boyfriend and I hate the term “partner”. Partner in what? Law? Crime? 

He is against it due to the risk of divorce and its financial repercussions.
This hurts as I believe I have proven myself worth the risk, we have been together almost a decade and - of corse had our ups and downs but in general are a good couple and care and respect for each other. we have separate finances (I’ve never asked him for money) and I am more than happy to sign prenups (which are binding in the country we live in)

He suggested talking it all over with a lawyer so he could be certain he would be safe (and advised that this wasn’t him saying yes to anything)
At that point I said, no thanks. Felt like I was twisting his arm. The bride wore a cattle prod. 


Has anyone been in the same situation? How did you learn to live with this? I do NOT want to split up with him, he is a wonderful man and I adore him. 
It’s just painful to see so many couples around me happily, eagerly and (seemingly) effortlessly choosing one another and taking that risk yet my partner (ugh) can’t seem to see my worth or the point in a legal union

ANSWER: Repeat this to yourself every hour until it clicks:
« he is willing to lose me, but I am not willing to lose him »

Say that over and over. How does it feel in that perspective?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Is my (30F) partner (45m) trying to sabotage my job?

I recently had a baby and returned from maternity leave. I have 2u2 and got a new job working part time remotely for really good money ($90/hour, 25 hours per week 12-5pm) basically my dream job.

We took our kids out of daycare because we both work remotely and could flex our schedules around caring for them while spending time with them and saving money. 

Partner just started Paternity leave today and it was the first time I asked him to watch the kids, just for a few hours so I could focus on meetings. He seemed OK with this in the morning.

He left to do some work for his business around 9:30 am. He knew my meeting started at 2pm. 

At 1:15 i called him to see if he was on his way back and he questioned why I hadn't called him yet (I was busy with a million things). This made me think he stayed out all morning to make me upset (because he'd expected me to call asking where he was). 

He then went on a rant about how he 'cant do this every day' because he has things to do and watching them would impact this.

Admittedly I got upset because I do 90% of the child care (his mom is helping for now but is leaving soon). I told him I just needed 2 hours and that's not a lot to ask. He got angry and threatened to turn around and not come home to watch them. I told him that sounds like he wants to sabotage my job and he hung up on me after screaming at me.

He did end up coming home and I was angry so I gave him an attitude and told him if its so hard for him I'll just take my children and do my meeting I don't need him.

He then threatened to kick me out of the house snd turn off the wifi for disrespecting him.

He then went to sleep and had his mother watch the kids anyway while I did my calls. Even though he apparently had so much important work to do which is what started the whole argument in the first place.

He always says my job contributes nothing to the household and I should just be watching the kids not working. I may be paranoid but I offer to pay bills toward the house and he refuses. I think he just doesnt want me to have my own money with how critical he is of me working. 

Am I asking too much?
Does it sound like he wants to sabotage my job?
Am I being ungrateful by giving him an attitude even though he doesn't make me pay bills except my own.

I just felt so much anger and resentment because I don't go off and nap whenever I want like he does. He NEVER wants to give me time to do my work like I do for him 

I clean and cook take care of 2 babies and I end up being the one constantly criticized.

On top of that he was talking about how he wants another kid but literally cant handle caring for the ones we have on his own.

ANSWER: Yes he's absolutely trying to sabotage you. I see a lot of red flags and abuse tactics here. You need to plan your exit strat ASAP.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend (35M) and I (35F) have been together for 5 years. My parents finally accepted him after initially disapproving, but now he’s putting conditions on them and I feel he’s trying to assert control. How can I decide whether to move forward or end things?

I (35F) have been with my boyfriend (35M) for 5 years. When we first started dating, my parents were upset that I chose love outside of an arranged marriage. Because of that, they didn’t speak to him for a long time.

Eventually, my parents softened and decided to accept our relationship. They’ve even encouraged us to get married. About a year ago, they gave us their blessing, but my boyfriend refused to go ahead at that time. He said he wasn’t comfortable because my parents hadn’t spoken directly to him yet.

I told him I understood and that if this situation didn’t align with what he wanted for his life, we could go our separate ways. Instead of having a calm conversation, he yelled at me several times but never actually ended things. Since then, every conversation about marriage turns into a major argument.

The most recent fight was terrible. He involved his mother, and I felt completely ganged up on. His mother (who is separated from his father) plans to live with us after marriage. Being shouted at by both of them made me feel unsafe and emotionally overwhelmed.

Recently, he has also started adding conditions that my parents must follow before he agrees to marriage. It feels less like he wants to build a partnership and more like he’s trying to assert control or dominance. I still love him, but I feel drained, confused, and unsure whether this relationship can ever be healthy.

What I need advice on:
How do I figure out whether this is something we can work through, or if these are major red flags that mean I should leave? How can I tell the difference between someone setting healthy boundaries versus trying to control a situation?

Edit : There seems to be a misunderstanding. I have been in a relationship with for 5 years but my parents have only known about this for a year. My father did speak to him when he came home ( my mother did not). My entire family extended family has been very nice to him and have invited him to all family events. But he isn’t satisfied with all of this . He wants to be very communicative and accepting, specifically my parents. I’ve explained to him it takes time to build a loving relationship and his actions matter too. He hasn’t made an effort to be nice to them either.

ANSWER: Do not marry someone who yells at you. Do not marry someone who is okay with his mother yelling at you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (F24) became obsessed with my ex (M25) and completely lost control. I’m so ashamed of myself. What can I do now?

I need to get this off my chest because the shame is eating me alive. I’m not asking to be shamed. I already know what I did was wrong. I hate myself for how I acted, and I’m not looking for excuses or sympathy. I just want to know if anyone else has ever gone through something like this, because right now I feel like the only person on the planet who’s ever completely lost control like this. I feel so sick about what I’ve done. It’s been 3 months since we broke up. 6 weeks since he told me it was final. 1 month since he blocked me on everything. 1 week since he unblocked my phone number, 3 days since I was blocked again after a messaging/calling psycho moment. 

We both live really close and are from a small and tight knit town in Ontario Canada (everyone knows everyone) and have many mutual friends. We go to the same gym multiple times a week and share a lot of similar hobbies (snow boarding, mountain biking, orienteering). We also both frequent the same coffee shop and go to the same university, in the same department, so it’s almost impossible that we won’t see each other. 

Background of our Relationship: we dated for 8 months, broke up. NC for 4 months. Got back together, was a healthy relationship for 3 months. Nearly moved in together and bought a dog. Last 2 months together there was a bit of arguing (never any yelling or disrespect). Then we were off and on for about 4 weeks. He would message to ask me to talk things out. I said no. Then I came around and we spoke and agreed to work through things. We just couldn’t. There was resentment and trust was broken. At the end we had a 3 hour phone call where I told him that I still loved him, he told me “I love parts of you, but not necessarily you” and was super airy about trying to reconnect later on after some time apart. At this time I was actively researching and seeking help to work towards becoming more secure. I became obsessed with ‘fixing’ myself. It was nothing that I genuinely believed could not be repaired through communication and listening.

Over the last few months, I became obsessed with my ex in a way I never thought I was capable of. It wasn’t just missing him or hoping we would fix things. It felt like something in my brain snapped. I called him constantly, sometimes literally dozens of times in a night. One night I called him around 40 times. I remember watching myself do it, knowing it was wrong, knowing I was crossing every boundary, but I couldn’t stop. It felt like my body was in a panic spiral and the only thing that would stop the pain was hearing from him. It almost felt out of body and I hate admitting that. I genuinely feel sick about it.

When he pulled away, I kept texting him long emotional messages, apologising, begging, explaining myself, trying to get him to just talk to me. I was humiliating myself over and over, and he barely responded. And the little responses he did give kept me hooked, just enough to make me think there was hope, just enough to keep me stuck in the limbo he created. He would say things like he “needed time” or that he “wasn’t sure” or that we “might talk later”, “I don’t know if I can move on”, “I don’t know what to do”, “what if i can’t find someone like you” and every tiny crumb felt like a lifeline I was clinging to. Looking back now, I can see how much I let myself fall into that cycle. We had broken up before and got back together. So I understand why I found it hard to comprehend the finality of the breakup. I’m also really struggling with the whole sharing mutual friends part. He also let me keep the dog, and I feel a weird disconnection from him. I love my dog to absolute death, but he is a constant reminder of my ex from the moment I wake up to going to bed. 

It got to the point where I even reached out to his best friend on Snapchat because I was so anxious and panicked that I convinced myself I needed to “check on him.” That is something I’m deeply ashamed of. She had nothing to do with any of this and I dragged her into the mess I created. I still cringe thinking about it.

The lowest moment was when I completely lost it and drove to his house. I showed up crying and basically having a full emotional meltdown on his doorstep. And instead of telling me to leave, he agreed to talk, for hours and hours. We ended up walking to a cafe and had coffee. We spoke a lot about things we should have done to have a better relationship and what went wrong. He told me at the cafe that he wasn’t sure how he felt about me and that maybe we’d talk again. He was busy with work and just got a promotion and had to start travelling more frequently to the main office. And because I was so desperate and dysregulated, I took those words as hope. It pulled me right back in, even harder than before. 

Then, a few days ago, he told me it was final. That he didn’t want anything. That he is seeing someone new. He had been talking to this girl the whole time this was going on, even when we went for coffee as mentioned before. Fully aware I was obsessed with him and trying everything and anything to fix things. And I just broke. I spiralled harder than ever. More messages. More calls. More panic. He told me to fuck off and that he wanted to never see my face again at one point, and honestly, I don’t blame him. Not because I think I’m some horrible monster, but because I crossed so many boundaries and acted in ways that were overwhelming and invasive and not okay. This is when I stopped contacting him. I knew it was over. Final. Done. It’s like a switch went off in my head and I finally could rationalise that it was over. I haven’t contacted him since, haven’t looked at his social media, haven’t driven past his house. Nothing

I’m seeing a psychologist. I suffer from really severe obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety, and in the past I’ve been told I present with borderline personality traits (4-5 years ago, was pretty mentally unstable at 19-21 due to a traumatic event). But have only ever had stable and healthy relationships with both romantic partners, friends and family, so I don’t think it’s BPD. I also have a pretty good sense of identity and self. I’ve just absolutely lost it this time around and I can’t quite understand why. I’m trying to understand why my brain reacted the way it did, why rejection triggered this kind of obsessive, uncontrollable fear response in me. I’m working on it, and I genuinely want to get better. But none of that erases the fact that I hurt someone I loved with my behaviour. It doesn’t change how ashamed I feel. It doesn’t change how much I hate the person I became during all of this.

I’m not here to blame or to justify my actions. I’m not here to ask if I was right or wrong. I already know. I just need to know if I’m alone in this. If anyone else has ever completely lost themselves after a breakup and done things that feel horrifying in hindsight. I feel like a crazy, psycho stalker ex. I harassed him and I feel abusive. I have lost all my self worth and am trying so hard to work towards moving on and forgiving myself but the shame and guilt is eating me alive. right now I feel like I’m the only one who has ever spiralled to this level, and I feel disgusting, and I’m trying so hard to understand how I reached this point so I never become that person again.

After all of this I am beginning to realise that I don’t actually love him that much. It’s almost like limerence and becoming obsessed with the idea of something that is unattainable. I don’t like the way he would treat me and spoke about how I needed to be “fixed” and change so many things about myself while we were together. I’ve idealised the relationship we had and the person he is in so many ways.

I am done. Done with the texting, calling. Done with harassing and obsessing. I’m setting strict boundaries for myself going forwards. I refuse to date again until I fully understand my actions, triggers and ways to better cope with emotional regulation in future. I will NEVER be that person again.

Please be as kind or cruel as needed. I know my mental health has been a major contributor and it is no excuse. But please remember that at the end of the day I am a human with feelings.


UPDATE: It’s day 4 since I last contacted him. I have not called, text, looked at his social media, or driven by his house since. I’m seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist and have made myself a promise that this will never happen again. I am taking this as a lesson. I am taking full accountability for my behaviour and seeking help to understand why and how I can prevent this from happening again. I feel deep regret, guilt and shame, but am trying to be kind to myself. I am also happy that he has found someone, even if it hurts a lot. But he deserves to be happy and I always hope he is.

ANSWER: Definitely not alone! I did very similar things when I was 21 and my boyfriend of 4 years ghosted me. This was 12 years ago now and I do still cringe sometimes. The brain has stress and withdrawal responses once the feel good chemicals have gone. Therapy is very helpful and try to work on forgiving yourself!

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (27f) boyfriend (30m) wants to buy a house together after only 8 months of dating. How do I make it more clear to him that it’s not happening?

I have only been with my boyfriend for 8 months and known him for less than a year. He keeps telling all friends and family that we are looking at houses. Obvious problem #1 is we have been together a short amount of time. He moves fast. He told me he loved me day 2 into dating. Problem #2 is he has $1,000 total in his bank account. First of all I am not buying him a house. I can afford a decent house on my own and I will be moving out of my current house within the next 6 months due to neighborhood drama.  He sees this as an opportunity to buy a home together. When talking about buying my next house I am purposely using phrases like “I can afford this amount”. I have told him his finances scare me to afford a house and contribute to any costs. He told me it’s “normal” to have only $1,000 at a time in his bank account and that’s how most people live. For clarity he has a decent job and works in the trades. In previous years he has filed taxes for a $90,000 income. Obviously it fluctuates depending on amount of over time each year. But every time I ask him where his money is his response is he has bills….. another inconstancy is his only bills are general utilities and a car payment that is almost done. He doesn’t have a mortgage (inherited his house), student loans, or any dependents. He also has passive income from being a landlord of other homes he has inherited. His dad is big time pushing us to move in together and my boyfriend agrees that we should. I am not ready to move in with him for a variety of reasons (time, money, cleanliness, habits) but he’s not picking up the hints I am dropping. I feel like he’s making this decision for both of us without even asking if I want to. I don’t want to hurt his feelings and I don’t know how to approach bc any time I bring it up he has absolutely zero verbal response to my concerns.

ANSWER: "We've only been together for 8 months. There is no way I am purchasing a home together. This is too soon and not financially feasible."

End of.

QUESTION: only getting my(22M) girlfriend (21M)a pit ticket to her favorite artist.

Hey Reddit, so I bought my girlfriend a ticket to her favorite artist (Renee Rapp), and I've told people this, and they naturally ask, “Aren’t you going with her?" I say that I only bought her ticket, and I'll be driving her to and from the concert and staying in the area to make sure she's okay. People have interpreted this as me not wanting to go with her to her favorite artist. The floor seats were definitely out of my budget, but I got them for her to have a great time and the best experience possible. And I definitely could have bought a cheaper nosebleed seat to at least be in the same building as her, but I personally don't see the point in that. My girlfriend is happy and excited about it, and that’s what I truly care about. 

Is there something I'm not seeing?

ANSWER: “Is there something I’m not seeing” 
Yes and no. You’re seeing their reactions and unseeing your gf excitement. Just look at her excitement and happiness to go and cut out the noise outside your relationship.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My girlfriend (23F) blocked me (22M) and went on a trip with her friend group, which includes her ex-boyfriend and it happens to be his birthday.

Hey everyone, this is my first post on Reddit, so please bear with me.

I (22M) started dating my girlfriend (23F) about three months ago. Shortly after we started dating, I had to move to another city for work, so we’ve been in a long-distance relationship (LDR) since then.

Before dating me, she was in a four-year relationship with her ex. She told me she ended things with him because she was attracted to me she even said she never found her ex physically attractive. However, she’s admitted that she still hasn’t fully moved on from him and that it’ll take time. I told her I’d give her space and try to be understanding, but lately, I’ve started questioning if I’m doing the right thing or just overreacting.

She’s a very social person and has a big friend group, while I have a small circle of close friends I completely trust. The issue is that her close friend group includes her ex. She still hangs out with them, and honestly, it makes me uncomfortable. I’ve told her multiple times that she can hang out with other friends, but why keep including her ex? She always says it just “happens by chance” that her friends call him when she calls them.

In the last two months, they’ve gone to four movies, one overnight beach outing, and several dinners together. What hurts most is that there’s this one place I’d always wanted to visit with her, and she didn’t want to go when I asked but now she’s going there with her friend group (which includes her ex).

Yesterday we fought because today is her ex’s birthday, and she’s going on a trip to that same place. I’ve told her several times that I’m not comfortable with this, especially since even her ex was insisting she come because it’s his “birthday” and everyone would “miss her.” Despite everything, she agreed to go.

Last night I told her that if she goes, we’re done. She apologized and said she’d “plead with me later” but couldn’t cancel because this would be “the last time” she’d get to spend a day like this with all her friends.

Fast forward to this morning she blocked me. She’s not answering my calls or messages. I’ve called her over 50 times, but she’s left me on delivered on WhatsApp and hasn’t responded at all.

I know she is going to come back and apologize to me about everything and this happened multiple times but this time this does not feel the same.

So now I’m just sitting here, completely lost.  
What am I supposed to do in this situation?  
Is it normal or okay for something like this to happen in a relationship?

tl;dr my gf went on a trip with her frnd group which has her ex and they are going to the place where i wanted to take her on her birthday date because we are doing LDR now, i had told her several times in the last month that i am not ok with that but still she planned that and today morning she blocked me and went on the trip what can i do now?

ANSWER: You already said what you were going to do in this situation.


Don't make threats you aren't prepared to carry out.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My sister (29F) didn’t invite me (27M) to her wedding. Thoughts?

Recently my sister got married on a destination wedding. She texted me 6 months ago saying the wedding would just be her and her wife and that she would hold a family/friends event next year. I congratulated her and said sounds good. 

I found out that both her and her wife’s direct family ended up coming to the destination. Not present for the ceremony, but they were there the rest of the time. My other sister and parents, the wives sister and parents, and the part that really gets me… my mom’s boyfriend (7 guests total).I would have felt fine with this whole situation, but hearing he was welcomed to come and I wasn’t… stings. 


My sister and I have had periods of months without talking but we are always happy to see each other. No real conflicts. I brought this concern up to my mom and sister, and they played it off saying it wasn’t a big deal and they would be there for witnessing/legality purposes. 

I’m imagining a few reasons for this situation 

1) my mom really wanted bf to come 
2) my sister secretly despises me 
3) it’s just how things worked out and it’s no big deal. You just happened to be the only direct family member not there.

ANSWER: You won’t know without talking directly to your sister. It’s wild to me that other family members did know and kept it a secret from you. You need to talk to your sister and understand what is going on so you can try to repair your relationship (assuming you want to have a relationship going forward with your sister)

QUESTION: BF calls his ex "my wife" when he argues with me. (40M and 40F)

Me 40F, BF 40M.

My BF is separated from his wife and is going through a drawn out divorce.  Many times during arguments he can get very nasty.  Swearing, yelling, insulting, etc.

Today, we were having an argument, and out of no where he goes "Hold on, my wife is calling me.  I have to talk to my wife.  My wife is coming today to get some of her stuff, I'll call you later."

Also during the same argument he started talking about my ex husband, and said, " I can see why he couldn't stand you and cheated on you.  Don't blame the guy at all!!!"

I have never said anything along those lines to him, EVER.  I don't bring our exes into arguments, ever.  I stick to the topic of the argument.  He generally goes into these types of insults when he has nothing substantive to argue about. I've spoken to him about this many many times, but for some reason, he wont stop.

I understand his ex is still legally his wife.  It's just that he never refers to her as that unless he and I are arguing, and only refers to her as that to me, not anyone else.  If he's talking to others, he will call her by her name, or say his son's mother, etc.

I feel like when he does this, its almost to put in me in my place.  To make a point to say, "she's my wife, and you're not.  She has status in my life, and you don't.  She means something to me and you don't mean shit."

He and I have discussed getting married once his divorce is finally over, but honestly, when he makes comments like this, I don't even want to.  I want to reiterate, I do not call him names, I do not bring other people into our arguments. He would regularly compare me to her during arguments, that has become more rare, but it has been replaced by this "my wife" talk.

I am left wondering why he does this and if I am interpreting this correctly.  I need to know if this is a behaviour that will change or if this is a warning sign of worse to come.

Why does he do this?

  
Update: I've read your comments and you are all just validating everything I feel inside.  He doesn't like me, this is abusive and it's not stopping. He's called me 7x since the argument this afternoon.  I haven't been answering.  I need way more time to process this and figure out how I feel and what I want to say. 

Update 2: thank you everyone for your advice. I have decided to move forward with my life. The biggest takeaways I have gotten from this are that 

1) he doesn’t like me. 

2) abusers rarely change. 

I have already ended the relationship in my head, and I will probably send him a quick text whenever he next reaches out just letting him know that I’m done. I will not speak to him on the phone. 

I will be seeing him over the weekend as our kid play hockey together, so any advice to avoid him over the hockey season would be greatly appreciated.

ANSWER: In your second sentence “many times during arguments he can get very nasty”. Why would you ever disrespect yourself and allow someone to do that to you more than once? 

Move on and cut out the drama.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My bf (48M) is mad at me because I (33F) because I didn’t want to have sex. Can the relationship survive?

I didn’t want to have sex in a specific position because my foot is broken and I’m in a lot of pain. 


I told him I was in pain and I needed a minute to get back in the mood because he was putting me in positions that made my foot hurt even worse. 


He said “sheesh it’s just your foot” then stormed out because “he didn’t like my tone”.  In all honesty my tone was normal, I simply said I’m in pain and this position isn’t comfortable for me. He asked me to give him a BJ but that position an the nagging pain was causing me to not to be in the mood for sex. I told him I needed a break and he got so angry and just left. Didn’t even say anything.

Please convince me this is wrong and I need to leave. I’m struggling.


Edit: thank you all for your support! I just texted him this: 

“I  can't fully articulate how deeply hurt I am... it's a searing kind of pain. I truly loved you unconditionally, until I felt used and abused. I keep trying to justify what happened and give you the benefit of the doubt...but you made me feel me like shit for not wanting to have painful sex with you this morning, and the fact that you would even want to be intimate with me knowing I'm in pain makes me sick.
I'm no longer interested in having any kind of relationship with you, in any capacity. I truly hope you never make another woman feel the way you made me feel. No one owes you their body especially if they're in pain
I don't block people, but if you need to, go for it.”

I know this is probably harsh, but honestly this wasn’t the first time he’s made me feel uncomfortable/obligated to have sex. I feel like I made the right decision, but the ending definitely sucks. :(

Edit2: he responded and said “apologies, take care”. Then he blocked me on all platforms. How does someone behave this way to someone they “love” and sleep at night?

ANSWER: Definitely a reason this 48 yo MAN was single. 

OP, dump him. You are not only there for his sexual pleasure while he ignores your physical and emotional well being. Please know you deserve better.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (26F) boyfriend (26M) got physical during an argument. He says I made him this way, and I don’t know what to do.

We’ve been together for three years. In the first year, I was recovering from self-harm and suicidal thoughts. He supported me through a really dark time, and I’ll always be grateful for that.

Since last year I promised myself I wouldn’t ever go down that road again mostly thinking of my parents. But lately our relationship has been really rocky. We argue a lot almost every weekend now, and every time things get heated, he blames me for “not listening” when he asks me to stop.

Yesterday it blew up. He was gaming when I walked past, and he yelled that I made him lose a point. Later I tried showing him a hoodie ad I thought he’d like, but he brushed me off. I felt hurt and went to the bedroom.

Later he called me just to ask if I’d go babysit his sister’s kids and I snapped a bit, asking why he only talks to me for stuff like that. He told me to stay quiet while he played, then started yelling again when he lost another game.

When I began packing to leave, telling if he wants 0 of my presence : I’d rather go now itself and he started calling me names, saying I’m “illiterate like my dad” and never listen when he asks me to stop talking. I said, out of frustration, “I wish I was dead and think all of this was for a game,” and that’s when he grabbed me by my hair and neck yelling at me for saying that. He told me he hates when I say things like that because it “reminds him” of when I used to self-harm. And everything I’m doing is for attention.

He said I’ve made him this way that trying to handle me turned him into someone he doesn’t recognize. I left and went to his sister’s place. I feel awful and guilty, like I caused it. But I also know being grabbed like that isn’t okay. I still love him and want to fix things, but I’m scared and confused.

TL;DR: Boyfriend (26M) of three years got physical with me during an argument, says I “made him this way” because of my emotional past. I love him but don’t know how to handle this or if it’s fixable.

My question(s):
	•	How do I know if this relationship can be repaired or if I need to walk away for good?
	•	How do I handle the guilt I feel when I still love him but know this isn’t right?


Edit: I know most of y’all are at right asking me to leave, but what about the compassion, love and care I have for him, how can I accept that this is the end of the road with him. I thought he’d be the one, every single relationship of mine goes through shit exactly the third year, last one I was sexually assaulted in public, and this one physically abused. I don’t know if it’s my actions that leads these things to happen to me. I’m hella confused.

ANSWER: And don't tell him you are leaving until you are away and somewhere safe. Make sure you take your important documents with you and anything sentimental. Once you have left tell your landlord you are in an abusive relationship and have left for your own safety and see if they will let you break your lease early. Seek help from domestic abuse charities/ support lines

================================================================================

QUESTION: [UPDATE]: I (23F) Asked My Friend (24M) About Our Sleepovers… and Things Moved Forward?

Hi everyone! I wanted to give an update because your advice honestly pushed me to do something I would’ve kept avoiding.

Here is the link to the original post 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/iw2WEXDuVe 

On Saturday evening I texted Matt saying I needed to talk about something. Originally I wanted to do it in person… but I chickened out. So I just went for it and asked him how he felt when we slept together. He was confused at first (understandably lol), so I clarified and told him I enjoyed those moments because I’m actually attracted to him. Then I asked again how he felt.

He told me that the first time we slept together, I had recently broken up with my ex and he didn’t want to take advantage of that moment. And the other times, he was just trying to be respectful. He literally said, “I am loyal to you always.”

After that, we decided to talk properly in person the next day. We already had plans to go to a friend’s place on Sunday, so we met there. It was super awkward for me to see him after confessing my feelings, but he was completely normal. After the hangout, he drove me home, and that’s when the real conversation happened.

I told him that I was into him from the moment I saw him and that my feelings grew stronger as we got closer. He said he likes me too :) and admitted there was always tension between us, even when we hangout with the group. He explained that he never asked me out because of my ex at first, and later because he thought I had something going on with other guys.

Anyway, we agreed the past is past. I asked how he wants to move forward and if he’s ready for something more. He said yes, and that he wants to get to know me in a different way.

So… I kissed him. Finally 😅. And the rest is history :)

Thank you to everyone who encouraged me to communicate. I would’ve stayed stuck in confusion without your advice. Y’all gave me the push I needed. ❤️

ANSWER: Please watch out for red flags… you casually mentioned before that he goes through your IG and WhatsApp messages to see who you’re talking to, and that was before you were even dating. Glad you’re happy but that seems incredibly controlling.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Husband (36M) constantly mansplains and interrupts me (37F), but gets upset with me when I point it out

My husband (36M) and I (37F) have been married for three years. Over those three years, I have noticed an increase in “mansplaining” and related behaviors that really bother me. He regularly interrupts and talks over me, he corrects nearly everything I say (even when I’m right or the issue doesn’t have a right/wrong answer), and scrolls his phone when I’m trying to talk to him. All of these things make me feel like he doesn’t respect me.

I’ve tried on several occasions to discuss these concerns in a calm, nonreactive way, but no matter how I approach it he gets offended. I really don’t think he realizes he does these things, but if I point them out he feels like I’m lumping him into “the patriarchy” when in reality he’s one of the “good guys.”

I think that my suggestion that he does these misogynistic behaviors is incongruous with his self-image and therefore feels like an attack. But the result is that the issue just gets abandoned. How do I express my needs in a way that he will respond to?

ANSWER: Those things make you feel like he doesn't respect you because he doesn't. You're correct. He's not interested in changing the behavior and when you challenge him on it, he only becomes irritated and dismissive. It's been happening for three years. If you don't want to leave, then it's time to insist on counseling.

QUESTION: My bf (33M) was uninvited to my sister's (34F) wedding. Can my relationship heal from this?

Part 2 Update:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/1ovdqcl/part\_2\_my\_bf\_33m\_was\_uninvited\_to\_my\_sisters\_34f/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ovdqcl/part_2_my_bf_33m_was_uninvited_to_my_sisters_34f/)



\\\Edit\\\

I started this thread with the intention of forgiving my (29F) bf (33M) after basically cheating (texting and messaging women and bots on other platforms - some explicit). Only this isn’t his second chance, it’s technically the third. As ridiculous as the third event is, it’s still cheating, whether it was a bot or not. 

The other issue I addressed was that my sister (34F) will not forgive or acknowledge him now, which I totally understand, but it would be obvious in front of my family, putting her character at risk, because my parents don’t know what’s going on. They will wonder why she’s being so rude, and that will hurt me even more. So I was wondering how to remedy the situation, or if it was pointless, and the relationship is doomed. She also revoked his invitation to her wedding. I am on her side. He has made me feel bad about this, but I agree with her. I don’t even want him at my sister’s wedding. 

Y’all did not hold back - and honestly, I needed to hear it. 

I want to thank everyone who took the time to give me solid advice. For many of you, it probably came from experience, and you know (on some level) what I am going through. For others, you have common sense, or are blessed with a strong will, or maybe just know better, but your advice and feedback still mean a lot. I’m sorry I couldn’t respond to everyone, but I tried to read every response.

Since I already put myself out there, I’ll go ahead and address a lot of common threads -

1. My sister is an angel for putting up with me. That’s putting it nicely. She is right not to want him at the wedding, and she’s an excellent judge of character. I should take her advice, and all of yours, and run.
2. I was in therapy, a lot of it. I thought I had moved on from all of this nonsense, so it was really hard to see it for what it is. I’m a bit out of practice. But he literally gaslit me so many times. I used to be an expert in this! My therapy started at 14 through 16, then again at 17 to 19. And again at 23 to 24.
3. I definitely need some alone time. I did have back-to-back relationships, with one break lasting up to at least 6-8 months, but my bf was relentlessly pursuing me at the time. I let his harassment slide for so long. And then I dated him. I saw him for what he was and chose to see what I thought he could be. He is not that person.
4. Manipulation is crazy, especially when the fog clears, which it has with everything you all had to say. My eyes are opening. It hurts so much to let the image of him go, but I need to realize it’s not really him. It’s fake. Doesn’t exist. 
5. I have safe places I can go. I have a support system and people who will be there for me. 
6. I promise this wasn’t for attention or clickbait. I was really lost before coming to Reddit. It was my first actual post. But I’ve hit a new low, and I think my subconscious was screaming for someone to wake me up. What better way than this? 

Y’all didn’t disappoint. I want to leave my bf now. 

I need to make a plan - many of you recommended I should follow through with packing my stuff and leaving while he’s at work. 

So, that’s what I’ll do. I need a few days to reorganize but… I need to do this. And for anyone who read this and is going through something similar, I hope this thread helped you as much as it helped me. 

I have free will, this is my life, I don’t need him, I will be okay, better even, without him. 

The wedding will be epic, especially because he’s not going to be there.

I need a real man. Wherever he is, I hope I find him. I don’t want to settle for anything less than what I deserve.

I’ll keep you posted 

Thank you, all.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

My sister "Eve" (34F) got engaged last year, and I (29F) am her maid of honor. We weren't always close, but we are really close now. She's my big sister and has always been really protective of me. I've had really bad experiences with men, but I've also been lucky to know what a good man is and looks like. 

My bf (33M) "Kevin" of 3 years really fucked up. I broke down and told Eve what happened (before I talked to Kevin, probably a mistake), because I was just devastated. Since then, after confronting Kevin, I chose to stay. Even though I had my car packed. It felt like he used all the "feel bad for me" manipulative tricks, but it worked, and I'm still here. I really do love him and care for him. 

But now Eve is refusing to acknowledge or talk to him. She also revoked his invite to her wedding. 

Ultimately, Eve doesn't want him in the wedding photos, and she doesn't trust him anymore. I totally understand. I'm not sure if I even want him at the wedding anymore. We're still working on us, but if things don't work out, I don't want him to be in those photos. She thinks he'll be a stain in the photos, and I'm not sure if she's wrong.

I want to express that I am NOT mad at my sister. I'm more on her side than his. He made a huge mistake and now he's suffering the consequences. But I'm right in the middle of it. He is devastated; he loves my family and now feels like everything is falling apart. So do I.

If you thought it was messy now... Thanksgiving and Christmas are coming up. Eve is getting married just a few days after Christmas. How am I supposed to have my bf around the family (literally just my parents, Eve and her fiance, and myself and Kevin), for Thanksgiving and or Christmas dinner?? Eve doesn't want to talk to him at all. It will be so obvious. She's sworn to secrecy; she won't tell anyone, especially not my parents. But if she acts like that, they'll know something is up. And all they'll talk about is the wedding that my bf knows he's not invited to, but can't tell anyone he's not invited to. I'm the maid of honor, so I have to be involved. It's just a mess.

When he isn't at the wedding, I'll have to lie and say he has covid and that's why he's not there. And afterwards? I don't know.

Should Kevin talk to Eve? Should he try to remedy it? Is this relationship over?

I can't imagine being with someone my sister doesn't trust... she'll probably never think any guy is good enough for me - but this just feels like too much. My parents, dad especially, love Kevin.

Backstory/ Drama:

I found out he had been messaging his exes and other women in April of this year. Really nasty stuff. One was even a "closure" message to someone he fell in love with years ago. Which, honestly, I wasn't as bothered by that as I was with the other stuff I saw. Also, for some reason, he was messaging bots on IG who were posing as sexy latinas... lol. We have lived together for over a year, so I slowly started organizing and gathering my things. I was preparing to leave. It took me weeks to confront him, because it felt so hard. I knew my life, our relationship, would change. I was scared to lose that comfort I found in him.

I chose to forgive him. We had a big talk, I said he needed to step up, yada yada. 

Months later, nothing changed. He was still up to his antics of not being a very good BF. Just unsupportive, unhelpful, lazy... September comes around. We're watching TV, he's on X, and I see him go to his messages, and quickly exited out. I knew something was up. I decided to check his socials while he was at work to see if he was talking to anyone again. Lo and behold, I found new messages with a BOT on X. "She" was sending him almost-nudes and whatnot, he was responding, calling "her" baby, etc... (I say "her" because it was probably a middle-aged man trying to scam people). 

I went numb, and I couldn't even cry at first. He wasn't supposed to be that guy. We were good friends for years before we started dating. He warned me against those guys, told me to stay away. That any dude who still talks to his exes or other women is just keeping his options open and is disgusting. He isn't supposed to be that guy. And now, my whole reality has shifted, and I don't know what's real or not.

This thought is what caused me to break down in front of my sister, causing me to tell her what happened. I didn't tell her about what happened in April. I only told her about the bot he was messaging on X.

I've been cheated on, and I was even groomed by a man when I was 14, not really knowing any better. Or thinking I did. It lasted years, and he abused me a lot emotionally. I've had a hard time with relationships ever since. I'm really good at dissociating, too, so that's kind of what I've been doing. And totally avoiding confrontation with Kevin.

We finally talked about everything the other day, and he's completely devastated again. I tried talking to my sister about whether she felt any differently about the situation, and she said no. She doesn't want to talk to him or acknowledge him, and he's still not invited to the wedding. He's upset and doesn't think it's fair. But he also gets it. He thinks she'd change her mind if I fought harder for him and advocated for him and our relationship.

Wtf am I supposed to advocate for right now? That's basically what I told him, in nicer words.

I've been in back-to-back relationships my entire early teens to late 20s. I've learned a lot and I've loved a lot. Kevin was supposed to be the nice guy. I chose the nice guy over money, over looks, over everything. I chose a guy that I thought would be a good partner and a good father one day. 

As stupid as it sounds, he was literally messaging a bot, and that's what did us in? It's hard to believe something so stupid, so ridiculous, so embarrassing for him would destroy our relationship. It moreso brings up images of the messages I saw in April, and it's triggering af. 

As I'm typing all this out, I feel like I know the answers to my questions. But I struggle letting him go "so easily". I know I'm not responsible for his actions, but when he cried and told me he was nothing without me, he couldn't do it without me, I believed him, because I feel the same way. But it felt really unfair. I had my car packed, and I waited for him to get home from work. When he did, I told him I was leaving. We talked for like 2 days. And I ended up staying. More for him than me. But now, a month later, I'm just sad and confused. I love him and don't want to see him so hurt. But he caused this.

I can't imagine anyone else can relate to a situation like this? Maybe it's not so uncommon. Should my bf try and talk to my sister? Or is this relationship just doomed now?

If this ends up getting a lot of attention and debate, I'll post the messages I found on his phone to settle it.

Thanks in advance -

"K"

ANSWER: Your sister is right, and you need to grow a straighter spine. He’s messaging other women and disrespecting you, then manipulating you to stay. What’s so great about him? It doesn’t sound like much.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (25 F) boyfriend (26 M) wants to be a billionaire and I’m realizing our values might be completely different

I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for a couple of years. He’s been working on building a startup for almost 2 years now no income yet and he’s now in debt but refusing to get a job. He’s incredibly driven and patient. He’s also supportive of me and encourages me to pursue my own dreams so I feel extremely conflicted.

One of his big life goals is to become a billionaire. He genuinely believes that since billionaires exist, there’s no reason he can’t be one too. To me, that mindset feels… wrong. I understand that part of this comes from wanting financial security and never wanting to struggle again like his family did as I child but to me, that mindset feels really off I don’t think anyone should be a billionaire when there’s so much inequality in the world. I value peace, balance, creativity, giving back, and financial stability, not excess wealth or constant hustle.

He works nonstop, even on weekends or late at night. I don’t understand why he can’t find a part time job to make some steady income but he refuses and says he needs to go “full throttle” on the startup and that it has “billion dollar potential”. I find myself feeling disconnected and honestly disagree with how he is approaching this. It feels pretentious and out of touch with reality. He’s point blank told me that he desires to be a billionaire and that my opinion about it is what stunts individual growth.

His recent decision have made me rethink our longterm compatibility. Can a relationship work when one person wants a simple, meaningful life and the other is chasing billionaire-level success? Or is this just fundamentally not going to align long-term? I’m open minded to different POVs and realize that my own middle class upbringing in a conservative family when if comes careers could be shaping this too. Thanks!

ANSWER: It’s your call honestly. I think this needs a bit more context. Is the problem the billionaire part or that he works and works and works and has only his debt growing? Also how come there is zero income if he’s running it 2 years? Does he have at least some, but is paying debt with it?

Either way look at the past years with him, can you stay with him for the same amount of time with nothing changing?

Also, is he mentally okay? Might be also a depression problem.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (27 F) husband (32 M) is deployed and I just found something about him that I can’t stop thinking about

I’m a 27 F and my husband is 32 M married together 6 years  I want to say up front that I completely support the LGBTQ+ community, and I don’t mean to sound judgmental or offensive. I’m just really confused and trying to make sense of my feelings.

About a year before we got married, I noticed through his Reddit history that he had been watching adult content featuring transgender women. I know looking through his phone wasn’t right, but I did it anyway. I didn’t see any messages or personal interactions, just that he was viewing certain communities.

When I brought it up, he was embarrassed and didn’t want to talk about it. I asked if it was something he was specifically into or just what he liked watching, and he said he didn’t really know. I wasn’t trying to shame him, I just wanted honesty and to understand.

Fast forward three years. He had logged into his Instagram on my iPad and forgot to log out. Recently I went on the app and saw that he was still signed in. I looked around, and even though his likes and comments were normal, most of his recently watched videos and link history were of transgender women. It looked like a consistent pattern over the last month.

From what I can tell, he’s not messaging anyone or paying for anything, but it seems like this has been ongoing for several years.

I’m not upset about the type of people he’s watching. What hurts is that I feel blindsided. It feels like there’s a whole side of him I don’t know, and I can’t talk to him about it because he’s deployed for a year. I don’t want to accuse or shame him, but I also don’t know how to process this alone.

It makes me question what this means for our intimacy, our honesty, and our future. I keep wondering if I’m overreacting or if this would make anyone else feel uneasy too. What would you do in my situation?

ANSWER: It makes sense that you’re feeling the way you do, totally valid. I don’t know how folks communicate with each other when deployed, but I also don’t think this is a relationship ender. I’ve dated men whose sexuality was fluid. Maybe that’s just the type of porn he likes maybe there’s something more. If you love him and wanna make it work, I’m sure you can make it work. First step would be having an open, honest conversation with no judgment

I’m 23, autistic, and I’ve had mental health struggles in the past but my last serious incident was over 5 years ago. I do need support in some areas because of autism, but that doesn’t mean I’m incapable, unsafe, or unable to make adult decisions.

For some background my mum has always crossed boundaries under the excuse of “keeping me safe” for example. - 

•She has looked through my diary before, even when there was no crisis or reason.

•When I lived with her, she would constantly walk into my room without knocking including when I was naked and just say “sorry” and keep talking.

•I’d sometimes leave for a week and come back to my room being trashed and covered in dog pee/poop.

Everyone in my family uses Life360 and I eventually started turning my location off or not taking my phone with me because the moment I walked out the door someone would text “Where are you? Are you safe?” even if I was just going to the shop or meeting friends! One time at 20 years old I walked to the corner shop at 9pm and got a call saying I shouldn’t be out that late because it was dangerous.. it’s literally a 3-minute walk! I’ve basically been suffocated with “safety checks” to the point I’ve formed habits that aren’t great like hiding where I’m going just to get privacy.

Two days ago I slept over at a guy’s house, I turned my location off because I didn’t want my family blowing up my phone. In the morning I texted my mum saying I was fine and she asked if I wanted to go grab coffee and I said maybe. My location is still off at this point.

Instead of waiting, she went to my house, let herself in, and read through my diary to “find clues” as to where I might be.

My diary has extremely personal, embarrassing things in it stuff I always thought I’d take to the grave, private thoughts, fantasies, and momentary ideas and I only found out she did it because my sister called me to tell me :D

I confronted my mum and the conversation blew up, she told me I’m “going to be a single mother” because I don’t want to go on birth control. So much for bodily autonomy or whatever.

A day later as we are trying to talk things out and she proposes an idea of a fetish clothing and sex toy business that we can both do online… she had read my sexual fantasies, preferences, stuff I probably don’t even remember writing and that I don’t identify with anymore shit that I NEVER wanted to get out.

I feel exposed, like I have no privacy even in my own thoughts anymore and the worst part is I know what she’s like and I can’t trust her to keep her mouth shut and I’m deeply embarrassed. I want to curl up in a ball and disappear. 

I’ve tried explaining the boundaries I want and how this is effecting me but the only response I get is she is mama bear and keeping me safe, that there’s bad people out there and she’d rather me be upset with her than be in danger. 

I feel sick knowing what she knows about me and I don’t know how to move forward anymore. 

Tldr - my mum read my diary where I wrote sexual fantasies, preferences and instead of respecting my boundaries she is now is proposing a sex toy business to start together.

ANSWER: If Mom has a key, you are taking it back right now.

If she won't give it back, you are changing the locks, also right now.

This is completely inappropriate and borderline incestuous. I'm autistic and have mental health problems but I'm also an adult with a job and if my mom looked through my things and then suggested we act on my sexual fantasies I'd exile her to Siberia and never speak to her again. She doesn't need a key if she's going to be acting like this.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My 39M husband wants me 39F to give him more attention (of all kinds). How can I get him to understand where I am coming from?

Hi all, thanks for reading. I have been in a relationship with my husband since we were 19 years old. In the last five or so years he has complained that I haven’t been giving him enough attention, and I mean of all kinds. Examples:

He complained we weren’t spending enough time together, I suggested a movie night. We used to love watching movies together. He complained that most evenings he needs to play games online with friends. I asked him how then can we spend time together. He said “You could just sit on the couch and watch me play,” in this wistful voice.

When I try to engage him at dinner he will talk about three subjects: work, firearms, and how the food tastes. If I deviate, he gets frustrated.

Lastly, he wants more time together in the bedroom. I asked him to come to bed before midnight. I don’t want to do anything after I shower because I generally shower and go to bed. I need my sleep for work as well (we are both employed full time). He comes to bed 12-2 am. I encourage him to come to be earlier and he won’t in favor of playing games. If he does come to bed earlier, I have to be the one to initiate.

When I try to talk this through with him, I am generally the bad guy. My libido isn’t what it used to be and with juggling the majority of the house work, working the same hours, and having my own things to accomplish, I don’t know how to make him see that maybe we could both stand to make more time.

If I bring that up, he gets defensive and I can’t seem to get through to him that it’s not because I don’t want to, it’s because he’s not willing to meet me halfway. How can I get him to understand where I am coming from?

TLDR: my husband wants all kinds of attention and I can’t seem to figure out how to give it to him without bending over backwards more than I already am.

ANSWER: It seems like he wants an NPC rather than a wife. An NPC would just quietly wait while he does his stuff (important Main Character stuff) then be immediately and happily available to him when he wants to interact. This NPC wouldn't have her own interests or agenda but would exist solely for his convenience

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (23M) broke up with my (22F) girlfriend, 2 years after she publicly humiliated me


About four months ago I made a post on here about what happened between me and my girlfriend. I was struggling to get over something she had done early in our relationship that left a lasting impact on how I see myself.
For anyone who did not see it, she took me to an event with her netball friends to watch England play live. The night started well. I went with her and her dad, and after he left, I ended up being the only man there. As the drinks kept flowing, the conversation shifted to everyone talking about their partners’ performance in bed. I was already uncomfortable and assumed my girlfriend would stay out of it.
Instead, she covered my eyes and tried to cover my ears and then told around fifteen people that I had a small penis and that I was not good in bed. Hearing that from the person who was supposed to care about me completely destroyed me. I walked away, but I still stayed in the relationship.
I stayed for two years. Two years of constantly questioning whether I was enough, two years of believing that the reason she did not have  higher sex drive was because of my size, and two years of emotional damage that I tried to pretend was not happening.
After our first breakup, we got back together, I came to Reddit for advice. Over 200 people told me to leave when I mentioned that she asked if she felt “looser” when I told her I had a feeling she had been with someone else. I deleted that post out of fear she would find it, and I still went back. I stayed another three months.
Finally, last week, I ended the relationship. I had enough self-respect to cut her out of my life.
The problem is that even though I left, I do not feel whole again. I still feel inadequate and still feel the echo of the things she said about my body and my worth. It genuinely feels like she took a part of me with her.
How do I move forward from this? How do I start feeling confident enough to date again when the humiliation and insecurity still follow me around?

ANSWER: My dad once told me after a breakup that "for a while it will be the first thing on your mind. Someday, it may be the second thing, then the third, and eventually you may not think of it at all. That will be a good day."

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (F30) partner’s (M30)  inability to do anything on their own is driving me to a nervous breakdown.

My partner and I have known each other for twenty years. We were good friends for most of our lives, then five years ago something sparked between us. I work as a manager at one of the Big Four, while he’s been teaching English at a high school for about a year and a half. Our relationship has never really been balanced. I’ve always earned more than he has, and he only decided to go back to school a few years ago. This year, we decided to move in together after five years in a mostly long-distance relationship.  
I wish I never had.  
Not only is there absolutely no intimacy between us (he says he’s too tired and selfishly, I can’t help but wonder how it’s possible that he’s the one who’s tired after working 3–4 hours a day at school, while I work nine and somehow shouldn’t be, but that’s another story). He has no savings but since he was called to work in my same town, he moved in with me. It took me a while to get used to his habits and routines, but eventually, I just passively accepted them.  
And yet, I can’t understand how it’s possible that a man his age constantly needs to ask me how to do everything. The problem is that he’s always lived with his parents, they never pushed him to be independent or taught him how to do things on his own. He expects me to cook for him during my lunch breaks when I occasionally work from home, and every single time he has to cook for himself or do any housework, he asks me how to do it. At first, I made up for it by doing the things he didn’t know how to do, but I ended up exhausted every evening. So now, maybe out of frustration or spite, I’ve started doing only what I need for myself.  
I don’t know what to do. He just asked me again how to use the dryer. I’m exasperated, and this whole situation (on top of the total lack of intimacy in our relationship) is making me question everything. I want a partner, not an incapable roommate.

I’ve tried talking to him, but nothing changes. What can I say to him before deciding what to do? And most importantly, what sh I do?

ANSWER: In a peaceful moment where he's not actively bothering you about a task, ask him how he, as a teacher, would deal with a difficult student who appears to be intentionally not remembering a lesson that he's been taught over and over and over. What would he recommend doing? And then do that back to him whenever he acts incapable.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (19f) boyfriend (20M) is a flat earther

So…. I (19F) just found out that my boyfriend (20M), who I’ve been with since middle school, is a hardcore flat earther. Like, not “the government lies” level I’m talking full “we live under a dome” type of flat earther.

We’ve always been super close, have talked about marriage, future plans, everything. Then out of nowhere, he just drops this bomb on me along with a bunch of other conspiracy theories he apparently believes in.

For context, I’m a Christian and a biology major planning to go pre-med, so you can probably see how this doesn’t exactly fit into the life I imagined for us. I honestly have no idea when he started believing this stuff, but he sounds 100% convinced about all of it.

I love him so much, but this is seriously stressing me out. Like how am I supposed to spend the rest of my life or even raise kids with someone who genuinely believes we’re living on a flat rock covered by a dome??? Is there anyway I can convince him otherwise because when I tried to bring up actual facts he just started sending me gibberish videos about the illuminati.

ANSWER: Don't get caught up in a relationship version of the sunken cost fallacy. Just because you've been together for a long time doesn't mean you have to be together any longer. Especially someone you met that young. The person you were in middle school will be a different person now, and a different person in ten years. Don't expect beliefs to change, just be honest with yourself as to whether you can continue the relationship and be happy.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My husband (35M), says I (35F), don't feel good anymore. What can I do?

Alright y'all I need help. Anonymous for what will be obvious reasons. Post may be a little NSFW.

My husband 35M confided in me 35F today that I don't "feel good" during sex anymore. Over the past couple years we have been struggling with him keeping at "attention" once we start penetrative intercourse, and he blamed it on being tired, etc for awhile. But over time I have noticed a pattern. He has no issues keeping it up for oral and other things, but the second it comes to direct sex he loses motivation.

So I confronted him and he admitted that he thinks I'm loose. I'm so mortified and embarrassed and insulted and so many other feelings. He also said he isn't as attracted to me as he used to be. He has admittedly struggled with porn addiction in the past. We got together when we were both 26, so of course I don't look like I used to. I've gained weight, so has he. I don't look like the women in porn.

What can I do to improve things? Can kegels really make that big of a difference? I want to take this seriously and invest in myself so my husband is attracted to me. I'm going to have to find out how to get over the hurt of it all, and the embarrassment, but I also want to address the issue.

TL;DR: After nearly 10 years together husband says he thinks I'm loose and less attractive. What can I do to be "tighter"? Are kegels really that effective or can I do more?

ANSWER: Yep. Death gripping his dick to fucked up porn, now can’t get it up for normal sex.  
  
Porn brain is destroying so many men

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (29F) want to break up with my boyfriend (26M), but he has no one else and the holidays are coming up. How can I end things as gently as possible?

\[Updated\] My boyfriend and I have been together for two years. We argue sometimes, but overall things have been fine, and there’s never been cheating or any huge issues like that.

But lately I’ve been feeling emotionally drained. He’s become more controlling and gets upset when I do things on my own. Part of the problem is that he doesn’t really have anyone else. He’s cut off from his family, and since moving to my city, he hasn’t built his own social circle. I have hobbies, friends, and things I enjoy, but he doesn’t really support that, and it’s becoming exhausting. We had a big fight recently over a Nintendo I bought for myself, and after a lot of thinking, I realized it was time to end things.

I still care about him and don’t want to hurt him. He has no one else to lean on, and I’m worried that breaking up will completely crush him. Money is another issue. We share expenses, and splitting up would make things more difficult for him financially. The worst part is that we were planning to visit my family this year for either Thanksgiving or Christmas, and with the holidays coming up, it just feels like the deadline is hanging over me.

I want to handle this as kindly as possible, but I have no idea how to start that conversation. I know sooner is probably better than later, but I just don’t know how to bring it up. I don’t want to make him feel blamed or like it’s all his fault. I guess what I really need is advice on how to talk about this in a way that minimizes the hurt, if that’s even possible.

TLDR: How do I break up with my boyfriend who depends on me a lot without completely crushing him?

UPDATES:

We talked and broke up. He didn’t take it well, but I think deep down he already knew it was coming since he seemed less surprised than I expected. Long story short, I’m moving out to stay with my family for a while, leaving the rest of the lease to him so he has space to decide whether to stay in the city or move somewhere else.

Thanks to everyone who shared advice. I don’t know what the future looks like or if he’ll be okay, but I’m trying to distance myself from it, which I believe is the best thing for both of us

ANSWER: Well with all relationships, you have to be honest no matter how brutal the truth is. Just be kind and gentle during the conversation, and use "I feel" rather than "you do this, you do that" sentences. 

Do you want to wait till after New Years or would rather be done with it and enjoy a nice end of the year without this controlling behaviour? 

I do think he isn't all innocent and needs to be told that he's controlling and rather dependent on you at the same time so he sees his flaws and tries to rectify them; it's good to try to be a better person when relationships end.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How can I (F/25) save my parents (M/52, F/53) anniversary after a terrible year/month/week?

The past year and especially the last several months have been brutal on them. My mom lost her own father around the holiday season last year, and it affects her immensely. A few months ago, my dad had to have emergency surgery while vacationing overseas, and just recovered from catching Covid in early October. Their older dog had a significant health scare within the past month, my uncle was hospitalized (but released as of yesterday!) this past week. 

Today, their younger dog is having emergency surgery for an obstruction. While letting him know about the dog, my asthmatic little brother told them he's got the flu while away at college, so they're taking him to urgent care.

In the middle of all this, my dad mentioned having to cancel a dinner reservation for their wedding anniversary tomorrow and it just crushed me. They deserve and need a break, or some space to breathe. What can I do in the next \~12-18 hours for their anniversary to still feel celebrated, and to really show them they're appreciated? Or lessen the amount of shit on their plates?

ANSWER: Clean up around the house (if needed). 

I like the idea of cooking a meal for them (or even ordering food for them, setting the table nicely to make it a little special?).

A small happy anniversary cake could be nice (or if they have a specific desert they like you could get or make that!)

If your mom likes flowers you can get a nice bouquet at a grocery store (she probably has a vase at home so you can just buy the flowers)

I don’t want to risk cooking for my partner at the moment because I have been diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands, and I am trying to rest it while I want to go physiotherapy and get better so that I can return to work. At the weekend, my boyfriend wanted me to make soup for him, but I didn’t want to excuse in my hands so I bought it from local restaurant and heated it up for him. He was grateful for it, but then he said that he felt if I love him, I would’ve carried one onion and one potato back home and made him some soup myself. He said he’s concerned that I don’t seem to want to cook for him and he thinks it’s a reflection that I don’t love him. The truth is exactly the opposite. I do love him very much, but I just don’t want to risk hurting my hands because when it does hurt, it’s extremely painful. Now he is giving me the silent treatment. …your opinions would be appreciated.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (32f) partner (34m) historically quits and threatens to quit his jobs, is this financial abuse?

My partner hasn’t held a steady job in 5 years. We’ve been together almost 9 years. He will get jobs here and there but won’t last too long and constantly says he’s going to quit when he is stressed out or if we are having an argument. He finally got a good job recently, about 2 months ago, and he’s been doing well. Well this morning we had a small disagreement and he said he was done and he was going to quit his job. He said he didn’t care anymore about anything. I said you know I would never threaten to leave my job because of an argument and he said well that’s because you’re not having to deal with you, I am. And I’m stressed out because of you. So I want to quit. 


Is this financial abuse? We don’t have kids so luckily that part doesn’t worry me, I can take care of myself and him too so I’m not worried in the sense that I won’t be able to afford bills… but I do feel like he is VERY capable of just quitting and going back to having no job for as long as he wants until he finds another temporary job again. I hate that he feels no shame in telling me he’s going to quit again, considering I have never once quit. I actually just celebrated 15 years at my job.

ANSWER: Girl why are you still with him? 5 years of this crap?! This man doesn't like you. He told you that he doesn't want to deal with you. Make his dreams come true but leaving him. You deserve better than a man child that refuses to hold a job and blames you for his shortcomings. And in short yes it's abusive.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Is my bf (23M) stepping out of line or am I (21F) overreacting?

I (21F) have a boyfriend (23M), we’ve been together for 3 years. I just moved out of my parents house and into my own apartment (we both are in college so he still lives with his parents, nothing wrong there) the thing is, I invited him to stay over a couple days so he can study, because his house is a mess, but it’s been over 3 weeks and he won’t go back to his home, I offered MULTIPLE times every week to take him back to his place and he won’t go. At first I understood because he needs to study, and here he feels more at peace (his house is small and he has 4 other brothers) but damm boy it’s too much time. I will say he does the dishes (after leaving them dirty for the whole day which bugs me) and takes out the trash (usually). But I clean up the house (I’ve just realized he’s a very dirty person), cook (HE EATS A LOT), pay for the food, the rent, etc, I do laundry and everything else. And he has the nerve of saying that I’m doing things wrong, like he genuinely thinks he does so much more in my apartment than me, and for example, the other day I was going to make some burgers, nice and easy right? well not, he wanted pasta with sauce, SO I HAD TO FUCKING GO AND COOK IT, when i’m almost done, he comes to check and he said “no, I don’t want it like that, my mom makes it with chicken” THEN FUCKING GO TO YOUR MOM’S HOUSE (I defrosted chicken and added it) idk I have trouble sharing things and space, but an other example is I bought this really expensive jam that I love, it usually lasts me a month, he ate it all in ONE DAY, I didn’t even get a taste. And right now i’m freaking out because he uses my whiteboard markers, all right, I don’t mind lending them, but they are new and I need them for college, CAN YOU GUYS BELIEVE THEY ARE ALL FUCKING EMPTY NOW? he used them all up, and the worst thing is that he has his own but uses mine
so I don’t know if Im freaking out just because or if he is really crossing a line

ANSWER: You've got yourself a freeloading barnacle.  Why in the world would you make his food.  He's an adult.  He can cook whatever he wants for himself.  Stop being his mother and send him home to his.

QUESTION: PART 2: My bf (33M) was uninvited to my sister's (34F) wedding. Can my relationship heal from this?

\\\UPDATE\\\

Hi everyone.

For those who have been with me since I initially posted - thank you for your advice and strength 🫶🏻

For any newcomers, welcome. Fair warning, you might find my story to be a bit… idk, I want to be kind to myself. But it’s hard not to think it’s a bit pathetic. Especially since the fog has cleared. If you or someone you know is battling an emotionally abusive partner, please have them read the thread from my original post. 

Or know that if you post to Reddit, your delusions will be blown away by (mostly) kind strangers.

Original post below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/1othzn6/my\_bf\_33m\_was\_uninvited\_to\_my\_sisters\_34f\_wedding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1othzn6/my_bf_33m_was_uninvited_to_my_sisters_34f_wedding/)

Update 

(Sorry, it’s a long one, and I word vomit. I also have ADD. And maybe a slight ‘tism. My oldest brother (35M) is severely autistic (less than 10 people in the world have what he has. He can’t walk, can’t talk, can’t do anything, and we have no way of communicating with him or vice versa.) Eve also thinks she was touched with a little bit of it. We joke about how our brother got the worst of it, then my sister got a little, and I have the least lol. That might sound rude or fucked up, but if you have a sibling with autism, you can probably relate to dark family humor. This is a topic for another thread lol, and I’m word vomiting, again. Sorry.)

Ok, here’s my update.

Shortened version: I’m going home on Thursday. Alone. I will probably need someone to come back with me and help get my stuff. And help me not fold again. I want to be strong and do it on my own, but I know having someone there to hold me accountable will help a lot.

Long version:

We had a long talk. And I studied the threads all week, so I came prepared. He’s still guilting me about the wedding. I told him I didn’t want him to be there. He said if that’s the case, I should just go home. I said okay I will. Then he proceeded to excuse his actions, again and again.

“I promise I won’t do it again. I will be better for you”

“I knew it was a bot. I was just messing around trying to see what it would do. It meant nothing.”

“What do you even want? Is anything I do good enough for you?”

“I’m embarrassed and disappointed in myself”

“I don’t want to exist. I have no one anyway”

“If she \[Eve\] doesn’t want me to be a part of the family or go to the wedding then fine. She never liked me and was probably hoping for an opportunity to get rid of me”

“Does the last 3 years mean anything to you? You know I love you. There’s no way you don’t know that. It’s because Eve knows and doesn’t want me at the wedding. That’s why you’re feeling like this”

It’s that manipulative back-and-forth tone, hateful then remorseful, trying to gauge if he’ll get comfort and reassurance from me depending on how he phrases it. 

I held my ground. I kept imagining if this was my sister Eve. Or my other sister (34F) (adopted) “Jace”. Or my best friend, “GG” (30F).

(Jace and GG knew what had happened since April. Jace was the sister who thought he was ugly AF, but got to know him, and could understand why I was with him. GG always hated him. Both encouraged me to leave. But both were hesitantly supportive when I said I decided to give him another chance.)

And I thought about so many of you who shared your stories with me. I thought of my future. I thought about my 14-year-old self. 

I told him he was coming off as really manipulative. That kinda switched something inside him. He said he just wants to fight for me. I told him fighting for me and respecting my boundaries are different things. You had 6 months to fight for me, and you did nothing but message a bot. 

“BuT 6 MoNThS iS NoThInG!! ThiS hAs BeeN tHe hArDeSt tiMe iN My LiFe!”

I am going home on Thursday. Alone. I don’t think I’ll be able to pack all my stuff in the car like the last time I tried leaving. His schedule is different this week, so he’ll be home on Thursday. 

He knows my weaknesses. He will likely say or do something that triggers me to stay with him. Either threatening his own life, safety, calling me soulless, or accusing me of never loving him, or my favorite, he accuses me of wanting to sleep with other guys.

I have no way of knowing if those tactics will still work now, but I don’t want to chance it. I’m not sure what he’d do if he saw me packing all my stuff again. So I’m just packing essentials. He knows I’m going home for “a few days” and that if he didn’t respect my boundaries this time around, it would speak volumes to me.

He accepted and told me I should go home.

I will probably have to involve someone in my family to help me get my stuff. I haven’t entirely gotten there in my plan yet. Maybe Eve, maybe my Dad. Maybe both. A powerhouse of 2 people with the strongest backbones I know. I know Eve would be absolutely pumped to help me with that. 

The other issue is, my bike, a portable but very heavy piano, skis, and a bunch of other crap are at his mom’s house too.

Yes, he was 30 when we first dated & lived at home with his mom. Yes, big ick, I know. There were too many icks that I ignored. 

The reason why I haven't just left, or told him I'm done, is because I have no idea how he'll react. My piano means so much to me. I'm also an amateur nature photographer, and he has all of my photos on a hard drive at his mom's house. I don't want him to destroy my stuff. Or threaten me with it.

So yeah, I gotta get my stuff from his apt, and his mom’s house. My sister Jace’s husband suggested I hire movers to get my stuff from his mom’s house. I don’t want to see or talk to his family. 

My next update probably won’t come around until next week. I will keep y’all posted.

(ps - I’m only ever on here to look at random stuff… I’m not really sure what the cadence is for updating everyone who responded… I really want everyone who put in the time to read and respond to get an update. There’s an “Edit” to my previous post that is technically more of an update, and I figured I would just create a Part 2)

Thanks, everyone.

All my love and gratitude,

Edit: Sorry!! I took out details about his family that were probably irrelevant and petty, but the point is, I don't want to confront them after I leave him. IYKYK

ANSWER: Try to get your stuff back, but also try to be ok with letting it go. He'll use it as a lever to try to force you back into his orbit.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (20F) hate having sex with my (21M) boyfriend and it’s ruining my relationship

I don’t know what is wrong with me. My boyfriend (21M) and I (20F) have been together for 3.5 years and we have always had incredible sex. But for the past year I have grown to absolutely hate it. I think I may know why, but I really need advice. 
Last year there was an incident where he was involved with another girl, it completely shattered me and our relationship, but I decided to forgive him. Ever since then, sex is painful, unenjoyable, and I am just doing it so that he feels physically satisfied. 
I always tense up and close my eyes, just waiting for it to be over and it makes me feel awful. I don’t want to make my boyfriend feel like he is violating me, but I also just never feel the way I’m “supposed to feel”
Is my relationship doomed? Is there no hope after a betrayal? 
I also want to mention I have been converting to Catholicism for the past year, so there is a great deal of religious conviction that plays into it. It I had it my way we would just re-wait u til marriage, but I know he has physical needs and I don’t want to deny him. 
I could use some advice or if someone could just analyze the situation to the best of their ability I would greatly appreciate it 

Edit: I wasn’t expecting so many people to reply to this so I thought I should maybe go more in depth.
Yes, it is obvious that I don’t want to be having sex while we are engaging, but I verbally give consent as I just feel awful to deny him. I have recently communicated these feelings with my boyfriend, and he is respectful, but I know that I am depriving him of one of the key components in a relationship. Yes, he has hurt me in the past but since being held accountable he has changed his ways completely. He is kind, loving, protective, and patient. This is why I am feeling conflicted. I want to be able to repair our relationship but I feel like it is me who is preventing that from happening

Also I understand that not everyone is religious and I respect that. I didn’t put that in to ask for peoples thoughts on my religion, just to give a little more details to the situation :)

ANSWER: The tension and lack of interest may be your body’s way of telling you that you are not over the betrayal. 

Listen to what your body is telling you. Please stop letting him do this; you don’t want it, and his needs are not a good enough reason to put yourself through this. If you ever want a healthy sex drive and sex life, you will listen to your body and only have sex when you are fully comfortable and genuinely want to.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife (34F) is pregnant and realized she doesnt want a kid. I (34M) dont know what to do. Please help.

Hi everyone, I'm on mobile, so apologies for any typos in advance. Also, this is going to be a long post since I want to give you as much detail as I can.

We decided to have a child last February and visited an obstetrician. The first one we visited scared us shitless, saying my wife didn't have any eggs, asked why we didn't try earlier, and recommended IVF (I do not live in the US or Europe, so it's normal for doctors to scare people for more money).

I try to support her as best as I can. I found another doctor with good recommendations. This one told us that everything was looking fine, to go and have sex, and to come again if she was pregnant or didn't conceive in a year.

This was around March, so we have been trying since then. It was hard, with negative tests at the end of each month. My wife quickly began to question why she wasn't conceiving due to the trauma of the first doctor. I always tried to support her and told her it was normal, that it could take up to a year or more.

In August, I lost my favorite aunt. I asked her many times to let me be with my family for the first week (as is our custom) and asked for her support. But she was aggressive towards me since we weren't having sex. She even told me, crying, that she wanted a child.

Three weeks ago, we learned that she is pregnant. Now she is seven weeks pregnant. It was great at first, but a week later, she started telling me that she is afraid to change her life. According to her, we have a very good life, and she doesn't want to change it. Now she is telling me that she doesn't want this child at all. She tells me she doesn't feel anything at all.

I mean, I am lost. I never spoke negatively with her. I told her to please remember why we wanted this child in the first place. I told her that we would make great parents. I told her that I would help her with everything. I told her that giving up would make me feel sad and heartbroken. I don't know what else I could say.

I really want this child, and if we abort this pregnancy, I don't think our marriage will last. This feels like the ultimate betrayal to me. We wanted this together for months; we were both sad when her period came. I mean, she even didn't support me during my mourning period. But when we succeeded, she decided she doesn't want it. I mean, why? I don't want to force her to give birth to a child she doesn't want, so I keep these ideas to myself.

Could you please give some guidance about what I should do? Especially women who may have experienced something similar?

ANSWER: Is therapy something thats available in your country? I think theres a strong possibility that she's reeling from the hormones and the stressful journey you two had to go through to get to this point.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (M/44) wife (F39) has hated every job she’s ever had and it’s starting to affect our marriage. How do I support her without burning out?

My wife and I have been together for 13 years. In that time she has had seven jobs. The pattern is always the same. She starts a new job, feels good about it for a short time, then the complaints begin. She says her managers don’t treat her well, she sees any feedback as “getting in trouble,” and she feels unhappy almost every day.

  
I have worked at two of the same places she did. The jobs had normal ups and downs, but nothing close to what she describes. I know work isn’t perfect for anyone, but her level of stress and frustration seems far beyond what most people deal with.

She is always looking for a new job, and each time she starts somewhere new she believes it will be different. It never lasts more than a few months before things go back to the same place.

I want to support her, but I’m starting to feel worn down. I listen, I try to give advice, and I try to help her see things in a balanced way. Nothing seems to help. I’m worried that if this cycle continues, it will take a toll on both of us.

I don’t know how to talk to her about this without sounding dismissive or unsupportive. I also don’t know how to set boundaries so I can support her without carrying all of her stress.

ANSWER: Some people hate being managed. These people usually start their own companies or become consultants, and find out the grass isn’t always greener when you have customers directly giving you feedback or no one lined up to buy your product. But some people thrive.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Accidentally send nude to another person, how to comfort husband (M21, F25)

I'm sorry for the long post this whole situation is complicated. My husband recently cheated on me and we're attempting to work it out. Another couple who we're friends with just broke up due to the girlfriend cheating. (Unrelated to my relationship)

I was on the phone with my husband when he asked for a picture. I was stupid and didn't double check the contact I clicked. I was messaging the mutual friend and sending him pictures for a 3D printed project he was making for me. I accidentally sent him the nude. He immediately messaged me, telling me I sent him something wrong. I told my husband something happened, hung up and called the friend crying asking him to please not look at it, to please delete it because it was not meant for him. He told me he didn't look and deleted it. I apologized again and hung up. I called my husband back and told him what happened. I told him it was a complete accident and apologized to him. He said it was fine and we moved on from it. Afterwards I called the female friend (the other man's ex) and explained the situation. I told her I wanted to be clear on what happened, that it was an accident and that I'd never betray her like that. I told her I valued her friendship and didn't want to hold it from anyone. She thanked me and we ended the call.

Well today after my husband left for work he got a call from the female friend. They talked and from what I was told it was suggested that I did it on purpose. My husband is now (rightfully) upset and telling me that I really got even with him. Everyone is mad at me and I get it, it was a big fuck up. How can I make this right for everyone? I've tried apologizing, showing them it was an accident, offering to cut contract, but nothing is being heard. They decided I did it on purpose so I'm a cheat now. I feel so embarrassed and guilty. I just want to fix my mistake.

Edit to clarify: the ex is also my friend. I told her because I felt guilty and didn't want anything to be hidden or twisted.

ANSWER: So, the two cheaters have gotten together and decided that now you’re a cheater?  They’re both trying to make you like them simply to make themselves feel better.  You’ve apologized for the mistake.  You’ve owned it and you owe those two nothing more.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How to be okay with the fact that I can’t fulfill my boyfriend’s fetish? 22F 25M

If your partner had a fetish that involved something you could never be/do, and ONLY watched this type of porn (he doesn’t watch any other kind) to fulfill that fetish, how would you handle that? It makes me feel as though I’m not enough, because I can never fulfill his kink, or like surely he’d want to explore it in person one day, with someone who can.

He tells me he would try it if given the chance (and we weren’t together), but that it’s not a big deal that I can’t give him that. But I don’t think that made me feel any better.

Does anybody have any experience with this? I always feel like even though we have a good sex life, he always fantasizes about these other things. It’s really impacting my self esteem. 


Edit: I didn’t want to go into details but since everyone is telling me I should I guess I will. When I first learned about it, he said it was just anal he was into. Which I know is pretty standard for men. But, I was sexually assaulted when I was younger like this, so the thought of engaging in that kind of act just to please him makes me feel very uncomfortable. And I know people might say “it’s better when you practice” or “when you’re with someone you trust” but I just do not want that at all. 

Then, I learned that it’s not just anal hes into but specifically trans women/femboy kinda porn. And again I have looked this kinda stuff up before and people said maybe he secretly wants to be pegged. I’ve asked him about that and he said no! 

So there you go, it’s both something I can’t be for him and won’t give him simultaneously. Hopefully this clarifies the situation a bit.

ANSWER: Browsing the responses, was a lot of garbage so here's my two cents.

So your partner is aroused by anal and you aren't into it. Okay, let's pretend your partner was into sushi but someone made you eat rotten sushi in the past and you don't like it. Where's the problem? Conflicting needs, right? What to do? Talk about it, set boundaries, find a compromise.

If you are okay with him eating sushi (virtually and alone), great! But if hearing about it makes you feel left out or insufficient then you need to have boundaries about discussing it (he shouldn't keep bringing it up). If knowing he likes sushi at all is upsetting to you, you need to ask yourself why. Is he eating sushi all the time? Is he often choosing to eat sushi instead of spend time with you? Is he pressuring you to eat sushi even though you've communicated you don't want to? Is he lying to you about eating sushi?

If he is not lying, hiding, pressuring you, or addicted to this porn then you have to handle these emotions with self-soothing and regulation. All relationships are going to have conflict and compromise. You have to set your boundaries and your partner has to set theirs and respect yours.

To set your boundaries you need to check in with yourself. Tbh, "how to be okay with" sounds like trying to force something. I'd advise that you instead try to just identify what feelings this situation brings up. From your post it sounds like you feel insecure, frustrated, pressured, and guilty. None of your response are wrong or inappropriate. You are totally valid in your feelings, but handling those feelings sucks.

From your partners point of view, it sounds like they are somewhat bicurious. Cool. A lot of guys are. But most men are so steeped in homophobic shame they never tell anyone, although femboy memes have become the new way to jokingly let it out. In other words, your partner feels safe enough to tell you. So seriously, good job for being a person he can feel safe with! You sound like a really caring and compassionate person and I want you to know you are amazing for that. I'm sorry relationships are tricky :{

Also I am SO sorry to hear you were abused. I (man) was also sexually abused as a child and as an adult have to navigate the way it messed up my sexuality. It's never fun and there is nothing good about it, but the work we do to grow and love ourselves makes us kinder people.

Godspeed struggler.

PS for those who say he is going to cheat. Eat shit, bisexual or bi-curious people =/= cheater. Selfish jerks = cheaters. So unless he has given her reason to believe he is trying to cheat or lies or seems genuinely addicted/compulsive or has other shitty manipulative behaviors that someone who would cheat has then no. Being attracted to femboys doesn't mean you'll cheat. I've been in a monogamous heterosexual partnership for 10 years, about 6 years in I finally accepted I'm bisexual even though I'd been hiding bisexual porn use for our whole relationship. You see I was abused as a kid and deeply ashamed/rejecting of my bisexuality. I certainly was addicted to bisexual porn. Yet I NEVER cheated. I never will cheat. It's not like because I never banged a guy I'm gonna cheat. I never got to bang a goth girl either, that doesn't mean I'll throw away a relationship so I can blow my load. If you think people who have fetishes cheat, what I hear is "I'm terrified I'm not good enough because peoples sexuality is larger than me". To which I need you to know, you are worth WAY more than what you provide sexually. Even if that's what the internet is pushing.

EDIT: Wow, all the upvotes and nice comments. Y'all made me cry. And I'm an emotional-repressed-from-childhood-man so like wtf. Am I healing? Is therapy working? hahaha

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife 24f just told me 24m that she has been faking her orgasms for 5+ years

I have no idea where to start. My wife and I, at the time we met were 17 and 18 and were in high school together. Spending every sore moment together in and out of school just as friends at first, we grew quite fond of each others presence. One day I asked her if she would like to start a relationship, she said yes and so would begin the best relationship I’ve ever had. 

2 years down the road we get married and we now have a little one. I absolutely love the girl I fell in love with and the woman she is now, but she’s been hiding something from me. She’s been lying to me for years.

I guess she’s had her mind on this for some time because just today while she was at work, she texts me that “we need a compromise about sex”. Well that set off the heart alarm very quickly. She doesn’t bring things up like this, like this. Never over text. 

Anyway we get through the conversation over text and I feel very hurt. I mean she’s been my girl forever it feels like, and she told me she’s been lying to me for the better half of it. Faking almost all orgasms for the past 4 years. She’s on her way home now and I’d just like some advice on how to open up a deeper conversation about this. I want to tell her exactly how this makes me feel but I also don’t want to punish her for being honest by yelling and making her feel bad. 

I know I just need to calm down but I don’t know how to handle being lied to like this. The most intimate part of my life with my most favorite person has mostly been a lie. How do I go about letting her know how she made me feel while also getting to the bottom of a healthy sexual relationship that we both are satisfied with, WITHOUT “punishing” her for being honest?

2 HOURS LATER EDIT: We had a great conversation about the topic. And for all of those that maybe struggling in the literacy department, no I did not yell at her, and no I was not angry towards her. That’s what I was trying to avoid by venting on this wonderful platform.

Thank you to everyone so much for the commentary, it really is a blessing to have strangers care enough to leave us with some advice on moving forward in a relationship.

ANSWER: “getting to the bottom of a healthy sexual relationship that we both are satisfied with” > letting her know exactly and in great detail how this makes you feel

Lock in. Treat it as both of you against a problem, not you against her.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (27M) was shown a screen recording of my girlfriend's (33F) Tinder profile.

I (27M) was sent a screen recording of my girlfriend's (33F) Tinder profile.

Background info I suppose? My girlfriend and I have been dating for over two years and we've been living together for a year and a half. I work in the ER and on the ambulance so I work long 12 hour shifts, days and sometimes nights. 

I clocked out of my shift at the hospital earlier today and was walking out with a couple of my nurse friends asked me to wait for them so we could walk out together. I didn't think much of it as the three of us are super close due to trauma bond and working together for about two years now. As we got outside and into the parking lot my friend, who we will call Anna, said "Hey, I need to show you something and I'm sorry that I am the one showing you." Anna pulls up her phone and says "Alyssa was swiping on Tinder and came across this profile..." She turns her phone and shows me a screen recording that Alyssa took of her Tinder and the profile. Sure as shit, it my girlfriend. The only thing is that ALL the photos are old. Like I am positive that these are old photos because they're all photos I came across on her Facebook after we became friends at a previous job we both worked at. 

Obviously regardless of the age of the photos, seeing my girlfriend's Tinder profile popping up on my friends phone was quite a shock. They both apologized profusely again, told me they loved me and that I could call them tonight to talk if need be since we're all off tomorrow. I told Anna to send me the video, gave them a hug and left. 

On the way home I was talking to Gemini about Tinder profiles and how long they stay active after the app is uninstalled, or whatever the case. From what I can find online, it seems odd that her profile would be active after over two years. I'm home now, my girlfriend noticed something was up with me but I told her we would talk about it later, after her class and after her son (10M) has gone to bed. 

I just want to know how I should approach this?

Thanks in advance. 

TLDR; My coworker showed me a video of my girlfriend's Tinder profile, but the photos are old. We've been together for 2 years and I feel like it's unlikely that her profile would still be active after that long.

ANSWER: Yo if someone’s tinder account is showing up, they’ve been active in recent months. If they’re inactive it doesn’t show the profile after a certain amount of time. If you’ve been dating for two years then uhhhh I have bad news for you unless it’s someone using her photos and name

================================================================================

QUESTION: My 22F boyfriend 23M have recently been struggling due to his family finding out I don't politically align with them. Despite never really getting to know me

Hello, I am looking for advice, sorry if it gets long. My boyfriend (BF) and I have been dating for a while and our relationship itself is great. He is kind, supportive and we are able to resolve problems well. My issues isn't necessarily with him but his family. When we first started dating, we had an honest talk about values. I told him I wasn't a fan or supported Trump/MAGA, but I don't automatically dislike republicans. I believe you can be republican without being apart of that group. He told me that he wasn't very political, which was valid at the time as he wasn't fully a citizen and couldn't vote. He was very receptive of views and understanding. We were able to connect on values like loyalty, goals, relationships and security, so we went for it.

Early on I found red flags (not sure what else to call them) with his family. These are all within the first month to two months of dating. I will list them below:

 His dad admitted to Facebook stalking me, right after our first date.
 His dad and mother admitted to driving by my apartment to "scope the scene". I really don't know why but it was before we even meet.
 They added my apartment to their family Life360
 They (parents and his brothers) constantly call/text him, which isn't inherently bad, but can feel intrusive. It has also affected our plans before.
 They expect a lot of time out of my boyfriend and aren't really considerate of it. After he is done working 7-5pm he goes to their family work shop and helps them many days.
 They are very traditional about gender roles and dress codes for women.

Now to talk about our relationships with our families. Spending time with his family has been rough. They make racist "jokes" (I am Native American, my BF and his mom are Hispanic), homophobic comments and generally dismiss me in conversation. His father also likes to make sexual jokes and on one occasion made a sexual joke about the Land O Lakes women, who is Native American, in front of BFs mom. I am an advocate, so I do public speaking, and every job I've had it was important to have good communication skills. I have no issues talking to people, but with his family it feels like I'm stonewalled. On the other hand, my family treats my BF like their own son and grandson. They take an interest in his life and follow up on what he has going on. This honestly makes me a little envious.

So to get to what made me make this post. Recently things shifted. His mom followed me on TikTok and saw some reposts I made (memes/political clips, not exactly polite ones) about immigration, racism, abortion, etc. If you are not familiar with TikTok reposts, basically when you repost you are sharing someone else’s video to your own followers, making it appear in their feed. They sat my BF down to question my “morals” and whether our relationship could last. The ironic part? My BF had already seen those posts, we discussed them calmly, and we’re fine. They also told him we need to use the "Bible" and our faith in our relationship. His family has never even tried to ask me directly about my values, my background, or who I am. They don’t know basic things like my major, my goals, or even that I want to go to law school.

The part that’s wearing me down: I don’t fully trust my BF now. He reassures me and says “that’s just how they are,” but I can’t shake the thought. What if deep down he agrees with them? What if he feels the same way but just isn’t saying it? He tells me it takes them "time" to get comfortable, but they haven't even tried. I feel like I have been doing my part by trying to get to know them. I love him, but I feel disrespected and alienated by his family, and the lack of trust is creeping into my relationship. Now they've agreed to have a "sit down conversation" about the TikTok moral debate.

My question is: How do I handle this? Do I take this as a red flag for the future? If we have the sit down what to even say? I have some ideas but its just so complex to even have one approach in my head. Has anyone else gone through this? Or has anyone else dated someone who's family was polar opposite like this? And how did that turn out?

ANSWER: So here’s the deal… whether he agrees with them or not, he should be defending you. If his family is being rude or making you uncomfortable, he should stick up for you. As far as the “that’s how they are” thing goes, that will only get worse. I’ve been there, done that. The insults escalated and all I got back was, “You know that’s just how she is.” That being said, tell him his family makes you uncomfortable, and explain why. You can’t change them, but you can avoid them. If he’s not okay with that, then you might want to reconsider the relationship. Also, I’m not sure if you plan on having children at all in the future. Say this were to play out and you got married and started a family. Are these people who you would want to share your child with? It would be their grandchild. Do you want your child exposed to that type of conversation and environment? It is seriously something to consider.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (39M) wife (38F) cheated on me five years ago and I just found out about it. Not sure of the path forward.

Throwaway for obvious reasons.  So this is a long story so apologies for the rambling.  My wife and I have been married for seven years however we’ve been together for 18 years altogether.  We started dating in college and we were together for a while before we got married about seven years ago.  She’s always been a big drinker and that’s been a point of contention for us.   My dad is also an alcoholic so I think I just chose the wrong partner possibly as I’m attracted to the chaos.

There were several red flags early on that I chose to ignore because she was very attractive and, smart and had a good career.  Majority of our fights always stemmed around drinking and getting way too drunk and putting herself in precarious situations.

Five years ago, we were drinking at our house as we typically did with friends and she was incredibly drunk.  It’s about 1 AM and I decided to go to bed and herself, one of my guy friends and another one of our girlfriends were still there.   I went to bed because I was exhausted and I tried to get her to come to bed and she refused.  She was adamant that she was not going to bed so I didn’t force the issue.

The next day, she was acting very weird and I was walking past the bathroom and she was in there with her friend talking and I overheard her say “I’m absolutely freaking out. I don’t know what to do.”  So she came out of the bathroom and I called her on it.  She made a big story up about how our guy friend told her the night prior that he had feelings for her and she wasn’t sure how to handle it.   And that’s what was freaking her out.   I confronted him about it and he gave me a different story and said that she slid next to him on the couch, but that was all that happened.

We got into a major argument about it, but I didn’t have any proof that anything happened despite their stories not lining up.  Fast forward to last week.  I was talking to another buddy on FaceTime and he mentioned this guy’s name.   My wife’s face turned white and she looked incredibly uncomfortable.   So I called her on it and said why do you look so weird and she said “I thought I saw someone outside of our front door.”   It’s a very dumb response and clearly made her look like she was lying.   So I’ve been sitting on this for about a week and then a few days back I talked to my buddy and asked him if he would talk to our other friend to see if anything happened several years ago.   Keep in mind the guy who was at our house that I think my wife fooled around with was married at the time but now he’s divorced so he has no reason to lie.   I’ve caught my wife in several lies over the years though nothing of this magnitude.

So my buddy asked this guy if anything ever happened and he paused and finally admitted that they made out that night in my living room (when I was asleep 20 feet away.). I’m not an idiot and highly doubt that was all that happened given everyone was incredibly drunk.   He assumed that I knew about it and we just worked through it because it had been so many years.

I haven’t confronted my wife about it yet, but I’m leaning towards a divorce given we have other issues and this just crushes me, knowing she lied to my face when I asked her about it and has been lying for five years.  The kicker is I just moved across country to be closer to her family and we have a three-year-old son that I am absolutely terrified of having joint custody because I won’t get to see him as much and he’s the love of my life.  We also just moved into a rental home with a 1 year lease so it would be tough financially for either of us to move right now, and I can’t bear the thought of kicking her out because she would definitely take my son with her.  

Also, I haven’t confronted her yet because I’ve read on here and other subreddits that you should speak to an attorney first.  It’s been very challenging to not bring it up and her family is coming later this week so I will have to continue to hide it for a couple more days.  

I’ve already started researching attorneys though and going to try to get a free consult later this week.  What would you do in my shoes?  Any advice from people that have gone through something similar would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

ANSWER: The marriage is toast, I'm sorry. If you stay for the child, you'll be miserable with her. 


Talk to the lawyer and figure out your options there. Only solid advice there is. I'm sorry, OP.

QUESTION: concerning behavior, intercourse while i’m asleep from my boyfriend 22F 24M

is this concerning behavior? so for the past month i’ve been awoken during the night to my boyfriend having intercourse with me. it varies from him fingering me to actually forcing himself inside of me. if i randomly wake up to it before it gets to the point that he’s inside i roll over onto my stomach (then he’ll start messing with my butthole …), moan disapprovingly, or the last time- i pushed him away. hard. One time he did it we spoke about it the next day and he admitted that it wasn’t okay at all but that he thought I was awake, but I know i showed no signs of this and the fact that it has happened multiple times? he also tried to say he thought it was okay because i was wet but i’m pretty sure that was just my body betraying me because he was fingering me in my sleep. is this something normal or is it a big deal and i’m just downplaying it?

ANSWER: yes, this is typically called rape. if it feels bad to you it's never okay. if you aren't consenting it's never okay. if he admits he knows it's bad ITS REALLY NOT OKAY, because most of the time guys will try to defend themselves first. get rid of this guy immediately, for real.

QUESTION: My (30F) husband (35F) won’t apologize to my parents. Should he at all?

(Edit: husband is male)

Hey everyone. My husband and I had this huge fight on my birthday and he humilliated me, called me names, was totally out of control and asked for divorce (for context, we have been struggling because I accepted a temporary job on a different city 4 hours drive from where we live and I had to move).

Now my parents get to the scene. After our fight I grabbed my stuff and went to my parents. My mom and dad were horrified and my husband has thrown similar tantrums(but no that awful) before.

Few weeks later my husband and I patch the wound, but my parents are still very upset and demanding an apology from my husband for the way he treated me. My husband doesn’t want to apologize (and I agree with him), but now we won’t have christmas together. Any tips on how to solve this?

ANSWER: I am once again begging women to have some self-respect and to not waste their one precious life on men who hate them.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My husband (33m) hates me (33f) so much and I don’t know why I’m still even hanging on to this….

There’s way too much details to this so let me just share a recent thing that been happening. Why I’m even sharing this, idk… I just feel horrible inside and alone…. Since we had kids this relationship has been holding on by threads. My threads. He cut all his already it would seem…. 

To preface this story a little I do ALL the house work, wake up early with the kids every single morning since they arrived and do any overnight things they may need, we split bills 50/50. If any cooking is done it’s done by me… like literally he won’t even turn off a light like a normal person. I have this one light I leave on overnight and always forget to turn off, rather than just shutting it off he unscrews the lightbulb because it’s going to “teach me a lesson” 

So to the main event that’s happening right now, it’s my son’s 5th birthday. I planned the whole party and made all the arrangements and invitations. This was an outdoor party with a bounce house. I obviously did any upkeep of the house that I could, but I also work long days Thursday and Fridays. We have two kids 2 and 4 and they make a mess when they play like any other kid…. He has Thursday off and comes home at 6 on Fridays keep in mind… 

Saturday comes. Party day. It’s at 1pm… I’m up at 630am per usual with the kids. I get their day started and am running around doing last minute party stuff. He sleeps in til at least 930/10. I had asked him to come to Walmart with us for an hour, I begged and he would not…. He wanted me to help him with morning wood first, with the kids right on my heels that was impossible and we were running out of time…. So I just leave. Keep getting the party set up. He gets up and gets right on Xbox playing rocket league for hourssss…. 

His sister shows up a little early as she always does and starts picking up what she could on the inside of the house. I made the asshole comment of “well it’s suppose to be outdoors so we don’t really need to clean up too much in here”. Looking back now that comment was snarky but I was fully annoyed that he was sitting there playing video games til about 1130 not helping…. According to him that comment set him off and he was pissed. Pissed that the kitchen was “left a mess and that I always do everything last minute” 

When I tell you I had no clue this comment I made, made him mad. I didn’t even know he heard it…. But this is where he says he got mad. Earlier that day nana (grandma) dropped off a brand new power wheels toy to surprise my son with later on. I figured AFTER the party. But we had no real plans. We didn’t discuss it. We continue through the party. Half way through with 15 other kids there he pulls out the power wheels toy… I asked him “please please don’t do this now” “please wait” “please wait for your mom to come back” he looked at me with a death stare and through the remote to the power wheels and broke it….at the party with guests there… 

Goes inside super pissed at me, my son just finds the power wheel toy sitting there, so we didn’t get the big “wow factor” out of it… nana missed it entirely. 

So my son rides all around the yard and of course all the other kids want turns, kids are crying, someone got their toes ran over…. It’s a mess honestly. 

I go find him because the garage is locked and he is the only one with a key, ask him to please put it away and he angrily shouts in front of guests “why are you telling me?!” His friend had to remind him he has the only key…. They got out and put it away. Party ends like a few hours later. 

730 at night now, the party is over, nana came back to help with clean up and getting kiddos to bed. He just left with his friends and said nothing to me. He ignored my calls for an hour and half. Apparently he was at the bar…. 

Now it’s been over a week and he will barely look at me still… won’t hug me, touch me, sleep our bed…. We go through a cycle like this seemingly every three to four months where he flips out but eventually comes back around sort of… I don’t really need advice I just feel like I’m loosing my mind…. Maybe I am the problem… maybe I cause this anger in him before the day even starts… I don’t know what I wanted from telling this story except to not feel so alone all the time…

ANSWER: Honey, choose you and the kids. He's abusive and he will teach your kids, especially your son, to abuse women. It's time to go. You can do it. His anger will only continue to get worse as the years go by. He will become even more violent. He will cheat or already has. He's evil. Please be smart and thorough in leaving, but absolutely leave. He's a monster.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife (41F) told me her fantasy is to watch me (44M) have sex with another woman.

My wife and I have been married 8 years, together for 12. We are exclusive, no open relationships, swinging or cheating. Last night we were drinking and talking about our fantasies. I told her mine, and then she hits me with her fantasy, me having sex with another woman while she watches. She swears it is not a trap. Prior to marriage we had a few threesomes, always MFF. The only rule then was I could not have penetrative sex with the other girl. I asked if this was some kind of exchange, like does she want me to do the same? She says no, which is great bc I have no interest in watching her with another man. The conversation went on and I believe she is serious about it. We discussed where would we even find a willing participant. In the moment, I thought this is hot, let’s do it. But now that I’ve slept on it, I’m thinking it’s probably a bad idea. Any advice on how to handle this?

ANSWER: Yeah man. I agree with other comment. Don’t do it. Let her know you’ve thought on it and while you want to fulfill her fantasy, fidelity to your marriage and vows is paramount to your values. At least that’s what I’d say. Too many moving parts leads to too many moving hearts.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My 19F boyfriend M19 took too many pills and now his life is falling apart, how do i support him without selling myself short?

Hi everyone, my boyfriend and I have been together for two years and I really like our relationship and he is very loving. We both use party drugs occasionally (about 1-3 times a month). However, about half a year ago he discovered Benzos. He doesn’t do them daily, sometimes to sleep. But 3 times now he has completely overdone it, he is a heavy (strong and tall) man but obv he can’t handle taking 10-13 pills in a go (i don’t know the dosage). 

The last time before yesterday was in August when i was on vacation. Between midnight and 6am i was on the phone with different people trying to get him home somehow, i was worried sick and it was a horrible experience. Also in my experience people on Benzos aren’t nice. He drove to where i was the next day to apologize. 

Yesterday we had set up a date at 10:30am at a park. We were both really excited the day before. Then in the morning he has taken a lot again, i could barely tslk to him. He let me wait for about 40 minutes and then kept giving me other informations until after two hours of looking for him i found him asleep in his car where he lives. I managed to bring him home (he weights double my weight) and he was constantly very very rude and mean. He made fun of me crying and was angry the entire time. He couldn’t walk straight and barely actually talk. He also got aggressive but not towards me. I got him in his bed and sat there for 4 hours watching him to make sure he will wake up. Suddenly his dad stands in the room (his parents aren’t together and he lives with his mom who isn’t in town rn but he was worried about him). 

Everything blew up and his parents aren’t the best or loving so it wasn’t good. His mom called me later to tell me how she wants to kick him out and has no empathy for him at all (she has been an alcoholic his entire life). 

I haven’t talked to him yet. How do I approach him? I want to be supportive with the situation with his parents but I am very hurt myself.

+ he obv didn’t show up to work that day so he might loose his job 


EDIT: to clear up some confusion: I’m not from the US or UK so sorry for any grammar errors (also explains confusions about me studying law at 19 or being a bartender in a club) & about my drug use I get yours concerns and will keep them in mind, right now I’m pretty okay with where I am 

UPDATE: I’m overwhelmed by the amount of attention this got, thank you for everyone taking the time to give me genuine advice. 
We have talked, he apologized a lot and decided to get any help he could get, his talk with his parents hasn’t happened yet so we will see how it goes (his mom changes her opinion by the hour, one day she’s smoking weed wirh us at 17 in the kitchen, the next she was threatening to call the police on us for smelling like weed when we got home). He apologized a lot, for the whole situation, for retraumatizing (is that a word in English???) me after my sister tried to end it with the same shit last spring and especially he was very ashamed that he got so aggressive (not towards me but in front of me what also made me scared). He could barely remember anything from yesterday. He said he doesn’t wanna be like that and promised to make a plan he will present me by Friday what he will do to change, including finding therapy and somehow convincing his parents to support him. I’m gonna give him this chance. Many of you will probably be glad to hear that i told my dad about the situation. My boyfriend agreed to this so that i don’t have to deal with it alone. I love my dad and he is very kind person who hasn’t always had  it easy either. He will support me and him no matter what i decide to do. 

And to everyone who has been sending me sexual messages what the hell is wrong with you.

ANSWER: That’s a lot of benzos to be taking in one go. You say he doesn’t do it daily, but I’d bet my last ££ he’s taking more than you think, if he’s even considering taking ten at once. 

You’re so young and it isn’t your responsibility to help someone with their drug addictions. I’d truly recommend you both try and find some support in getting off these “party drugs” and support for your bpd etc.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend ‘M/24’ asked for a threesome with my ‘F/22’ bestfriend ‘F/21’. How do I deal with that?

So… I’m still trying to wrap my head around this whole situation, because it feels messy in a way I didn’t expect. I’ll explain everything slowly so it makes sense.

My boyfriend, my bestfriend, and I hang out together a lot. Not in a weird way, more like we just have the same humor, the same energy, and it’s easy to be a trio. We go for drinks, chill at home, watch shows together. Nothing ever felt off.

About a week ago, though, my best friend and I were talking about stupid things we did when we were younger. One thing led to another, and that old memory came up, how we hooked up once when we were figuring ourselves out. Nothing romantic, nothing deep, just two curious teenagers trying something and then moving on like it never happened.

I mentioned it to my boyfriend because the topic somehow came up when we were joking about “weird teen stories.” It wasn’t a big confession or anything and more like “lol btw, we hooked up once years ago and it was dumb.” He didn’t act weird about it at the time. He laughed, asked if it was awkward, and we just moved on.

Or so I thought.

Fast-forward to yesterday. We were lying in bed, just talking. Out of nowhere, he brought it up again. He said something like, that since my bestfriend and I already hooked up with each other before, we would probably be comfortable with each other to have a threesome with him because he thinks that it could be really hot.

I kind of froze.

At first, I didn’t even know what to say because on paper it sounds like a simple question. But in reality, my brain immediately went into panic mode.

My bestfriend is omeone who knows everything about me. Someone who’s in my life long-term. Someone I trust. And the idea of my boyfriend wanting to sleep with her, even with me there, hit me in a way I didn’t expect.

I started overthinking everything.

I know people ask for threesomes without bad intentions.

But it still bothered me deeply that the specific person he wants is the one girl who is closest to me, the one girl who’s always around us.

And the worst part is: now I don’t know how to act around either of them. I don’t like the idea of them being together.

I don’t know if I’m overreacting, if it’s a red flag, or if it’s just an awkward situation I have to talk through carefully. I don’t want to accuse him of anything, but I also don’t want to pretend it didn’t mess with my feelings.

Edit:

My boyfriend and I talked and I posted an update.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/s/0PcBueqmJZ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/0PcBueqmJZ)

ANSWER: Threesomes are a bell that can't be unrung, the same as asking to open a relationship. For a lot of partners, once it's said it changes the dynamics and how you view the other. I think there's additional damage in knowing he selected someone, even if his mind went to what you'd find comfortable.


Threesomes almost always destroy relationships and have to be an enthusiastic yes because I can promise you it won't be as hot as he's thinking. So you have a couple of options here: you can talk to him about this and find out if he just wants a threesome or if he wants one with her in particular. The latter? I don't think you can come back. The former? He was admitting a fantasy. If there's no other red flags and you think you can move past it, let him know you'd never want one and not to bring it up again. If he brings it up again? Break up with him. Don't get pressured into an act by a partner.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife (26f) cheated on me (25m) and i dont know what to do?

My wife (26f) recently admitted she cheated on me (25m) with her ex. So my wife and i have been together for over 5 years now and we have an almost 3 year old. We have always had really good communication and kept nothing to ourselves. Recently she went to a concert and her ex was in town and asked if i would mind if she took him as i was staying home looking after our daughter. I didnt mind as he was an ex from around 10 years ago and i thought i could trust her. I also helped pay for her hotel as she wanted to have a night out and she deserves it. A few days after the concert she admitted to him confessing his love and they made out for 3+ minutes and he took her shirt off, he than said she will regret this so they stopped but she admitted that she probably would of went all the way. Some backstory also this isnt the first time she has been unfaithful as a few years ago she told me someone close to her offered her money for nudes and as we were not in the best financial situation she sent them. I forgave her as we just had our daughter but it took me awhile to get over it. I just dont know what to do. I have moved to my mums for the time being but she is upset with me how fast i uped and left but it was purely in panic. I do love her with all my being and she is the best thing to ever happen to me i just cant seem to get the image of her making out half naked in a hotel room with another man. Just seeking advice on what others think about my situation. I might add also that recently our relationship hasnt been all sparks and rainbows as we both work full time and once we get home we just focus on our daughter so we rarely get date nights or alot of us time.

ANSWER: "they made out for 3+ minutes and he took her shirt off, he than said she will regret this so they stopped " - if you actually believe this, i have some magic beans to sell you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (23F) slept with my bestfriend (23M) of years and I am so confused now..

So I’m a 23F and my good friend and I since the 6th grade 23M recently slept together. There has never been any past “history” between us at all. He did confess to having a crush on my our freshman year I had a little crush on him in like the 6th grade as well but that’s strictly it and we never confessed it till years later (last year) he knows my family has known all of my previous partners and vice versa. Anywhooo we’ve been hanging out a lot more recently I come over we have a couple beers watch football or movies sometimes have dinner and a drink and we call it a night. About 3 weeks ago is when it first happened, I gave him oral for like 10 minutes before stopping and realizing omg I’m gonna regret this tmr. We spoke about it 2 days later he said we were both drunk and that it was completely okay. We both did not feel forced at all I wanna make that clear and he made it clear as well. He also stated im the #1 person he confides in and that he doesn’t wanna lose our friendship I agreed. We were both very apologetic to each other. 
We didn’t hangout for a few days and didn’t talk as we consistently do for about a week before everything went back to normal. 
I honestly will say and be truthful he is so attractive, in the past I always thought of him as like an aww he’s adorable but as we’ve gotten older especially the last year I’m like woah he’s a good looking guy but I wouldn’t DARE try anything…… till I did. Last week we hung out, had dinner at his place then watched movies as we were drinking. He went on and on about my hands being so soft (for reference I was  handing him my vape) I end up giving him a back massage then he does me and boom my shirt is off lol… I honestly will say I was really really turned on. I kissed him and we went all the way. He was so GENTLE in a caring nd loving way. I texted him the next morning saying “idk if you wanna talk about it or not but I probably shouldn’t have kissed u I apologize hope we’re okay?” He replied back saying “it’s all good no worries we’re okay” we’ve been speaking completely normal ever since too. 3 days ago he told me he bought me these plushies from this show I put him on with (the night we had sex) and I was like what the hell?…. He’s a gentleman and has paid for my food In the past but random gifts??? NEVER. Idk if I’m reading too much into it, I’m so delusional too which does not help. 
He’s also the typa guy who no longer believes in love and isn’t the kindest person to himself so I almost see him as someone who just needs someone. That’s the main reason we’ve gotten even closer the last 2/3 years He basically is all alone rarely speaks to parents, only child, literally a handful of friends. Anyways some reason I feel so much adrenaline yet guilt at the same time. I’m so scared I’m falling for him like there’s no way. I feel like he wouldn’t like me back… idk guys I’m venting at this point. I’d love to hear a guys perspective on this if you were him like how would u feel about me? Is this casual like what is this…. oh and I refuse to bring it up anytime soon to him 😭😭. I wanna wait a little while just to see how things are in person. We’re hanging out Sunday for the first time since it happened. He’s giving me the plushies he got me and I’m planning on a spooky basket for him cause why not. I feel bad coming empty handed knowing he got me plushies of my favorite characters. Plus I’ll be eating half the stuff in the basket, anywho I’m done yapping guys I’m sorry I’m spiraling. 

UPDATE 10/29. 
We carved pumpkins Sunday, baked brownies, watched a show and had a few beers. Nothing happened but we both had a great time. He thanked me for the spooky basket. Anyways… I asked him today to talk, I asked what it meant to him if it was casual or meant more. He replied saying “it means nothing more”. So yeah.. happily ever after I guess.

ANSWER: I'm much older than you but from my perspective I can't really see the down side to having your best friend that you are also attracted to as your partner for life.

I get what you both express about being afraid to lose what you have. To me that's not a good argument. The chances are that if you don't end up together one or both of you will end up with a long term partner that won't accept a best friend with a romantic and sexual history. The best chance you have of staying friends in the future is to be that partner yourself.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (27M) started climbing with this girl (24F) from my gym but can't tell if I should keep offering to pay or if she thinks I'm being weird?

I (27M) started climbing with this girl (24F) from my gym about 3 months ago and I'm honestly confused about the whole payment situation when we do outdoor routes.

It started with us just spotting each other on boulder problems but now we've done a couple outdoor trips together. First time I suggested this route about 2 hours away and offered to drive since I have a truck that fits all the gear better. I paid for gas and let her borrow some of my equipment since she mentioned she's still building up her collection and trying to save money for her own rack.

When we stopped for food after I just automatically paid, didn't really think about it. Second trip she drove and suggested breakfast afterward, but when the check came I felt weird letting her pay so I grabbed it again.

Thing is, I definitely like her as more than just a climbing buddy but I can't tell if she's into me or if me paying for everything is making her uncomfortable. She always offers to split stuff but I keep saying no because honestly I have money aside and she's mentioned budgeting for gear, and I was raised to pay when I suggest plans.

But now I'm second guessing everything. Is she being polite when she offers to split? Does she think I'm some controlling guy who won't let women pay? Or worse, does she think I expect something because I'm covering costs?

At the gym our conversations are pretty normal, we talk about routes and random stuff, but I can't get a read on whether she sees these outdoor trips as dates or just climbing sessions.

ANSWER: If you end up telling her how you feel and she doesn’t feel the same, will you in any way regret paying or feel like she took advantage in some way? If you would, you should stop paying. And not saying feeling one way is right or wrong. Let her split it with you next time.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (25F) husband (29M) wants to get rid of our cat. I love her so much. What can I do?

My husband and I moved into a new apartment at the beginning of the year. There are many stray cats and we fed them. We soon noticed that one of the cats was pregnant and agreed when the time came, we would take care of her and her kittens. She gave birth in April to 4 healthy kittens. We asked friends if they wanted to adopt any and gave away one after three months. A month ago, we found a hungry, motherless kitten about 3 weeks old near our apartment. My husband became attached to her so we're back to 5 cats which is a lot of work and money, but we both agreed that it was manageable.

During the six months we've had her, the mama cat has grown on me so much. She doesn't like to be picked up or cuddled but loves pets and rubbing her head on my legs while I work at my desk. My husband doesn't interact much with Mama Cat because he's usually at work or would rather play with the kittens. When he does interact with her, he picks her up and makes her do little dances which she does not like. My husband is now saying that she is "unfriendly" because she avoids him and because she hissed+accidentally scratched him a few times (twice) when he tried picking her up. He wants to get rid of her since we're moving to a new house. To be clear, this is not because 5 cats is too much, but because he does not want a cat that "doesn't like him." I have tried asking him to feed her so can she associate him with food and will then be less likely to avoid him, but he wont hear it.

I love this cat so much. She is so sweet and has so much personality in her own way. I have read that cats experience emotional trauma if abandoned and I cannot bear to think that she would experience that or go hungry because I couldn't convince my partner to keep her. Is there anything I can say to be more persuasive? Is it not cruel to abandon an animal like that? Is there any chance she will be OK if she stays here?

TL;DR My husband wants to get rid of our cat because she's not friendly enough. I don't know what to do.

ANSWER: "My husband treats an adult cat like a toy, the cat is understandably annoyed by this behavior, and now he wants to get rid of her because he's annoyed that, under his roof, there's a living being that doesn't fully submit to his whims".


Here, I fixed it for you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 18M 22F her ex sent her a large teddy bear twice my size and 100+ roses and idk what to do about it. any help?

so im 18 and shes 22. we have been in a relationship for 2 months (im not counting 1 month of talking stage) so we talked about our relationship and she said we r 50% official and I can call her my girlfriend in front of my friends and for 100% she needs time. so she has her ex followed on insta. they broke up 2 years ago. today her ex sent her teddy bear which is twice my size and 100+ roses. A LOT OF roses. at first I got embarrassed that I could not buy her those stuff and her ex did (I do buy flowers but not that expensive) at first I told her what shes gonna do with them, like throw them away. and she said no shes keeping them both. I told her "r u gonna put those flowers next to the flowers I gifted you?" and she said "yeah but far away" so yeah im a little bit heartbroken about it. then I said "why did he gift you those stuff when he knows u have a guy" and she said "we talked about it" like she meant we r not 100% official. am I wasting my time here? we had our first kiss too 2 days ago at a party.

edit: she also mentioned that "his just wasting his own money"

also this is my first relationship

also she told me im the only boy she went out on a date in 2 years. some of you mentioned that she bought those flowers and teddy bear but I actually don't know. he spent so much money that its someones one month salary in my country and its just too suspicious. im 1000% sure they have 0 contact and she even said she broke up with him. she also said its not 100% official yet because when she made things official that fast before they did not go well. I really love this girl, and the option to just leave her and stuff just wont work with me


update: she kept flowers and teddy bear when i visited her house

ANSWER: Dude I'd rather be single than this. 
Be with someone who WANT you. None of that situationship/uncommitted stuff, what a way to degrade a human being. I was treated like that until finally I found someone who actually liked me and life is so so much better. I wish I had just left people who treated me like that.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (33F) husband (33M) was less than supportive through pregnancy, labor & postpartum. Can we overcome this?


I’m 6 months PP and have had a tough time with my husband. A little backstory - we’ve been married for 7 years, together for 10. He’s always wanted children - if I was up to him we’d have at least 3 by now. He didn’t have a great example of support growing up. His dad is an asshole to put it lightly. In our relationship he’s always been supportive of me, but I’m also very independent and low maintenance so he’s used to me taking care of things for myself. My family and friends adore him, etc. 

During my pregnancy he wasn’t overly supportive. When I wasn’t feeling good things around the house piled up until I felt better. I got exactly 0 back rubs despite asking and expressing how uncomfortable I was in the last few weeks. He lacked sympathy, honestly. During labor he sat in his chair watching shows on his iPad alone. When I got my epidural he sat in the same chair, did not move. The only “support” if you even can call it that, was telling me to breathe from across the room in said chair. I ended up pushing for hours and needing a c section. He was supportive during that part (from what I can remember - a lot of it is blurry for me) In recovery he didn’t help me out of bed, he just called for a nurse. I see these videos online of women whose husbands helped them shower and change bandaging - I did that all alone. If I asked he would’ve helped but I didn’t want to have to ask. I have to imagine if the roles were reversed I would’ve helped without asking. 

Fast forward to coming home, he was overwhelmed (understandably) On day 2 at home he broke down in tears bc he was overwhelmed. At that point I felt like I had to carry a heavier load. We slept downstairs for the first two weeks bc stairs were hard for me and the bed sits high up. In those weeks the baby didn’t want to be put down so we did “shifts” of holding her. I was a freak about safe sleep and during his shifts he’d sleep with her in his arms. My shifts I stayed awake. He slept until 10am every morning. By the time he’d wake up I’d have been through half a day with our daughter. We finally move upstairs where our daughter slept in her bassinet. I did every overnight feeding - I was NOT breastfeeding so it’s not like he couldn’t help. Every morning he’d wake up complaining about being tired while I was lucky if I had 3 hours of sleep broken up. I expressed to him with tears in my eyes multiple times that I felt like I was breaking, I needed help. He would listen and almost think it’s cute how deep of a sleeper he is he just “didn’t hear her” - funny bc he hears his phone ding though…He even had the audacity to be completely serious and complain about his allergies while I had staples in my abdomen. 

To say I’m flabbergasted and disappointed by his behavior is an understatement. He is great with our daughter and I knew he’d always be a wonderful father but he really dropped the ball as a partner. I feel robbed of my first pregnancy, birth and PP experience. I love him but I truly don’t know if this is something I can get past. I always wanted more children but I can’t fathom doing this again with such little support and I know it would be harder since our daughter will need to be tended to next time as well. He has apologized but I’m not sure if he’s sorry or if he’s now realizing how big of an impact this is having on our marriage. 

He has an issue with our lack of intimacy since pregnancy / birth but I am just so hurt I can’t even bring myself to imagine being intimate with this man right now. 

I guess I’m just looking for anyone with similar experiences. I know therapy would be a good move.

ANSWER: Is he a great father though? A great father would have done an overnight feed, made sure safe sleep was happening, and made sure the mornings went smooth for you and baby.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (34M) wife (37F) had an affair for six years, and explains it with cultural differences

tl;dr: My (34M) chinese wife (37F) of 8 years (15 years as a couple together) had an affair for 6 years, and claims that she started the affair due to my laziness that can be explained due to cultural differences (I am German). But is it really though?

I just found out my wife, that I am together with for 15 years and married for 8 had an affair already for 6 years. Just two years ago we bought a house together and got a daughter together. Her behavior towards me worsened over the years and she became quite hostile. We worked really hard together and were quite successful on so many ways. I got an extremly well paid job at a big corporation in a management position, and she made her small, but very profitable business. However, there has been times where I didnt want to travel because of work. It was around 2 years after our marriage where I decided that that year I didnt want to travel. Already then, she met someone and since then they traveled all the time togehter and became a couple. Because I felt bad for my wife that I couldnt travel with her that year, I supported her to travel as much as she want (I thought with friends). But she traveled so much that it became such a huge burden for me. She traveled 6 to 10 times per year and was away every second or third weekend. This made me extremly burned out and also sad for the relationship. She said I was too lazy for her, but my lack of energy was because of the extreme amount of work we just managed to handle. Since we got our daughter, I did everything necessary to make her life as easy as possible, because I know that its hard for moms at the beginning of having a child.

She argued that she is always so angry at me and could never accept that I couldnt finish things as fast as she wanted it to be finished. Like if I push a task in the future because I was tired, she couldnt accept. Or like we have to have documents done for some passport application or something like that, and I was working until the night before, and then I said "I want to prepare the documents tomorrow because I dont have energy anymore today." She is so angry about it that she said she needed another man who is more like she want her boyfriend/husband to be. But her affair is much younger and they agreed that they dont want to be together and only be together for as long as the man finds a younger woman that her parents can accept in order to make a family.

Now she said this is all due to cultural differences, and she claimed everyone around her (her friends and business partners) agree and support her in her decision to cheat on me. All of them are chinese too. Even her mother, who often came from China to Germany to help us with our daughter always complained about me, that I am lazy and I should do more, even though at the time of her visit to us, my wife escaped with her secret boyfriend always and I had to stay home with her mom to take care of our child. I just dont understand how I am lazy here?

Why do they all think I am lazy and all accept this situation like now? I refuse to believe that this is a cultural difference as of now, because I work from 07:00 to 23:00 everyday, and sometimes even so much that I have like only 3-4 hours of sleep for several months.

Please help me understand this situation. What happened here? I am so confused and would really appriciate a chinese perspective here.

OF COURSE I don't forgive her. I write this because some people here think I accept this somehow. I will of course move forward and start a new life as much as possible. Right now I am just a broken man though.

ANSWER: Cultural? I’m pretty certain cheating is frowned upon more in China than Germany. Your wife’s a skank.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Do not know what to charge my(33f) Bf(34m) in rent

I’ve been dating my Bf for about 2 years now, but we have never truly lived together in this time. Though over the last 6 months or so he might stay at his own place 1-3 days through out the week. I enjoy him being at my place and have asked him countless times if he would like to move in. 
Recently things have come up that make it an even better idea for him to move in and he’s actually considering it but wants a set ‘rent’ and wants me to tell him what that would be. I have no idea what would be fair honestly, so thought I’d ask for some advice. 
I’m content paying my own bills as I have been doing so. I’ve consistently made more during our relationship 70k vs 50k (give or take) and have less bills over all (one of the reasons I’ve always offered for him to stay). House bills consist mostly of utilities 3-500 a month, mortgage 600 a month, 1-200 extra for random extras, And a once a year big Reno about 5k-7k which I save up for all year. (Only adding the Reno as it’s why the mortgage is so low so I like to think of it as mortgage payments too). But it will also give a good idea of what the house expenses look like. 
What Is everyone’s thoughts on what I should charge ? Nothing isn’t an option I’ve tried. 

TDLR; I don’t know what to charge my bf who insist on paying rent.

ANSWER: Do you have combined finances? Is he going to be doing any of the renovation work? If not, you’re in more of a landlord/tenant situation. Charge him half the market rent, split the utilities, and you pay for the renovations, taxes, and insurance on your own. And make sure he signs a lease, to protect both of you.

I (27M) posted a 1 year anniversary story with my girlfriend (25F). We both look young for our age (we’re Asian). A guy from college (who’s white) who I haven’t spoken to in about 6 years replied to my story and this was the exchange:

Him: How old is she...?

Me: Why do you ask?

Him: People wonder if she’s 18

Me: She’s 25. Asians tend to look young. It’s a weird thing to ask someone after 6 years. I see you haven’t changed a bit.

Him: Ah I’m happy she’s old enough
Him: I see you have changed


I haven’t replied since. Was his question valid? I’d say we both look young for our age, me maybe 24-25 and her 21-23. I’m not sure, it kind of insulted me and I’m not sure what to think of it.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (26F) got married around 3 months ago (27M) and things are already going down

I and my husband are both teachers. Being a teacher, I don't only work at school but also at home as I have to prepare materials, exams and evaluate them etc. When I come home, I have to cook (he hates vegetables and I cook meat everyday, the kind of meals u'd have at a restaurant) and wash the dishes, and on the weekends I do the cleaning. He sometimes helps with the dishes, but most of the household chore is on me. I could be okay with it because cooking is actually my hobby but when it becomes a responsible with all the other responsibilities I have got, it becomes tiring.

When we got to our house, we decided sleeping in different beds could be a better choice as his sleep is very light. We also have different work schedules so we go to sleep and wake up at different times. From my husband, I see nothing romantic, no compliments, no gifts, no cuddles. The only time he cuddles me is when he wants to have sex, which causes me to have no desire at all... 

Since he's better at economy and finances, I send some of my income to him for him to make savings. I am okay with it. But sometimes it becomes very controlling like when he wants to control what I got the credit card debit (which is not at all high) from and what I bought... or when he complains about how we spend money on groceries and meat but how could I possibly cook without them?

  
To be honest, I don't feel like someone's wife, I don't even feel like a woman, I feel like a robot who always has something to do. When I have time off, I spend it going out with my girl friends or playing video games as that's the only thing that feels a little better. But I cannot ignore how we already have nothing joyful left tho it's been only a few months since we got married. I don't know what to do, and I don't know if I am making things up in my head and creating problems. I also feel guilty about not being that into having sex anymore, but I just know that I don't at all feel fine so it seems understandable to me. Could you guys maybe show me a way as someone objective?

ANSWER: We need a bit more information on the context of the relationship, how long you have been together, was it always like this, why are oyu taking on so many of the responsibilities, do you live in a Western country, etc.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (28f) best friend of 10+ years (33f) cut me off completely. How do I process this?

I’m struggling to process something that’s completely blindsided me.

My best friend (33fF) and I (28F) have been inseparable for over 10 years. She was my maid of honor less than a year ago. Everything seemed normal. She was amazing that weekend, and just a month ago she and her husband stayed with my husband and me for a visit. She talked about upcoming trips, their dogs, and house projects.

Two weeks later, she started acting off. I offered to fly out, then gave her space. Out of nowhere, her family called saying she’d filed for divorce and asked if I knew anything. Her husband and family were totally blindsided and worried she was having some kind of mental-health crisis.

That night, she texted me: “If anyone reaches out, no response... I’ll call you to explain.” I had already talked to her family by then. When she called later, she said their visit to me and my husband “was their last shot.” I was stunned. None of this had ever come up. I told her I loved her and just wanted her to be happy. I understand divorce is very personal but we share everything together that it seemed odd to not mention anything about it to me in any capacity.

After that, I sent one short “love you” text. She deleted me from Find My Friends and social media, changed her number, and cut off mutual friends and some family too.

Then this week, I got a formal email from her titled Harassment Warning. It said she doesn’t owe anyone an explanation, that this is a pivotal step toward her happiness, and that any further contact will be treated as harassment. It ended with “Please do not reply.” I'm not sure who, if anyone, else got this.

Her husband is in a dark place. He said she’s still talking to a few acquaintances. She is talking a lot  to a much older “life coach” type friend who’s telling her things like “you’re young, live your life, be selfish.” Her family thinks she's involved in a cult.

I’m  confused. It’s surreal to go from daily best friends to total silence.

What are healthy ways to process this? Do I expect to not hear from her again? It feels like a movie.

TL;DR: My best friend of 10 years suddenly filed for divorce, cut off everyone, and sent a “no contact” email calling further messages harassment. I’m shocked and have no idea how to process it or if she’s okay.

ANSWER: Her behavior does suggest she's got involved with something shady. Cult, drugs, affair, sounds like only she knows. Until you know more about what's going on it's hard to know if you can help her. Be patient and wait for more information. At the end of the day, she may not want any help and you may have to come to terms with that.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Ex (24m) got my name (27f) tattooed on his ribs after he cheated on me and left me for someone else, why?

My ex, who cheated on me and left me for someone else, got my name tattooed on his ribs, in huge letters, probably two inches tall each. We were together for a year before he cheated on me with a co-worker and completely abandoned me and started dating her.

Two months later, he came back saying I was his soulmate, that he loved me, and that he had changed his whole life, and then he went and got the tattoo.

I still can’t wrap my head around it. Why would someone do something so extreme after betraying and discarding you? How can a person claim to love you while doing all of that?

ADDING TO THIS:

\-He is a very charsmatic, good-looking person who can charm anyone. He fooled all my friends and family and everyone adored him. He wasn't an asshole, he was very nice and kind so this was genuinly a complete shock.. until I started discovering all the LIES.

\- HE ENDED IT WITH HER. She flipped on him when someone sent her a screenshot of him at my house. He called her and apologized and then they ended. I found this out MONTHS later after I went through his phone. I had no clue he was with someone else... I thought he just left me..

ANSWER: Enjoy the fact that every time he sees that tattoo he will be reminded of how stupid he was to treat you badly and lose you.

QUESTION: How do I politely tell my bf I'm touched out? 34f and 38m

IDK if this belongs here or in a parenting group. My (34f) boyfriend (38m) of about a year is very physically affectionate. I have a young child who is going through a sleep regression, BF and I don't live together, he only stays over on weekends.
BF likes to grope my waist, ass, breasts, thighs, basically anything he can get his hands on. Every time he spends the night he's biting his lip and growling at me when I change and wanting to hug me while I'm trying to clean or cook dinner. He always calls me sexy or gorgeous or hot or whatever but y'all, I'm exhausted. I bring it up and he goes "I can't help it, it's a guy thing". He'll stop me from grabbing stuff at the grocery store to get a hug and wants full on make outs every time we kiss, even if the kid is screaming because LO is overtired.

ANSWER: "I don't like that, please stop doing it" 

And if that's not enough, it's not because you're not saying it right. It's because he refuses to hear you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My GF (22F) dream is to be a stay-at-home wife and say I'm not doing the bare minimum. I (28M) on the other hand would like both of us to work.

My girlfriend and I has been dating for 2 years now. Recently we talked about what we want in the future, and she told me she wants to stay at home wife/mom. I told her that I don't want to do that because:

1. dynamic of power will be weird - i will have the say on what we do with the money
2. I want equal partnership and we both working will make more money to afford a bigger house and nice cars, and other things.
3. If i work by myself, we probably penny pitch and live pay check by pay check. I feel like that will make me resent her in the future because I'm financially savvy - i like to save and invest for retirement and not a big spender like that.

After i told her this, she brings up how her friend that she knows is doing that - stay at home mom. They have a house and will be going on vacations for 1-2 weeks a year. She say it is not impossible and she dont need alot in life - it could be a small house. But that's not what I want. I want both of us to work and be able to get a nice decent big house - like a 4-5 bedroom house with a 2 door garage and a basement and upstairs in a good neighborhood with luxury nice cars, and also be able to afford a nice vacation. You don't know what's really going on in another person relatioship and their life too. They could be in debt or very cheap on their vacation, or even just loaded with money. But for me I can't do that. I told her if I make doctor money or win the lottery then yes that will be on the table, but also the dyanmic of the relationship will shift too.

I think this is the breaking point in our relationship and I don't see how we can save it since we both want different things.

Is my thinking wrong or there's a way to fix this?

We have other issues like she say i don't celebrate monthsiversary and get her flowers every month - apparently in her culture they celebrate their relationship every month. I dont take her on dates a lot. She would give me examples of her friends in a relationship and getting gifts from their partners and going on dates. She wants to plan trips and dates and doesn't really want to do any of that. I don't do stuff she wants from a bf or the bare minimum.

But I do our laundry, make her food when she's over, and other stuff when she asks. I buy her gifts now and then, and try to surprise her, but not every month. I like to stay home and we usually see each other every day. I like to stay home with her and just watch a movie or something. I don't like how she compares us/me to others either. I tell her to just say what she wants from me, but she never does. She says that you should know as a bf, i should need to you how to be a bf. She says she gives me hints and i should we the clues.

At this point, I dont know what the bare minimum is anymore. Am I not doing enough? She is a lovely girl, sweet, and very caring to family and friends. Someone that is loyal and check all my boxes as a girlfriend.

EDIT: I want to clarify, OF COURSE she has a said in money. When I say the power dynamic is different, I'm saying here and there she can buy what she wants. But if it's like a big spending thing and i dont want to do it then I'll have the last say since I'm the one bringing home the money. Like if she wants to help a family member out from somewhere, then okay it depends how much and where we are. I will have to know EVERYTHING before we lend out money and how much will always be in question.

EDIT: She does work right now and a hard worker. She also supports her mom - very mature.

ANSWER: If you don't want that for yourself break up. She's 22 and still growing (up I hope). You have a right to want those things for you so you are simply incompatible.

We've talked about the time she spends at the barn in the past and she changed her work schedule around to get off sooner so she could go straight from work and then be home somewhere around 5-5:30.

Time goes by and now she starts helping more at the barn and is getting home later than 8pm twice per week and then on Sunday staying at the barn from 9a-4pm.   
  
I had a talk with her that this is unsustainable for me and we have to make some changes. She had a show coming up in several weeks, so we 'agreed' to maintain this schedule until after the show. The new terms is 1 evening she will be home for dinner, the other will be the same (8pm), but on Sunday will be home by noon. The first week of the new schedule goes by fine and I'm feeling like we've compromised and that this might be sustainable. But the first evening of the second week she's asking me to stay late again.. already trying to push from what was agreed upon, then on Sunday she says she's going over later because she wants to sleep in because we were out late Saturday, so she's at the barn from 10:30a-3:30p. 

And now I just can't get over the resentment, it's like her family is her lowest priority. 1 and 2 being both of her horses. 3 being the barn owners, (when we talk about schedules she always talks about how the barn owners need the help that they have taken too much on, I always tell her that is not our problem), 4 our toddler, 5 horse equipment, 6 me.

How do I make it clear this isn't working? What is fair as far as time for her hobby goes?

ANSWER: I'm a cyclist and this is an extremely common topic in our subs. Cycling can be a time-consuming sport, and there's a lot of "my partner spends 20 hours per week on the bike while I'm at home with the littles help!"


You two need to have a serious discussion about division of labor and division of rest/hobbies. You should have equal time to do your own thing, but it seems like she just does what she wants.

QUESTION: My gf (F23) told me (M23) she gets turned on knowing other dudes like her ?

We’ve been together for 4 years now. She told me the other day that she got turned on by knowing that some dudes at her work seem to be attracted to her a lot. And told me this after she came, I couldn’t even keep going. It was such a strange feeling. 

I know that over these 4 years some girls wanted to hook up, but even the slightest idea of doing it didn’t go through my mind. Even less I got turned on by that. 

Im not an insecure dude, but that hit me. 
How do you even understand this? Like how do even approach this, from where, and how do I get this out of my head.

ANSWER: She said this while you were having sex? 

My best guess is that she was trying to bring you into a kink or something but that's absolutely terrible timing.

I don't think it's all that unusual but I think most people keep that to themselves and I definitely don't think that they mention it in that situation unless they know that the other person is into it.

QUESTION: My (23F) boyfriend (25M) would rather jerk off to fully clothed women than sleep with me

My boyfriend has confessed to me he has jerked off to fully dressed streamers on instagram, Sabrina carpenter (one of my favorite singers and he knows that) and Jennifer Lawrence. I’m pretty sure he has also jerked off to girls he has went to school with’s pfp on Facebook. My issue is with the fact he often declines to have sex with me and we hardly sleep together. When I spoke to him about it he said it’s because he’s embarrassed about his penis size HOWEVER he has changed his answer as to why 1,000 times. I’m too goofy, he was worried that we’d get interrupted, he was too tired and he wanted to do it himself, he didn’t want to put in effort are some of the examples of other things he’s blamed it on. He also had made me throw all my toys away when we first got together because it made him uncomfortable so now I’m just sexually frustrated and feel worthless to him. It has taken a pretty big toll on my self esteem and no matter how much I try to forget it makes me very upset every few days I just wish I could forget about it. Any words of encouragement or hopes that it’ll get better? I just really wish it didn’t bother me like it does, I feel so stupid.

Small update disclaimer: I don’t know if it makes any difference but he was a virgin when I met him (2 years ago) so maybe possibly that might explain the behavior??? Idk maybe I’m just trying to justify it :(

                    UPDATE he said it’s because he sees 
                    me as a mom now instead of a whore               and can’t disrespect me like he wants to during sex.

ANSWER: Never hope it would get better. Basically bring out whats bothering you and communicate to your partner. Don't wait and take action.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (43M) suspect my girlffriend (F45) is in just for the money

Hello all,

I have been dated this girl for the past year. She was divorced twice previously but has no kids. She has a office support job and lives with her sister. She make about the median amount in our city. She's overall a sweet girl, but when it comes finances her ideas and mines diverge quite a bit.

I make significantly more than her and she has been very "aware" of this from the beginning. I pay for most our dates. She shows appreciation for it but at the same time expects me to. She does make contributions but they are always far smaller, the ratio is about 80/20. She often suggests places she would like to go, things she would to get, or activities she would like to do as hints for me to get them for her. On our second date she straight up asked me how much I was making. From early on also she has been talking about marriage. Given our age and that kids are practically not an option at this time, I don't care for marriage. Wanting to find out what her true intentions were I asked her if she would be ok with us not getting married. She said such relationship would go nowhere and wouldn't stay with him if we were to never. Then I suggested we do get a prenup, which she flat out refused. No matter what would led to the marriage failure she knows it would mean a big fat check for her and ruin for me. Given that she's already divorced twice before hitting 50 and she isn't a celebrity, I believe acting with caution isn't unreasonable.

She doesn't really reciprocate. The other day since I was sick with a cold she stopped by my house to drop me a container of vitamin C supplements from her home about to expire ....

I'm often left feeling she sees me like a walking ATM, which isn't a life goal of mine. To give a little background she is a of East Asian extraction.

Is this doomed?

ANSWER: I think what’s telling is the way you describe her. You already know this isn’t the relationship for you

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (32F) love my partner (31M) but I don’t desire to have children. How will this end?

We’ve been seeing each other for a year now. Each time the topic of children comes up, I always make it very known that I don’t want children and have no desire to be a mother. He thinks I’m not serious. He thinks I can be persuaded. He thinks I’m open to it. Most of the times I try to explain my decision, saying “I don’t want to be a mother because I know how selfish I am and I will never be a good mother.” He would respond something like “You’ll definitely be a good mother. I can tell.” 

I will no doubt sit down and have a serious conversation with him about this very soon.

The only chance I can be persuaded to have kids is if my partner steps up and takes most of the responsibilities. He said he’s happy to do his part and more but let’s be honest here, that’s unrealistic.

I’m going to get downvoted to oblivion for saying this but I am selfish. I refuse to sacrifice my career, my freedom and my life for a child. I know I’ll ultimately end up doing it and resenting them. 

I’m painfully aware a child needs both their parents and it would be incredibly unfair to bring someone into the world and not love them. 

I’m writing this but I already know what I have to do. However, I would like to know, if there’s anyone here that was persuaded to have kids by your partner and ended up being very miserable? Is breaking up the only option here? I would hate to be the reason he never got to be a father because he loves me too much to part ways.

ANSWER: Why are you still dating someone who's trying to change your mind on one of the most important things that you could do to impact your life?

The two of you are incompatible, full stop.

So I came home from work one night and my girlfriend was at her friends house. I offered multiple times to pick her up when I was close to being home. She denied and said she was already getting a uber. Which is red flag #1, I call her when she’s In the uber and I hear a man’s voice in the background. One that I recognize, I immediately say I’m at her house and want to see the uber driver drop you off…she hangs up and then FaceTimes me on the side of the street saying she wants me to pick her up when she was 8 mins from her house….every time I bring it up she makes me feel like I’m crazy or I’m just tripping. This happened about a month and a half ago and I keep bringing it up to her and everytime I do she says “you need to stop bringing this up or this isn’t going to work”so I stopped but I ALWAYS think about it and end up bringing it up….. I love this girl so much…part of me dosent want to believe it but my heart is telling me something isn’t right

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (30F) husband (32M) can't set boundaries with anyone and it's affecting our marriage

My husband and I have been together for 6 years, since we first got together I noticed we had very different aproaches to things that, at least to me, are simple to solve. Things like comunicating with his family before they come visit so we could prepare instead of a surprise weeking stay arriving at our door at 5 am of a Friday, asking for our furniture to not be rearranged, or our closet reorganized unnecessarily and without our consent.

Personally I’m not one to put up with this kind of stuff, and that’s the reason I don’t have any contactwith my father or his side of the family, but knowing how important it’s to him I did my best to make them feel welcome once every 3 months, while still asking him gently to set some rules. But after years of putting up with them, their behaviour and snarky remarks about my body, how we’re raising our kids and unwanted two cents about our marriage I did something about it.

We were expecting our second daughter, had just lost her twin and it was a very high risk pregnancy, after the usual hell imposed by his mom + evil remarks that she “had a feeling this time we had twins on the way” one week after my surgery to remove the other baby, I told him I didn’t want her around until our baby was born and had taken her 2nd round of vaccines at 2 months old. He talked to her about it and with his brother.

This resulted in his family bringing out all the guns to manipulate us. First trying to make me feel like I was being a b- and after it didn’t work, trying to turn him against me. Surprisingly he stood his ground but after a while I found out his brother is trying to convince him to separate and move states with our oldest daughter.

I confronted him, he swears he loves me and would never do something like that, but told me that he fear that by setting boundaries with them they won’t love him anymore. I get where he’s coming from, but it’s gotten to the point where we make decisions about our lives, career related, about our kids education, or our marriage (!) and I am only informed out agreement is not on anymore after I ask him and he says: “I didn’t think I needed to tell you, I’ve talked to my brother and changed my mind”

I just can’t stand this anymore! He also refuses to set healthy boundaries with our daughter, and won’t let me do it without trying to guilt trip me. I wanna help him set himself free of this codependency with his family but he even refuses therapy. I don’t wanna leave him unless it’s the only option left, but I’ll admit the thought has crossed my mind a lot lately.

How can I save my marriage?

ANSWER: I'm not a mental health professional, but it sounds like Your husband has some serious abandonment issues. Without background I can only guess(though it seems obvious)where they come from and it's causing him to be a doormat.

If it were me I'd have a serious conversation about possibly getting into therapy, but it's going to take time and there's no guarantee that even that'll help

The question you now have to ask yourself is do you want to raise your children with a man that will likely continue to put his family above you and your kids?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (33M) just recently found out my gf (27f) previously had sex with her (40m) “best friend” and she lied about it

For this story I will be John, she will be Jane and he will be Jack.

I work with Jane. Back in March she threw a party that I showed up to. We flirted a lot and kissed but we work together so I didn’t want to overdo it and pursue too hard. 

I could tell she had a crush on me and my feelings were growing for her.

Two weeks later at the end of March we hang out again and this time we have sex and so begins our relationship. 

Then in June we go to a concert with a large group of friends. I’m introduced to Jack as a normal friend of the group. 

Jane tells me Jack is a new but good friend. I accept this and we hangout with him a lot through September. Many hangouts with his new gf, group events, and sometimes just me Jane and Jack. A trio. 

One night I had a gut feeling something was up so I went through her phone (bad I know but keep reading).

I found texts on her phone that Jane and Jack had sex the week in between her party in March and when I got together with her two week later. 

Jane instructed all of her friends to go along with the lie. I found texts proving it. 

I called out Jane and she said “it’s not that big of a deal” “it was in the past it doesn’t matter” Things like that. 

I asked her why was it so important to keep Jack around? She said he’s a cool guy and everyone in the group likes him. She denied having feelings for him and called their short tryst casual.

I also found texts that she was planning on introducing Jack to her Dad when he visits for thanksgiving.

I feel embarrassed hurt and lied to. She denies having feelings for Jack but I just don’t think that’s possible. 

She said she lied because she knew I’d be upset. But she did it anyway and protected another man and didn’t care about my feelings. 

The question is: is she still lying saying she doesn’t have feelings for this guy? You would lie about someone, keep them around for months, and introduce them to your Dad and not have feelings for them? It doesn’t add up to me. Thanks.

ANSWER: I wouldn’t trust her enough to continue the relationship at this point. That is a significant lie, and pulling everyone else into it seems mentally ill.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My fiancé, 38M cheated on me with my cousin 39M and I found out through Grindr. My whole world has fallen apart.

I don’t even know where to start. I’m 31 (F) and I’ve just had my entire life flipped upside down in the space of 48 hours. I’ve been with my fiancé (38 M) for almost three years. We live together, have been planning our wedding, raising my son, and trying to build a life after everything we’ve already been through: court cases, his drinking, financial struggles, you name it. I thought we’d already survived the worst. Turns out I had no idea what “worst” even meant.

He came home the other night absolutely drunk. We had about $300 left in the account, and when he walked through the door, there was $29 left. He passed out on the couch, and his phone was open. On Grindr. If you don’t know what that is, it’s a hookup app for gay and bi men.

My stomach dropped. Before I met him, I knew he’d experimented. He had a thing for butt play and had slept with trans people in the past. I never judged him for it. I thought it was something from his past, not something ongoing. I’m open-minded. I don’t “yuck someone’s yum.” But this was different. This wasn’t old curiosity. It was active, recent, and constant.

I opened the messages, and what I saw made me physically sick. He had dozens of chats with men and trans people, explicit photos, constant sexting. But one chat stood out. The location, the profile picture, the name. It was my cousin (39M).

I froze. I couldn’t breathe. My cousin is transgender, and I’ve known for years he’s on Grindr. We aren’t close. I haven’t spoken to my extended family in over a decade because of old trauma and family drama. But still, he’s my cousin. And my fiancé had met up with him at my auntie’s house. They slept together, unprotected, and my fiancé actually bragged in the chat about it, writing things like, “Thanks for letting me breed you, can’t wait to do it again.”

I felt my entire body go numb. He slept with my cousin. On my nan’s birthday. Then came home to me like nothing happened. And did it TWICE. 

I confronted him that night, or tried to. He was passed out drunk, literally lying in bed covered in his own feces because he’d shit himself. His phone and wallet were hidden outside in his ute, so when I couldn’t find them, I rang his phone, snuck out, and found it in the car. That’s how I saw everything. Every message. Every photo. I deleted every single picture of me off his phone, even the intimate ones, because I didn’t trust him not to use them out of spite later.

I also confronted my cousin. He tried to act innocent, saying “I didn’t know his name, I didn’t know he was your fiancé.” Bullshit. He absolutely knew. He even told my fiancé that ‘You (me) probably told everyone at Christmas,” like I’d been gossiping about my fiancé being bisexual at a family event, except I haven’t attended a family Christmas in years. Not in 2024, not in 2023. My cousin only could’ve known about him because my sister still talks to him. So now it feels like they’ve all been talking about me behind my back, and somehow I’m the one being blamed.

To make it worse, when I confronted my fiancé sober, he became aggressive. He pushed me, raised his fists at me and at my son, and punched a hole in the wall. We already have an AVO in place, but I felt unsafe in my own house. I spent that night awake, terrified, while he slept in my bed like nothing happened.

Now I’m sitting here, trying to hold it together for my son, realising I can’t afford to stay in Sydney on my income alone. I’d have to drop out of uni, give up my nursing degree, and move hours away just to survive. I don’t have family support. I don’t have savings. I’m looking at two-bedroom rentals in cheaper towns, trying to figure out how to rebuild from nothing.

People at work were kind. They hugged me, cried with me. One woman said something that stuck with me:
“You’re expecting rational decisions from an irrational person. He’s an alcoholic, a sex addict, and he’ll destroy anyone around him if it means escaping accountability.”

And she’s right.

It’s one thing to be cheated on. It’s another to find out your fiancé slept with a man, your cousin, and they both knew.

I’m heartbroken, but mostly I’m angry. Angry that I stayed, that I supported him, that I paid bills and raised his kids while he was out living a double life. Angry that he could do something this vile and still walk around the house like nothing happened.

I’m done. There’s no wedding. There’s no coming back. Just me and my son now, starting over again.

How do you just move on from something like this? Who has betrayed me more my cousin or fiancé?

ETA: He is an alcoholic and was charged with DV against me earlier in the year hence the AVO. The matter before the courts relates to driving….i know, red flag after red flag..I honestly try and see the good in people and look past their negative traits but this was one of those times when I should’ve run away at the start.

ANSWER: I’m so sorry. 

You’re Aussie? Lodge for Centrelink TODAY. They will backdate an approved claim. 
There are also resources for emergency payments to help you leave. 

Speak to your uni. There is a lot more support for single parents in study and escaping DV then there used to be. 

Rental market in Sydney is absurd. Have you checked the outer suburbs? Can you continue your study partially online? Many TAFEs have nursing courses which may help

================================================================================

QUESTION: My partner of 3 years (M33) says that he would only merry me (F34) if I agree to have a swinger relationship.

My boyfriend recently told me that he would never want to marry me unless I agreed to have threesomes or group sex in the future. He said he’d rather break up than live a strictly monogamous life, because he can’t imagine being with only one person forever.

According to him, this is just “the reality of men” that if someone is attractive, they’ll naturally have many opportunities with other women and will eventually cheat if they’re in a monogamous relationship. He believes that allowing threesomes or open experiences is a way to prevent cheating.

As a side note, he often tells me that I’m his most healthy and mature relationship, that I give him stability, peace, and a sense of belonging and family. I have a successful career, I take care of our home, I cook, and I genuinely try to be a supportive and loving partner. In my head, I consider myself a really good girlfriend.

But lately, he’s been saying that he misses the intensity, the “crazy sex experiences” and wild lifestyle he had before me. He says that kind of excitement is more important to him. Once a man experiences a lifestyle like this, he can't go back to boring monogamy.

It honestly shatters me, because it makes me feel like no matter how much I grow, give, or love, it will never be enough simply because I’m not enough for him as he said. And personally me I never had these kind of experiences, even the though makes me uncomfortable. But who knows, maybe if I try it I would enjoy it? What would you do in my position? Would you settle?

ANSWER: What a weird hill to die on. He's saying that because he's a man he will cheat unless there's a swinger relationship and places the responsability on that happening on you. I'd not settle I would leave and find a better life partner.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (31F) Nan passed away and he (29M) went out with the boys.

I(31F) messaged my partner (29M) that my grandma had just passed away around 4:30pm while I was at work.

He was nice and comforting. He finishes work around 4:30-5pm. I assumed he’d be heading home to see me, we have lived together for the last 5 years and been together for 6 years.

I got home at bit before 6pm, fed the pets. Messaged him to ask if he was heading home.

Didn’t get a response so took the dog for a 15 min walk.

When I came home, his car was there but no sign of him.

I called him - three rings, voicemail. Called again, one ring, voicemail. I thought maybe he’s at the shops and can’t talk. Then thought, nah, I’ll call again. He answers this time.

“Oh, I didn’t know where you were and we wanted to go out to dinner. I didn’t know if you wanted some food. I’m out with the boys for dinner.”

Didn’t text me, didn’t call. He surely would have seen the dog was missing and could have figured I’d be back soon.

I did text him to say I’m upset and not happy with him going out with friends.

He did text back: I thought you might be on phone to Mum or family, or working late again. When we got there I saw you weren’t home and I was going to ask you to come get food to get your mind off things.

He got home at 9pm. I was pretty upset and yelled at him. He’s blaming me for not being here and making a fight out of nothing. Apparently I should have come out if I was that upset.

I told him I wanted a hug. At home.

“ Do you want one now”

I feel shocked and upset. I assumed he would be home to see me after work, but I didn’t ask him to be. 

He hasn’t experienced the loss of a family member himself but if the roles were reversed, I would have been home to see him. 

How do I discuss this with him, without him getting defensive?

edit - my Nan was 97 and had a fantastic life. I was told in June she was starting to decline and to come visit. I had a lengthy conversation with my partner because I couldn’t afford the flights but I wanted to see her. 

I only have one photo of her. My partner accidentally lost all my photos, I lost all my family photos of growing up with her. /edit

TL;DR I (31F) told my partner (29M) my Nan passed away and he went out to dinner with the boys.

ANSWER: Who goes out to dinner with friends right after finding out that someone close to their partner has passed away? That’s honestly insensitive and really immature on his part.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (23f) tell my co-worker (24m) that he has really bad BO without making him feel like it's a microaggression?

I (23f) have a new co-worker (John-24m) who is Indian. We work in the same office block and for the first 3 weeks, he was shadowing me. He has some major personal hygiene issues- his breath is bad, his BO is horrific and I started breathing through my mouth when he's around. I've even heard other co-workers mention it. John doesn't seem to notice. 

A few days ago, we where talking and he had some homemade Indian food. he asks if I'm ok with him eating it, I say of course. He then tells me that the reason he had to switch jobs was due to 'anti-Indian racism' from old co-workers; mainly, saying he smells bad which I know is a harmful thing said about many Indian people. 

But John does, genuinely, actually smell bad. It has nothing to do with the fact he's Indian and my assessment of his BO is not affected by his ethnicity, but it's becoming a real issue in the workplace. I don't know how to bring it up to him. I feel like a huge asshole because I'm kind of starting to wonder if the 'racism' at his old workplace was actually just his co-workers mentioning his poor hygiene. But I don't know. 

I don't know whether to mention it to him in person, or to HR. I don't want him taking it the wrong way. Besides the BO, he's a lovely guy and I don't want him to feel attacked here, too.

ANSWER: Take it to HR. Let the institution handle this. If you tackle it as an individual, you won’t have the same protections or weight to it.

First off just to explain how poor I was growing up. My mom was terminally ill pretty much my entire life, after she passed my dad stopped talking to me/my brother.

At 16 I moved into my car, after years of on and off homelessness and crappy jobs I started working as a waitress at a pretty nice restaurant and was able to rent a crappy room. This to me was absolute luxury, having my own room lol.


I met him at like midnight walking home from work. He saw me and was concerned about me, wanted to help me. So I gave in and let him drive me home. I ended up agreeing to go out with him but I was in a lot of debt, and obviously struggling.

He was not judgemental at all, he helped me get out of it. I moved into his home, we obviously ended up engaged. He is truly an amazing guy but I don’t understand how he differentiates me from others in the same scenario.

We have a good life now, I’m a housewife which for someone like me after years of chaos is extremely peaceful and amazing, he works in law. We’re planing on having a baby soon..
So this isn’t something I want to leave him over, it’s more that I’m looking for help on how to better communicate with him.

He knows Everything and he knows I was homeless, but he’ll say things about homeless people being “dirty” or needing to “get off their ass and work” right in front of me.

But he literally was the one that pulled me out of that, I could have very well (and probably would have) ended up back in that situation.

I asked him what is different about me, and the homeless man he was talking about and he laughed and said “it wasn’t even comparable” so no real explanation.


We were laying in bed the other night and talking about the cost of living in our area and he made a joke he liked it and hoped it continued to go up because he doesn’t want the people who can’t afford it in his neighborhood.. and I was just like… okay but that is me.

And he says it’s not, because it’s not anymore but he’s basically saying in my mind that if I were single & still in a bad situation I’m right there with the people he’s insulting.


There was also another time, we were shopping on rodeo drive and some guy was asking me for money for coffee, I was trying to find my wallet and he pulled me away. He did actually give this guy money but he was pissed I was talking to him, said if he wants money he can get a job and also said it’s dangerous for me to talk to them.
But as someone who lived it i know most of these people are good people. I understand using caution but genuinely most are good.

He literally let me in his car the first night we met, he thought i was homeless and wasn’t scared of me

He says I’m thinking way too much, and it has nothing to do with me. But i just can’t help but think… what did you truly think of me when we met?

ANSWER: It only “doesnt apply to you” because he’s attracted to you and likes you. But if that went away, it would 100% apply to you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My boyfriend ‘M/24’ asked for a threesome with my ‘F/22’ bestfriend ‘F/21’. How do I deal with that?

I know that is already a quick update since I just posted today but after reading all of the comments all day I immediately talked with my boyfriend after he got home from work.

The first post is here btw:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/s/GgB519dA97

And some people texted me and asked how long we’ve been dating which is a little over two years + we are living together.

So after overthinking all night and all day today, I asked my boyfriend if we can go over it again and I feel a lot better.

We immediately sat down and had a long conversation. We talked about everything. I told him that I felt uncomfortable and couldn’t get it out of my head. I told him that I was worried on why he is focused on my best friend being the other girl and that it got me worried, especially, because he never mentioned the idea of a threesome before.

He then told me what he thinks:

He said he isn’t interested in a threesome because it’s my best friend. He’s not secretly into her, not crushing on her, nothing like that. He explained that what really happened is that he got excited when I mentioned that she and I had hooked up once when we were younger. He said that for him that means that my best friend and I are already comfortable with each other in that way and that it might be an option for more experimenting. He said it’s less awkward than involving a stranger and less of an hassle, he said my best friend is chill and open minded when it comes to sex (she is single btw, bc some people asked about that, and she is quite casual and talks openly about sex a lot). He said for him, my best friend meant safe and no drama, but he understands why I was worried. He really reassured me that there is nothing to worry about.

He said the whole fantasy came from the idea of me being with another girl I trust, not from wanting her specifically. He says to him it sounds hot and got him thinking. However, he doesn’t care if he is actually sleeping with my best friend as the turn on for him is seeing me with her. 

He would like to have that experience of watching me with her but only if I am comfortable with that. 

Because I got so worried, he wants me to make sure that that’s something I wouldn’t regret and if I think it has potential of ruining things, that we shouldn’t do it. 

So he pretty much told me he doesn’t need a “full threesome” at all. He said if I don’t like the idea of it, he is fine with not touching my friend at all and just being a bystander. 

What he imagines is: 

him just watching us kiss or make out. He said that he would like to see some more sexual stuff but only if i am okay with it. Also he doesn’t even need my best friend to take off her clothes (if i am not okay with that or scared of him seeing her like yhat). So mostly him watching her do things to me, and then him and I having sex afterward. 

He said he doesn’t need anything more, only if i want that with them two. And less would be fine too, or nothing at all. He doesn’t want to pressure me but he would definitely like us to try it (if i am fine with it).

I told him I need time to think before making any decision, and he said he fully respects that.

Honestly, after hearing him explain everything, I feel way calmer. It doesn’t feel like he’s into her anymore. It feels more like he got excited about the idea of seeing me with another girl, especially one I’m already safe and comfortable with. I’m starting to think I might have overreacted at first, but I’m giving myself time to think it through before deciding if we’ll try this “experiment.”

Also I would have to ask my best friend if that would be something she would want to do too (I think she would since she was open for the idea of a threesome if I decide if I want that in our previous conversation), if I decide that I want to try that, but first i am just going to take my time to think about it because I don’t want to ruin everything. So I don’t think there is gonna be another update from me anytime soon since I will take my time and sit on his idea first.

ANSWER: Never bring other people into the bedroom unless  everyone is 100% on board. You also need to be aware this could permanently damage or end both your relationship and your friendship. Think carefully.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I 24F got a piercing, now my partner 29M whines how little I value his opinion.

My (24f) partner (29m) and me have been together for close to five years now.

I am a very outgoing person in how I present myself. Tattoos, colourful clothes, statement piece jewellery etc. He on the contrary is rather conservative, but never has been anything but supportive.

The artistic way I engage with myself and others was, according to him, one of the main reasons why he felt drawn to me.

Over the years we had small arguments here and there about dresscodes and whatnot but that was easily resolved.

Now. i have been thinking about getting a Labret piercing (lip piercing) for close to half a year now. I talked to him about it.

He hated the idea. We sat down and I told him that I was planning on getting one and he told me he didn’t want me to “mutilate” my face. 

Well. Today I got my piercing, after hearing him out, and telling him that I still wanted one.
 
Before I left for the piercer he told me “your journey m’am”

Now I cane back and we had this long conversation where he revealed he felt I don’t value his opinion.

He brought up how he was the main provider (true) and how therefore he would feel more appreciated if I took his opinions into consideration.

I usually do. But from the start we have established that he doesn’t get to tell me what to do with my body, samesies goes for me.

Legitimately I am so angry at him for it. Because yes I heard his opinion, I just didn’t let it change my decision.

Am I the selfish asshole here who should have not gotten a piercing because he disliked it? Why would he expect me to forego my own bodily autonomy for his opinion?

For what it’s worth, I think the labret looks fantastic on me. 

UPDATE

Firstly a few things I saw getting asked in the comments:

Yes I have other piercings, Bellybutton and Nipples, the latter of which he ADORES

And Yes when bringing up the Labret with him, I asked him if he would find that piercing unattractive on me. He said “No”. He did bring up that he wouldn’t want to kiss my piercing whenever we kissed however, which influenced my choice to get a normal Labret rather than a vertical one.

No he does not attempt to tell me what to do in terms of who to meet, where to go, when I should be home, who my friends are etc. I am safe and don’t feel he is controlling, though the way I phrased things above did make it seem that way. 

Yes, the way our financial situation is currently was pre-negotiated. I moved to his homecountry because I had an easier time doing so than vice-versa, but also meant my career was put a bit on hold.

Yes I brought up to him how him dangling “Well I’m the provider” over my head was a dick move and he apologised for it. Said it was a moment of insecurity on his end.

Now to get to the actual update on our talk.

I think the consensus we reached is that the piercing in itself is not the issue.

He felt excluded from this whole shabang.  He does not find me unattractive with the piercing now. Fuck, this dude met me when I had a buzzcut! Which I myself can look back at and say not my best hairstyle lmao. 

We discussed how it made him insecure in the relationship that I excluded him in this, and concluded that if I decide to get more piercings, he wants to tag along to “hold my hand” when being poked with needles. I find that a bit unnecessary but hey if it makes him secure fine. 

In general I think over the years he’s realised that I am still a very independent person. I never thought that was a bad thing. I would never want to burden my partner by asking for help when I damn well know I can deal with shit on my own.

He brought up that this mindset, while he understands it… well essentially wants to help me. He very grudgingly admitted that he only feels loved when he can be of use.

I don’t quite know how to explain to him that I’d love him even if he was a worm, but if he needs to provide acts of service to feel loved, alright.  I can work with that. 

If anything I am a bit shocked it took five fucking years for him to admit to me that while he adores me for how independent and confident I am, he does feel insecure in knowing that I don’t “need” him.

Like gurl in my humble opinion a partnership is not meant to be dependant on the other.  I love him for being my gentle giant who I can talk to about anything, who gies the best advice and makes me see things from other perspectives. And yes sure he overly worries about my safety, but I am reckless. Not in a self-destructive way, but in the sense that if I think climbing a tree is fun I will doit even if I scrape up my hands.

Essentially the update is that I found out he feels incredibly insecure, both in how much I love him and if I would not leave him for someone else.

You folks have been lovely with advice thus far, do you have advice for that as well?

ANSWER: Of course it’s ultimately your decision.  But at a certain point, you need to look at the consistent, ongoing (and apparently escalating) pattern of him not being happy with your fashion and body modification choices, and ask yourself if this relationship is really a good fit for either of you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: [Please help] I feel like my husband [40M] is prioritizing his new female coworker [30F] over me [36F] and we are discussing divorce over this.

I am currently discussing divorce with my husband of 8 years, in a relationship for 12 years. 

For context, one of the worst fights we had happened shortly after we got married, 7 years ago, when a part of his family was being racist toward me. After many months of suffering he did talk to the family member and agreed that they were not willing to put any effort to make me feel respected, and that he is ok keeping distance from them. I feel like similar dynamic is happening again but with a random coworker of opposite gender, which makes it far worse. I have been extremely hurt and could not think straight for many months, and now I just feel numb. I am seeking for some objective point of views to help me process the situation, if anyone can bear with me.

\long txt warning\

My husband had this new coworker joining his team at the end of last year. He was onboarding her, and I did not think much of it, but noticed that he started mentioning her very frequently. 

Early this spring, he started acting very cold and distant towards me. I tried to be understanding, as I knew that he was going through a tough time at work, but after a few weeks I told him that his actions hurt me, he is being cruel to me for some reason I do not understand and that I would like to take some time away from him. He apologized profoundly and told me that he was feeling resentful toward me about our past fights. He promised that he’ll pay attention and that he won’t take me for granted. He kept his words to the extent he could.

A few months later, he asked if it is ok to take the same flight with this new coworker for a business trip (just two of them), and I still did not think much about it. I just noticed that he has never done that with other male coworkers of his for many years when he was on business trips with them.

The day before the trip, he said that he will ride with her to the airport as she offered to pick him up on the way, although the company pays for everything including the ride to the airport. I thought that is crossing my boundaries and asked him not to. He insisted that he wants to take the same car with her and we had an argument for many hours, and eventually he reluctantly said he will reject her offer.

He continued telling me that he really wants her, her fiancé, him and me to be good friends. I asked him what is he going to do if they are mean to me (I have heard a few stories of her being somewhat nationalistic, which he agreed as well, and I was concerned that they may be against me as I am an immigrant). He said that then he’ll have to hang out three of them without me, which made me feel really confused and worried that his first option is to drop me not those people. He later said that he was not putting much thought into this “three of us” comment when he said it, but I started to feel like he is prioritizing the relationship with this coworker over me.

A few weeks later, the four of us had a dinner together and it was actually pleasant, I thought she may not have good boundaries towards married couple but does not have bad intentions and that I was open to be friends with them. My husband was happy to hear that and we planned another gathering a few months later for a brunch. 

However, I still felt somewhat uncomfortable as she kept inviting herself to our weekend plans and my husband really wanted to accept them all. This went on for many weeks in a row. I could not quite understand why he feels obligated to accept these requests, when the two of us have already made plans, and normally he does not like changing plans to the extent that he becomes passive aggressive towards me when I suggest to change something.

One day, I visited his office per his invitation as his company was holding a family event. We were planning on going to a concert that evening. This coworker was there too, and she said that she also decided to go to the same concert, and that she’ll buy her ticket onsite. She then invited herself again, that we should all go together to have dinner and hang out before the concert. My husband beamed up visibly and I was unhappy, as we had a different plan to run errands before going to the concert but he seemed to have forgotten about it completely. I told her that we cannot directly head there because we have to stop by somewhere else, while trying to be nice, and I could see that she was pissed at me for saying it. I thought this is a sign that she prioritizes her friendship over our marriage, which was not an ok behavior for me.

As we headed out to run the errands, we had a big argument. He claimed that he did not forget the errands and that he thought I told her about it and she was just suggesting to meet us for dinner after we were done. I had hard time taking this excuse as it really did not make any sense, he was there the whole time I was talking to her, and to be honest I was already quite upset. I told him that he can go to the concert with her while I just go home, and he was very upset at the way I said it- he said that if I said it nicely he would have believed that and took it. We ended up going to the concert without having any dinner. We also started couple’s counseling per my husband’s request, as this seems to have become a source of continuous fights for us.

In the mean time she was texting him, sometimes over the weekend, with personal stuff, which also made me feel uncomfortable. She also bought him an expensive and rare gift for his birthday which I felt is out of line for someone who’s known him for less than a year, especially given that my husband is her senior at work and this can create a conflict of interest. With these continuing, per my request my husband reluctantly created a group chat to coordinate the planned brunch, and I still tried to talk to her nicely even though she appeared annoyed at me for not being up for all her self-inviting. She did not engage with most of my messages, only actively replying to my husband. Then on the morning of brunch day, she explicitly only referred my husband and told him that she’s sorry but they cannot make it to the brunch, which I felt excluded as I was in the same chat but she went out of her way to call only my husband’s name in the message. I told my husband I felt disrespected, which he disagreed and that he wants to continue deepening his relationship with this person. 

A few weeks after, he started saying that he wants to have weekly workout followed by brunch with his coworkers every weekend, which included one or two other coworkers and her. I said that does make me feel uncomfortable, but he really wanted it and that he has nothing to hide because I am always invited. I was already quite unhappy with this coworker and spending more time pretending to be ok with this person was a waste of my time, so I did not want to sign myself up for weekly socializing. He insisted that he wants to go and after another few weeks of argument we decided we can join the brunch part together. The brunch was alright but they stopped doing it after I joined.

In the mean time we continued couple’s counseling, and my husband said that he feels resentful toward me for blocking him from having a social life and that I am getting into his way whenever someone is ever trying to get close to him. He is traumatized by me and afraid that he will never have a close friend. I felt like this is a generalization and that he specifically wants to be with this female coworker is the issue I have. For example, I encouraged him to hang out with his male coworkers but he made excuses and never made it happen. 

Furthermore, he continued saying that even if it is not this coworker, if there is a female person who approaches him in the future, even if I feel they do not respect the boundaries and our marriage, as long as he does not see it that way he would like to regularly hangout with them without me, since it does not necessarily mean that he is having a close friendship with that female person.

Then two weeks ago, he was sad for the whole weekend, then told me that he had a conversation with this coworker that I (his wife) am not comfortable with her and that he cannot hang out with her privately. I did not request it and it was out of nowhere so I was confused but I thanked him for taking my concerns seriously. He omitted mentioning to me that while I am not ok with her, he is ok with her and that he would like to remain friends with her, which I later found out. Then last Friday, this coworker and her fiancé offered my husband a ride home from work, which he took, but did not mention to me until the next day which made me feel really hurt. 

There are three things I found problematic. 1) the ride home offer after knowing that I am not comfortable with her is another clear sign that she puts her friendship over my relationship with my husband. 2) he intentionally omitted the part of him directly telling her that he would like to remain friends with her. 3) I feel like I cannot trust him when it comes to anything with this coworker. Plus, it is really exhausting to continue fighting over someone who makes me feel uncomfortable and to feel like my own husband is the one who is protecting the person, not me.

Now I feel like this is becoming an irreconcilable differences in values between him and me. I need to be comfortable with his female friends if he were to be close with them outside of work, but he thinks I am too sensitive and overreacting and that it is my issue to resolve and he does not need to change his actions, otherwise he will resent me. I don’t want to stay with someone who will resent me for the rest of my life, but it is scary to leave a relationship I had for a good 1/3 of my life. I also considered him not only a husband but also my best friend, so it hurts even more.

Am I being unreasonable, paranoid, and sabotaging his social life and that I need to fix it?

ANSWER: Yeahhhhh your husband is not in a relationship with you, he's in a relationship with THEM. The coworker and her "fiancee" are the only two people he cares about out of the three of you. He's checked out of your marriage. Might be time for you to do so as well.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I feel like I'm (36M) forcing my wife (35F) to get rid of her cat and I don't like it.

Looking for opinions on a situation I have, I (36M) feel like I'm forcing my wife (35F) to get rid of her cat of 7 years. I am not much of a pet person, but I'm okay with them cause it makes my wife happy. The issue is, we have a cat who will not stop spraying in the house and it has become a cleanliness issue now. I feel embarrassed to have people over because I feel like I can still smell cat spray. This happens at least once a week and has been going on for over a year now. We've been married for just over a year and I feel like it started since she's moved in with me, which was almost 2 years ago now.

We have tried multiple things, the cat has already been fixed, but now know that's not a guarantee to fix spraying. We've tried multiple liter boxes, those cat pheromone scent things, we feed him well, fresh water...The only thing I'm finding is that it's stressed that will cause this, but I don't know what is so stressful for him. I'm never mean to it, I try to be as friendly as possible but nothing is changing. 

My wife is pregnant, we're redoing some of the house, fresh carpet and refinishing a basement bathroom, along with getting a nursery ready, and we recently just came home from a vacation, we had a friend and a family member check in on the cat, feed him, and clean litter box while we were gone. When we came back home we were hit with a stench of cat spray in the house. I kinda lost it cause I no longer feel comfortable in my own home, told her that this has to change. The cat sprays if we rearrange a room, let alone fresh carpeting, and remodeling, I feel like all that is going to just get destroyed by this cat.

Now the issue is my wife is putting the cat up for adoption, obviously at this point I would love nothing more than to see this cat go bye bye, but she's sad and more than anything I don't want to see her sad. I feel like it's not just "I don't like your cat" but more of a problem and nuisance, however I am stuck between a rock and a hard place because I don't want my wife to resent me over this. She says she's doing it cause it's the right thing to do, but I don't believe her, I feel like I've forced her hand on this. I just wish she came to this conclusion before I had to say anything about it. I don't know what to do...

Sorry for the long story, please help on what I should do, am I out of line on this? Is there anything else I can do for this situation?

EDIT: we did take the cat to the vet, vet ran a couple tests, found cat is healthy and stated it seems like it's stressed induced. Vet said to confine the cat to a single room again and slowly reintroduce it to the rest of the house, we tried that over the course of a month or so, didn't change anything :/ 

UPDATE: THANK YOU ALL FOR THE FEEDBACK, we will continue to work with the cat for awhile. I should have expressed that these renovations haven't happened yet, but my concern was that if it's bad now, it certainly won't be any better when that begins. Also, after talking to my wife, she said the vet did prescribe Prozac, but she said it was too much of a fight with the cat for the cat to take it....so there's that lol

ANSWER: Medication for cats like prozac is a great option to treat spraying! Pls consider it before going to adoption. Chances are a cat who sprays due to stress will have an incredibly hard time getting adopted.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (26F) fiancé(26M) are having a disagreement on equal contribution after marriage. How do we come up with a solution?

Hi everyone, 

My fiancé and I are getting married in September 2026 and we have been discussing a lot about how married life would look for us. 

We align on a lot of things except the whole ‘50-50’ life style. I personally don’t believe in 50-50 in a relationship because one will always do more than the other. Whereas, he does. I don’t think it will ever be as equal as 50-50. 

Currently, we live together and bills are split evenly. I pay for my half of the rent, council tax and wifi. He pays for his half of the rent, electric and water. We also split food shops down the middle. Bills wise I pay more, but to make up the difference he pays for one week food shop by himself. I have a longer commute to work so that means I also have to pay for more petrol (which is not cheap). At the end of the month, I’m left with nothing and he is fine. He doesn’t drive so we live close to his work so he can get to and from work easier. 

With household task, we’ve split that as well. He does the dishes, laundry, takes the bins out and cooks twice a week. I hoover, general tidying, clean the bathroom and cook 5 times a week. We’re really happy with how we split the housework, but it’s the financial side that we don’t seem to agree on. 

The disagreement started because we were talking about how we will split everything including housework and childcare. He said housework would probably stay the same and with financial the same. But we will take into account how much each person makes and work it out from there. The issue started when we discussed what happens during maternity/ paternity leave. His work offers 4 weeks to the father and my work place offers 12-18 months.  for the mother. We were talking about how I wanted to take as much time as possible to stay home and bond with our child. He seems okay with this but the question of how will all other things work out. He said everything will stay the same. I don’t agree with this because it doesn’t really work with his 50-50 Mindset because I will be doing more of the childcare stuff. We talked about how we will do 50-50 of that and he doesn’t have an answer. 

I asked if he’s will to do night feed and changes and he said he doesn’t know because he will need sleep for work. So far, the way it sounds is he seems to think I will do 90% of the childcare stuff and he will do his 10% during the weekend when he can have the whole day with them. He is saying he will do more when the child is older but that just means the first 2-3 years of the kids life will fall on me to manage. I don’t think this is fair. I have to do all my current housework, plus take care of the baby and on top of that, because I would be getting paid maternity pay, he is saying I can still pay my half of the bills. 

I don’t like this arrangement at all. It makes it seem like he’s getting everything he wants and sometime off as well. Where I would be working 24/7 in the house and also contributing financially. It also doesn’t align with his 50-50 lifestyle. 

We had a very big argument last year over finances and since then I’ll admit I’ve had my guard up when it comes to this. 

I’m trying to explain to him my point of view on this but he just doesn’t seem to get it. 

How can I explain to him that the way he’s looking at it is not equal at all? Is there a solution to this? 

Edit:

 For those who read my previous post and have questions as to why I am still with him. He made a promise and told me he understood where I was coming from and apologised and said it won’t happen again. I told him the next time we have this discussion I was done. He said he understood and now we’re here. I think in the back of my mind, I thought we would be having this discussion again but just hoped it wouldn’t happen. 

I am also pushing for a prenup if the wedding takes place and I am asking for premarital counselling which he is refusing to go to because he thinks the counsellor will side with me. 

Edit: 

Hi again. Thank you all for the support and giving me your advice. Everything you said, I’ve thought about time and time again. I think I just needed the validation that this is red flag behaviour and not just a bump in the road. 

I’ve struggled to bring things up in this relationship because everytime I have he has said I’m attacking him ( this is me trying to be delicate with my wording as well). But after seeing all of this, it good to know that I’m not being dramatic and everything I’ve thought are valid thoughts. 

I am sitting him down to have this conversation with him today. I’ve also spoken to my sister and she has said I can stay with her whilst I figure out what to do. So I might have the conversation today and just stay away for a little while. 

Wish me luck.

ANSWER: This insistence on 50/50 makes me think he's the kind of person who does what he perceives as his half, and then tells you "figure it out" if you struggle with your part.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (F21) was sent a sex tape that my bf (M21) and his ex made

throwaway account for obvious reasons. going to get straight to the point, but if you guys want more context, i will be happy to provide.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half now. I’ve always had a little retroactive jealousy and it didn’t help that my bf constantly would talk about his ex at the beginning of our relationship, that obviously created internal issues with myself such as; feeling as if i have “competition”, insecurities and just constant comparing. i never said anything tho (i know, that’s where i messed up). he is very honest and if i want to know something, he has no problem telling me. past or present it doesn’t matter. he’s always been reassuring, just all around very good to me and i couldn’t be more grateful.

now bring us to a few days ago, when my friend sent me a sex tape of my bf and his ex. obviously upon viewing it, my heart stopped and anxiety just started flowing through my body. of course no one wants to see that but i think how ive been handling it since then is not ok and thats why im coming here for help.

i told my boyfriend and he was very mad that “my friend” would even send me a video like that. he apologized that i even had to see the video and he said he was embarrassed. now here’s my issue, im not mad at him because he didn’t do anything wrong, he didn’t cheat on me. this is clearly something from his past and i should be able to accept that it was from before and not now. i should be able to accept that he’s had a past, because everyone has. but i think what’s really getting to me is the fact that i had to see his past right in front of my eyes. i’m traumatized and even tho none of this is his fault i still feel a certain way about it. i don’t know exactly what it is or why im feeling this way. but as soon as i saw it, it’s like a flip in me switched. i no longer wanted to be affectionate with him, i don’t want to be touched sexually by him. and i definitely don’t want to continue making tapes of our own anymore. i can’t even look him in the eyes without thinking about it. i guess im just repulsed by it all now and disgusted?

please someone help me because it’s taking over. every moment i get to myself, i just cry because i feel like i have no one to go to about this that would understand. every little thing that happens during my day just reminds me of it and i can’t get it out of my head. it’s just constantly playing over and over and over. i’m just so mad at myself that im letting something like this affect me so much. i hate this so much. please if anybody has any advice whatsoever, i would appreciate it.

TLDR: got sent a sex tape between my bf and his ex, looking for advice on how to get over it.

ANSWER: Your boyfriend has every right to go to the police that that has been distributed. Your friend isn't your friend they are an arsehole

================================================================================

QUESTION: My GF ‘36F’ is freaking out over me selling one of my ‘32M’ cars?

I’ve been together with my girlfriend for four years and we’ve had a lot of issues throughout the time but nothing compared to this past year. I lost a lot of money in my business in January through a closed account and a partner stealing a lot of money (almost all my money) and my gf does not work. Since January it’s been really tough. We had to move out of our home and have been moving every month to new places while building up finances. It put a lot of stress on our relationship but tbh it actually showed me what I really wanted, valued, and how my gf actually was as a partner through a wave of hard times. 

I’ve had two cars since the beginning of the year and they are both worth $40k+ each. I brought up selling one of them earlier this year and she freaked out which I didn’t expect. She said it was her car too and that she found it to be a last resort and basically gave an ultimatum and threat to if I sold the car. I ended up missing an amazing investment opportunity then due to not selling the car and have the capital free and I’m gutted every week I did not do it as I would have had huge returns in the months following. It would have changed everything, literally.

Fast forward we are in November now and with holidays around the corner along with another investment opportunity, I’m planning to sell one or both of the cars as our financial situation is not better but I need free capital to work and use to build on. It would help greatly.

I brought it up again and currently have three offers on both of the cars and the same issue is coming up. We’re barely able to pay bills and I’m in a constant state of stress every week because of it. I just feel stuck and have free capital available. I brought this up to her and she freaked out. She actually went and messaged two of the interested buyers and sent them semi aggressive notes saying not to buy the cars. She’s saying now that the only stability she has had throughout the years is the car and that’s her excuse now which is insane. She either said I have to break up with her and sell the cars or keep them and figure out a way to make money and to “manifest” it and stop complaining. 

I just feel like I’m done with her and this mentality. It’s insane and doesn’t make any sense to me. We’ve been together so long and we’ve had many issues but due to the amount of stress that could have been avoided months ago, and the same situation arising now, I just feel done with her and just see this as a red flag in the future. I won’t go into details but would love some advice on where to go here as I’m feeling stuck.

I appreciate you all! Thank you!

Tl;dr

ANSWER: Massive red flag on her end. She does not work, and is now preventing you from liquidating your assets. 

Take her on her offer. Break up. Sell one of the cars. Climb back up financially.

================================================================================

QUESTION: [27M] My wife [28F] cheated two years ago, and I still can’t stop looking for the cracks

She cheated about two years ago. She drove to another state to meet up with a guy. They didn’t have sex, but they did other things.

She was also in a really unstable place mentally. Her meds were all over the place and I understand that. I’ve been there myself, I’ve made mistakes too.

My question is: after they draw that line in the sand, when do you stop looking for it? In every interaction, there’s this trace of contempt, barely there, like 0.001%. But I can feel it. She irritates me more than she used to, and I hate that.

I think I still love her. That’s what’s kept us together. (That and a friend who convinced her that dumping me for the guy would be a bad idea.) She says she loves me too, and I… mostly believe her.

I’m not interested in anyone else. I’m not looking for an out. But I feel like I’m being mentally tortured by all the reminders. We’ve done marriage therapy before… maybe we should try again? But I’m not sure it’ll change anything.

How do you stop searching for the damage once it’s been done?

ANSWER: I’m sorry but there’s absolutely no chance that your wife drove to another state to do other things but not have sex. She definitely had sex with him.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I f/18 just gave my boyfriend m/19 an ultimatum. How do I hold myself to it?

So me and my boyfriend have been together for about a year now, we’re very close with each other’s families. He’s an amazing guy and I really do love him and that’s what’s making this so difficult. 

In our relationship sometimes, he gets angry and will say things like “fuck you” and just be super rude. It’s like when he’s mad he forgets I’m his girlfriend and treats me like a stranger and it honestly has started to scare me. (I know he would never hit me, but I always get scared when people raise their voice). There was one time I tried to comfort him by grabbing his arm, and he ripped me off of him. After that happened, he went to his car and was crying. He says he doesn’t know why he’s like that and he hates it and he wants to change. 

So, the 2nd most recent argument we had I told him after that I want him to work on the anger because I feel as if I can’t talk to him about issues. I offered podcasts, books, therapy, but he claims he doesn’t have time for it so he can’t. And I just told him to find something that works. 

The most recent argument however was our worst one yet. I drove up to his campus and went to his dorm to surprise him and set up decorations, two of his friends were with me. We had original plans to meet at a coffee shop but it was a 5 minute walk to his dorm so I assumed it would be okay. As soon as he texted me that he was out, I told him to come to his dorm. Then he started to blow up on me over text. “Why are you like this” “fuck you” “okay I’m just going to your car”. I was super upset at this point and both of his friends saw this, and were in utter shock (one of them saw his texts) 

Once he made it to the dorm and realized his friends were there and everything was decorated, he didn’t say thank you, he talked to his friends about his day then gave me a side hug. 

So, I asked his friends to leave for a minute and we had one of the worst arguments we’ve ever had. It pretty much ended with me saying “if you snap at me like this again I don’t think I can be with you”. 

It felt terrible, my entire trip up there felt ruined. I don’t want to break up with him. But it’s coming to a point where he’s texting me this stuff while I’m with my friends. And I’ve started to get migraines from the amount of stress I’m under. I’m just scared that when the time comes, I won’t have the strength to end it. 

So, how do I keep the strength to end it? I know that when it happens again he’s going to do it and then apologize and say he doesn’t want to lose me and everything. I’m scared I’m not going to be able to break up with him.

ANSWER: Bite the bullet and do it, or just decide that you'll content yourself with a shitty relationship.

We can't give you strength beyond telling you that this shit isn't tolerable or acceptable. If that isn't enough, then turn to your friends and family for encouragement. 

Wanting better for yourself means making the choices that get you better things.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (F27) boyfriend (M35) is controlling and insecure, but is begging I wait while he gets therapy - I don’t know if I should ?

For context, I work from home, rarely go out, and I don’t chat with anyone online, I’m a ‘what you see is what you get’ type of lady. I’ve never cheated, emotionally or physically. 

However, my boyfriend has been cheated on in past relationships. And since he hasn’t done the work to heal, he is very insecure. When he perceives something as a threat, he feels the need to control the situation, so he becomes harsh, moody and stonewalls me (silent treatment).

The most recent problem - there is a guy in our friendship group who once had a crush on me many years ago. He has since moved on and has a girlfriend. The other day this guy confirmed in our group chat that he will be attending a gig with us - so I responded with a Party Hat emoji. Two hours later I am picked up by my partner as we were heading for a weekend getaway. He was totally silent the whole journey, apart from when he did a sarcastic laugh and asked if I am a retard, because I responded with a Party Hat emoji to that guy. 

He is constantly picking apart my behaviour and twisting it into whatever narrative his brain has created. 

“You asked a guy in the smoking area for a lighter ? EW - why did you feel the need to ask a MAN?! He will see that as an invitation! I honestly thought better of you - I put you on a high pedestal, but now I know I was wrong”

A few months ago me, my partner and his friend went into town. I didn’t want his friend to feel like a third-wheel so I made sure to ask a few questions and make him feel comfortable. The next day I had the silent treatment for apparently giving his friend ‘too much’ attention. 

I got stonewalled recently for playing a ball game in the pool during a STEN party (combined Hen / Stag) because I described we were excited and were grabbing each other to try and get the ball.

I feel like he is constantly watching how I talk, what I say, how I act, with whom and when. I no longer get excited for going out because it’s now a ritual I’ll be stonewalled about something the next day. 

He also likes to tell me how gross my history is, even though my history is pretty normal for my age. 

He has shouted at me a few times in front of my friends if I don’t adhere to his expectations, which has been embarrassing. 

These are a just a few examples - but the accusations are constant.  

My family and friends don’t like him and said I should leave him. 

This weekend I told him I think we should end the relationship because I am emotionally burnt out, I just can’t cope with the constant accusations and insults. I totally understand that people need reassurance sometimes, and I’m happy to do that, but the way he communicates is upsetting. 

He is now apologising for his behaviour, recognises his error, and says he will get therapy. He is asking me to please wait while he focuses on healing. But I just don’t think I have it in me. 

Has anyone here ever stook it out with a controlling partner who actually ended up improving ? My position is that I should leave.

ANSWER: Don’t wait. There’s no promise he “gets better” and on top of that, he could be better for a week and then revert. You don’t have to wait for anyone, it’s not your responsibility

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (F48) Husband (42M) and I Have Totally Different Lives Now

My husband travels a lot for work. Like, two to three weeks of the month he is out of state. I am a stay at home mom
with a severely autistic son (Level 3, significant outside support need. Think Arnie Grape and Rain Man as opposed
to Abed and Sheldon).

It is causing a lot of friction in my marriage. When he's home, he is completely involved and we share almost all the
responsibilities. I have no complaints when my husband is actually here. It's when he's gone and when he comes
home I'm struggling with.

Caring for our son alone for week stretches at a time, for half the month, is incredibly stressful. I feel isolated,
exhausted, and emotionally battered. We don't have a ton of money, and I decided I'd rather not have to worry about
housekeeping than hire qualified child care to ease things, so someone cleans the house once a week, and that's
our expendable income spent. It seemed wrong to hire a nanny so I can clean the house uninterrupted; morally I feel
it's better to be available to my son and hire out the house cleaning.

I'm also in school part time online working toward my Master's so I can get a career down the road.

My husband's job is very fulfilling to him. He loves what he does (camera operator for pro sports), and his employers
pay the costs for him to see and do a lot of really interesting things - visit the Grand Canyon, ride four wheelers on
the beach, eat at nice restaurants, stay in nice hotels. I'll get texts like ‘Keanu Reeves is in our production truck right
now!’. Stuff like that.

I don't do anything really. I'm so strapped to my son. My friends are all parents to special needs kids so none of us
have time for a social life. I have limited places I can take my son because of his behaviors. So I'm almost always
just at home.

Here's the main problem: when my husband comes home, happy and full of experiences, he wants to spend time
with me watching movies or playing video games, hanging out. I appreciate that he's happy to see me and missed
me, but all I want to do is hand my son over and sleep, or have the luxury of going to the bathroom with the door
closed, or have a good cry (can't cry in front of my son, he utterly flips out). In short, I want my sense of self back.
And I can tell it disappoints my husband that I am basically zero fun, with zero energy, and just wanting to isolate and
recharge.

It's been almost five years since this started and, frankly, I'm a ghost of who I used to be. I understand that he needs
to make money for us to survive. I understand the situation is what it is. He didn't choose to travel for work, the travel
gigs just pay the most and gig work is precarious and he needs to take every job he can or crewers will think he's
unreliable and take him off their hire lists. And I am very aware how fortunate he is to do a job he loves, with
coworkers he enjoys being around.
But I'm so unhappy. And when he's gone I go into survival mode, making sure I can take good care of my son, get
my schoolwork done and keep my grades up, and handle all my responsibilities. When my husband comes home I
can't get out of that mode instantly or easily. So he comes home to a very sad, very tired wife who was cleaning poop
off the walls while he was eating surf-n-turf at Ruth's Chris. And while I know he wishes things were easier for me, he
has no real idea what my life is like. The longest he's ever cared for our son alone was one week two years ago
when I went on a cruise with my adult daughter. We'd saved for a long time so I could do that. But that's it. Out of
eight years of having our son.

I don't know what to do. I feel like we live almost opposite lives and there's this huge chasm between us. He'll call me
to tell me he's going hiking in the mountains, and I'll call him to tell him our son bit his own hand so hard at school
they had to massage his jaws to get him to let go.
Is there any hope of us connecting as a couple again? I don't know how to do it.

Info Edit - My son has medical orders for every service under the sun. Unfortunately, there's a severe shortage of professionals here. He's only getting a third of his hours with a BHT (para, wraparound) because he has to share with another kid. No home and community hours either, no one to fill them. 

Y'all's advice is sound and awesome. I'll be having a talk with my husband, and I'll be going to a hotel next week on my own to unwind.

ANSWER: You sound like you’re burning out. 

I think you need to tell your husband, but also can you look into respite care for a bit? You very much sound like you need a break. A week off. Probably with your husband to reconnect as well

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (31F) want to divorce my husband (33m) due to my ongoing infertility

My husband and I met in college, we’ve been together over ten years now, married three years, own a house etc. Over the last three years we’ve been going through infertility, entirely female factor (endometriosis). 

We did IVF and I actually got pregnant this round but it looks like I’m miscarrying. I’m devastated and feel even worse as he looked so happy when he saw that positive test, just for it to look like it’s going to get ripped away so soon. He is the best guy I ever met, I feel like I took the best man I ever met and then destroyed his life. He should be a dad, he would be a great one! 

Every time I bring this up he says it’s okay, he doesn’t blame me, we can adopt etc. He’s so young, he could easily go have a family with someone else.  I myself fantasize about having an affair or something not because I don’t love my husband (I do) but the thought of a relationship where I don’t have to spend every minute feeling sad and like shit about myself is so appealing. The guilt is destroying me all the time, part of me wants to divorce him so he can be free and I don’t have to feel so responsible for ruining his life anymore. Advice for a situation like this?

TLDR: I want to divorce my husband so he can be free of me and my ongoing infertility.

ANSWER: Please reach out for mental health support. You're going through some extremely tough stuff and it's understandable that your thoughts and feelings are a mess right now. 

Please believe me when I tell you that you NEED someone who csn guide you through this from the outside. It will be the greatest gift you ever give yourself AND your marriage.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (23F) think my husband (26M) is having memory problems and I am concerned for him

hi all, my husband and I just got married 2 weeks ago and are having an amazing marriage so far. we are both pretty hard headed people, but work through any and all problems we have very well, and are both fairly emotionally mature, so arguments and scuffles always get resolved within a day, if not within an hour or so. however, there has been one main issue that i’ve had that has been brought up many times, but can’t really be “fixed” by normal means. 

his memory is very poor, and i don’t mean that he forgets birthdays or anniversary’s, he would never do that. I mean more like he will say something one day and the not remember saying it the next day. or he will claim to have said something that he didn’t. on som occasions, he will swear up and down that we had a conversation about something that either never happened or sis not happen the way he is claiming. in more extreme scenarios like the one i just experienced, he will say something, and then immediately forget or claim he didn’t say it the same breath during a conversation. 

for example of what just happened, we were having a chill conversation about a friend of ours and he said “i think some of it is maybe for shock value or attention” to which i said “really? you think it’s shock value”. he gave me a weird look and said “i never said anything about shock value”. This was followed by several seconds of silence as I tried to process what just happened or wait for some sort of response, but he stood by the fact that he never said that and was convinced I was making it up. 

now i don’t want this to come off like I am always right or I have the best memory, I really don’t, i make mistakes and forget things or remember things wrong all the time, but at this point with him it is becoming genuinely concerning that there could be an underlying problem 

for reference; he doesn’t drink, he used to smoke weed but doesn’t anymore bc of work (this has happened for several years regardless of weed use), and he doesn’t not use any other drugs. he does have severe depression and a history of mental illness, but nothing relating directly to memory capacity. we are both very open and talkative about our mental health and he does not typically mention anything like brain fog or anything that would clue me in to this issue. 

this problem has been the root and cause of several arguments and scuffles, both due to him not remembering things, putting words in my mouth, and also due to his frustration when I call him out on it. I genuinely do not believe that it is in any way manipulative or on purpose, I truly think he is not aware of when it happens and really believes in his memory. any ideas on how to help him/ better facilitate conversations around this topic?? thanks in advance.

ANSWER: Probably needs to see a doctor. My coworker used to do that before they found out he’s got rheumatoid arthritis. Once he got on the right medication, these things stopped happening as often.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I politely tell my partner (M30) that the way he eats makes me (F33) want to drop dead?

My partner (M30) and I (F33) have been together for about a year now. One of the things he thinks is really important is open communication. His last partner never told him when she was upset about something and just broke it off with him out of no where, so he really wants to open dialogues when there is some sort of issue.

The problem is that I'm the only one who ever opens these dialogues. I feel like I'm always asking him to stop doing things or to do things a certain way. I'm worried that I'm becoming overbearing in this sense, which I really don't want to be. I don't want to always be asking him to change his behaviors when he might be letting things I do that bother him slide under the rug.

This brings us to the way he eats. God he never chews with his mouth closed and he's always smacking his lips. I can't stand it. I'm autistic and have a bit of Misophonia, and can not stand hearing people chew. Its not just irritating I have a visceral reaction to it. It becomes the only thing I can think about when I hear it and it makes my skin crawl. However, I'm aware this is a bit dramatic, and it feels like such a petty gripe to ask him to be more mindful when he eats. Not to mention I don't want to bring it up while he's doing it because i get so strung out I don't want to come off like an irritated bitch.

This came to a head last night when we were having a party with some friends. He was sitting next to me snacking for hours, and I could hear every bite he took. Suddenly I could hear EVERYONE eating and I got so overwhelmed and strung out that I had to just stand up and leave the room, which freaked everyone out a bit because the thought I was sick.

I really want to avoid this happening again but I really don't know how to or if I should bring this up.

ANSWER: Is he Asian? This is really common in Asia. I hate it too and I’m exactly the same as you. I’ve dated guys who do this. In fact I could have written this 😂 I’ll stay for the comments 

But yeah, you have my support. My sister is also autistic, I’m not but I’m very sensitive to anything eating related and gag very easily when I think something is gross 😂😂😂😂😂 Your EXACT situation has happened to me too, except in my case I genuinely could actually throw up from it. 

I really support you so much, I feel like you are my kindred spirit. Never thought I’d see someone post about this on Reddit.

QUESTION: I (19m) got a haircut from my friend (19f) while being in a relationship with my gf (19f).

I’m wondering how badly I crossed the line here as my girlfriend became very upset upon me telling her that I got a cut from my female friend. I tried to stress to her that it is simply because it was a free haircut (I’m broke and don’t wanna go to the salon), along with the fact that my friend is actually a good barber as she cuts her own hair. I know what this can look like but I genuinely just needed a haircut and it was free. I also have previously asked my gf to cut my hair to which she has said she doesn’t know how to, which I interpreted as a no. Have I cheated? Is this something people consider as cheating?

ANSWER: there is no world where this is cheating. How is this different from going to a female barber? If you went to a female barber regularly and became friends do you then have to change barbers or else it's cheating? This is ridiculous.

Him: Ugh I am sorry. Get off the computer and go have a great weekend.

Her: I still have to finish the Trinity Hills quote that l had to put on hold to do Hunters Revision. Lol. It's fine though. It's only 3:45 here. I'll be done in time to go party with the kids. (❤️)

Him: What’s your costume?

Her: Pam Beesly (😆)

Him: I love it! Is your husband Jim Halpert?

Her: Lol. No. He never dresses up.
Honestly I wanted to be 3 hole punch version of Jim myself, but i feel like only the cool people would get it.

Him: I would have (❤️)
Or Facebook 

Her: Like I said.. cool people.
Dude. Hunters getting himself in a tizzy over this. I'm about to lose my cool. us stuck

Him: What a dick. Can I text you?

Her: Even if I had gotten this done at noon, Marco is still out and unavailable to review it. This is the unfortunate nature of quote creation sometimes. He really doesn't get how this works. Ugh.
I'm done bitching about him. It's late there. YOU should get off the computer and go enjoy your Halloween. Lol

Check you FB. Happy Halloween 😉


she friend requested him and that’s where the conversation ended for now. The hearts I put in a heart reactions from the other person. I just want to hear other opinions. I obviously have my own but I’m trying to gather myself and figure out how to handle this. This is a guy she met a couple months ago on a work trip to Seattle. She has never mentioned him to me before but I obviously know of him

UPDATE

I confronted her about it and she confessed to it. Says that she has a problem with needing to seek validation. Also claims it wasn’t going to go anywhere and she already felt guilty before I said anything..

ANSWER: Friendly and possibly slightly flirty work talk. 

What were you looking for? 

Her colleague is encouraging her to enjoy the weekend with her family, knows she has a husband and kids. I saw nothing untoward.

================================================================================

QUESTION: He [41M] asked me [37F] to marry him and he hates my reaction

I really need some outside perspective because my head and heart are a mess right now.

We’ve been on vacation for a few weeks, and today he planned a very romantic dinner. In the middle of it, he surprised me with a ring. Instead of saying an immediate yes, the only thing that came out of my mouth was: “Baby, are you sure? We’ve been having problems.”

He got extremely upset. He took the ring back, said I embarrassed him, and told me it was over. He said my reaction wasn’t “good enough” and then started listing ways I break his heart. He also made a jab about how I’d probably write about this because I’ve been writing stories and working on a book, clearly meant to hurt.

For context: we’ve been together 7 years and living together most of that time. I’ve always wanted to marry him, even though he’s always said he “doesn’t believe” in marriage. Our early years were rocky, with multiple breakups. Since June I’ve been in therapy because I realized I’m a pushover and struggle in our fights, which can be messy and awful (alcohol involved). I’ve been trying to reflect on our relationship and even asked him to try therapy with me, but he’s refused.

He has been trying to improve, and I do appreciate that. But I also wanted us to talk about our issues before giving an immediate yes to marriage. Ever since I started therapy, we’ve been fighting weekly about me being “less loving” and him feeling like I’ve changed.

Now I’m heartbroken. I feel horrible for hurting him, but at the same time… if we can’t even talk about something as big as marriage without everything blowing up, are we actually ready for it? Are we even right for each other anymore?

I don’t know if this is salvageable. It feels like the way things unfolded has broken something between us.

What would you do in my situation? How do I even start processing this or deciding what’s next?


TL;DR: My boyfriend of 7 years proposed during a romantic dinner. I hesitated because of ongoing relationship issues, and he got very upset, took the ring back, said I embarrassed him, and started saying hurtful things. Our relationship has had rocky patterns, including messy alcohol-related fights, and I’ve been in therapy trying to work on myself. Now I’m devastated and unsure whether this relationship is healthy or if marriage is even the right path. Looking for advice.

ANSWER: In my honest opinion, he just provided immediate evidence for the source of your hesitancy in that very moment with his reaction. Seems like a case of a bruised ego and a failed attempt at putting a bandaid on your problems. If you cannot communicate about your relationship in a healthy way, or at least make a joint effort to bridge those gaps in communication, what else do you have? his refusal for therapy, and prior disbelief in marriage speaks volumes here though, it sounds like he thought the proposal would shut you up tbh.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend (26M) wants to surprise me (23F) with a vacation but I found the booking details and its way beyond our means and I don't know what to do?

My bf and I have been together for about 8 months and things are mostly really good. He's super thoughtful and always trying to do nice things for me which I love about him.  
Last week he was acting all mysterious saying he had a surprise planned for my birthday next month. I wasn't trying to snoop or anything but when I was using his laptop I saw email confirmations for this resort in Cancun. Like a really fancy place with those overwater bungalows that cost an arm and a leg.  
Here's the thing... my bf works retail and I know he has some money aside from a win on Stɑke to move out of his parents place eventually. We've talked about our finances before and he mentioned wanting to keep that money saved for when he gets his own apartment. This trip would probably cost him close to $4000 with flights and everything.  
I'm torn because its so sweet that he wants to do something special for me but I don't want him to blow through all his money just for a vacation. I also feel weird that I know about it now when its supposed to be a surprise. Part of me wants to just let him surprise me and act shocked but another part of me thinks I should say something so he doesn't make a huge financial mistake.  
I really don't want to hurt his feelings or make him think I don't appreciate the gesture because I totally do. But I'd honestly be just as happy with something more low key that doesn't stress his budget.

ANSWER: “I wasn’t trying to snoop but I just happened to be on his laptop and I just happened to open his email inbox and I just happened to open his email confirmations and then I just happened to read through them”

I always find these sorts of explanations so funny.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How can I (23F) explain to my boyfriend (28M) of 5 years that I don’t want to take from my personal savings to help him with his bills like he wants me to?

Hi all! this is my first time posting to reddit but basically as the title says, my boyfriend wants me to take from my personal savings to help him with his bills but I honestly don’t want to and I feel really guilty about it.

I’m going to try to not make this crazy long but there’s a lot to unpack so please feel free to ask questions if anything is too vague or doesn’t make sense. My thoughts are currently all over the place so sorry if there’s any mistakes.

For a bit of background, we live in an apartment which he owns but the monthly fees are really high. The apartment is under his name as he had it before we got together, I have never had my own place and legally still live with my parents. I currently don’t have a job as I quit a little over a month ago due to personal reasons, and will be going back to school so I am not looking for employment as my parents have funds for my education. My bf has a full time job and has been there for almost 10 years now, however the owner recently changed which he’s pretty unhappy about as the new owner isn’t a good guy. Up until this point my bf was fairly happy with his job as he use to be able to nap most of the days and didn’t really do a lot of work, but with the owner change he hasn’t been able to nap or relax at all. I understand it’s stressful but he now wants to quit and unfortunately told that to the new owner even though everyone told him he shouldn’t. Now the new owner is looking to replace him so my bf is panicking that he won’t have any income and wants me to take from my personal savings to cover his expenses.

I love my boyfriend alot and want to spend my life with him but I’m really uncomfortable taking from my savings as I don’t think I should have to, however he thinks I should since in the end it’ll be “our” money anyways and it’s better than him losing the apartment. The thing that really irritates me is he’s super into crypto and has a bunch of money put into it but he refuses to take anything out. When I was working I would regularly send him money to help out with bills and other expenses, but now that I don’t have a steady income I can’t send him as much as I use to and am running low on funds. Luckily as I still partially live with my parents I don’t have many expenses (no bills at least) so I’ve been able to afford helping him. I’m just really stuck with what to do because I want to help him more but I don’t have the means to, and I’m starting to get pretty upset that he keeps pushing me to either get a job or take from my savings. He also could ask his family for money which I know is embarrassing but I feel like he’s putting this all on me without exhausting other options. My parents also are really against me giving him money, especially from my savings, and they refuse to help him as they’ve already had to dig him out of multiple holes previously. I love this man a lot but it’s starting to get hard not to be upset with him, I know he’s struggling a lot but I’m already stressed enough with going back to school after completely changing my career path, and I’m just so worried that this will break us. I’m not always the best girlfriend, I’m not great at cleaning up after he cooks and I’m not good at talking about my feelings but I just hate how upset he gets at me while I still support him constantly even though pretty much all he does besides go to work is sleep or complain or talk about crypto. Sorry I’m starting to ramble but any advice would truly be a blessing I’m just so stuck right now and I don’t want to lose him or myself to this. 

TLDR: My boyfriend wants me to take from my personal savings to help with his bills without exhausting his other options and I’m worried if I don’t our relationship will be over 


UPDATE / EDIT:
I’ve never updated a post so hopefully this is right!
Just wanted to update and add some additional information as a lot of people seem to misunderstand that I do nothing for my boyfriend. I do pay for things and up until recently I had a job that I ended up having to leave due to my mental health and toxic environment. I do clean up after my boyfriend cooks, I also pay for groceries and pay for anything else we need or want, I just have never paid rent as he owns the apartment and never wanted me to pay / wouldn’t let me pay rent. I am also the one with a license and drive us everywhere as he refuses to get his license. Up until recently I haven’t been able to pay for as much as I no longer have an income and have made the decision to go back to school so I will not be able to work while studying. Anyways! I ended up speaking to him today and told him I wasn’t comfortable taking from my savings and asked if he could ask his own family or take from his investments. He still won’t ask his family which I understand however regarding his investments he said he’ll take from them in the new year if they still don’t go up but currently he still wants to hold on to them as they’re currently down and he doesn’t want to take them at a loss. If he does end up losing his job (which we should know next week) then I’ll just cover him for a couple months until he can hopefully go on employment insurance (we’re in Canada). I’m still not very comfortable taking from my savings but he explained that it’s really his only option and it’ll be better for the both of us in the long run, so I’m praying everything works out (mainly praying he doesn’t lose his job so I won’t have to take from my savings at all). I appreciate all of the feedback, even though some of it was definitely not helpful, and I am aware I’m a bit immature, I mean I’m 23 and have never lived by myself or have had to fend for myself so I’m still learning a lot as I go. I know a lot of you won’t be happy about the update and I’m not really but he’s always been there for me and I’m not ready to give up jus yet, we’ve had to go through a lot and if I need to financially support him at his lowest then that’s what I have to do. Maybe it’s the wrong choice and could be due to my immaturity but I know he would help me if our roles were reversed (even if that sounds hard to believe). Thanks again everyone for your opinion, both to those who supported me and were against me, gave me a lot to think about :)

ANSWER: Move back in with your parents and focus on your education. 

This guy is stressed that he can’t nap his way through his job and wants your money.

You don’t want to clean after he cooks or pay rent. 

Your parents have helped financially “multiple” times.

It’s okay that you’re not ready to be independent, but stop playing house and pretending like you are.

================================================================================

QUESTION: A few weeks ago myself [22M] and gf[21F] went out with a few friends and she spent the night ignoring me and touching/dancing with another guy and then asked him for his Instagram.

Went out to the club as a group and my gf spent the night pretty much ignoring me, holding on this guy's arm and dancing with him.

On the way home we all stopped to get food and she asked for his Instagram. All of these events took place right in front of me. I've told her years ago I'm not cool with her touching other guys like that. I just found the whole experience to be pretty humiliating.

I didn't say anything about it until a few days after it happened and she just said she's sorry. I brought it up a bit after that and she told me to fuck off and said I'm dragging it. The final time I brought it up she only said she was drunk and didn't think about what she was doing. That time I said I don't think I can continue like this. She basically asked me to take some time to think about it but since has been acting like everything is fine when now it hurts to sleep in the same bed as her. I've barely been sleeping at the moment because it's been on my mind so often. 

I know reddit likes to always jump to the conclusion of splitting up but I just wanna give a bit more context as to why that's so hard for me. Firstly we've been together for 6 years. Secondly we live together and still have 10 months left on our lease, my family lives far away and I've been playing in a band here that I really enjoy and I don't wanna leave them. 

I feel like she's tried to make me think I'm thinking about it too much.  I don't wanna leave everyone else behind and move home. As I said I've tried to say we can just be friends but she won't have it. I'm afraid to bring it up again. 

Is there any chance to fix this? Or are we just incompatible?


Thanks guys

ANSWER: I mean I love when my partner treats me like shit and then blows me off when I try to talk about it.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (34M) girlfriend’s (34F) coworker keeps pushing for one on one time. I’m unsure how to feel about how she’s responding. Advice?

Girlfriend and I have been together 2+ years. New coworker has been messaging her a lot outside of work. It quickly shifted into asking her to spend time with him one-on-one (movies, dinner). She She semi-ignores those.

Then it moved to several messages focused on me. Asking if I lived there, my schedule and what I do. She ignores those. I know this bc she openly showed me.  We briefly talked about the portions I was not comfortable with and moved on, no argument. 

What she doesn’t know is I found the conversation doubling the following week, her initiating half. She didn’t encourage anything romantic, but much less work related (good morning, photo of her Halloween costume and now responding to his invites as ‘ll let you know’).

I’m not looking to control who she talks to, but I feel uneasy about how he believes he can probe for availability for eternity?

My question:
How would you handle a situation where a partner continues talking with someone who repeatedly asks for 1 on 1? How do you balance trust with wanting to feel respected?

ANSWER: Ok, I’ve been married 20 years and neither of us would entertain this with a person of the opposite sex. She should have shut down anything personal politely,and not responded to these requests. She’s encouraging him and you know it and it will turn into an emotional affair. The fact that she’s letting this happen is not a good sign for your relationship.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I(20M) found out my wife(20F) cheated with a close friend for 8 months. I don’t even feel anything anymore. What’s my next move?

We’re both 20. We’ve known each other for 10 years, friends first, then dating, and married for the last 2. I really believed our history meant something solid. But for the last 8 months, she’s been having an affair with a guy I once considered a close friend. Someone who acted like he respected our relationship while sneaking around with her.

There wasn’t some dramatic discovery, a different friend pulled me aside and told me the truth. And when everything clicked into place, it was like my mind just… shut down. All the suspicion and confusion I had before turned into this weird emptiness.

We don’t live together anymore. But now that the dust has settled, there’s no screaming, no crying… just nothing. The days we spent together during those months don’t even feel real anymore. It’s like I was still trying to build a future while she quietly walked out of it.

I know divorce is probably the next step, but even that feels like it’s happening to someone else. I don’t know what to say to her, I don’t know what to say to him, and I honestly don’t know what to feel. The numbness is almost scarier than anger would be.

TL;DR: Both 20. Married 2 years, together for 10. She cheated for 8 months with a close friend. We’re no longer living together. I feel numb and don’t know how to move forward.

Update:

Three days after I found out about the affair, I filed for divorce. Since then, I’ve stayed completely no-contact with her. She’s tried reaching out a few times, but I haven’t responded. There’s really nothing left to say.

Things got a little messy a bit after that. I was out with some friends when her new guy (the one she cheated with) pulled up on me. She was in the car with him. He tried to start a fight, then switched up and said, “we good bro, I don’t want drama.” That same night, she texted me to apologize for how that went down and said she didn’t want it to happen. I didn’t reply to her either.

A few days later, I ran into a few mutual friends from that group. They didn’t even know what had really gone down, so when they heard my side, they all took my side and have been helping me gather evidence for the divorce. Apparently, her new guy has been telling her that I was trying to take everything from her in the divorce, which wasn’t true, but now that I know she’s been trying to do that to me, everyone’s telling me maybe I should just take what’s mine and walk away.

Recently, I found out some more news about them. Apparently, he just bought a house, and there’s a chance she’s living with him now and helping take care of his kid. I can’t confirm it 100%, but that’s what I’ve been told by people who know them.

It’s strange. I’ve accepted that it’s over, and I’ve been staying focused on my own peace, but part of me still worries. I grew up around this guy, and I know how he can be. He’s always had a short fuse and tends to get aggressive when he’s in the wrong or doesn’t get his way. I’m not saying that to start drama, I just genuinely hope she’s safe.

I’m not planning on contacting her or involving myself in any of it. I’m keeping my distance, letting my lawyer handle everything, and focusing on moving forward. It’s been a lot, but honestly, staying calm and silent has helped me more than anything. I’m taking it one day at a time and just trying to rebuild.

TL;DR: Filed for divorce three days after finding out she cheated with a close friend. Been no-contact ever since. Her new guy tried starting a fight, she apologized, and now they might be living together. I’m staying focused on myself and moving on, just hoping she stays safe.

ANSWER: I know this feels like a cliche, but you need to be talking to someone about it.  A therapist ideally.  A religious leader or a trusted older confidant are also possibilities.  But you need to talk to someone to help pull yourself out of the numbness.

Once you do, you'll realize that her behavior was all about who she is and nothing about you.  You'll realize you're young with a whole life ahead of you to love and build a future with someone who deserves you.  And you'll also come to understand that, as awful as this experience is, overcoming it will help you grow in ways you don't yet see.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (38M) feel resentful about the creeping expectation that I should support my mother (F55) and her partner (F55) as they get older.

My mother had me at 16. We grew up very poor because a) she was/is an alcoholic and wouldn't have been able to hold down a job and b) she's very lazy, and didn't want a job anyway. We lived in a council home, on welfare. Both of them chose to not work a day in their lives and live on welfare to this day. Recently, she's made vague comments about how my sister has been sending her money "and she doesn't even want it back because she knows we're getting older" - which they are, and the sort of lifestyle they've lived means they are more like 65 than 55. The comments come across to me as her basically saying "and why don't you help us?" I've been working every day of my life since I left school at 16. She had me paying rent with her from my very first paycheck, before I moved out at 17. They've never helped me, financially or otherwise really, since then. We get on OK. The idea that, because they're getting older, and they need more money than they currently get from the government, that somehow it's on me to support them seems unfair.

ANSWER: Children are not a retirement plan.

Your mother can expect as much as she likes but you owe her nothing, it might be an idea to start limiting contact with her.

================================================================================

QUESTION: (25F) My boyfriend (30M) dismissed my sickness twice. I am deeply hurt and is struggling with the idea of breaking up with him.

Hey everyone, using a throwaway for privacy. I'm (25F) an Asian immigrant, and my boyfriend "BF" (30M) is a local Caucasian. We've been together for 5 years, and I'm really struggling with a recurring issue that has me questioning our entire relationship.

I need some outside perspective because I don't know what to do.

Incident 1: About a month ago

I woke up in the middle of the night with sudden, excruciating lower abdominal pain. I'm not exaggerating when I say it was worse than my appendicitis pain. I was literally screaming and crying. I had read about Corpus luteum ruptures and was terrified.

I begged BF to take me to the ER (I was too sick to drive my own car.). He refused. Not just once, but every time I asked. His reasoning was that the ER "wouldn't do anything" and I'd "just be in pain in a different location." He said I should just wait it out and would feel better soon.

I cried in agony for over 3 hours. Eventually, he started saying, "Fine, I could take you," but then would immediately follow it with, "but you need to know it's a waste of time and they won't help you." It felt like he was trying to talk me out of my own pain. The pain finally calmed down after about 5 hours total, and I passed out from exhaustion. I was fine the next day, so I tried to just forget it ever happened.

Incident 2: One week ago

I got hit with a bad case of food poisoning (vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache). I couldn't keep even water down. I had a midterm the next day and was worried that I wouldn't make it. I asked to go to the ER again.

BF refused again. Same script: "You'll waste 6 hours there for no reason."

This time, I called an Uber and went by myself. At the ER, they gave me some hydration thing and told me to go home and wait for the doctor to call. The whole thing took less than 10 mins. So I Ubered home and took it easy for the rest of the day.

Now?

I told my mom about both incidents. She is a very traditional Asian and believes in seeking medical help. She is now deeply displeased with him and thinks I should break up. She said, "If something is wrong, it's always better to be at the hospital."

I'm stuck because I can't get over this. This isn't a one-off; it's a pattern that has happened a few times throughout our relationship whenever I'm sick or hurt. His default is to dismiss my need for medical care.

For context, he is not a recluse; he goes out with his friends to bars/pubs at least once a week, so it's not like he's avoiding going out altogether.

I feel a massive breach of trust. When I was at my most vulnerable and in genuine distress, he wasn't my partner; he was an obstacle. My mom's disapproval is adding pressure, but my own hurt is the real issue.

I'm at a lost here and don't know what to do.

TL;DR: My boyfriend has refused to take me to the ER during two medical incidents (excruciating pain and severe food poisoning), arguing it's a waste of time. I went alone for the second one. My mom wants me to break up with him, and I'm struggling with the broken trust.

ANSWER: This is a terrible boyfriend. But you should know that going to urgent care is another option over the emergency room and you won’t have to wait 6 hours and it’s much more affordable.

yesterday, i (22F) caught my boyfriend (22M) sexting another man while also sending him my explicit photos/videos. the two of them were “trading” content of their girlfriends while telling each other how bad they wanted to fuck one another as well as each other’s girlfriends….. i’m sharing this story because i’ve simply never heard of such a concept before and am hoping somebody could shed some light as to what the fuck just happened to me.

part of me is heartbroken, of course, but another part of me just feels so violated and disgusted. normally i’m a crier when it comes to breakups but after this one i just feel so fucking angry and betrayed. what if my pictures get leaked somewhere? what if this wasn’t the only guy he’s sent my pictures to? i just don’t know what to do and could really use some insight/perhaps some words of encouragement.

thanks in advance.

ANSWER: Find out if where you live, there are laws against the distribution of intimate photos without consent. If there are, you can report him to the police, and in some cases they can help you trace and delete the photos (but if they will do that, heavily depends on what part of the world you live)

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (F29) kind of want to break up with boyfriend (M29).  I’m emotionally drained. I like peace, he doesn’t.

So, my boyfriend and I have been together for 11 months. He’s not from the US and has only been here for 6 years. Everything was going good. 

Then, it started. Two months in and he started talking about us getting married and having kids. He was previously married and when they divorced, he said that he was mad at women for years until he met me. He said I was the second woman he’s ever been sexually involved with. Of course, his wife was the first.

He said he’s never really been anywhere. He stays inside all the time. He said he and his ex wife rarely went anywhere. He always talks about how he has no friends.

He said he’s NEVER celebrated any holidays which is fine. I was the first person he celebrated Valentine’s Day with. However, he didn’t do anything for my birthday, but asked me what I was doing for his birthday which is weird. He mentioned he’s never had anyone do anything for him for it.

He always on social media and follows a lot of women and when I mentioned it, he said it’s because they followed him first. 

The worse thing is that he gets mad at me for every little thing. 

He said that his ex-wife used to go through his phone and always accuse him of cheating. Every time someone calls me, he thinks it’s another man. When he calls me, he tells me it’s too silent in the background and that I must be telling someone to be quiet.

He hates when I express my feelings. He often tells me to shut up or be quiet. Then when I am quiet he says that I’m acting weird. 

I try to take him different places and thought we were having fun, but he recently revealed that he’s never liked anywhere we’ve went. But, he never gives any input on what to do or where to go and he blames it on not being from here.

When we watch movies, he makes me choose. He snaps me up when I ask him to choose the movie and when I choose he complains, but tells me to keep the movie on. It doesn’t make sense.

One time I wasn’t feeling well when he called and he laughed at me after I told him, I asked what was funny and he was like, “You’re always sick. What am I supposed to do? Cry?” And I was like, “I’m gonna lay down” and before I could say anything else he hung up in my face. I’m not always sick, btw. I have migraines sometimes.

He’s very disrespectful and rude, yet accuses me to be that. I try to my best to be kind, considerate and I like to keep the peace. I often let things slide, so I don’t understand what’s rude about that.

He’s cussed me out multiple times for no reason. The first time was because I made a joke about him going to his favorite store. He got mad because he thought I meant that he was going there to see one of the cashiers who happens to be his type. 

He usually pays for everything, he gets mad when I offer to pay for things. We went to a restaurant, when it was time to leave I was about to pay and he pulled out the money to pay then when we got back to his place, he shouted at me and said I never want to pay for anything and that blew my mind.

He gets mad when I tell him I already ate before I came over. He gets mad when I tell him “thank you” for things. He snatches trash from me when I try to throw it away. It’s all weird. 

I’m not sure why I’m so tolerant with him. 

Things will be going smooth for weeks then he’ll start an argument about something so random. He said he and his ex-wife argued all the time. Maybe that’s what he’s used to.

Now, he is very affectionate and compliments me often, he does buy me things that he thinks I’ll like and I appreciate that because in my last relationship the guy wasn’t like that. 

When I buy him things, he pays me back even though I tell him he doesn’t have to. He said his ex-wife used to pay for things for him and then throw it in his face so I guess he thinks I’ll do him the same way. I’m not like that. I do things from my heart. 

He goes along with most things I say and he never puts in any input, but it can get annoying at times considering that he starts complaining about my choices.

I’ve taught him a lot of things. I’ve taught him about simple things like using dish detergent, using bleach, or show him simple foods like chips, he said he’s only ate plain chips until he met me. I got him to try different restaurants and stores. I wonder where did he ever go with his ex-wife. He didn’t seem to know about much or about many places before we met. I taught him how we do certain things here in the US (reminder: he’s already been here for SIX years.) He’s very intelligent, though. Knows a lot about history. He’s stuck on how they do things back where he’s from.

He said I’m not doing him any favors which I’m not trying to and him saying that is hurtful, because I’ve done nothing but simply try to enjoy life with him and help him when he needs it.

During one of our arguments he told me that he didn’t love me anymore and honestly I haven’t let it go. He said he only said it because he was angry at the moment. 

He took a picture of me and I told him to delete it because I didn’t like it and he got super upset and told me to delete every picture I ever had of us.

He ultimately wants to go back to his home country, wants us to get married and have children. He said that he was only staying here for me. He wanted to leave after his divorce, but someone convinced him to stay.

He said the fact that I stay with him despite the arguments is because I love him.

Sometimes I don’t hear from him for days and he’ll reveal to me that he was mad at me, but doesn’t have a reason why when I ask.

I can’t talk to him because he will just say I’m talking too much.

I love him, but I’m emotionally exhausted. I don’t want to end things, but I don’t feel like the relationship is going anywhere. I’m not sure why I’m holding on.

ANSWER: You already know the answer you are just finding it hard to accept. He’s controlling and emotionally abusive. The good moments don’t cancel out the disrespect and constant criticism. You can’t fix someone who refuses to see they’re the problem. If you are this drained , it’s time to walk away for your own peace

================================================================================

QUESTION: Me (37f) seeing my partner (40m) falling out of love with me. Why is the pain almost unbearable?

I’m a 37 year old woman who has been with my partner 40 for 3 years.
We dated as teenagers, lost our virginity to each other at 16/18 and I moved away for uni a year later. We lost touch, and didn’t see each other for 17 years apart from a brief glimpse of each other at a mutuals friends wedding.
6 years ago he messaged me asking me out on a date but I declined, as my father was terminally ill. Fast forward 3 years, and he messaged me asking for a date which I agreed to. 
From day one, we clicked like we did when we were teenagers, spend all our time together, went on several holidays and fell madly in love.
He told me early on that he loves me and that he will never let me slip through his fingers again. He told me that I was on his mind for all those years we were apart etc. he would ring text me every day and make plans. Always wanted to be with me.
Now the change.
For the past few months, we no longer go on dates. He no longer makes foward plans with me, he no longer invites me to weddings with him, we do nothing together as a couple anymore. My anxiety regarding this has been through the roof, and I may have went overboard with ringing and texting etc as our connection and closeness was being lost due to his decline in communication.
I always feel like a last priority and that his fiends/darts/football come first and that I’m “slotted in”. This was not the case the first 2.6 years.
I became upset and quite angry about this as I had mentioned it several times.
I told him (truthfully) that I get chatted up a lot, and that sometimes I feel I would be better talking to a man that is willing to give me the attention and affection I’m craving. 
When I pushed him on the subject, he says that he doesn’t know if he wants to commit, and when I said ok. He said he’s afraid of loosing me as I’m a good woman. 
I have cried so much watching the man who adored me, but me so low on his pecking order that I might as well be an aquintence he met at a bus stop. 
He came over briefly last night and told me that he still loves me etc.
I love this man, and I don’t want to start over again at my age. However, I deserve to be priority in my partners life and to feel reassured and respected.
I’m planning on going no contact for the next couple of weeks to give each other space and for him to figure out what it is he wants.
Any advise is much needed 
Thanks 

UPDATE 
Well well.
He rang me this morning and decided to come “clean”. He has told me that he has been “hiding” an addiction and he couldn’t keep up the lie any longer.
He has told me that for the past year, he has been taking cocaine on a weekly basis. 
He told me that he thought he could have the best of both worlds, but that trying to hide it became too much. He has told me that he has been sneaking around taking cocaine behind my back. His brother who he works with has messaged me several times in the past couple of months, looking for him as he didn’t show for work, this was usually on a Friday after playing darts on a Thursday night (which is whey he would take cocaine). It’s all finally clicking into place. 
He was loosing weight, which he was putting down to IBS but it was a drug addiction. 
The constant “colds”, the “watching football on a Saturday” (when it was to shield me from a coke comedown).
He said that for the first year and a half of us, he didn’t take it but he has been hiding it now for the past 18 months and the lie was getting too big to mask. 
He has told me that he’s sorry, that he does love me and to give him a chance to sort himself out. 
He said the days he was pulling away from me, he was coming out of binges.
The not inviting me to weddings/events etc is so that he could “binge” without me knowing. 
I think in the back of my mind, I knew there was something “bigger” going on, because the change in how he was to me was rapid. No rowing prior, full of affection, plans etc. 

I am BEYOND angry, and I am in complete shock

ANSWER: I say this out of love and as someone who recently went through similar. Let him go 😮‍💨. Men won't break up with us but will allow us to linger feeling unfulfilled. He doesn't want to lose you but he's not trying to keep you either. Relationships take effort. Work is required and that's on both sides. I carried too many relationships and left feeling the same, drained! Don't be like me. The man who will love you the way you desire to be loved is out there and he will find you. 🫂

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend (38M) and I (28F) have lived together for two years, but now his “coach” says our relationship is unhealthy. I’m heartbroken and don’t know what to do

Hi everyone! I really need some perspective on what’s happening in my relationship, because I’m emotionally exhausted and not sure what to think anymore. (English is not my first language so I took advantage of AI to help me edit this post .. I hope everything’s clear).

I (28F) had a tough few years. I lost my mom, went through a painful divorce, and even admitted myself to a psych ward in September 2022. When I came out, in October 2022, I met M (then 35M). I was 25. We met casually while going out, and we connected right away. He told me upfront that he didn’t want kids from previous relationships, and I respected that. I wasn’t looking to pressure anyone, I was just trying to rebuild my life. For context, I have 2 kids who are now almost 9M and 6.5F. 


I’ve been in therapy since before we met. At first it was weekly, now it’s monthly. I’ve grown a lot and truly feel I’ve matured and healed from so much.

In March 2023, M asked me and my kids to move in with him. I was surprised, because of what he said about not wanting kids, but our relationship felt strong and loving. He supported me emotionally and financially: he never charged me rent, and we agreed that I’d take care of the house and groceries, cook, clean, and keep everything organized. It worked well.

He was also amazing with my kids. I never asked or expected him to take on that role, but he bonded with them naturally. They see him as a second father, and it made me so happy to see that connection,especially because I’ve always made sure never to put that pressure on him.

Things started to change about eight months ago, when he began seeing someone he calls a “mental coach.” I was actually the one who encouraged him to go to therapy, because he has deep unresolved issues with his parents and childhood trauma. But I don’t think this person is a licensed therapist.. it’s more like a self-help coach.. and ever since he started going, he’s been repeating ideas that sound straight out of their sessions.

According to this coach, our living situation is “unhealthy.” She’s told M that having me and my kids in his home is preventing him from feeling free, and that I’m somehow “putting a strain” on him. And without even meeting me, this coach has apparently said I have “unresolved parts” of myself to work on, that I “play the victim,” and other things that really hurt to hear.. especially because my own therapist completely disagrees with those assessments.

I’m usually the first one to doubt myself. I always question if maybe I’m the one who’s wrong. But this time I genuinely feel like I’ve done everything I could..
I’ve been there for M through his emotional struggles, his fits of rage, his ups and downs. I’ve supported him and stayed patient.

And now, it’s like I’m living in limbo. One day he says I should look for my own place, that it’s best if we live separately. I tell him okay, I’ll start searching. Then he takes it back, says he loves me, doesn’t want me to go, wants to make things work. It’s this constant back and forth, and it’s wearing me down.

I love him, and I’m grateful for everything we’ve shared, but I can’t live with this stress anymore.. I’m constantly anxious that he’ll come home and tell me I should move out again. I don’t think I deserve this instability, but at the same time, moving would mean uprooting my kids again, and I just don’t want that chaos for them.

IPart of me wants to leave just to prove a point and take back some peace of mind, but another part of me still hopes he’ll realize how unfair this is and stop letting this coach influence him so much.
M keeps saying it would be a temporary solution, bc he loves me and we would still be together in a separate house. 
But I know that I would feel rejected, and it’s not how I personally view relationships..

Has anyone been through something like this?

 EDIT 

Thank you for the many answers and opinions! 
I’m gonna paste a comment I made and add a bit more infos 

To address some of your questions : I admitted myself in the psych ward bc I was in a full blown burnout.. i was there for 2weeks. They later diagnosed me with autism! Since the diagnosis I’ve been doing really great. My kids love M. I talk to them about their feeling, their wellbeing, etc. I’m really open to their opinion about what they like/dislike, even about my parenting style. He rarely is with my kids when I’m not around, but the kids always ask him if they can stay with him at his shop, or if he can bring them to school. He improved his behaviour immensely, he used to have fits of rage when discussing with me (he was really jealous) but as I said, he worked on it bc he realised it was a very bad behaviour on his part.
He wants things to work out, he wants to be with me and he’s been very open about all his problems / thoughts. I find his brutal honesty refreshing, even if it’s sometimes hard to hear the cold truth. At least I know what kind of person he is, and he’s always matched his words with facts.

ANSWER: You need to protect your kids first. If he is being wishy washy on your living situation, you need to secure separate accommodations for you and your kids. Something he can’t just decide “actually I want you to move out now”. He is almost 40 listening to some (most likely) unlicensed “life coach” who is creating issues in your relationship by planting ideas in his head that you, someone this life coach has never met, are bringing him down in life. I would also do some digging on who this life coach is and what her credentials are. If my partner was destroying our relationship over advice given by some rando with a Google.com degree, I’d contemplate if I want to continue the relationship.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I ‘29M’ Got a message from my ‘26F’ girlfriends coworker

I 29M received a text from my girlfriend’s 26F coworker tonight about some things my girlfriend has been saying which is making quite a few people at work uncomfortable. “She’s made comments about multiple customers being very attractive, one of them making “sex eyes” at her and she said she wasn’t mad about it… and she told me that she had went to that new bar downtown with some girls and danced with a guy all night that she also found very attractive. It didn’t feel right keeping all this to myself and would want to know if I was in your position..”
I’m pretty taken aback as it has to be pretty aggressive to make your coworkers this uncomfortable as the coworker and I don’t talk. 
This is at a coffee shop. This is pretty new behavior and hasn’t happened to this extent before. 

We’ve been together for three years now, live together, discussing future. To be honest things have gotten pretty rough recently. The last three months have been hard, I’ve been pretty career focused and perhaps wasn’t giving as much attention to the relationship as I should. She brought this up to me and seemed to have one foot out. Things have gotten better, I’ve stepped up to all of the areas she said she needed, but it’s felt like a losing battle. Things have been better but it still feels pretty empty. I’ve had quite the gut feeling that something else has been going on for the past few months. I’ve never been able to confirm but this just kinda reinforces that feeling. This just kinda feels like a final blow where if this is what other people are seeing, what else is going on. I haven’t discussed this with her, I don’t want to bring in the message and cause drama in their workplace and mostly just want to keep the coworker anonymous. I feel like this relationship is a feeling of comfort for her at this point. 

What are your alls thoughts? I do love her but damn am I not into wasting my time with someone with one foot out and behaving like this. 

Update #1: to give everyone a bit more insight. This was her female coworker that messaged me, she’s recently engaged, we’ve never communicated outside of casual talk when I’m getting a coffee or at their work Christmas party. I’m friends with her fiancé and we went to the same school so there’s no ill intentions. This particular bar was a country swing bar that had just opened, it opened on a night that I was out of the country for work and it wasn’t a secret that she went. I’d have full expectation that she would go and dance casually, that’s not a boundary. What is a boundary is telling your coworker unprompted that you danced with this guy all night that you found attractive. We’ve been in what I thought was a better spot, working on the things that she needed from the relationship and this just comes like a gut punch. I don’t have the expectation we would go back to normal overnight, but I do have the expectation there would be effort and a bare respect while we are working on it or what’s the point. 

It’s a bummer, but this is coming after a long list of things that I was willing to accept in our relationship from hobby differences to moral differences. But now that this has happened it’s kinda blowing all of that out of the water. I’m willing to grow and work on a relationship with someone. I’m not willing to be in a one sided relationship because I have things to work on and this is the result. 

Update #2: I broke things off tonight. The more I festered on this the clearer everything became. I don’t believe she physically cheated on me, I truly don’t believe she has that in her capacity (yes I understand how ignorant that can sound). But the more I considered the things I was sacrificing in our relationship, not feeling understood, not having a partner that could be accountable for how her behavior and attitude affect others, ignorant hypocrisy and a lot of other things that I’ve been able to optimistically put aside for the last three years that after trust disappearing are no longer acceptable. 

She was pretty much in shock. She wasn’t really able to accept I was serious about ending the relationship. I never once accused her of doing anything but I did tell her someone in her circle told me the above and that confirms a long standing gut feeling I’ve had. She became pretty defensive that she never did anything. I believe that to a point. The conversation started to get pretty emotional and I made an exit. She asked if there was any chance to work on this and if my mind was 100% set. I said right now there is no way we can work on this and I can’t be 100% set because I care about her a lot, but the fact that I have a lack of trust in our relationship and I see a lot of these other things very clear now overcomes the uncertain parts. I had to leave pretty quick after that. 

Not easy. Tomorrow won’t be any easier.

ANSWER: You're right to cover for the co-worker. They seem to have tried to do you a favor.

If all you had to go on was the co-worker's comments, I'd suggest you not act hastily. But, as you say, the comments just reinforce what you already suspected. Sounds like your gf is in a situationship with you, and it's time for you to take a hike.

"Losing battle"? Cut your losses.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (25F) boyfriend (28M) says I “need to be more fluid” for Halloween

Posting for some clarity because I’m struggling with this. My (25F) boyfriend (28M) and I are hosting a Halloween party this year. It’s our first time hosting a themed party like this, but I’ve always loved the idea of having one. I’ve watched countless DIY guides and videos about food, drinks, games, etc. I made a spider web out of paper streamers that covers our entire living room and took nearly 10 hours total to hang from the ceiling with lights to make a dance floor. And so much more. Point is, I’ve spent anywhere from 20-30 hours so far into this thing setting up, crafting, and buying supplies by myself.

Today my boyfriend asked if the guys could play a trading card game at the party. I immediately said I would be deeply offended if I set up a dance floor, beer pong, and decorations just for them to play a card game that we could play any other time. This is not a short card game - it can take a few hours depending on their decks and amount of players. On top of that, the music is going to be blasting so it’s not like they could hear each other anyway and it would take up the beer pong table. I offered that the guys could come earlier to play or wait until most people have left the party.

When I essentially shot it down completely, he said I “need to be more fluid” and I put my foot down and said if they did that I would likely get an Uber to a club and not come back until after. That I would feel very hurt and unappreciated. He backtracked, but things still feel a bit tense. On my end, feeling like that shouldn’t have even been on the table to begin with. But it seems small so I might be overreacting. How would you approach this situation?

TLDR; My (25F) boyfriend (28M) wants to play a trading card game with the guys at the Halloween party. Is it an overreaction to say I would feel hurt and unappreciated?

ANSWER: > I made a spider web out of paper streamers that covers our entire living room and took nearly 10 hours total to hang from the ceiling

A long LONG time ago (1980s) I did this for a Halloween Party. I ended up having to repaint because someone sprayed beer from a keg in the wrong direction and the dye from the streamers left stains all over the ceiling.

My point is just to keep the keg FAR from the streamers.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (30F) husband (30M) suddenly feels unsuccessful in his career. This has happened after I got a higher paying job and he says it's not related.

Hi all, I hope to get some advice from you guys on how to deal with a very sticky situation. Both me (30F) and my husband (34M) work in the same field but different "branches" of the same trade. He is 4 years my senior and has more work experience than me. He always supported me in my career to do better and helped me with interviews, dealing with stress etc since our field is very male dominated. He has always made more money than me and held a more senior title than me. I have to say maybe I have been lucky but in the summer I got an offer to join a startup with a Senior title and a 70% pay increase and an amazing health insurance. This of course was incredibly good for us since we have financial goals and all of that. He was so proud of me and I really felt it. But now the sticky part is that I make roughly 40K more than him and I have the same title as him although he is 4 years my senior. Since this has happened he entered quite a depressive spiral, feeling like he has nothing to show for himself after 4 years at the same company with minimal professional growth. I tried to help him since he started being so unhappy with the job and redid his cv and cover letter and applied to over 50 jobs for him, but we never heard anything back other than vague rejections or ghosting. I have to say that for me it was easier to stand out because my ex company made me do a ton of public speaking and writing. His company is all internal so of course he's not allowed to publish things through them. And this made him feel even worse and he basically has non-stop being extremely unhappy with himself and his life and I fear I have made it worse with the job application stuff. I truly feel like he is so smart and can do better if he wants to and maybe I was naive and didn't do the right thing. This pains me immensely because I want the best for him but now I feel like I don't know how else to proceed. At the same time he is telling me it has nothing to do with me getting this better job and it feels like I can't even go there to say it because he gets extremely upset. How would you approach this situation and can it really be unrelated to me getting a better job? I don't even know if I should feel angry... I feel like he always had the highest income and I was always so proud of him.

ANSWER: To validate. I had this situation happen to me a couple years ago. My wife has always made more than me but not by much. It was always kind of a funny, friendly competition. I’d get a raise and make $500/y more than her and then a month later she’d beat me by a few. But then a couple years ago, she landed a big corporate job that she never even imagined she could get. 
After the initial shock and happiness, I definitely went through a few months of feeling like “dang, I suck at careering” and “why haven’t I been as successful as I should have been?” Additionally, I’m in the tech field so a lot of my colleagues and friends at other companies but in similar positions were killing it. It definitely makes you question what you’re not doing right. 

For me, after my pity party, I decided that I needed to 1. Ask for a raise and 2. Try to figure out how to make myself invaluable at the company and get better at my job. I’m still not making anywhere near as much as my wife but I’ve had to learn that my career looks different than hers which looks different than my friends which looks different than anyone else’s. It doesn’t matter because my kids can eat and play and my wife loves what she does. 
That’s basically the conclusion I came to but it did take time.

================================================================================

QUESTION: (F21) My boyfriend (M22) has a hygiene issue and it’s giving me the ick.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year, we’re long distance so we’ve only met physically twice. During those visits we’ve spent at least 3-4 days together and each of those times I’ve noticed he has an issue with his hygiene. He’s very messy, doesn’t worry about how he dresses or even taking care of his body, the couple times we’ve showered together he said that he can’t ’scrub his body’ because it damages his skin which is really weird to me and he literally wouldn’t pay attention to how he showers that he’d leave the bathroom with soap all over his body. 

I understand that we are all different and I was willing to let it go until I smelled him stinking like sweat the past couple times we were together, he doesn’t have a signature scent or anything that makes him smell good. He just gets out of the bed, without brushing his teeth or showering and goes about his day looking unkempt. Each time we have sex I smell him and his private area, it’s so nasty and what makes it more annoying is that the scent will stick with me for daysss, my private area and my pee will smell like it too and for this reason I found an excuse telling him I don’t want to have sex for a couple months. His mum once called him aside once and mentioned his bad smell to him, he didn’t think I heard the conversation but I did. He honestly isn’t the easiest person to speak to, he’s way too emotional for me and I can’t deal with whatever will come after if I try speaking to him about it. I love him so much but he’s GIVING ME THE ICK!!

So my question here specifically is: how do I go about this situation? Because at this point, I’m worried about my own health too. He’s too careless

ANSWER: If you can’t talk with him about these issues then I’d honestly rethink the relationship. The fact that you two are having sex gives more than enough “right” to bring these things up

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (37M) just found out my partner (37F) was hiding 80k of debt

I just found out my partner's student loan debt is essentially double what I expected. 

I have been supporting my partner to go school over the last several years. I have cosigned loans and just paid for semesters. They have failed classes and have had to retake things, but that's … not relevant.  I understand we're very fortunate to be in the position we are. 

I knew some of the loans had really bad interest rates and I asked her over 9 months ago to look into refinancing…which never happened. In the interim we had a kid, so a lot has been going on.

I got a bug up my butt and finally set aside the time to go through the process and see what rate we could get. I expected there to be $70K ish worth of debt … that actual amount is $150K. 

There are so many financial decisions in the last 7 years (since we got engaged) that I would have made differently if I knew there was this much debt. She comes from a poor family with little to no financial literacy. And so I… believe her when she said she just wasn't paying attention and didn't realize it was that much. But fuck …

Now we have a kid and I would have to pay for a Nanny to watch said kid so she could continue school. And perhaps the thing that eats me is I don't see the effort/struggle to ensure she graduates and can get a job after graduation.  Like she's failed classes while also putting in 100's of hours in Diablo IV. 

So I just … don't know how to feel. I want to support her dreams, she's a wonderful person. But she does not heed my advice of how damn competitive it is out there and like she could be doing drills or making a side projects outside of class to help differentiate herself. The idea of go to college and get a job is just trashed in tech.  You got a degree? Well they got a degree, had internships, a personal git repo, and open source commits. … it's so competitive. 

I've essentially paid for her to live and go to school for years … and I wanted all of that. I accepted that was what we were doing as a unit.

This unexpected debt just has really upset me, cause Idk … Ive given so much and maybe I feel like I'm being taken advantage of? Or my contribution is not being respected? How am I to tell the love of my life … I can't keep supporting you at the level I have been cause … well you accidentally hid all this debt that now I'm on the hook for. 

I'm just not sure how to feel

EDIT1: We are married. I did not cosign on this debt I didn't know about. But we're married, ... it's sorta our burden not just hers

EDIT2: People are confused about timeline and situation. We've been together over a decade, engaged 2018, married 22. She did school part time while working full time from 2018 - 2021. Then she went school full time, until prepping for kid and kid this year. I've only cosigned ~50K of debt. The rest is from previous schooling attempts, and I just didn't know about it. 

EDIT3: We have talked and are going to go to counseling, and her schooling won't continue (probably).

ANSWER: Why on earth were you paying for their schooling while they were failing classes and both of y'all not keeping up with how much student loan debt they had!? On top of that, you added a kid to this mess. 

You both need lessons in financial literacy.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I 20M found pics in gfs phone 19F.  What now?

I 20M and my gf 19F have been dating for 7 months now and the relationship is going great. We rarely fight or argue and when we do we can usually resolve the issues. I recently was looking through her photo gallery on her phone looking for a specific photo and I had the sudden urge to look into her hidden folder. I’m usually not a nosey person and I wanted to respect her privacy but something just compelled me to look. I saw a pictures of her and another guy and it really made me sick to my stomach. While the pictures are from before we meet what upset me was that they’re still on her phone and that she keeps them hidden. What now?

ANSWER: I know when I broke up with my ex and there was a chance we might get together I hid all the photos of us. Giving her a bit of slack, she might have hid them an forgotten about them. Additionally she may have had collected/taken many pictures after that picture she forgot it existed.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I 30F like showering with partners but my boyfriend 35M is hesitant. This isn’t the first time.

I’m 30F have been in a few relationships (3 months - 3 years) with 25M-35M and when I’ve asked if they want to have a shower with me they’ve always been hesitant or don’t want to. Personally I think it’s so romantic showering with a spouse, you’re both chatting away, soaping up, cleaning each other/yourself, sometimes it’s sexual sometimes it’s not.

I’d just like to know what is with the hesitation?!

The men I’ve been with haven’t had body issues and have generally been very comfortable with being naked. 

Edit: Showers usually happen after sexy time, a form of aftercare if you will. Some of you are so cute sharing your intimacy stories and I appreciate them so much. Also some of y’all are super judgmental. I’m not forcing anyone to do anything they don’t want to, just curious about why.

ANSWER: I mean, it’s not unreasonable to just want shower time as private time. Just because you’re into showering as a couple, that doesn’t mean they have to be. Maybe they see that as decompression time and not social time.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My 29M girlfriend 26F was planning to go on holiday with a guy she had slept with and I don’t know what to do?

A few months back I posted a situation I was going through on here. My girlfriend had a holiday booked with a friend prior to us getting together, then she mentioned casually that a couple of guys had booked to go along as well. I posted back then feeling very uncomfortable about it. The overwhelming advice was if she goes it’s a dealbreaker and I told her if she doesn’t cancel her trip it’s over between us. 

She did cancel the trip and that was the end of it. Her main defence was that the guys were “friends of her friend” and “just tagging along”. 

It has since come to light that she had slept with that guy, just before / around when we started dating. Nothing has happened since then (they live in different countries) I can say for certain she hasn’t cheated on me but this now throws it all into doubt; going out partying and drinking on holiday would have been totally different etc. 

It’s making me look at the beginning of our relationship and her intentions on holiday in a totally different light and I don’t know how to build back from this or whether it is time to end things. The past couple of months for us have been genuinely stress free and the best we have had and I feel like we had turned over a new leaf and so past mistakes feel a bit irrelevant now

ANSWER: She was planning to cheat on you with that guy.  That’s why she was lying and trying to hide who it was she was going with. You know this.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My girlfriend (F42) thinks I (M33) don’t respect her because I forget how she wants things done (ADHD brain here)

Hey guys,

So I have been dating my girlfriend for a while, and we keep running into the same issue, she feels disrespected because I forget how she likes things done around the house. She’s super particular about stuff. Like, dirty dishes have to go on the right side of the sink, the cutlery needs to be lined up, the dishwasher has to be loaded a certain way. I don’t mind doing things her way, I honestly want to but my ADHD brain just forgets sometimes.

She says I’m hiding behind my ADHD and using it as an excuse. The thing that hurt most was when she said: “If you cheated on me,like my ex did, at least I could blame you. Then you’d clearly be the problem. But this makes me feel like I’m the problem for wanting things done a certain way.”

That one really hit me. For context, I grew up super laid back, no routines, just kind of doing things when they need doing. She’s the total opposite: everything has a specific place, a system, a way to do it. We tried splitting chores so each of us could do things our own way, but she doesn’t want that. She wants everything done her way and done now. And when I forget something, it turns into “you don’t care” or “you don’t respect me.” The thing is, I want to change. I get that structure helps her feel calm and respected. But it’s exhausting when she thinks I don’t care, when really I just have a brain like a sieve and genuinely forget.

I love her and I want to make it work, but I’m honestly getting tired of feeling like I’m failing tests I didn’t know I was taking. My question is: how do you build a healthy middle ground in a relationship where one person needs strict routines and the other struggles with ADHD forgetfulness? What strategies have actually worked for you or your partner to make things easier on both sides?

ANSWER: Honestly, and you might not want to hear this, you may just not be compatible.

My ex has ADHD and a godawful memory for stuff like that, and is also messy/a bit of a hoarder. I am like your girlfriend. I have autism and it makes me feel like my skin is itching if everything isn’t in the right place and properly clean.

When it came time to us being about to move in, we broke up under the realisation that living together was going to make at least one of us utterly miserable. I deserve to have a clean house and they deserved to not feel constant pressure.

We are still best friends nearly 8 years later. We work so much better as friends where neither of our homes are the others’ responsibility.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Silent treatment from my mom (60F) after I (28F) asked her not to post 32 photos of my daughter on FB. Advice?

My daughter turned 1 this weekend so we flew to my in-law's house to celebrate. They just retired and moved into a beachside house, so it was like a cheap vacation. My mom was meant to meet us there and stay over, but she couldn't make it due to her own poor decisions and not having proper IDs to fly

On the actual day of her birthday, my mom posts 32 photos of my daughter to FB. All but 2 were taken by me and texted to her over the past year, so many were meant to be private. Because our social media accounts are not public, I am fine with some photos. I reached out and asked her to reduce it, and delete the photos I felt weren't appropriate. 

She got angry, deleted the post, and sent me paragraphs about how her friends post their own grandkids all the time so she wanted to "celebrate in [her] own way." Because she is going through a nasty divorce, she added that "figuring out how to be a grandma to [my child] will have to wait until [she is] healed."

Both in-laws live several states away and this was our first time traveling with our daughter. In one of her angry paragraphs, my mom admitted that she is jealous that we visited my in-laws instead of her (despite the fact that she was meant to be here also). She is pressuring me to visit her next, but her current behavior makes me question that.

I've been getting the silent treatment from her for 6 days. I've sent 3 messages and I've heard that she has spoken to my sister.

Do you have any advice on how to handle this? In one way, I feel awful that my mom missed out on her only grandkid's first birthday and that she is struggling with a divorce. In another way, she is emotionally immature and self-centered. 

(I am currently not interested in going no-contact, because our relationship is more complicated than what this post depicts.)

TL;DR - My mom threw a temper tantrum and is giving me a 6-day silent treatment because I asked her not to post 32 photos of my daughter on FB, after she couldn't join us for a family trip.

ANSWER: It's only been six days.  Stop messaging her.  She'll get in touch when she's ready.  Eventually she'll get mad at your sister about something and stop talking to her so she'll switch back to talking to you then.  That's how it works in my wife's family.  Someone is always the good daughter, and the other one is on the shit list.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My mom (43f) promised I'd (25f)go on a family trip (Disney) when I was underage (trip was cancelled for reasons and she said next time I'd go and was promised I'd be payed for) and now refuses to let me go on a single family trip unless I pay. Is that right of her to expect?

So, long story short, when I was like 14-16, my family had saved for a trip to Disney. Come to find out our house was built terribly so my mom (43f now) told me we were cancelling the trip. She then said I'd absolutely be allowed to go whenever they go. Skip to 2019 and my family is planning a Disney trip. I'm 19. I bring up my mom's promise to me and she goes,"you have to pay your way if you want to go" which means I couldn't even stay with them room wise and stuff if I did. At that point it feels like they'd be on a family vacation and I'd just be... Tagging along. I've been told I'm acting greedy for being upset with her but I don't think I am. I was promised something and that promise was broken. 

Edit: yes this was years ago and I can pay my way now (not really) it's the principle of the promise and this isn't the first one she's broken. This is just a huge example. She has never supported me since high school. Stop telling me to grow up. I'm just asking if it's okay to be upset in general. Im not upset about the trip, I'm upset about the broken promise.

ANSWER: My mom did something similar - took my youngest sibling to Disneyland with her new BF and his son who was the same age. Swore she’d make it up to us, never did.

But I also knew she wouldn’t, so I didn’t hold my breath and I didn’t wait for it to happen. I also didn’t ask for money or compensation for that broken promise because there was no point.

Does it suck that people like your mom do this? Yeah, a lot. But living by your expectations of how you want others to act or think they should won’t help you at all.

Now you know her word is meaningless, so don’t trust her again.

Sex has become such a chore and I hate “having” to have sex bc I’m not mentally there. I’m tired I’m overworked btwn a full time job and two toddlers. My husband comes home late when all the work is done (that’s his work schedule) and i literally just want to go to bed. We argue all the time about it. It’s gotten to the point where I feel like he’s only nice to me when he wants to have sex so now I low key hate it when he’s nice bc I know what that means. I know this is not fair of me and I don’t know how to rewire my thoughts. For example he texts me I love you at 6pm and in my brain I think damn it I’m tired and I don’t want to have sex. Yikes. Help me.

ANSWER: There’s nothing wrong with your brain. You are noticing a pattern that when he’s nice it leads to sex.

Communicate everything you said here to him and hopefully he can figure out ways to help out more and be nice to you in general, not just when he wants sex.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I feel I should dump my (38f) partner (43m) of 17 years but Im worried about what will happen to him

This is a very long story, I will try to short it the most I can.
I (38f) haave been in a romantic relationship with this person (43M) for 17 years, of those 11 we have been living together at his mom house.
Nobody from my family and friends have ever liked him, but they beared with him for me.
A few months ago, his mom went bananas and kicked me out of the house, called the police on me and kicked me out because "I dont clean enough around the house". Ive been the economic support of this family for all those 11 years he have been living together. Neither my bf or his mom (or his brother untill a few years ago when he finally did find a gf and went away to live with her) work, his mom has a small state pay but its me who buys all groceries for all the family, pays some bills and buys everything its needed, plus my bf being always asking me to buy him videogames (which I also love, but all my money goes for the games he wants).

When his mom kicked me out, I was very very lucky to find that my parents were willing to lent us one of their rent houses (my parents financial support is renting houses) to live. I went to my parent house and he stayed with his mom temporally to plan out the move, take care of his mom a few more months and taking care of our two cats untill its possible to bring them to the new house safely. 

Finally, we were able to move with the cats, he has still not bring all of his videogames (big retro game collector, +10000 games) but the cats are safe. We got a huge fight, because the house my parents lent me is smaller than the one we tought it was going to be. Im fine with it, but he is not, he want to force me to demand my parents for a bigger one.
He has been all the time since I told him it was going to be the smaller one pressuring me to demand to change it, some times violent even. 
A friend of him helped is with the move and told me I should dump him, he is not treating me well and has been doing it for years. Im doubtful because even if I know it will be best for me, Im worried about him and his family. If I do it it is going to destroy them and even if they have not treated me well at all, I still care about them.

I have decided to fump him tomorrow, by sms, when he goes back to his mom to keep packing.
I know its a horrible way to do.it, but Im scared that if I do it by call or in person it could be dangerous to me. 

I... I really dont know what to do. I need reassurance.
I dont even know if this is the best place to ask. But Im quite lost.

Help?

----‐--------------------------------
UPDATE
 
I did it. Last wednesday, he left to his mom's, I took him to the train and faked it until he was gone, and then I sent him a text and blocked him everywhere. He has no keys of the new house and is 700 km away with no economic means of being back, so Im not worried about my safety.

It hurts, I know he is hurting and confused, does not understand why I have dumped him and thinks we're going to fix it, is trying to contact me through all means, and it hurts me to see him like this. I also feel bad, of course, breakups are not easy. But im strong and my most haunting thought is him being as ok as possible. Im fine.
All of our mutual friends are rooting for me. Even his brother has told me Ive done what I should have done long time ago, and is rooting for me too.

I will be fine. I just hope he can heal someday too.

ANSWER: Call a locksmith in advance to get an appointment to have the locks changed so they can do it immediately after you break up with him. And have friends or family present when he comes over to retrieve the rest of his belongings.

QUESTION: Me (38F) have been with my partner (40M) for over 10 years. How do I break it off?

Me (38F) have been with my partner (40M) for over 10 years. We were engaged about 2.5 years ago and I am gave him back the ring when he revealed he felt like I forced him to get engaged. I have no interest in marrying him anymore and I never get any free space. He's always home. He doesn't pay for anything for me and is stingy with money. I have a 16year old child from a previous relationship and he doesn't help with anything there too. He also doesn't do anything around the house. I do all dishes, pay for groceries, take out trash, clean up after pets. He works then comes home and watches TV or games until bed. I used to be so obsessed with this guy but now I'm desperate to be single. I've tried to break it off several times but he is not listening and thinks we just need to work it out. I want him gone. I want to be single again. I actually want him to cheat so he can leave me asap. Help me. This has not been easy or simple to do. Has anyone been through this? How did it turn out? I need help because even though I've told him to leave, he is still here. How do I get him to leave? He lives in my home and he was paying a monthly rent. He's paid up through next year. He wants to make another lump sum payment for rent but I've decided to not accept it and will be telling him in a few weeks that I want him gone next year officially again to see if he listens this time. 

Tldr: lost all feelings in long term relationship and want to be single again. How do I have my partner leave me alone?

ANSWER: He doesn't get to say no when you break up with him. It's not a negotiation, it's you informing you that your relationship is over. He gets to say he disagrees but that doesnt mean the relationship is continuing. 

So, tell him again. The relationship is over and start untangling your lives, whatever that looks like. Show him that it is over now.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My [48M] wife [47F] making me uncomfortable with work friend [50M]

Ok I’m kind of spiraling here and having a hard time getting my thoughts down so please bear with me…
Me [48M] and wife [47F] married for 17 years with 2 teenage daughters. She was a stay at home mom for 13 years, went back to work part time in an office 2 years ago. 

She made lots of friends, but I could tell this one coworker [54M and widowed about 2 years ago] liked her as more than just friends. 

A couple times before group meetups he would text her personally asking if she was gonna go or not and text things like take her time cuz he wasn’t there yet or asking when she was gonna be there  so he would have someone cool to hang out with. 

After some group meetups he would text her saying things like how cool it was to hang out or he loves hanging out with her and wishes they could hang out more.

A couple months ago after his birthday party he texted her something like he knows it is super inappropriate but he had to admit he has a huge crush on her and she should probably delete the message and he didn’t want to break up anyone’s marriage.  My wife responds she is flattered and loves hanging out with him and always feels guilty hanging out with the group but she selfishly loves it so much and please let’s hang out more. 

I told her before this that he was crushing on her and falling in love with her and she was always dismissive like they are just friends. They never hang out alone, it’s always with other coworkers. 

Well last week the group went out and after he texted my wife something like his girlfriend told him out of the blue that if my wife wasn’t married then he and my wife would be together and he responded to his girlfriend yeah probably. So my wife responded to him either “yeah we could probably have fun” or “yeah we would probably have fun” 

I only know about all these texts because when she got home she was acting weird and I went and checked her phone when she went to sleep. Needless to say I was gutted. So then the next day I went to see if there was any new texts and I see that she deleted the text where he says what his girlfriend told him and she deleted her response. She didn’t delete any of the other stuff so I don’t think she suspects I went thorough her phone. 

She has never given me a reason to not trust her but now I can’t help but wonder what other texts she may have deleted. 

I cannot confront her without revealing that I went thorough her phone. 

How do I proceed? What’s my first step?

ANSWER: I mean she gave you a reason to check her phone and you did found an inappropriate conversation between them. I think it is better to confront her now that nothing has happened yet and establish and enforce boundaries. Don't wait until this will progress to something far more worse. Or you can stay silent and keep wondering what is happening between them.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (30f) found out my boyfriends (32m) life is a lie.


I’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years. We don’t live together. 

Recently,  I couldn’t shake the feeling that parts of his stories never lined up. There were inconsistencies about his life before me, about relationships, about why he moved, about who did what to who, timelines that changed depending on the day, details that seemed dramatic but vague.

I bumped into a friend who had a mutual connection to his ex. He has spoken so badly about her. She is the “crazy ex”. 

She told me that almost everything he told me about his life in his home state and their relationship was fabricated. Major events, timelines, reasons for their breakup, things he used to portray himself as the victim, lies.
Now I feel genuinely shaken.

The way he portrayed himself in their breakup was untrue. Significant parts of his life in his home state, events he referenced, timelines he used to build sympathy and credibility, things he said defined him as a person, none of it was real. This wasn’t a difference in perspective or two sides of a story. This was a completely different reality.

He even lied about friendships, his family (I haven’t met them in person yet) and his upbringing. He lied about small irrelevant things too that just don’t make sense. 

I believe her because she also has proof of some of the lies. 

He has always been the victim in every story he’s told me. Never had a long term relationship other than me and this ex. Only short term ones. 

I don’t plan on confronting him about this. I feel quite frightened. I’m not sure who he is. 
I’m worried how to navigate this. 

What do you do when you realise you weren’t in a relationship with a person, but with a made up person? How do you heal the part of you that ignored red flags because you wanted to believe the story more than the inconsistencies?

ANSWER: The person you think you love doesn’t exist. He sounds dangerous. If I was in your position I would leave it’s obvious from the lies he doesn’t have a clear sense of self which is why he has to lie to make himself look and feel better. What happens when you don’t make him feel high or excited anymore?? He will devalue you and throw you away. Save yourself.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (29F) boyfriend (31M) never tells me what he actually wants, and I don't know what to do?

I genuinely need advice on this. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years and hes amazing in so many ways but theres this one thing thats been bothering me more and more lately.

He NEVER tells me what he actually wants. Like ever. If I ask where he wants to eat, its always "whatever you want babe." If I ask what movie he wants to watch, same thing.

At first I thought it was sweet that he was so easygoing but now its honestly frustrating. I feel like Im making every single decision for both of us and I dont even know what HE enjoys anymore. Last week I specifically asked him to pick the restaurant and he literally said "you're better at picking places" and then when we got there he seemed kind of meh about the food but said it was fine when I asked.

I tried talking to him about it last night and he got kind of defensive saying hes just trying to make me happy and that he genuinely doesnt care about most things. But like... everyone cares about something right? I dont want to be in a relationship where Im constantly guessing what my partner likes or just making all the choices.

We're planning a vacation right now and I asked him where he'd like to go since we finally have some money saved up from Stаke for it, and he just said "anywhere you want to go sounds great to me." Even with something this big he wont give me an actual answer.

I love him but I feel like Im dating someone without preferences and its making me feel disconnected from him. Am I being unreasonable here? How do I get him to actually communicate what he wants without making him feel attacked?

ANSWER: I want to say you're not being unreasonable. Being so chill and not having preferences puts the all the responsibility on someone else, and it isn't right. It adds unnecessary stress on your relationship. I think you guys need to find a compromise. Would he be open to couples therapy?

Not to excuse his behavior, but I was your BF when I was married. The reason I couldn't make decisions was because I was raised in a family where I never had the option to choose. Even if it was my choice, I'd defer to my mother, sister, or father as I didn't want to cause conflict. When I did choose, I always chose wrong. I actually had to work on this in therapy because my ex-husband found it exhausting. Now, I take turns making choices. It's safer for me to propose 3 options, and I find that my ex-BF appreciated this approach as do my friends.

================================================================================

QUESTION: The guy (30M) I (22F) have been dating has been lying about his age

I met this guy on a dating app and his profile listed his age as 26. We’ve been dating for around four months now, and things have been going well.

Recently it was his birthday. I found out he wasn’t turning 27 like I thought, he was actually turning 30. I really like him and we have a strong connection, but I also feel very uneasy that he’s been lying the whole time. I’m struggling to figure out how big of a red flag this is. On one hand, I understand why he might have done it, but on the other hand, it makes me question what else he might not be honest about.

Either way it sounds like he wasn’t actually looking for anything long term…. The age difference doesn’t bother me, my circle is made up of people 25-35 anyway and I am the outlier being 22. It’s just the lie.

How do I go about talking to him about this and setting boundaries about lying? I also don’t know if I should stay with him or if this is a big deal…..

ANSWER: There is literally no reason for him to lie about his age as an adult seeking out other adults. I would then consider if he's trying to make himself more palatable to younger women which definitely would raise a few red flags to me.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (25F) "Grandma In-law" (64F) WONT LEAVE US ALONE! Advice?

So to start, I have never had much of a problem with my husbands grandma while we were dating and the first 2 years of our marriage. This was until, we ended up buying a house from my Husbands Uncle and moved in right away as we were expecting our 2nd child and the house we were renting wasn't going to be big enough for our family. This house is shares a long driveway with my husbands Grandma. I have a big feeling this is why my husbands aunt and uncle wanted to move out as fast as they did. Ever since we moved in we have had problems with the Grandma. We have told her NUMEROUS TIMES to please call before showing up to our house (We love our privacy & our kids sometimes are napping when she decides to show up!) I almost always keep the door locked since we live in the country and I'm a sahm who's alone a lot. She will either let herself in if I end up forgetting to lock it after going outside for something or she will pound on the door if its locked and I don't answer it. Then, if I open the door I'm met with "You're trying to lock me out?" And other comments. She has even resorted to peaking in our windows and walking around our house trying to peek inside. She will also show up sometimes at 8PM when I'm getting our kids to bed.  Whenever she visits she ALWAYS points out "flaws" with my house, cleaning, DIY projects and etc. Got mad at me because I painted chairs that I bought a color she didn't like and I also stained our kitchen table (which all turned out amazing btw) and she threw a fit. I have a 25 month old who's into EVERYTHING and a 5 month old, my house isn't always perfect and she thinks it HAS to be. Her house is a mess but whenever she comes over she always picks apart mine. One day she showed up randomly and I simply said "Please excuse the house, it's a little messy" and she said "a little bit???" Very rudely and laughed to herself". She also makes nasty comments like saying "What, are you starving? Mommy didnt feed you did she?" Whenever my daughter points to the cookie jar. She's super rude, bossy, controlling and even two-faced. She constantly gossips about people behind their back to others and I feel like i have to walk on glass around her. she throws these pity parties very often if she doesn't get her way.  She was having my daughter take bites from a sandwich the grandma already bit all over and I said "no we aren't going to do that" and put my daughter on the floor and then his grandma was like "Ah come on she was enjoying the sandwich". Also to top it off, we aren't able to have parties at the uncles giant barn/house anymore so now she wants all the parties to be here at my house AND TELLS PEOPLE that it's going to be here and I have to occasionally be the one to tell people there's no party here and if we do have a party here, no one helps at all. 

My husband and I have TRIED to talk to her so many times. We have tried telling her to call before she arrives, keep her opinions to herself if they're going to be rude, ask us for permission instead of inviting random people over to our house for a party, and the list goes on but it's like she doesn't care. I don't know how else to tell her? I've told her kindly and I've also gotten snappy about it. What would be the best way to deal/talk to someone like this? I don't know what to do or say? Cutting her off is not an option (although sometimes I wish it was.) I don't mean to sound like a negative nancy but I'm at my WITS END and have no idea what else to do????

ANSWER: Here are two phrases for you:

“You’re being rude and I need you to leave”

“Now isn’t a good time, please call next time.”

QUESTION: how do i 22f explain to the people in my life that breaking up with my boyfriend 23m for making jokes about my body is absolutely fair?

i 22f had been dating my boyfriend 23m since uni. we had been exclusively seeing each other for two years but been romantically involved all five years i’ve known him. he is a masters student and i work rn, we went on a trip with his friends last week. so i used to be midsize when we started talking but i have health issues and have gained weight and am very anxious about this. he knows this, and in private he is very sensitive. while at a party, the day of our two year anniversary, his friends made some joke about one of the other girls eating a lot of food and my boyfriend dragged me into it for no reason and said something really out of line that got some awkward laughs and i just felt so humiliated. it felt like i just can’t go back from that idk i felt so awful about my body since this happened and it isn’t even in my control. anyway now he’s kind of acting like a man child and being butthurt about it but everyone in my life including my mother and my closest friends are telling me i’ve made a mistake, that he loves and cares for me and i’ll never find a guy like him but i don’t know.. 


EDIT: i’m sorry for not responding, i realise from the overwhelming response saying i don’t owe anyone anything that this is most definitely a cultural thing.. i came here to vent because honestly at the end of the day what’s going to happen with my life is what my family wants and i don’t have much of a say in it and people on the internet won’t really understand but thank you all for proving to me that i’m not crazy i just live in a crazy world

ANSWER: You don't owe the people on your life an explanation. You felt disrespected and left. The choice was ultimately yours. I'd advise you tell them to shut up and stop asking about him, but in a nicer way lol.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Why won’t my (29F) boyfriend (32M) let me join his D&D campaign?

Me ‘29F’ and my boyfriend ‘32M’ have been together for 4 years. Although it doesn’t really seem to come up a lot I think he has a slight superiority complex to me when it comes to intelligence and culture/arts/history because I did not go to college but I take the time in my own hands to read and learn about these things that interest me on my own time and am no where near stupid or uncultured, but I digress. Anywho, he just started a new d&d campaign with his 5 friends (30s M) and my dad was an avid player back in the day and gifted me some dice and books and such so I got excited and asked if I could join them this time. I’m not a huge gamer by any means but I do enjoy some RPGs and tabletop games and I thought it’d be fun to do together. Now I would kind of understand if ya know, this was his thing and he wanted to keep it as an independent activity  because we both have that as a need in our relationship but no, no no. His reasoning was “Baby I just don’t know if you would really grasp it and I wouldn’t want you to feel like you couldn’t keep up. But you’re welcome to watch!” …. Zero shade to any d&d players but wasn’t this game literally invented for children. I’m trying to decide if I should talk more in depth about what his reasoning is because right now I just feel like he thinks I’m stupid and would rather know if there’s some other reason?  

TL;DR I’m trying to have a better understanding of why he doesn’t want me to join his d&d campaign

ANSWER: I mean, he told you the reason. He doesn't think you'd grasp it. He could have easily said there's too many people in the group already, or this was more of a guys night thing, but he chose not to say that.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My Partner (39M) calls me (40F) 'Selfish' for Refusing to Visit his Traumatic Family this holiday .

I \[40 F\] am deeply struggling with my partner (39M). We have been together for almost three years, living far away from his and my family. Since I met his, two years ago, there's been tension between us. Now, he is deeply upset and sad because I refuse to a ten-day stay with his family for the holidays. He claims my refusal is selfish, exaggerating, and unsupportive, arguing that I should tolerate his family and make things lighter for him when they are difficult, rather than adding to his stress by being nervous myself.

They make me really anxious. I have tons of examples, but to give a couple of them, one of my first meetings with his mother, she shared a family history of incest with me. His sister, on our first or second encounter, asked me about my history with violent relationships and then told me about her own abusive ex-partner. She and his father both tend to get really nervous about non important problems (she started a fight with her boyfriend in front of me the first time I saw her because her family in law sent her a Christmass greeting when she is not a christian. Her mother then told me that if her daughter wasn’t a yoga teacher, she would had become a murderer. I also hated that). I find them overwhelming, conflict-ridden, and prone to extreme emotional reactions. When I try to set boundaries or name the dysfunction, my partner calls me 'immature'. He also says that he accepts my family, so I should accept his. My Question is am I selfish for refusing this trip and, in general, for demanding limited contact?  Am I 'exaggerating' or gaslit? Thank you for your advice.

ANSWER: I think this relationship doesn't really have a future. Your partner doesn't want you to set boundaries and he doesn't want to do it himself either. You feel uncomfortable and unsafe with his family. 

There's no way around that.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My fiance (26M) and I (24F) just got engaged. He wants to break up because he feels guilty. How do I deal with it?

My fiance and I have been dating for 6 years. He just proposed to me four days ago. We’ve had a good share of issues in the past mainly surrounding his family. His mom specifically has always been very passive aggressive about me but always nice/ok in person. She’s openly disrespected me and our relationship going as far as lecturing her own son about how we are not a good pair. Well anyway, that took a big toll on the relationship and frankly me as well. She’s done as far as breaking us up multiple times earlier in the relationship. Lately, he’s been very good about standing up to her and telling her to stop and everything else of such sorts. Before he proposed to me, he had a conversation with my family and told them the plan for the proposal and how he told his family. Lo and behold, we get engaged and we heard nothing from his family. He is extremely close with his mom and his three sisters so that was a bit shocking. He told me his family knew everything about the proposal, but turns out he lied and didn’t say a word to any of his family. Two days after the proposal, he told his mom and some of his sisters that he was engaged and clearly they were upset. He didn’t want to share any of our engagement pictures with anyone and didn’t want to announce the engagement on social media or to his immediate and extended family. Well that made me very upset and we’ve had a huge fight over it. I don’t understand how he doesn’t care to announce it when he can see how badly it hurts me that he doesn’t want to show off our engagement especially since he is so close with them. 
Well long story short, we just got done with a phone call. He tells me he feels very guilty over not telling his family about the proposal before he did it and feels guilty for lying to me and my family. He says he wants to break up because him lying will have a long impact on our relationship but that he loves and cares about me nonetheless. Hes lied about a lot of little stuff before but I’ve always forgiven him. He already took down all of our pictures from social media and ended the phone call with a “you deserve better than what I’ve done and given you” I know for a fact he’s not cheating so I’m having a really hard time processing this. How can he end our relationship over this? I know we haven’t been perfect and there was a lot of hurt and drama between us before, but I’ve forgiven him and we both tried to move on from it all, and then he lied to me again. I don’t know how to deal with the break up and how we can be so okay breaking up with me over the fact that he didn’t share the news with his family before he actually proposed.

ANSWER: His family doesn’t approve of your relationship. 

And he either isn’t strong enough, or doesn’t love you enough, to choose you. 

This is not your guy.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My girlfriend (27f) is expecting me (29m) to change therapists and said in unreasonable for refusing?

I started private therapy a few months ago. I pay £60 a session. I have always found it easier to open up to women so I chose a female therapist.

Outside of sessions she always makes it clear if I am struggling, to reach out and message or email her.

I mentioned this to my gf and she said she thinks that's weird and crossing a line.

She asked if I talk about our relationship to the therapist and I said yes but that I won't be going into any more details about what I discuss in my sessions.

My girlfriend said it was weird I was talking about our relationship with another woman and that I shouldn't be considering messaging her outside of sessions.

I told my gf she was the one making it weird but she just said she things I should change therapist. I refused and told her she doesn't get to dictate what therapists I'm allowed to talk to.

She said I wasn't being reasonable but I just said she was out of order for thinking she gets to choose my therapists. I said I wouldn't be talking about it further and she should drop it.

She just said again I wasn't being reasonable and that I should consider changing.

How would you handle this?

Tl;dr my girlfriend is expecting me to change therapists as I’ve chosen a female therapist. When I refused she said I wasn’t being reasonable.

ANSWER: Your girlfriend is being unreasonable, not you. It is very normal for a therapist to be open to hearing from their patients if they're in distress. She wasn't asking you to text her casually or meet for coffee!

================================================================================

QUESTION: I 32F found my fiancé's 36M secret Instagram account

Me 32F and my fiance 36M have been together nearly 7 years and are planning our wedding for summer next year. We've also been family planning, after having some miscarriages, we've had appointments for health checks etc. My fiance lost his job in April but has successfully found another he is enjoying. 

Last year we were in couples counselling because I had seen on his phone he was on only fans. He deleted the account before I could even see what he was doing on it.. he said he was only on it out of curiosity. Anyway, we work through it. And go ahead with planning this wedding. 

A couple of weeks ago I see on his laptop, not through snooping, it was just on his open laptop in our office as I passed it. I see hes got a secret Instagram account, following loads of explicit models and he has been messaging these models flirty stuff like "lovely thighs"... The account is a random username and no profile picture. It is also set up using a different email address so it doesn't link to anything on his phone. 

Again, after going through couples counselling last year, he's betrayed my trust. We were both happily planning a wedding and very excited for our next chapter, I feel completely blindsided by it. He promised me he'd never put me through this again after the only fans saga, and here we are. I know he loves me, I don't doubt that. But he's not respected my boundaries. He wants to work on this in counselling again but I don't think I keep going through this. He says that losing his job was a stress trigger that causes this behaviour. He says that I'm throwing our life together away too readily but I feel like I don't have a choice after all this happening again.

Does anyone have any experience with this? Is this something a relationship can work through? I do love him very much and I don't doubt he loves me, we do have a lovely relationship, I just don't understand this behaviour.

TLDR; we are planning to get married next year but my fiance has broken my trust again by making a secret Instagram account and messaging naked models. There's a lot of love there but I'm struggling to see a way forward. Is this workable?

Update: Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to read and respond to my previous post. Your advice, care, and support have helped me massively during this difficult time. It truly feels like a huge virtual hug, and I am incredibly grateful for the kindness you’ve shown me. 

Regarding next steps, I have the full support of my friends and family now. We have cancelled the wedding, and I am working through what comes next. I know that I cannot continue in this relationship, and I am slowly gaining the confidence needed to move forward. Although I am absolutely terrified of what the future holds, I know in my heart that this relationship is not healthy and the trust has been irrevocably shattered.

ANSWER: The problem is, he will either stop, or be smarter next time so he doesn't get caught. You won't know which one is true ...

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (28M) fiance (28F) can't hold a job and can't pass classes

Hi, my (28M) fiance (28F) is not able to hold a job and can't pass basic community college classes to get a degree/certificate to work somewhere she enjoys. She and I met in college in 2017, where she wanted to get in the healthcare industry (nursing originally). She did decent enough on the general studies requirements, but when it came to math and the biology classes, she could not pass no matter what she tried. She took and failed a math and biology class 3 times, even after getting a tutor the second and third time for both courses (the community college provides tutoring). She tried to do other majors, including general studies, and health administration, but could also not pass the low level classes required to get through the degree (except the general studies degree, but she didn't think that would help in her job search). She's also blamed that she doesn't have a quiet place to study with her parents, so she moved with me before taking the course the second and third time and I made her a quiet zone she can study. 

When she first started community college, she was able to get herself a job at Starbucks. She absolutely hated this job and she cited many times that she was failing because she didn't have the proper time to study, due to a 20 hour schedule. So on her third course attempts (math + bio), I told her to quit and focus solely on the school work. She however still failed these courses. The college also says you can't take a course more than 3 times, so thos degrees were out of the wiestion. Afterwards, she ended up getting some odd jobs working at as an orthopedics assistant (lasted 1 month, was fired due to not passing some test she needed to pass), a receptionist at an oncologist's office (she was fired after a week because she sounded too nervous when talking to the customers), and then eventually got another job at a different Starbucks. This is over the last 3 years.

By this point, she had pretty much dropped out of community college, so I suggested she look into IT certs. I bought her a training courses to get an Comptia ITF+, and she said she would study. Well, months later I ask how it's going (she worked at nights, I work mornings), and she says work has been too stressful because she can't work 40 hours a week and do the studying. We talked it out and we had her work 4 days a week for 6 hours each day. Even now, she's saying the work is too stressful and she won't really study for her cert, even though we are now both home at the same time. 

For some other context, I work 40 hours a week and make a decent amount, but she keeps talking about buying a home, starting a family, but I don't think we can afford that with our pay. Also, she gets really stressed out easily whenever we talk about finances, or I ask how her studying is going.

I know it sounds like I'm shitting on my fiance, but I do love her and I want her to be in a better state mentally and financially, but I don't know what to do at this point. The only job she's been able to hold is the Starbucks job, but she hates it and talks about wanting to quit all the time. I am worried about our financial future, and whenever I bring this stuff up, she gets really upset. She's also seen a therapist on and off over the last few years to talk about her feelings of being a failure and it had semi helped, but she's still kind of doing the same thing.

I should also mention this whole thing has been making my depressions worse (been depressed for years, even talked to a therapist myself about it). While I do love her, this is not how I expected our life together to go. I was hoping we would both make decent money, so we wouldn't struggle with basic living needs. Don't get me wrong, I can afford it on my own, but I want to be in a more comfortable spot.

 I don't know if she can get the certs required for an IT (she's a terrible test taker no matter how much she studies). She doesn't want to work in food service anymore and I don't know what else she can do. What can I do to help her? What can I do in general? I feel so drained with this situation.

ANSWER: Why are you pushing her towards IT? Its a profession that requires constant learning and she is clearly incapable. I wouldn't wish her as a coworker on my worst enemy.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My bf(18M) is letting everything go after I(18F) said "Thank you" to someone who wanted to get with me.

This is probably weird or pointless since this is I guess a high school relationship but I do ask for opinions on this situation if this is alright. 

My boyfriend is trying to break up with me and is being incredibly petty over something that happened a few days ago. 

What happened was, I was at school during lunch and some guy told me that their friend said I was pretty, I said “Thank you, but I have a boyfriend.” I told my boyfriend what happened and now he is incredibly pissed off at me because I said “Thank you” he wanted me to basically start shit and say “Nono I have a boyfriend” aggressively. 

He said to me that it was pathetic of that I didn't wanna start shit. 

Reason why I said thank you is because I was scared and didn’t want to start anything or be negative. It was a way to protect myself. 

But my boyfriend is NOT having it, it’s to the fact that he threw all of the things I gave him in his closet, and every-time I try to criticize it, he doesn’t want to hear about it. He changed everything that has to do with me, he said I wasn’t worth all of his sacrifices he made. He has a big fear of cheating because we’re all at the age where it is common to happen, not only that, he has a cheating record himself.

We always had a rocky relationship as we both suffer from BPD. Everything mostly went into shambles after the honeymoon phase was over, which obviously that's a common thing that's meant to happen.There are often times we argue all the time and always assumptions about cheating. I always pull back but he always tries to run away.

I would never cheat on him and have no intentions to. But he might. 


All of this was over that single situation i tried to get away from and he is not letting it go. 

I feel as if I messed up and I do not want to lose him. He is my first real life relationship as I used to date people online before at a young age. We go out together all the time and he is a smart loving guy. I don't want lose him but I know its too late. 

Should this be a time where I should just let go? It's hard since I do suffer from BPD as well. Maybe I shouldn't have said "Thank you."

Edit: What I mean by smart is that, he is academically very smart but he doesn't have much common sense. He has a 4.0 and everything he drives, etc. Thats why I find him attractive as we and not wanna lose him. We both have similar interests and everything and we did so much together, it's hard to even want to lose all of this. We went out a lot and everything. 

We met since middle school and finally got together around the ending of junior year. Thats why I'm so attached. We understood each other and have so much interests together. We made stories with our characters and did so much. I just.. Dont wanna lose all of this as again, 

This is my first IRL relationship coming from a online nerd who used to date a lot of people online

I'm waiting for him to move on but nothings happening and it's been almost 5 days

He helped build my life so much that it's so hard to let go, he gave me the best advice and to do what makes me happy as I am in under a lot of pressure under my parents expectations. We planned college together and having kids. I just didn't want that dream to go


Update 8:18pm: a lot of things happened. He unblocked me and tried to apologize. We tried to have a civil conversation but then when I started to criticize him properly, he snapped and started to blow up my phone calling me whre, and everything. I tried to stand my ground and be the bigger person. 
He hurt himself really bad and he tore up all the stuff I gave and made for him. Hes apologizing as he snapped out of it. I'm scared I don't feel good.. 

Update 7:31am: I got over him, we're still together but if he keeps going to do this, then we're done. Thank you guys so much for your support. You guys really made me see things and I got into a better mindset. Thank you so much, I'll be the bigger person now.

ANSWER: \>he is a smart loving guy.   
No, he's not. he's an irrational, immature, tantrum-throwing child, and he's projecting his own cheating behaviour onto you. You did NOT mess up. Saying "thank you" is meaningless punctuation in English conversations. Tell him to snap out of it and calm down, or he'll lose you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My SIL (40F) wants her parents to spend Christmas at my house (32F)

OK so for context, my husband and I have been together for a long time but we've only been married for about three years. 

We've always done Christmas Day separately because my parents are quite introverted and keep to themselves and his family have their own routine and their immediate family is quite small too. 

Usually we need to travel to both of our parents from where we usually live, about a 3 hour drive. My SIL finds this trip quite tiring and would rather have my in-laws stay at our house to make travelling easier. We live close enough so my SIL. 

She thought it was ok to suggest this because I usually spend it at my parents house but the thought makes me uncomfortable because my MIL doesn't like me and has become increasingly hostile since we married. She also has some problems with alcohol and this has caused a lot of tension at recent family get together. When we bought our house she was also getting too involved in what we were doing to the house and we had to set some boundaries. 

Because they can be like this, I think this is why SIL is suggesting that they should stay at our house rather than her own house. When we were hesitant and suggested maybe rotating hosting duties, they seemed confused and said they couldn't understand why we wouldn't want to host them ourselves. 

What would be a good compromise? I generally get on well with my SIL and I haven't explicitly mentioned not getting on with MIL to her because I want to try keep relations as positive as possible.

ANSWER: That won't work for us, but we'd be happy to see them when they stay with you.


If she continues to push, be honest about your mean MIL - is she your SIL's mom? If she is, it makes way more sense for her to stay with her daughter.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [35M] found out my girlfriend [31F] lied about a night out with an older married man, not sure if I can ever trust her again or if I should walk away

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for almost 2 years. Earlier this year, she lied about a night she spent out with a 52-year-old married man who used to be a customer at the girls’ bar where she worked in Japan.

She originally told me it was just dinner with a friend, but she didn’t come home until around 4 AM and was pretty drunk. Over time I found out more and more things that didn’t line up with her story, like how she said other friends were supposed to join (which turned out not to be true), or how she said they only went to one bar when it was actually three.

When I confronted her and asked for proof, she eventually admitted to lying about parts of it after I asked her to show me receipts and messages. She still insists nothing sexual or romantic happened, and she has receipts from every place except one bar, which only he has.

I actually messaged the guy months later to ask directly. He said nothing happened, but he’s been evasive and refused to share that one missing receipt that could clear up the timeline. He stopped replying altogether.

This isn’t the only time she’s lied or deleted messages. Early in our relationship, she deleted her whole message history with another male friend she went drinking with and later went to his apartment to “wait for the first train.” She swore nothing happened there either, but she hid it from me and only admitted it when I confronted her with proof.

She says she lied because she “didn’t want me to assume the worst” or get upset over things that looked bad but were innocent. She admits she has an issue with lying to avoid conflict and says she’s going to start therapy for it. Recently she’s been a lot more transparent, gives me full access to her phone if I ask, and has been consistent for a while.

Even with that, I can’t stop replaying things in my head and wondering what really happened that night. I told her that if I can’t get some kind of closure or solid truth, I might not be able to stay, not to punish her, but because I don’t think I can rebuild trust on half-truths.

TL;DR:  
My girlfriend (31F) lied about spending a night out with an older married man and has lied about a few other sketchy situations in the past. She says nothing romantic happened and is trying to be honest now and work on herself. I (35M) want to believe her but can’t stop doubting everything.

How do I figure out if it’s actually possible to rebuild trust after this kind of repeated lying? And if I can’t ever know the full truth, how do I decide whether it’s healthier to stay and try, or to walk away?

Edit: I did not expect this post to blow up as much as it has, but I truly appreciate all the responses. I want people to know regarding an update, that there is not much to do but break up. I obviously won't learn any new information about past events, but it's not necessary at this point regardless. I know my previous questions talked about if it's possible to rebuild trust or not. Truthfully my mind was already made up for quite a bit of time though. I just really wanted to share my story here to see other people's opinions, because so far aside from a couple of close friends I never talked to anyone about all of this. But the overwhelming majority of responses were exactly the same kind of conclusions I felt myself. I just wanted to hear other people to confirm what I already was suspecting was true.

ANSWER: You won't ever find out. 


You have enough to make a decision.  


Shes lied, the guy likely lied to protect her. She didn't come home till 4 am drunk. Shes lied before,  almost same scenario.  


Shes been cheating and you know it. That's enough for you to end the relationship.  If you stay, then accept cheating will always be a problem.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (26f) discovered bf (26m) using grok for unsettling fantasies and I am not sure if I should bring it up

As title stated I hope this is a valid question to ask. Basically my bf now fiancé has been acting kind of suspicious lately (not wanting to talk much, being on his phone a lot, not wanting intimacy) and I was able to get access to his computer. There was no search history available as it was all deleted but luckily I was able to see he had recently purchased grok premium and had his twitter logged in on his computer (I asked him what he used it for - he said work but that it wasn’t that good). Of course there was no history for grok either but luckily grok remembers everything so when I asked it to recite past conversations it turns out over 55% of their conversations were all sexual. Apparently he uses this often so that is not a small amount either. 

Of these conversations I found out many of them were about kidnapping, incest, and mainly nonconsenting fantasies. Of these, over 10 were saved to his private notes for later and one of them was a detailed list of ingredients needed to drug someone and methods on how to do it without being caught. I can buy some of the other taboo stories being just for masturbating or something but the drugging in particular was very detailed with several questions and follow ups months later. Even one asking about how the cold would affect it. There were a few other concerning ones about how to isolate someone over time and these were all the ones saved permanently. I am feeling creeped out by this but is this worth discussing? Obviously people can have fantasies but something about this feels like I should bring it up. I haven’t been able to find many situations like this online, especially since it’s ai 

Edit:

Well guys I hate to leave an embarrassing update but since this got some traction I owe a bit of an explanation. I left our shared apartment tonight and texted him asking him for an explanation on what he was doing on the app. I know everyone said to just leave but I couldn’t help it idk I needed an explanation but in fairness I was prepared to leave. 

Well he was dumbfounded and admitted to using grok for nothing more than generating sexual ai images and had no fucking idea what I was talking about. Even though I had asked grok for history from his account he had only had the app for a couple of weeks and as we discussed I realized some of the history on what he had asked was almost a month before he even tried grok in the first place. He’s now understandably kind of upset that I even assumed he would be asking it that. I’m still confused on how it generated the history in the first place but just goes to show do not trust ai even if it does have timestamps

ANSWER: Hey! I'm not an alarmist, and I've been with/been involved with people who have fairly dark fantasies. This is not that. Please take me seriously when I tell you that you are unsafe. 

Confronting a partner with this kind of history in his phone is likely to be unsafe. As someone who has experienced intimate partner violence and works with survivors, I would not recommend confronting him - if you feel that you must, do not do it at home, and do not do it without another person who is present physically and aware of the situation. 
Leaving a relationship can be complicated, scary, expensive, and time consuming, but I urge you to do so quickly. Next steps include telling someone you trust about what you found, then creating physical/geographical, financial, social, and emotional distance from your boyfriend.

Edit: it's also worth mentioning that when assessing for risk of harm (to self or others), professionals are trained to look for a plan, means, and intent (to identify actual risk vs just venting or fantasizing). 
Your partner at the very least has a detailed plan to harm someone, and could very well have both the means and intent to do so. That specific detail is why this is about more than dark fantasies and you are not safe to stay with him or confront him alone.

QUESTION: I F22 am scared for my bf M28 to see my boobs. How do I get comfortable enough to show him?

I’ve always been insecure about my boobs. They’re side-set, have stretch marks are a bit bigger so they’re a little saggy, aren’t perfectly round and I have quite big nipples and of course, they’re uneven. I’m terrified to show them to my boyfriend. I told him this at the beginning of our relationship and he hasn’t been pushy at all, but I’d like to take the next step with him. He hasn’t touched them or seen them (obviously), but he does like to rest his head on my chest and kiss it through my clothing and he says that he finds me beautiful no matter what. He’s told me that he’ll find them beautiful, but he can’t possibly know that. He might take my shirt off and find me disgusting.
Does anyone have any tips? Does the look of boobs matter a lot?

ANSWER: Came here to say this boobs are boobs and he's a man so he will like them. If he complains dump him immediately

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend (M25) resents me for having an abortion (F25)

Hi everyone,

Bit of a difficult post of write but I could do with so advice. I (25 F) had an abortion around 9 months ago, when I first found out I was terrified and didn’t know what to do. Me and my boyfriend (25M) have been together for 9 years, but we have had a lot of difficulties throughout the years such as him deciding he wanted to break up twice through this time as he was unsure about the relationship.

This has left some scars on the relationship, because he becomes withdrawn, less interested in the relationship which leaves me anxious throughout. I’ve asked him to come to therapy with me to resolve these issues but each time he has declined to do it. He has became this way over the last few months which again made me feel anxious wondering what the behaviour was about.

In addition to our difficulties over the years, I believed we were not in a good place financially to have a kid yet- we didn’t have our own place, I was at a job for minimum wage, I’m studying to become a solicitor which is costing me a lot of money at the moment. He, on the other hand, said he would help a lot financially, with the time of bringing up a baby while I study, and general other support.

Despite this, I just felt like because of past behaviour of him leaving, my own experience with relatives becoming single parents due to their partners leaving etc. I didn’t want to put myself in a position that I would become a single parent, with little finances if everything went wrong- as realistically babies are a beautiful thing but can strain any relationship, particularly one where there is unsolved issues.

My boyfriend sat me down yesterday and said he’s having feelings of resentment and coldness towards me as a result of the abortion. Throughout the abortion he supported me with the decision I.e, taking me to the appointment, taking care of me for the weekend but never voiced any of his strong feelings through this.

Now I’m sat here wondering what to do. I understand his worries when he says you never know if you can have children in future as I’ve said I would be more than happy to have kids from 28 when I finish studying, but now he doesn’t believe me? Any advice would be appreciated.

ANSWER: Sorry OP but it doesn’t seem like relationship that will last. Even before the abortion he was on the verge of leaving. Even when you will be in better financial position you will have at the back of your head that he might leave. Is it worth living in such anxiety?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (28M) gf (31F) got very drunk yesterday and I don’t know if I should trust her?

My (28M) gf (31F) went out yesterday to a costume birthday party. She’s friends with the birthday guy. They both had some affectionate messages that she showed me a couple months back, which at the time caused a discussion and she reassured me that nothing was going on between them and I trusted her at the time so that was it.

So yesterday I sent her a message around midnight to update her on what I was doing since I was having dinner with some other guy friends. I saw she uploaded a story where she was dancing with another girl and there were other guys in the back, and minutes later she deleted the story. 

I was curious and asked her why she deleted that, and she responded four hours later, but her messages were not making any sense. I also asked her why did it take her so long to respond, and after a couple weird messages she finally responded saying that she didn’t even notice the time and that she didn’t like the story so she deleted it. Judging by the messages she was very drunk. She then says that she’s drunk and is driving home. I got pissed and told her that she shouldn’t have drunk so much knowing she had to drive home after and to let me know as soon as she gets home.

Now the drinking and driving is definitely something that bothers me a lot, but also, I feel kind of disrespected because she went out and got very drunk in a party with other guys I haven’t met specially with a guy we had a discussion about. I guess I feel insecure because of a couple things she has said and done in the past. For example she once said that when she drinks “her legs open by themselves”. Also that she’s a very sexual person. Also she once said that she liked that she looked like a bitch on one of her instagram posts and a couple other things.
So yeah, honestly I would like to trust her when she goes out but if I know shes drinking I feel uneasy. Is it wise to bring this up to her and tell her that I don’t like it when she drinks?

EDIT: I got word from a mutual friend that also went to the party that she was being flirty and handsy with the guy I mentioned above the whole night. At the end of the party this mutual friend saw them both getting into the guy's car to "have drinks". Yeah, that's bs. I just broke up with her and blocked her on everything.

ANSWER: What do you want to know that she didn’t already tell you. 
She is not a keeper it’s just your turn. Either enjoy the ride or move on.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My(25F) Bf(30M) left after seeing ex's engagement post

Okay so, I '25F' have been dating my boyfriend '30M' for a little over two years now. We just moved in together a few months ago. Last night we were doomscrolling on insta reels and his ex's(32F) post popped up abt her getting engaged

I don't rly know much about their relationship in detail other than her cheating on my bf with her current fiance while she was engaged to my bf (they were together for 5 yrs and it's been 3.5 yrs since they broke up), so ik that it didn't end well with them and it's just a sour topic so i never rly bring it up. I don’t follow her but she's kind of famous on insta as she is a food vlogger and I watch a lot of that content that's y she popped up.

Anyways when he saw it he like frozen and became tense i asked him if everything was ok and he said yeah but i asked if that her looked tense was it because of the post he just brushed it off and rolled over to go to sleep and then thing is we didn't even rly cuddle when we cuddle like almost every night when going to sleep.

I woke up around 2 a.m. and he was gone. Like, completely gone.  he was nowhere in our house. I called him, like, 10 ,15 times. No answer ,Phone was switched off. I even called one of his friends, and they had no clue where he was. I was thinking of calling his mom but ik she would have blown his phone up so i decided to wait and call my frnd she also suggested to wait a few hours so i did

Then around 3:30 ish  he finally calls me back,i ask him wtf is he doing And he just says I'm fine pls don't call me rn ill explain later and he hangs up b4 i could say anything properly

I tried calling again obviously bcoz what does that even mean like I don't get why he would even be upset about that post seeing they broke up so long ago I can't imagine leaving your gf over this at night. He didn't explicitly say anything abt the reason he went off but I'm pretty sure it's bcoz of the post. I stopped calling him after a few times as hes not going to pick up i rly don't know what to do.

He still hasn't returned, and I don't know what to do when he does.

What is the best way to determine if this is a one-off panic attack due to unresolved trauma or if this is a sign of a deeper issue in our relationship?


TLDR: BF left in the middle of the night after seeing his cheating ex got engaged, turned his phone off, and called back hours later only to say "I'm fine, don't call." How do I handle this fallout and the conversation about his unacceptable behavior

Update- https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/223AzlHLSa

ANSWER: If he’s that upset by his ex getting engaged that he can’t talk to you about it and has to go out all night, then he’s not over her and shouldn’t be dating other people seriously.

You should take a break and he should see a therapist. Alright for him to be upset, freaked out even, and to need time alone. But to be so not in control of his feelings that he can’t even express to you in a rational way what he’s doing and where he’s going, is excessive. 

Is this his usual way of handling issues? If so, he has growing up to do. If not, he definitely still has a thing for her. 

ETA: text that magically disappeared from my original post and corrected that he should seek therapy, not OP.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (26F) tried to slow ghost my former best friend (26F) of 10+ years but she won’t take the hint. Do I tell her directly that I want to part ways with her completely?

UPDATE: I sent her a long message - tried to keep it kind and respectful but explained all the reasons we wont be friends anymore. She read it and was ‘typing’ on and off for more than an hour but hasn’t sent her reply yet. 

So I’ll call my former best friend Megan. We were best friends from age 11 until about age 24, where it all went wrong. As it stands, I don’t want to have her in my life. She has caused me a lot of pain and I no longer trust her. She hasn’t gotten the memo though, and keeps calling and texting saying ‘it’s been so long let’s hang out!’. At first I tried to allow it to fizzle out gradually but the more I do, the more persistent she is. I’m feeling guilty and don’t know where to go from here. 

So, the context: Megan and I decided we wanted to move to the city together after we graduated. The city is expensive so we had to move into a share house with other people, which is very normal for people in our age and location.

We found these two guys our age who were looking to balance their house with two females. They seemed like a great fit for us. They were very involved in their church life as Christians. They weren’t ‘bro’ kind of guys, which suited us as we didn’t want to live with guys who were into partying/drugs lifestyle or who might persue us sexually. A wholesome home in the crazy big city. 

I’ll try to keep this short but this is a LONG story. If any of you have seen Baby Reindeer on Netflix, that’s what happened with one of the guys. That’s the TLDR. I’ll call him Tom. Tom became obsessed with me - at first positively and then extremely negatively. He hated me with a passion. It was hell. I didn’t understand what I did wrong. 

He would send me massive paragraph texts about how disgusting I am, so much that I had to block him from being able to message me on anything. I wasn’t messy or noisy, actually I spent as little time as I could in the house because of him. Never cooked or used the common area to avoid anything he could get angry at me over.

I was working in hospitality so would get home at 1am - 2am and he would be waiting at the window, big light on. My room was next to his, and as soon as I was inside my room he would make as much noise as possible - banging on the wall, walking up and down, grunting and groaning. He always knocked on my door when I was sleeping to ‘talk’ to me. 

Meanwhile, he was a completely different guy to Megan and the fourth guy. Because I was always out and they had similar schedules, they’d spend lots of time together. I could overhear him when speaking to them and he was acting as the most well adjusted, thoughtful, kind person. Crazy.

You might be wondering how they couldn’t hear the commotion at night. Megan is deaf in one ear and sleeps on her good ear, so if she’s asleep she can’t hear anything. The fourth guy had the bedroom downstairs and had to sleep with his medical equipment on, which is pretty loud. 

Tom bitched about me hardcore to the others. I heard him doing it a lot. His main point was that I kept him awake at night. Thing is, I did keep him awake at night because he was up  waiting up for me. But he left that part out. 

It all got so bad that my dad called him to have a conversation to try and get him to stop all of this. My dad, who had a career as a psychologist said ‘baby I won’t tell you what was said but I can tell you he’s obsessed with you and you should lock your door at night.’ 

So how did this ruin my friendship with Megan? Well for the first months I kept it all to myself. Because it was all happening in the middle of the night and over the phone, I kind of wanted to pretend it wasn’t happening and if I told them, it would make it feel real. I also didn’t want them to feel awkward. But when it got too much and I told Megan all about it - she did nothing. She didn’t really respond. I expected her to be horrified, but she was all ‘that’s between you two, I’m staying out of it.’ That was it. 

She continued to be friends with him. One time - they didn’t know I was in the house and Tom was on a rampage about me to Megan downstairs. I stood in the hall and heard it all. For literally 45 minutes he was ranting - ‘she’s the most uninteresting person I’ve ever met. There’s not one interesting thing about her. She so unmotivated. All the wants from her life is to be looked after by men and watch reality TV. I have no respect for her at all.’  Megan didn’t join in, but she also didn’t combat him, she listened. And as my boyfriend pointed out to me - she’s definitely said mean stuff about me for him to even feel comfortable saying all of that to her. 

After that, I left the house and just cycled around in the dark. I put a message in the group chat saying I heard everything, and I bullet pointed the reasons why all of that wasn’t true at all. Megan didn’t say anything to me about it. Tom came to my room the next day and demanded I move out. I said no (I was waiting until both mine and my boyfriend’s contracts were up so we could move in together). The next week, he moved out. I think me overhearing all of that outed him as being awful and he was embarrassed. Megan went for a farewell dinner with him to say goodbye.

That was over a year ago now. I tried to forgive Megan. She came to my place and I explained my whole experience and she did apologise. She was sorry. I tried to move on after her apology - we went to a festival together and hung out a few times. But I can’t shake it. She didn’t act like a best friend at all through that situation and I do not trust her. Now thinking of her makes me think of him and how she left me alone in that situation. I’m much happier in my new life in my new home with new best friends.

That leads us up to now. She keeps on messaging and calling trying to rekindle and I know that I’ve tried, and I know it doesn’t work. I don’t want to confront her because she already apologised for that stuff, and I don’t believe in making people feel bad when they’ve already been sorry. But I know that she lost my friendship in the way she acted during that time. 

Do I tell her or keep saying I’m busy? 

TLDR my ex best friend sided with our housemate who was making my life hell - I don’t want to be friends but don’t know how to make that clear to her.

ANSWER: 'Hi Megan, I haven't really wanted to get into it because you have apologised and there's nothing to be done about it now but the whole situation with Tom really changed how I feel about you and I can't see myself having any kind of friendship with you going forward. I think it's probably best if we don't contact each other any more.

QUESTION: Me (F22) how can I romance my husband (M20) if I’m his caregiver?

We’re newly weds, barely hitting a year in December. Last month my husband was hit by a car while riding his bike home from work. He fractured parts of his back and many other issues. I’ve been dealing with lawyers and managing his doctor’s appointments. I care for him now while he’s on bed rest. 

He’s been getting depressed and today he tells me he is craving romance. Usually when he tells me this, I give him a romantic bath, or go out to dinner, or even get him gifts, or plan activities together.

Now with money being strict, and him incapable of travel, all my ideas of romance are blank

I have no idea how to romance him like I use too. I’ve just been under so much stress and have been busy taking care of him, he says he feels like a patient rather than a cherished husband

What can I do to make him feel loved and romanced while he’s in this condition. If we need anything more right now, it’s romance

ANSWER: This is a tough situation and you have my empathy. My husband was previously in a care taking role for me, however a work accident had had us swap roles and I understand how complicated this can be. 


My best suggestion is to ask your husband what would make him feel cherished. It's too big a burden to put on you to solely come up with the ideas and hope you land on the right one. You guys need to have a conversation about what romance will look like for you both now. I know conversing about it dosnt exactly scream sexiness, but I can tell you that being confident in knowing what your partner wants and then being willing to do that is hot. 


If you have the energy, you can also do some online research in disability communities. Talk to other couples who have experience with romance and caretaking. Read some articles. Then talk with each other and see what fits within your desire, timeliness and budget. 


Also, it can also help to try and broaden your ideas about what constitutes romance. Presents and adventures are wonderful but so is a hand written card left for him to read or a head rub while you talk about your day. 


I wasn't 100% sure since you said romance but if you are using romance to also include sex then I would definitely recommend again heading to Google to research disability, caregiving,  and sex.  If you would like more direct links let me know and I can share some resources.


Lastly, being a care taker can be tough. Make sure you do what you can to care for your self as well. While it might feel selfish to focus on your needs it absolutely isnt. If you get too burned out and run down then your ability to care for your husband is detrimentally impacted. Take a little time to pamper your self or care for your self and see how your husband reacts to a more relaxed abd happy you.

QUESTION: My boyfriend 21M is showing a lot of red flags and I 21F don’t know what to do.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. Lately he’s only wanted to have sex once a month. I just found videos on his phone of us having sex that I didn’t even know existed. He also has screenshots of other girls and charges for OnlyFans. A similar situation happened about a year ago and I almost broke up with him, but he convinced me that he would change. He was a lot better for a while and we had sex multiple times a week. But now we are back in the same situation. Does anyone have any advice for how I should approach this? I’m at a loss.

QUESTION: I (24M) dating My (20F) gf has no more libido

I ‘M24’ am dating my gf ‘F20’ . Ive been with my girlfriend over a year now and out of no where, shes lost her libido pretty much completely over 7 months ago. I was wondering if any of you have been through a relationship where your partner just completely lost their libido, and then came back to normal some day. If so, was it because you guys changed something you did? Im starting to get pretty frustrated being the only one trying in that aspect. Any type of advice to help her improve this would help. thank you

================================================================================

QUESTION: Couples counselor suggested that me (M26) and my wife (F24) go on a walk and try to look at each other like we were just meeting again for the first time

I’ll try to be brief here without elaborating too much about the circumstances of why we are in couples counseling, but if context is appropriately needed in the comments I’ll expand.

Basically my wife and I recently started couples counseling as we have hit probably the worst patch we’ve ever experienced in our almost 6 year long relationship. I have basically decided that I think it’s best to cut off communication with her as much as possible until we can work through some of the issues, as I feel communicating is only making things worse. We have only had 2 counseling sessions so far so it’s still very early and our therapist has mostly just been learning about our personalities without really delving into the specific issues going on in our relationship.

Near the end of our recent session she brought up love languages and suggested that we take a walk together and treat each other as though we were just meeting again for the first time or early on in our relationship. My wife’s love language is quality time and taking a walk is a low stakes and easy thing for us to work into our week. Unfortunately we didn’t really get to expand on this discussion much as we ran out of time.

The issue I have is that part of the reason for the rough patch is that when I had been making more of an effort to spend time with her recently I found myself getting frustrated with her behaviors and choices near the ends of our dates and conversations, but she would just say I’m being too sensitive and say that I do the same things to her. This repeated pattern has really damaged my sense of being able to trust holding a conversation or spending time with her.

That discussion is probably better saved for the therapist, but what I want to get advice on is how to try and approach taking a walk together and trying to get into the mindset of just meeting each other for the first time whilst trying not to fear the possibility of an argument breaking out when I feel like I have trust issues/trauma when it comes to communicating with her recently.

Would you recommend to hold off on the walk until we can discuss this more in depth and concretely with the therapist, or would you say we should try it and if so are there any caveats or considerations to keep in mind?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Boyfriend [19M] doesn’t like sex with me [19FTM] anymore?

Little bit of background here, trying to keep it vague as possible. We [19M] and [19FTM] started dating around a year ago after dancing around things for a long while, we joke that his “closet” was a wet paper bag. We both graduated high school and that summer was amazing in every way. Romantic and shit. I have a lot of kinks and stuff, and he’s completely open to all of that. He’s made me feel so so loved, even with all of my issues. We had to switch to long distance as we’re going to school far away from each other now. I didn’t really handle that super well, I have an anxious attachment style. When I visited him last, he didn’t really initiate anything but I didn’t really mind putting in most of the effort. A few days later he tells me that sex just isn’t all that interesting for him anymore, hey I get it, sure. I’ve definitely got a higher libido than him. But lately he’s even asked me to stop talking about sex altogether. I love this man with all my heart and I want nothing more than to spend the rest of my life with him. However, my old anxieties are surfacing. Is he still attracted to me? Am I being annoying? Stuff like that. I’m trying to remind myself it’s most likely stress, he’s never been the best at expressing emotions (which we’re working on), and the school he goes to is really difficult. He says he still loves me just as much as the day I asked him out, but my brain won’t let me believe that. Help?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (26F) boyfriend (25M) wants to move our anniversary for Friendsgiving. Feeling too invested?

My boyfriend and I’s 1st anniversary is coming up, and this year it happens to fall on Thanksgiving. I knew he would feel very bad about skipping family Thanksgiving, and I wouldn’t want to either, so I asked if we could celebrate our anniversary the day after, if he didn’t have work. I also got a dog sitter for a few days so we can spend more time together away from my apartment, both for Thanksgiving and the anniversary (he didn’t request that I do this, I did this on my own). 

A few days ago he told me he’s not allowed to request the day after TG, so I said okay I’ll just go ahead and pick up my dog that day since I’ll just be at home. Then, a couple days later, he looked at his schedule and saw that the day after TG is actually a company holiday, so I said great, I didn’t change anything with the pet sitter, I’ll just pick her up Saturday as planned and we can do Friday. 

Today is where I may have overreacted. In the morning he texted to ask whether or not we have plans for Friday (day after TG). I said that I thought we were celebrating our anniversary that day. He responded that he does want to celebrate, but he wishes his friend had asked when a good day for a party was, because they are throwing Friendsgiving Friday night. I was at work, so I basically just said yeah that sucks that he didn’t ask. 

Later tonight he called and was talking about next week and said “Well, what are you doing during the day Friday? Can we just do something during the day? I can’t miss Friendsgiving.”

At this point I basically shut down and could barely respond because I was so disappointed. I feel as though I’m burdening him by asking him to dedicate a day to celebrate our relationship and I feel kind of silly for going as far as to book a pet sitter to spend time with him, when he would seemingly rather just go to Friendsgiving instead. I’m having a hard time not applying this situation to our relationship as a whole. 

Any advice welcome. 

(I did start abbreviating Thanksgiving as TG bc I was tired of typing it out.)

================================================================================

QUESTION: I 26F and my boyfriend 30M have been in a relationship for a while. How do I differentiate my own insecurities from actual disrespect?

Hello,

I (26F)  been with my boyfriend (30M) for about two years now. He is sweet, loyal and generous.

There are a few issues that have recently come up: The problem comes where he has started drinking more often.. usually a 325ml bottle x6 a week. You cannot necessarily tell he’s drunk but that on its own is worrisome

He will also send IG models back and forth with his guy best friend.

He will clean once in a blue and complain when I do not finish or do things “on time”

As I am writing thing out, it seems “obvious,” but I’m also sure you understand with all this, there is a lot of good traits / moments meshed in there.

At the same time, I’m not trying to paint myself as blameless. I know I can be clingy, I struggle giving him space, and I’ve had moments of being too controlling like not wanting him close to female coworkers or checking things I shouldn’t check. I’m trying to be self-aware and take responsibility for my part.

How do I tell the difference between my own insecurities making things worse or his actions actually being disrespectful? Thank you

TL;DR: I can’t tell if I’m the source of the problems in our relationship or if his actions are crossing boundaries.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Feeling guilty about my divorce and moving on. What would you do in my circumstance? (31F - ex 37M - current 41M)

TLDR: I was married for just over six years, things were going well but my husband kept getting into legal trouble, was very inconsiderate of my feelings when he wants his needs met and I know for a fact he was unfaithful to me at some point during our marriage as the other woman contacted me thinking I was his cousin so I served him the divorce papers whilst he’s in prison and moved on recently. I feel a lot of guilt about moving on and wasn’t looking for anyone or anything when the new person showed up yet I just can’t shake the feeling 


Full post

The final straw with my husband was when I felt seriously unwell one evening and was in a lot of pain in my chest + back/shoulders and he was more worried about his needs than helping me and after he went to the store I felt even worse started feeling serious pressure in my chest and couldn’t breathe I literally thought I was going to die so called the ambulance and turns out I had a collapsed left lung which required a hospital stay 😶 there were moments during my marriage that made me feel very uncomfortable and objectified but the collapsed lung scenario was it in regards to coming to terms with the fact my husband did NOT care about how I feel or my wishes when he wants what he wants - he made my skin crawl and at that point I was no longer attracted to him but didn’t end the marriage til a short while later after really thinking about things and giving it time whilst he was in prison again for breaching his probation. 

Not sure what I feel for this new man but it feels good and he doesn’t make me feel anything like my husband did yet I just cannot shake a feeling of guilt regarding the divorce 😕 I KNOW I shouldn’t, I was never unfaithful or mistreated my husband and went along with whatever he wanted and supported him through the good times and bad times, he cared at first but started to act like I’m property not a person and I feel like he only married me to keep me where he wanted me 🫤 I feel bad for him because he wasn’t always like this but we just aren’t on the same page and unfaithfulness is a deal breaker. During our marriage I was approached by multiple men and always politely told them I had a husband and wasn’t interested, not once did I accept advances or step out on him. I didn’t get with the new guy until months after we separated, I didn’t plan to leave one for another or anything like that, new guy sought me out and we reconnected. We became friends just before I met my husband but lost touch with each other until recently and after a while he made his feelings known I explained the situation which he respected and we decided to move slowly and so far things have been great but I just can’t shake the feeling of guilt or doing something wrong even when I know I’m not 🫤 what would you do in my position?

QUESTION: I(21M) told my SO(24F) that I slipped and told my friends we already had sex

I am with my friends and suddenly our topic shifts to talking about sex. They know I do not usually talk about it and would not engage on it, that is also what I also told my SO. I promise her that I won't be mentioning it to my friends because I know how sensitive it was. But I don't know what happened and I slipped. I immediately felt guilty and did not engage with the conversation anymore and invited them to go our separate ways. 

I got so guilty, that on the same day I told her what I did. I did not try to explain myself nor even make excuses, because I know what I did is a breach of her trust. I just apologized intensely and I told her that I will accept the consequences involve. 

I know what I did and that is why I told her immediately, I don't want to keep secrets to her and continue knowing I am keeping something from her. I am giving her space to process this emotion, and letting her be alone. 

What is the next step on this situation for me?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (29F) husband (32M) has been using AI to respond to our texts for months, and I just found out. How can I ever trust him again?

My husband and I had a long, serious conversation via text yesterday about a big problem in our relationship. Near the end of our conversation I started to suspect that his texts were written by chat gpt due to the wording and grammar used. When I checked his account, sure enough he was pasting my texts in and asking the AI to write responses to me. I looked through his chat history and saw he's been having AI write texts and responses to me for months now, usually when we're having serious discussions or when things are emotionally fraught. 


Specifically, the conversation we were having yesterday was very sensitive and I was being very honest and vulnerable with him. In my texts I was begging him to be real and honest with me about his own thoughts and feelings (something we have clashed on before). Seeing that he was dumping his actual real thoughts into an AI and having it generate less honest answers filled with typical AI bullshit was devastating. I don't know if he even read my texts himself. 


When I asked him if he had done this to me before he lied and said maybe once or twice before. His chat history showed dozens of times he had used it to text me. He has been leaving me love notes in my work lunches lately, which I thought was so sweet, but come to find out some of those were AI generated too. 


I don't know how I can ever trust him again. He lied to me for months, lied to my face when he was found out. All I have ever asked of him is honesty and transparency, and I can't believe he would go to such lengths to avoid telling me his true thoughts. Right now I don't feel like that's the type of person I want to spend the rest of my life with. How can we rebuild trust?


ETA: I agree that it's better to have serious conversations in person. My husband has a very difficult time communicating sometimes, and will completely freeze up and not be able to engage in a conversation with me at all, so I have thought that having conversations in writing would take some pressure off him. Additionally, he travels a lot for work (will be gone for weeks at a time) so we have had to adapt our relationship to be able to have tough conversations over text. 


The conversation yesterday happened because we had a weird morning, and then I had to go to work. I sent him a long text trying to explain my thoughts and feelings. It wasn't an argument

ANSWER: That's incredibly gross. If I was pouring out my heart to my husband and he responded with AI slop, I don't know if I could ever forgive him. Call me old fashioned, but I think you shouldn't outsource your fucking relationship to AI, and there is no excuse for it.

QUESTION: i (22m) need advice because of a fight with my partner (23m)

hey reddit, need some advice. earlier my partner and i were having a flirty conversation. kaso, biglang he said na he was small. and since he really isn't, i mentioned that based on my experience he’s “ranked second” compared to others in terms of dick size and that he was the best sex i've ever had. i was trying to compliment him and reassure him about his size because he said he felt insecure.

instead, he got upset, said it turned him off, and felt hurt. i really meant to make him feel good, but obviously it didn’t land that way. 

what else i could do about this situation? i know i have to apologize for wording stuff incorrectly and work on my communication skills, but if u guys know any other ways i can improve, just let me know :'D

================================================================================

QUESTION: My Boyfriend Wants Space (20F, 22M)

Hi, I, 20F am having issues trying to understand my 22M boyfriend. This is LDR, and we have a timezone difference of over 12 hours. My first ever real relationship too, though not his, and this has been going on for about a year now. In the beginning, he chased after me a lot and we used to, despite the time zone difference, call almost any time of the day that we are free for at least 3 hours. Now, after almost a year, we barely call every 4-5 days, and when we do its almost always only an hour, as he is busy trying to figure things out for his future education/career along with juggling taking care of his family. This, along with the time zone difference, has not been very easy for us. However, I feel like we already do not talk as much as we have before in the past, and he never starts the conversations anymore. Every time I question him whether or not this relationship is something he wants to do now, he still says yes but he just is busy/wants space when he is tired. (However he always will have time to repost) I have also been trying my best to involve myself in other things and hobbies to distract myself, but to me, no matter how much school work and social life I have, I still constantly think about him and I want to be able to talk to him every single day as we used to. And this time really pissed me off, as I haven’t talked to him in over a month, when I did not start the conversation. I just keep reminding myself of what we are working towards in the future, but how he used to treat me in the past keeps popping up in my mind. I keep getting the feeling that to him, the chase is over, and he has already done everything fun in the relationship, theres no need for it anymore. I have brought up how much the silence bothers me, but every time he apologizes for it he just makes me feel bad about him being busy and tired all the time. I just feel like such a neglected and clingy girlfriend right now. I have tried to get a reaction out of him in the past by blocking him, but it seems like even that doesn’t guarantee a reaction. Are we really that incompatible and I have to break up with him because of this?

ANSWER: not talking for over a MONTH should be a bit of a redder flag for you. I say you part ways for now. this sounds like it’s taking a great toll on both of you for different reasons and maybe a break is the solution here. you two are living completely separate lives twelve hours apart. I’ve been in this situation (albeit a bit less extreme) but in his shoes, and I can tell you that deep down, he wants to focus on his own life, he just doesn’t want to acknowledge that because it would mean losing a safety net (each other). it’s a complicated situation but the answer is simple, albeit quite painful.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I'm (23F) trying to make sense of why my boyfriend (22M) avoided posting me — what could be behind this behavior?

I (23F) and my boyfriend (22M) have been together for a year. Early on, we spoke about posting each other. I said I don’t care about daily posts, but on special days such as birthdays and anniversaries, I’d appreciate a story post. He agreed and never said it made him uncomfortable.

The night before my birthday, we were joking about which pictures he should post, and he even told me he wouldn’t use any “crusty” ones. So at that point, I had every reason to believe he was planning to post me.

On my birthday, he came by, gave me roses and chocolate, spent time with me, then left. Later, I checked his socials and there was nothing. So I called and asked him why he didn’t post me when he gave me the impression that he would. He replied, “Oh, which social media platform do you want me to post you on?” I said, “Instagram is fine.” The whole day went by and he still posted nothing.

For context: two years ago, before we dated, he posted a girl he was messing around with on Valentine’s Day. Mind you, she didn’t even have to ask him to post her. So him not posting me felt weird, considering the fact that I asked him to post me, plus I’m his girlfriend.

The next day after my birthday, I brought it up calmly and asked him why he didn’t post me. He replied that he “didn’t see the necessity to do so” because he had already come over, given me flowers, and said happy birthday. He also said he doesn’t really post people on their birthdays. But when I brought up the girl from two years ago, he said he didn’t think about it back then and just posted her without any thought behind it, and that he also chose not to post me without any thought behind it. When I asked why he gave me the false impression that he would post me, he said, “You already thanked me for the gifts I brought you, so I didn’t see the need to still post you.”

At this point, I honestly don’t know if I’m overreacting or if he’s not giving me the real reason. I told him I’m struggling to trust his answer because it doesn’t add up. How can he post a girl he was messing around with for two weeks but not post me, his girlfriend of 12 months?

ANSWER: The fact that he made comments alluding to posting for you and agreed to when you asked, but then didn't follow through on his word is what would bother me the most. If he doesn't post people for their bday that's fine (though you should be able to make an exception for your partner), but then why lie about it? I think there's something sus going on, like a girl he likes is following him and he wants to appear single.

QUESTION: How can I [21M] tell my girlfriend [20F] that I desperately need more space?

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for coming up to a year now, both of us being at university. Since we started dating, the longest we have had apart from eachother is no more than a couple days with her always being at mine every day.

I’ve brought it up to her a few times about how I want more personal space but no matter how many times I say it nothing happens. Her place isn’t a very nice environment to be in and she never feels that comfortable anywhere but with me.

Being with her is amazing and I love her so much but it can be very exhausting 24/7 and I have recently started to be unhappy around her and am feeling very suffocated.

I want to save this relationship but I also want to have my own life, I feel I can’t do anything or go anywhere without her having a problem with it and getting annoyed I’m not spending the time with her

How can I speak to her about it and for something to actually happen?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Boyfriend (19M) isn't putting in as much effort as me (18F) into our relationship.

CONTEXT

1. I don't want to hear that because we're teenagers that we're not meant to last or it's a starter relationship

2. I'll provide context before my question

3. Pardon my grammar and flow Im extremely frantic and desperate on how to fix this!

My boyfriend (19M) and I (18F) have been together for almost 2 years but have know each other for nearly 3. As we are young, we were each others first everything. First relationship, first kiss, first date, literally everything. 

For a 19 year old he is an extremely rare find. Goes out partying and enjoys raves/clubs just like me and when we're not doing that stuff together he respects me and I trust him. He's extremely smart, leaving school with straight A's and now studies Engineering. He has always treated me well and given me the world. He's everything I've ever wanted. 

However, recently I feel like our relationship is fizzling out. I am understanding and I respect he has an extremely busy schedule. He attends university 5 days a week, works a part time job, and plays football. But here's the thing (or two things)...

So do I. Im also in university, working a part time job and compete competitively in swimming but I always give him as much time as possible. I don't feel Im receiving the same level of effort back. The second thing is he's second year at uni and I've been in a relationship with him since he was in school. It's the exact same schedule as last year in terms of time in university during the day and it's still uni, work and football. But the effort has taken a drastic fall. He still treats me with respect and love but I get maybe a text every 2 hours and our conversations are so boring. can't even have a conversation at all because every reply comes an hour later. I see him once a week when I used to see him maybe 3 times a week last year. It's not the time together that matters, but I do feel like less of a priority. I understand but it still really hurts and I miss when he put me first. He put me first last year and still completed and passed first year with no resits and over 80% in all his exams so why now am I less important. His football games are Friday nights. Thursday nights used to be the only night we were both free. He has training on Mondays and Wednesdays, and I have training on Tuesdays and Fridays. So he used to stay at mine and we'd go to uni together on Friday mornings. But now he says cause he has to wake up early on Friday morning when he's at mine he's too tired to play his games? For reference I live an hour away from uni while he lives 30 mins away. It feels like he's telling me Im not worth it. Even on weekends, we work Saturdays and Sundays so if he stays over one of us has to leave in the morning early. We are very limited on our time together from our busy schedules. I understand that I was still in high school last year so my days were 9am until 3pm Monday to Friday so there was more time but now he's 9am til 4pm and Im mixed in times (10am to 5pm most days sometimes even finishing at 6pm). Then we have work or sports after wards. I know it's difficult. However, I put my everything into texting him, suggesting we play video games on call on Thursday nights instead of him staying over. Im trying to accommodate to him. He is not trying for me. 

It's extremely difficult for me but I've started matching his energy. It feels toxic but I need him to realise how bad it feels to have no effort and become 4th choice to everything in life. I love him so much. I've loved him since I was 16 and I've never felt like I do for anyone but him. And I know him, he's my best friend so I know he loves me. We went to his cousins wedding last month and he kept saying he couldn't wait for it to be us. I don't want us to end but his lack of effort hurts. I have brought it up to him and he kinda just apologised (genuinely not passively) but chopped it up to being busy. WE HAVE THE SAME SCHEDULE but I try so hard. Im continuing to show him how isolating and hurtful it is by matching his energy and effort. It's hard but I feel like it's the only way for him to understand how I feel.

I'm also extremely anxious about his lack in effort being linked to my change in appearance. When he met me I was in the middle of an eating disorder and dropped weight continuously throughout our relationship. Until February 2025, when I began recovery. Since then my recovery was successful but I have put on more weight than I intended too and feel extremely insecure about it. I'm anxious about it and if it'll make him leave. It's gotten to the point where I'm slowly relapsing because that sick part in my mind is telling me if I'm skinny again he'll start making me feel wanted again. He's never given me a reason to believe this and has continuously said I'm beautiful and don't need to lose weight again and he'd rather I was healthy than slowly kill myself like he feared I was when I was sick. It's all so stressful and on top of my uni work, job and sport. I don't want to stress about my relationship that was so perfect until a few weeks ago. I really want the old us back.

So Im asking. Is the relationship actually fizzling out or is it just all in my mind?

ANSWER: Relationships that survive do so by adapting to the changes the participants go through in their lives. The earlier you start the more changes you'll have to go through. College tends to be busier than high school. Depending on what kind of careers/jobs you both manage to get, times could get busier still in the future. If you're starting to relapse into an eating disorder you should obviously get some help with that so it doesn't get out of control. But the time you each have to devote to this relationship is going to shift and evolve with each year of college, again when you start working, and then probably for the rest of the time you're together. Nothing stays the same, every part of your life will always be in a state of flux. This is the human condition.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Me (32F) and partner (34M): He wants us to rush our son (6M) to a workmate’s kid’s birthday right after school, but I feel our son’s needs are being ignored

Me (32F) and my husband (34M). Husband prioritising a workmate’s kid’s birthday over our own child’s needs, am I being unreasonable?

For context, our son (6M) needs help with transitions and usually only eats properly at home. After school he’s hungry, dysregulated, and needs a predictable routine to avoid meltdowns.

My husband’s work friend invited us to their kid’s informal birthday party. It’s on a school day at 3:30pm, which is exactly when I get home with the kids. We’re also the only invited guests.

I told my husband that I’d need to get home first, feed the kids, and give our son time to settle before going anywhere. Rushing him straight to a party hungry and overstimulated is a guaranteed meltdown (this kid barely eats breakfast and lunch at school).

I suggested the timing should have been factored in. I’m not pulling my kid out of school nor doing the impossible to be socially pressured into an informal party. The party could easily be shifted by an hour or another day since we’re the only ones attending. My husband got upset and said I was being difficult, and now he’s angry with me for not agreeing to go immediately after school.

I feel like our child’s needs weren’t respected at all, and I don’t want to be the one to initiate a conversation because I didn’t do anything wrong. This birthday is also one of a string of events that his workmate has guilt tripped him and my family by association. And the pattern is starting to get exhausting.

Partner thinks I’m letting him down and I never make sacrifices for him. Is my request unreasonable? How do I handle this without backing down from what our son actually needs

ANSWER: Who the fuck has a birthday party for their kid on a week day at 330???

QUESTION: Is there hope (21M) (20F)

So me(21M) and my gf(20M) have been together for almost 3 years and in the last few months we were both pretty stressed out and we had some conflicts. Also year ago we've had a huge fight about me hiding things from her specifically that a female friend of mine (who is basically a dude with the way shes acting) spends a lot of time in our dorm room and we can't get rid of her. So because of previous things where she was suspicious of her when she found this out we were on the verge of but somehow didn't break up. But the thing is from that moment on she lost all the trust in our relationship. So a month ago we've had some issues and she initiated the talk about us breaking up, not now but in a few weeks when the finals are over because it would be too stressful to combine those two. We said that it ain't final and that we will see how things play out. Fast forward a few weeks and she's mad at me that I didn't tell her about one time that my friend invited some girls at our dorm. I did nothing about them being there, nothing even remotely close to infidelity or anything they were just there and I didn't tell her. I understand her point of view because how would I feel if she didnt tell me something like that. But she decided to give me another chance and now this week we "broke up" and reunited twice which is crazy. We have no courage to truly break up because we still love each other a lot. But she can't trust me and I'm very scared that I'll mess up or that she'll find out about something I forgot to tell her happened and she's gonna dump me. I love her so much and I dont know how I'd live without her and she also loves me but I'm scared that it's only the matter of time before we split. I can't imagine my life without her because she is my best friend and the person I love the most, but I can't go to just being friends, not with her. So after deciding not to break up I still feel like I'm doing her unjust? Is there a chance for me to become better bf. Most of our problems stem from me not noticing some little things that bother her or me not telling her something which in turn leads to fights.

ANSWER: There is always hope.


But do you really want this?

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I 26f move on in my relationship with my boyfriend 24m?

I posted about things between us a bit before. There was cheating, dishonesty, homelessness, all over a period of about a year. We’ve stayed together and we’re in a much better place now. He’s sweet to me, tells me I’m beautiful all the time. He cooks for me, he cleans, is much more responsible with finances and work. There’s no other women anymore and he takes the time to reassure me if I ask for it. 

But it’s hard for me to move on from all the pain. Everything that happened made me feel so pathetic, and like I was less than. I can’t get it out of my head that I’m not truly what he wants, and he’s just with me out of connivence. Every time there’s a girl I know he’d be attracted to I wanna crawl into a hole because I know I’m his eyes I’ll never be her. Whenever he tells me I’m pretty it doesn’t feel good it feels like he’s doing it out of pity. When he touches me, I don’t feel desired I feel like a hole. When he says he loves me I don’t believe him. I feel like he just says it because he thinks he’s supposed to. He puts in the effort now, but how do I know if it’s real or just to keep me around? How do I actually trust him? 

And please if the only advice you have is to break up with him, I don’t need it. I understand where you guys are coming from with that and I appreciate the advice either way. But it’s not what I’m asking, and I always leave just feeling more confused.

ANSWER: The thing is, you can’t force yourself to be okay about things. That’s why cheating is such a hard line deal breaker. It’s not just about the action, but everything it makes you question after. Truth is there is no easy route or quick fix. Maybe don’t try and make something work that isn’t meant too

================================================================================

QUESTION: Break-up but not the end, 18M AND 19F, what to expect?

Me 18M and my GF 19F, recently broke up, in the past she had a long distance relationship of 4 years and like a week after they broke up we started talking, granted, in the beginning she asked me for some time alone to organize her thoughts, like 5 months, but in the end we ended up becoming a couple 1 month after talking, almost 2.
We recently celebrated the 10 months.
2 months ago we talked and she said she had been feeling bad because she was thinking about that time alone she needed and to find herself in solitude and to know herself, in the end we both cried but ahe decided that she didnt want to lose me and wanted to keep the relationship going.
4 days ago we broke up, she said she really needed this time to be alone and discover herself, but that she loved me and the relationship wasnt the problem.
Yesterday we talked and she still had my face id, a number in her password in my honor, my photos in her favorites and even the WhatsApp wallpaper being a photo a kiss of us. She said that she loved me, missed me and she had a tiny hope that we would go back, but she couldntbring herself to ask me to wait for her because she didnt want to hurt me and was unsure about how much time she needed.
But in the end of the conversation, she looked at me with those beautiful eyes of her and that gaze that told she was in love with me and asked me to wait for her.
I called her in the night because i was feeling anxious and alone and she told me to not wait and because she didnt know what would happen and she didnt even know what she wanted, but i ended up telling her: "Im going to wait for you, i love you with all my heart, I know you want to wait for you, but you are unaure and dont know what you want, but i know deep down you do, im gonna give you your time and i will take this leap of faith because i love you and i will wait" She told she loved me, thank you for everything and for understanding her, that it really meant a lot for her.
The thing is: I know she still loves me, misses me, the relationship wasnt the problem, and she deeps down really wants to go back in a future but is unsure; But even with that im feeling anxious all the time, close people to me told me its normal and with time it goes away, but i really feel bad as hell. I miss her so much and Im willing to wait but im scared that we never go back because the relationship was beautiful.
I guess that what i really need is some advice on how to manage myself and if someone went trough the same experience i need to know how much time it took or what to expect or really any comfort. I really want to wait but the future scares me a lot. 💔

ANSWER: You won’t want to hear this, but just let it go. You’re so young and you don’t need to be waiting around for anyone that isn’t sure of you, for whatever reason. She’s valid for needing time alone, but you shouldn’t hold out hope for her to come back just because you like her. I know how it feels right now, but please trust me, it will not feel so horrible forever. Try to put yourself in the mindset of yourself looking back 10 years from now. You’ll be proud later if you choose yourself now.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I’ve (22m) got attachment issues with my gf (22f)

Well it kidna reads as it is. I (22m) get really stressed when my girlfriend of over a year ( 22f ) goes out mainly on a night out or in the evening with friends. Normally I do come along to most things but occasionally or when we had a rough patch ( only happened the once ). I will get a tight chest and just panic, she’s very pretty and I’d say out of my league and while I know and do honestly believe she’d never do anything I still hate the idea of other guys trying to hit on her or trying there luck or something.
When she goes out I have to try to fight the urge to message every 5 minutes, or look at her location etc. I’ll try distract my self with hobbies and games and all sorts but it doesn’t work for me. I’m still just as stressed and it’s hard. Her communication isn’t the best even when I’ve had it under control which I don’t think helps but I’m aware it’s 90%+ my side. 
I’m not really sure what to do I want to sort it but I don’t know how, I don’t want to loss her due to these issues and what to be better for me to as it’s a horrible feeling. I can’t really afford therapy or anything. 

- idk if it helps but when I was a kid I was heavily bullied and would spend most of my primary ( for the none brits it’s 4-11) with 1 friend max and they’d change regularly as they came and left the school. So mainly some issues from that ig ?

QUESTION: 20F 20M

So last night he said he’d call me, and I was excited and waiting. But he ended up falling asleep, and I didn’t get the call. I understand he was tired, and I’m not mad about that. What hurt was not being told right away like, “I’m really sleepy, can we talk tomorrow?” That would’ve helped me feel okay. Tho we did talk about it over the phone last night. I'm just quite bothered that when I try expressing how it made me feel he automically started being hard on himself. He said he felt useless. I know he didn’t mean to hurt me, but this keeps happening sometimes when I share my feelings, he spirals into guilt, and I end up comforting him instead of feeling heard. I’ve been working on not being so hard on myself, and I wish he’d try to do the same. I don’t think he’s a bad partner at all. I just feel like I’m the only one growing emotionally sometimes. I want to create a gentle “rule” together, like if one of us is overwhelmed, we just say hey I'm not okay I'll explain later or can we take a few?.” or when one of us is tired we say it and talk about it the next day, and when we do talk we try not to be dry to each other? Any advice on how to bring this up in a way that feels honest, not attacking? Or how to stop feeling guilty for expressing hurt? I don't like attacking my partner at all I never have. But it's been adding another layer I have to carry. Now I don't mind comforting him when he's going thru stuff. It's like I'm hurt and trying to make him feel better and I can't help but feel he probably feels the same way but I don't wanna assume either. I would rlly like your advice please and reassurance anything.  
We created one rule tho that if he doesn't call me within a minute or two to call him

what could be a gentle rule I can try creating with him?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [25M] caught feelings for the person [25F] I'm casually dating. How can I move forward?

After being single for two years, I was introduced to casual dating. I had one serious relationship in the past and wasn't ready for love again. Three months ago, I met "Jenny", who had been casually dating for four years. I didn't fully understand how it worked, but since she was experienced, I let her take the lead.

We clicked right away, and after a few dates, I started wanting exclusivity. I brought it up, but Jenny told me she enjoys the freedom of casual dating and couldn’t see herself in an exclusive relationship for at least a few years. I didn’t push it, but secretly hoped she’d change her mind.

Things changed when she invited me out and left with another guy. I was hurt but I couldn't blame her, she had been clear about her expectations from the start. I realized I needed to meet new people. However, since then, we’ve spent nearly every day together with little physical intimacy. I grew more attached to her but still eventually planned a date with someone else. When I told Jenny, she broke down, saying she had developed feelings for me, which she didn’t expect. Still, she couldn’t see herself in an exclusive relationship and encouraged me to still go out on my date and meet new people.

She said she doesn’t mind if I sleep with other people, but she’s scared of me getting emotionally close to someone else. On my end, the thought of her sleeping with others bothers me, and we disagree on how much to communicate about it, she wants honesty, but I’d rather not know.

Is there a way for both of us to be happy in this dynamic, or should we just cut ties?

ANSWER: There's a difference between casually dating and going out with someone and then leaving with someone else. That's extremely disrespectful and almost psychotic. 

This is not a relationship that you're interested in or likely able to handle. She's been clear about where she is at, you now need to realize that this isn't the relationship for you and move on.

It shows your history of what you’ve searched and then below there’s a you may like and it shows two things in red. I went on my husbands Tik tok and on the you may like there’s things such as “girls in crop tops” “pajama pants” “Hornsby relief” things of that sort. But on the search history nothing of that. I checked my tik tok and my search history is pretty aligned with my “you may like” it has pretty much the same things. Could he be deleting search history?

QUESTION: When is the right time to talk about "traumas"? (M30 and M40 as per rule 1)

I (m30) am seeing someone (m40) and we may have something serious in the future ahead.

I grew up with a lot of traumas during my childhood and they are still affecting my present. I am the sort of guy who bottles up emotions about the fear of abandonment, low self esteem, need for physical contact etc. to not reflect it to the other person. It is extremely difficult sometimes for me to hinder my feelings and pretend okay, but I am used to acting up.

Thinking about future, I am so torn. I think I need to bring it up at some point, but when is the right time? Before things get serious might look too dramatic, after things get serious would make me feel anxious because I am worried he'd be distant after that, and some months after the relationship might probably the best option but then again I don't want him to feel like he is with the wrong person after I let my guard down all the way by that point.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (26M) partner (43M) and I can’t decide on if we should invite my parents to our wedding. How do we figure this out?


My partner (43M) and I (26M) are planning on getting married towards the end of 2026. It’s a very small thing, just some family and a couple friends. 


His family (mom/sister) are very supportive of us so they were the first added to our invite list, We’re at around 20 people so far. We agreed to not talk about my family until very last because we can’t agree on whether or not they should be invited. 



I grew up hearing the old “gay people are going to hell” all the time from my family, and when I came out my mom told me “I don’t want to see you holding hands or kissing a man because that would make me uncomfortable”. I was 19 when she told me that and it’s something that still hurts. 


They’re somewhat okay with me being gay, and they try their best to accept my partner too but I can tell they still don’t like it. We just act like good friends when we’re around them to make it easier. 



My partners been bugging me about inviting them and last night I finally told him about what my mom said. He said that it was a long time ago and I should invite them just because they’re family. I don’t want to invite them at all because I don’t want to dilute my relationship at my own wedding. 


He understands where I’m coming from, but I can tell he’s still upset about it. Not mad, just upset because he wants my relationship with my family to be better while I don’t really care about my family. 


I’m honestly thinking about just inviting them to make my partner happy, but I don’t want that to take away from our wedding. Whenever we talk about it, it just ends with me crying and him not getting why I’m so against inviting them. 



(Edit- the whole age gap thing; We talked about it before we started dating, he’s never made me uncomfortable over the past 3 years, he’s amazing… which is why I’m marrying him. This has literally been our only issue).

ANSWER: I don't love him pressuring you and I really don't care for the age gap

================================================================================

QUESTION: I'm (M22) thinking about moving away from my long term situationship (M26). Advise?

I (m22) have been in a situationship with T (m26) for almost 3 years now. We met when I was 19yrs old, and he was 23. At first it was supposed to be a FWB situation, but we both caught feelings and decided to enter a relationship. 

About three months in is the first time I found out he was cheating. Still on hookup apps, hitting up people in our local queer community. I unfortunately was VERY naive and blamed it on myself. I was angry though, and hurt. I spent everyday basically tracking his moves and even catfishing him at some point. I personally couldn't tell you when he was or was not cheating on me. We would have all out brawls simply cause I'd beg him to be mine. Even to this day, he still talks to other men.

Here's my problem, we have been on and off for a very long time, but living together for about a year and a half. We've gotten used to each other, we both settled for whatever was going on. I would try my hardest to try to make him want me, and he would still go behind my back cause he "needs the validation" whether I'm giving him enough attention or not. 

Last week, everything came to a head and kinda exploded. He has a habit of kicking me out then begging me to come back like an hour later, but this time he asked me to move out and I have been staying with a friend on and off, only really coming back to see my cats. He is so determined that he can be "better". He wants us to be together, but I simply don't know if I can trust him or not. He has been going to therapy, and he said he is wiling to communicate when he feels like he needs other men, but I simply don't think I should have to hear about how he is struggling to not cheat on me.

My friend, (F45), has offered me this fully finished shed in her backyard. My brother already rents out one of her rooms, and she is willing to let me stay as long as I need to get on my feet. 

I don't know if I should just take the opportunity, or if I should give him another chance...

What is your advise here?

ANSWER: You were only 19 when you started seeing this man, he got to you before you ever had the chance to see what a healthy adult relationship felt like. You deserve to know that. You WILL NOT find it with this man.

Move and block him. He will never stop trying to reel you back in and he will never actually treat you well.

We always spend a lot of time together and im very happy in my relationship, i typically spend 3 nights a week at his house , (he just bought a house!) and he spends a little less at mine but moral of the story is we see eachother pretty much every day. i spent a 3-  day weekend at his house because we had a party to go to, then following plans. i left friday night to his house, and was gone until monday. i was supposed to come home monday afternoon/evening and thats what i told my parents but my boyfriend came up on a last minute facebook marketplace deal 1 hour away and i decided i would go with him . we ended up coming back home at 9:30-10 pm. i had work the next day at 10 am but i always make it to work regardless if im at his house or not. anyways while we were on the markeplace outing, my dad called me asking me where i was and i told him what we were doing. he was mad. didnt talk or hear from them until i was on my way home with my boyfriend , he hands me his phone while he’s driving and its a text from my mom: “i don’t appreciate (my name) being gone for 3 days. she needs to take care of herself and she needs to be home more. im not happy etc etc.” it was more than that but thats all i can remember. he apologized but my mom said its MY fault so im wondering why is she texting HIM? and when we get back to his house for me to get my stuff my parents are blowing my phone up telling me i need to get home immediately and then my dad calls me and asks me where im at once again!!! for context i have my location shared with both of them and told them i was going to be going home. then after all of that he still continues to text my boyfriend “is (my name) coming home”  even though i told him i was on my way back to my house… i was frustrated because my boyfriend is an overthinker and all of this makes it seem like the blame is on him. fast forward the next day, we dont hang out . i go to work, come home, clean my room , shower, go to bed. For context my bf usually comes over after i get off of work but he felt like he couldnt because of the stuff that was going on with my parents. Today (wednesday) he said he was gonna come over and he was at work, i had a 4 hour shift today and i started my period this morning and it was  very intolerable so i decided to call the shift off. i ended up taking a 2 hour nap because i had a migraine that came with it. i woke up to my boyfriend calling me saying that my mom once again texted him “see what i was saying. (my name) cant function after spending 3 days with you. “ thats all i remember she texted my boyfriend but i know there was more. Now he said he feels like hes not gonna come over again today because of this. i feel like hes not wrong for being anxious about this whole thing but im thinking that shes butting in too much???  its causing extreme anxiety and stress between all of us and she acts like i dont take care of myself . i always go to work regardless if im with him or not, i take showers at his home, he takes care of me . im not quite sure what to tell my parents to make them understand how me and my boyfriend feel. And when i did say something my mom said “oh well your bf is grown he should be able to deal with it” . and for context my parents have a very good relationship with my bf and are close.

ANSWER: >And when i did say something my mom said “oh well your bf is grown he should be able to deal with it” .


Tell your mom that you're grown, you should be able to look after yourself lol.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My girlfriend is tired of being harassed by her parents. (F19) (M50 - F50) What should she do?

My girlfriend, CC (F19), is tired of being harassed by her parents, GG (M50) and JJ (F50), for doing what she want with her hair.

CC started to wear braids in her hair a few weeks ago and she likes doing different things with her hair. As her bf, I love what she does to her hair and will support her decisions on that. Her parents on the other hand don't like. They are constantly telling her to get the braids out of her hair and now they think she is disrespecting them.

Background:
CC and I have been dating for a while now and ever sense we have, CC's parents have always been harassing her on her appearances, social life, and relationships. CC has ADHD and is an introvert, so she struggles a bit on pushing back on her parents. GG is her father and didn't really need to step into this but he was dragged in by JJ. 

JJ is her CC' mom and as most people now that mother's and daughters are too a like (if you know what I mean). JJ wants CC to be this perfect being that does everything right. You might even say JJ is a controlling person. 
End background:

JJ thinks that CC is damaging her hair because she has braids in. JJ tells her to remove constantly throughout the day and it has been a long week. JJ then brings in GG to talk to her and make her take the braids out. It didn't go well and to this day she still has them in. And just to make it clear, the braids were done right by a professional and maintaining her hair has no issues.

CC is to the point where she is ready to pack up and leave(she doesn't because of financials). I have offered to step in and help end this but that was not my place.

My only question to you reddit is what should she do in this situation?

P.S. If I missed something important or you need more details comment below and I'll try to give more details. I'll try to get JJ and GG's full story(not guaranteed).

ANSWER: She needs to choose between obeying her parents and moving out of their house.  She has to do one, or she won't live in peace.  There are no magical answers here.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Improving communication in marriage 32F and 38m

I 32F have been with my husband 38M for 15 years, married for 11. We have 2 kids, one of which is autistic and VERY emotionally draining. We’ve had A LOT of ups and downs in our relationship. We’ve done marriage counseling twice. 

Honestly over the years I stopped putting up a fight and voicing my opinions because I didn’t want to deal with the argument it would lead to. (It always leads to an argument.) He has no friends so he literally just follows me everywhere. He has to know my location. He goes through my phone. He comes and talks to me while I’m in the bathroom, while I’m showering. He invites himself when I go out with my friends or has to know everything we talked about. I’ve started going to the gym for my mental and physical health and he always has a snide comment about how it’s a waste of money or I could be home with him instead. Trust me. I know how this sounds. 

I’ve had an absolutely horrible year. Between my autistic son emotionally draining me. My other son acting out because he sees the other one do it. I was laid off from my job through my fault of my own. I lost my one pet of 14 years and my other one if 5 years within 2 weeks of eachother. I feel like I just can’t take anymore. 

He always undermines me when trying to discipline the kids. The other day I was trying to discipline our youngest and he said to me “why don’t you just shut up and go back to sleep and let me handle this”. I’ve been depressed since losing my one pet and have just been keeping to myself. He then makes it about himself “God. Why do you hate me so much. I didn’t do anything to you.” I finally found a new job. Haven’t started yet. It’s a pay cut but it’s still 35k more than he makes. Yet he is pressuring me to find a second job when he works from home everyday. Since I’ve been laid off, I’ve seen first hand how he works from home. Yes he does go on his computer and actually work. But he spends a good portion of the time sitting on the couch watching horror movies all day. However since he works from home he does get the kids ready for school. Picks them up. And takes them to Dr. appts. 

Given all the above I feel like I’m at my witz end and about to breakdown. I feel like I have no say in our relationship. Yet I don’t know how to confront him because all he will do is make the comments such as above. Or he will start yelling at me which then causes our autistic son to start crying and having a melt down. 

Anyone have any advice on ways to communicate but avoiding the yelling and above? 

I’ve honestly thought about separating a few times but with our kids, I think that would traumatize him more. Also i know for a fact im not easy to be with and he puts up a lot with me.

================================================================================

QUESTION: What does it say when my (23F) boyfriend (22M) speaks badly about other girls?

I (23F) was seeing this guy (22M) for 6 months. It was pretty serious, but he ended it after we had a fight. Then we barely talked to each other for a year and now we have been seeing each other again and it is pretty serious again. 

However, in the past year he had been seeing this girl that he was actually still sleeping with while we already started dating again. When this other girl found out, she informed me about it. She said their connection was purely sexual and she would take her distance. However, she also mentioned some things she noticed and lies he might have told. I really like this guy and he is saying different things to me, so I don't really know what to believe. 

She told me that he has slept with over 10 women in just 4 months. In addition, he said: "When I talk to women, it is just for sex. Or I just don't talk to women at all. Although it is different when I think someone can be my wife." Which is imo quite a mean thing to say... like women are only good for sex unless she becomes your wife?? Of course, I am hoping that I am the wifey material, but I don't know if him saying this, means anything about how he sees me or will treat me in the future? And let's not forget he told me and her both different stories... he says he is sorry and she never meant anything serious to him... but what if he's just playing games again...
Hope you can help!! Can a guy actually treat other women shitty but one really good?!?!

ANSWER: He thinks women are only good for being a warm hole 

You are a woman

================================================================================

QUESTION: My bf (M26) has not been respecting my (F23) boundaries in bed, how do I go forward?

Recently, I have had a lot of life stressors with school and my career, so I know my sexual drive has not been at its highest. But every night, my bf wants to initiate sex even if I really dont feel like it. I will tell him no and provide my reasoning, but 9 times out of 10 he continues by rubbing and grabbing my body until I am turned on. This makes me feel dirty afterwards and like I was only used for his satisfaction because he said he was horny. then he always says, "see you liked it after all." The 1/10 times he does listen to my "no" he gets really quite towards me and wont even cuddle or really acknowledge me, which makes me feel guilty for even turning him down in the first place. It feels like a domino effect because the more he persists with this, the less I feel like having sex with him in general.

additionally, we used to get a little more into rough sex and choking but it makes me feel worse about myself. especially since i have read studies about the dangers of choking (which i shared with him btw!!), i dont want that anymore. Yet of course he persist with this too.

I feel good about myself and my body since I eat good and workout often, but I even asked him the other night "if in 20 years I am exactly the way I am right now, would you still like me?" and he said "well if i was fat when we first met, you wouldnt have dated me sooo..." and this made me feel even worse because I have actually lost weight since we started dating so it is not like I am "fat", but even if I was I would still like to think that my partner would love me.

overall, I just dont feel heard, seen, or truly loved (even though he tells me all the time). I feel like he doesnt mean to disregard me this way, I just dont know how I should go forward...

ANSWER: This is sexual assault, and you need to get out - ASAP.

If you have nowhere to go contact social services and ask them for the number for the domestic violence shelter.

As a very longtime member of the kink community, I want you to hear me loud and clear when I say - 

His kink is non-consensual non-consent.
He is not playing.
He is dangerous.

Get out, do not tell him you are getting out, get out without leaving a note, block him in every possible manner -
 and leave no forwarding method of contacting you whatsoever.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My girlfriend (20F) and I (20m) have been no contact for over a week.

My girlfriend (long-distance) has been feeling “off” for a few months. She’s told me I haven’t been attentive enough over the summer and that she doesn’t feel loved. She also says that on the other hand she has been feeling off but it is unrelated to our relationship. Two weeks, during a phone call, she said she’s not sure what to do but would never end things on the spot. I said I want to work on it and that I’ll make a conscious effort, but I also need her to be receptive, since she’s been getting upset at little things lately.

Now a week ago she asked for a week of no contact to process things and focus on herself. I tried to check in at the end of the week, but she said she thinks space is still best and that she wants to talk in person when we are both home from school (Sunday). I’m anxious because:
	•	she removed our most recent instagram photo this week
	•	She’s asking for space but also wants an in-person conversation.
	•	I’m worried she’s preparing to break up with me.

On the contrary she said we can still snap which in the grand scheme doesn’t mean much and she is currently driving across the country to get home. 

We agreed to talk Sunday when she’s home. I’m trying to respect her space but I’m really anxious about what she’ll say. How would you aim to make  this work? Does it seem like the end of it? I’m just unsure what this means for us.

================================================================================

QUESTION: What can I do to feel better about my relationship? 30F, 30M

My girl 30F and I 30M, have been dating for almost three months. There's a lot of things that I like about her, she's a hard worker, she cares about me, and treats me like a king, she's always giving me gifts, and she supports me with my projects. In the other side there are things that I don't like, she's really vain, talks bad behind the backs of others, I've seen her lie way to often and manipulate others, she cares way to much about money, she's constantly rushing our relationship (she wants me to move with her already) and also treats her children (8M and 4F) a bit rough. So in one side I have everything I've been looking for in a relationship, before her I thought that was impossible, but, in the other side I have many things that I usually avoid and make me feel uncomfortable. I can't get the courage to talk to her about what I feel, because I feel that she's like that is her personality.
I need advice

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (M21) ex-boyfriend (M-20) is moving on. How do I deal with this?

This is just a vent. Feel free to ignore it. 

Sunday before last, I broke up with my boyfriend of 11 months, I'll be calling him S in this post. In that 11 months, S and I held hands twice, hugged once, and never kissed or did anything more than that. Along with that, we just have a lot of issues going on in our lives that led up to my decision to break up with him. We've been friends for 7 years, and I've been in love with him for 4 of those, but I just couldn't subject myself to any more of the pain that came with being with him. 

I've been coping, sort of. We still live together due to both of us being in bad financial situations, and it's been mostly fine besides me occasionally getting really frustrated with him a lot easier than before. 

Here comes the big issue though. The Tuesday after we broke up, his ex-boyfriend (I'll be calling him C) from about 3 years ago reached out to S again. C moved away a while ago and joined the military, so they haven't been in touch. However, C is back in town and wants to reconnect. S and C are meeting up with a few of C's friends from high school in about half an hour. 

I'm freaking out. S dressed very nicely, put on cologne, did his hair super neat, the whole nine yards. He looks amazing, honestly. I really think that he and C will be getting back together. They've been texting non-stop. I don't know how I'm supposed to feel. I broke up with S, I feel like I have no right to be so tore up over this. 

I guess what I'm trying to get advice on is just asking how to get over this? Or at least how to not worry myself into a panic attack tonight.

ANSWER: I think living together going through this is a big part of what is not helping you get through this because you have to be there to see the detachment right in your face. You must figure out a way to separate from seeing him everyday at home or this will tear you up pretty bad. You have to go somewhere or he does, sooner rather than later preferably

So I F32 and my partner NB30 have been together for almost 6 year friends for 10+ years. We've talked about getting married often and its something we would want in the future. The past years I have been struggling a lot with my health both fysical as mental and everything is starting to look bright and good in the future. And I want to ask them to marry me.

 My father gave me my grandmas wedding band. A gold ring with my grandparents name inscripted in it. They never knew my grandpartments since they died before we met. I was very close with them and treasure the ring a lot. Would it be appropriate to propose with that ring?

 I would still have to ask my dad how he feels about it but also wanted to get some advice about it first. What do you think?

ANSWER: Ask yourself this question... would your partner appreciate the sentiment? Did they ever mention what kind of ring they wanted? Take all that into consideration. 

Knowing they never knew your grandparents it may not mean as much to them as it does to you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 36M boyfriend asked me 37F to take care of cat in new relationship

I, 37F, have been dating my boyfriend, 36M, for just over three months, two of which we've been exclusive for. The relationship itself is fine. I'm hopeful, but not positive it could turn into a long-term relationship.

Next week he is going out of town and he asked me to check on his cat a few times while he is away. He lives 20/25 min away so checking on her for even just 30 min will take over an hour each time. Previously when he would go out of town, his aunt would check on the cat. To my knowledge there is no reason she can't this time and we were not yet dating when he booked the trip.

In relationships, I tend to give more than I get (especially early on) so I'm trying to be cognizant of that. Honestly if it were reverse I wouldn't have asked him to check on my cats at this stage. I would do what I've done prior to him being in the picture. It also seemed more like he was assuming I would moreso than asking, which I didn't love. 

TLDR how do you handle favors early on in a relationship?

ANSWER: I don’t know the context in which he asked but as an outsider I think you’re reading too much into this. I see it as him trusting you with his pets and his home while he’s gone and seeing if you’d like to do this. You can just say you appreciate him asking but don’t have time during the week, could his aunt or pet sitter do it this time around?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (29M) girlfriend’s (24F) constant complaining is driving me insane.

My girlfriend and I have been together for quite a while now and even live with each other. I love her very much and I know she loves me as well. The one negative thing about her is how much she complains. She literally complains about anything and everything e v e r y d a y. 95% of what she complains about doesn’t even pertain to our relationship. I don’t even know how she finds the energy to complain this much. I used to try and give her my opinion and advice, but all that would do is cause her to complain more. Now when she complains I don’t say anything anymore because I just get annoyed. Then she complains about that.

Bad day at work? Complains.

Too many people around her? Complains.

Traffic when I’m in the car with her? Complains.

Minor conflict with her family? Complains.

Too hot or cold outside? Complains.

Sleeps past her alarm? Complains.

Chooses to not do anything all day? Complains about how she should’ve done something.

Wind blowing the wrong way? Complains.

Drops something? Complains.

Trips over her own foot? Complains.

Can’t hear her when she says something to me? Complains.

I could go on and on, but you get the point. I don’t even know what to do now. I’m tired of hearing her say how she’s sick of her life. I’m mentally exhausted. I feel myself just going insane. I obviously want it to work out and I’ve suggested therapy. She said she would, but hasn’t done anything yet.

Is there really anything I can do about this?

ANSWER: I don't think you are still as in love as you want to believe

================================================================================

QUESTION: My partner (NB 25) is upset with me for not telling them sooner about a short text convo I had (NB 24). Am I a poor communicator or is this something else?

This morning before I headed out for class, my partner and I had sex. When we were done, I checked my phone, and saw a message so I opened it. I was still laying in bed with them, so they saw it too. I didn't try to hide it, because there was nothing to hide. I gave them some context about it (A friend of a friend who looking to trade services for other goods like art or other things they need instead of $). Then I got up and started getting ready for class. I had an hour before I had to leave. 20 mins before I had to leave, they say to me, "So we're just not going to talk?" I was confused and asked them what they wanted to talk about. They start saying how it feels like I am hiding things from them and that they wish I told them sooner about this friend of a friend instead of having to find out right after sex. They said a lot of other things, one of them being how the thought of me getting rubbed up on by someone else was upsetting (one of friends services is massage.) I started to get really irritated w the whole thing, because I needed to leave for class and I told them I wish they let me know earlier when it was bothering them or just waited till I was free bc it was the worst time for the conversation. I also personally don't think it's necessary to talk about every little text convo I have unless it has to do with something that they might want to know, like if I had a session planned I would've told them about it. I don't know what to think of this, any thoughts? I could add some more context but I am in a rush sorry

ANSWER: "You should have told me that you have acquaintances"

Do I have the basic complaint correct?

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (22F) help my bf (25M) with not feeling religous guilt after sex?

Recently my boyfriend has been getting into christianity. This has caused some rift because he is essentially going through what many people who grew up in the church went through where you feel guilty about doing anything that is against the bible. I grew up Mormon, don't practice religion anymore, so I know exactly what he's going through.

Basically he REALLY wants to have sex and then we finally do and he gets a huge post nut clarity crash and feels guilty and immediately starts praying for forgiveness. I don't know how to navigate this because to me, you should absolutely not feel any guilt about having sex.

He told me that he's never felt so bad after having sex and he still wants to be with me, just not have sex. I don't know how to explain to him that he shouldn't be feeling like god is going to smite him for sex with his girlfriend.

ANSWER: Religious abuse is deep seeded and you cannot fix him with your love. He needs therapy.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How can I (18M) differentiate between girls (18F) simply being nice or flirting?

(I hope this sub is also suitable for dating advice and if it’s not, I will post this somewhere else👍)

This has occurred twice so far and I’ve gone 0/2… first instance was a girl being nice to me in school for a solid few months (assumed she was just a kind person and didn’t think much of it) and was later told by a friend of hers that she apparently used to liked me back then. And just recently, a girl that I had known for a while was unusually friendly to me and asked me stuff like that”if you had a gf, would you…”. A few days later I asked her on a date and she rejected me.

I really don’t want to: 
-Miss dating opportunities 
-Ruin a friendship with a girl by thinking that she’s into me

Do you guys have any experience of recommendations with this? Thank you in advance.

ANSWER: There's no way of telling tbh.


Some girls will flirt with you like crazy and then reject you. 


Whilst other girls won't flirt with you at all, but inside they're dying for you to ask them out. 


All you can really do is shoot your shot at the girls who you find attractive and accept that you might get rejected sometimes.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I think my (25f) boyfriend (27m) wants to break up with me

For a bit of context (also keep in mind English is not my first language). We’ve been together for little over a year now and I heard through someone else that he’s been saying that he doesn’t see a future with me because he “doesn’t know what I like”. Which I’d like to disagree with because even though he never asks me questions about anything deep, I’d like to think that when we hang out he takes the time to at least pay attention to what I share with him.

He has a very demanding job and usually when we talk it’s just him telling me about his day and all the craziness that happens. I’m a nanny, my kid is super easy so most times I don’t have anything to say to him about my day or what I do or don’t.

I’ve been trying to make conversation with him and ask him about sports and stuff here in the US since they’re different from the ones in my country, but I can’t get him to engage enough. 


How can I improve with our conversations? I’m honestly lost here.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (18M), confessed to my best friend (18F) and things aren't going well.

For a bit of context we were best friends for around 6 months. Really close, we shared our deepest thoughts only to each other. We saw each other basically every day. I started having feelings on her since around a month and a half, and it got to the point where I couldn't keep it anymore. I told her one night we were alone. She said she couldn't give an answer, but the tone showed rejection, which I dont mind as I told her that day that I really value and appreciate our friendship. She did assure me that we should still be really good friends. The worst part (and the one that is stressing me out) is the fear that our friendship won't come back. Its been almost a week and she has felt more distant, talks way less with me and more with others, and avoids looking at me to the point where people in our circle have asked me if anything is wrong. Will this get better as time goes on?

  
tldr: confessed to my best friend and things aren't going so well

ANSWER: Just act normal tbh. You've done nothing weird. If she's acting different, it's on her.


If people ask you why she's acting differently towards you just say you're not sure.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Is my (30F) fiancé (30M) starting to pull away from our relationship or is it in my head?

Edit: We talked last night. The conversation isn’t completely over but things are okay now. He is definitely going through a bout of depression like r/jadiejang said above and wanted to leave me out of it as a way to shield me. After I explained how all he was doing was pushing me away it click for him. It was very emotional for both of us so we didn’t really talk next steps but we’re going to be making a nice dinner together today and I plan on addressing it then.

Hi everyone I’d really appreciate some insight on this before it escalates. My fiancé and I have been together for nearly 6 years. He is the absolute love of my life. He proposed in June and we are supposed to start looking at venues this week. A few weeks ago I noticed he wasn’t as excited when I got home from work. I.e. he wouldn’t get up to greet me or would take his time to do so. I’d ask to play a board game or go out and he would say he was too tired. Then a few days ago he just left for work and didn’t even say goodbye. This is the first time this has ever happened. I brought it up to him and he just shrugged it off saying he was running late. In the past he’s always still run over for a quick goodbye even if he was running late. But then it happened again the next day and the one after that. Both times he shrugged it off as well. Last night I spent all evening crying, it just kind of hit me that this has been going on for a while and I didn’t realize. He did come to bed around 8 and held me for a while as I cried and then turned over to sleep. 

This morning we were leaving together and so he stood there waiting for me to kiss him but after he looked at me like I was I don’t know disgusting? Like it was the last thing he ever wanted to do. I started crying immediately and he just said he didn’t know why I was being like this. I understand that I’m more emotional than most but I don’t think I’m wrong here. This has NEVER happened. We always talk about our problems and try to meet a half way point we are both okay with. He’s completely shut down in this. Part of me wants to cancel our venue visits. Is this in my head? He was been struggling a lot with work but I just can’t seem to wrap my head around that leading to him acting this way. I’m going to try to have us sit down today but if anyone has any advice I’d really appreciate it.

ANSWER: Sounds like [the bell jar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Jar) descending (i.e. depression.) Sit him down next time you're both home and not doing anything important, and tell him you're officially postponing wedding planning until he gets evaluated for depression. If he pushes back, tell him you don't know how long you'll be able to live with someone who acts as if they no longer love you. Set some benchmarks: if his behavior hasn't changed by X time, or if he hasn't gotten evaluated and gotten treatment, you'll leave. With depression, you have to take the bull by the horns, bc it's too easy to sink into it and make it the new normal.

Other possibilities: he's panicking bc of the proposal and doesn't know why or how to deal with it. If that's it, you need couple's counseling.

Or maybe he's just suddenly fallen out of love with you and doesn't know why or how to deal with it. But it's unlikely that this has happened without one of the above two options also being true.

Or maybe he's done something bad and doesn't know how to tell you: cheating, losing his job bc of a mistake he made, etc.

In any of these cases, you'll need to push for communication, and be firm and impose consequences if you don't get it. Remember: moving out and taking breaks don't have to be permanent, but you do have to be ready to make them permanent if he doesn't come through.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [M22] think should break up with my girlfriend [F21] but don't know if I should?

I love my girlfriend she's an amazing person but I can't help but think the relationship should end.

 We've been dating for 10 months now and we've had our ups and downs. There's been times where I was an emotional mess and needed support and she was there for me and vice versa. But it's becoming to much for me.

Lately she's had a hard time with school having to go an extra semester instead of graduate on time which sucks but her parents pay for it. It won't negatively effect her but she's cried and acted like the world was ending for a whole week. I can only care so much about the problem before I just get annoyed with it. 

She constantly says no friends but does have people in her life I (and most people) would consider her friends. I don't have a ton of friends but I have some and we hang out at the same time every week. This has become a huge problem for her and anytime I mention hanging out with them she gets really sad and cold. She's even cried about me going to hang out with my friends on the same time every week. It makes me feel like a horrible person leaving her like that but I know I shouldn't have to put up with that.  It's gotten to the point lately where me mentioning hanging out with them has made her go from a good mood to having her whole night ruined and by extension ruining mine.

I've tried having little parties or double dates so she can meet my friends but every time I do she doesn't enjoy it and complains. She'll say "she's overstimulated" or "she's tired" or "wants to cancel"  and almost every time I tell her that we can leave or cancel but she refuses and just sulks. When we leave she'll complain about everything and it's just exhausting hearing it.


She has her own mental health problems like cutting and idealizing suicide. I told her I love her and support her but I have trauma with suicide so her just talking about it all the time in a positive light hurts me deeply. Lately she has tried to get better about it but sometimes she'll slip up.

I tried to have a very personal talk with her about a lot of these issues a few days ago. It ended with her crying begging me not to leave promising she'll change (she's seeing a therapist and psychiatrist) and the whole time I literally didn't feel anything. I should've felt relief or sad or even frustrated but I just stared at the ceiling numb. 

After our talk she's very distant and seemingly cold. The best way I can describe it is her using corporate speak very professional sounding with no emotion in anything. She wouldn't keep a conversation going, would only let me hold her hand if I asked, etc. When I mentioned to her how I felt how she was acting she only responded with "I'm sorry you feel that way" and would refuse to talk anymore about it.

Last night she refused to cuddle or any affection but about 20 minutes later hugged me as tight as she could and cried. I tried asking her what's wrong and wanting to talk about it but she once again wouldn't no matter how hard I pushed. 

I won't pretend I'm perfect and there's been times I pissed her off or accidentally hurt her but I literally don't know what else I can do. I don't want to break up with her but it seems more like my only option each day.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Married 6 years. Im 37m and my wife 38f

FYI, this is gonna be long. My wife (38) and I (37) are going through it. Have been for a few years but we really came to a tipping point where I have had enough of not feeling loved,  appreciated,  or needed and was just about ready to walk out the door a few months ago. Thats not what I want and I have been trying to do some soul searching and even began reading some relationship books, starting with the five love languages. Hers is acts of service and mine is physical touch so herein lies thw first issue. I communicate affection and love through hugging, kissing, cuddling, holding hands, sex, Etc and she shows those emotions through doing things like taking care of the shopping, doing the laundry, on the way in the dishwasher, etc. To me these are just mundane adulting responsibilities. Things that I do as well and while I hope they're appreciated, that's not how I express love. She says that I'm only focused on my needs and not on hers. I can say that I definitely try to focus on hers but also, not to put too far out of a point on it but I feel like I've built up a love deficit as it were over the years. 
        I've always tried to show her my love through those physical acts and since it's just all I've ever known, I assumed that if you love someone that's naturally how they would want to act towards you as well but she says that it doesn't come naturally to her and it doesn't even occur to her to show affection in that way which absolutely baffles me. I understand now that it's just a difference in love language but I keep trying to get closer and express love, not only in the way that I naturally do but also through acts of service for her and I feel like they always go unappreciated and frankly unacknowledged. There's little acts of service that I do every single day that get no appreciation and then I'm told that I don't do enough and I'm not hearing her when that's literally all I'm trying to do. It feels like the more I try, the more I get pushed away physically and emotionally. She doesn't even have a desire to have sex which just makes me feel lower than dirt. I try my best to make myself physically attractive to her and she says it has nothing to do with that but how can I feel like it's not personal when we used to do it far more often than we do now? 
        We're kind of in marriage counseling, and by that I mean that we had our intake appointment and then they fired that therapist and then once we were finally placed with another therapist a few weeks after, she was in an accident and so we haven't even met her yet. We did meet with the director of the therapy place last week and had a session with him which was good but of course he's not our permanent therapist. I keep trying to communicate with her and make progress and it's to the point where she is saying that I'm talking about it everyday and hyper focused on it and it's just draining for her. How can I not be hyper focused on what seems like my marriage falling apart? How can I not be hyper focused on trying to get out of this affection deficit that has been built up over the last several years? 
        What makes it worse is that frankly I would rather be at work than at home at this point which I hate feeling like. I'm lucky that I work with people that I've known for years and that feel like family. We laugh and joke around and I actually get compliments from people which happens 0% of the time at home. What Hurts the Most though is that the one person on the planet that I want to share everything with, be affectionate with, intimate with, loving with, I feel more alone when I'm with her than I do when I'm actually alone.

ANSWER: Break up with them and find another person so you’re not alone 👍.  I know easier said than done but this ain’t changing. This isn’t a fix it thingy.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 27M has a crush on 26F school friend. Is it too late to ask her out ?

Im 27M and I've a school friend crush. While in school I never approached her or anyone else in particular because of my very poor financial background. I thought I would be a creep to ask her when I couldn't even buy a fucking lolly for her. Being born in low-middle class Indian Hindu society where love is treated as taboo made it all difficult for me at that time.

Currently my situation is changed now, I'm now earning really well worked hard for my job that I dreamed of. Bought an apartment and am financially independent.

We were already in connect on insta where I asked her number which she gave without hesitation. Calls happened and we talked for an hour sharing our school memories.  
We connected again around 2-3 times a month through call sharing our backgrounds, vulnerabilities, relationship status, job etc. While talking she was very open and had a good converstation each time.

She even said that her family sometimes forces her for arrange marriage (common in india) but she just ignores the topic. She even described she is not doing great in job and doesn't even have a boyfriend. She has discussed this thrice over our past calls.

The problem is that she never initiates a call. She never texts or call by her own will. Every time she messages / calls only when I ask her. I even asked once is she wants to meet and she showed genuine interest that she'll definitely meet once she arrives her home town.

I genuinely like her a lot. But I'm not sure she's getting any of my hints. I'm not sure if I should ask her out when we meet or just back off.  
Can anyone give me some suggestion? Thanks in advance!

================================================================================

QUESTION: Advice on going no-contact with friend (29F) that I (30m) am deeply in love with?

Several years ago, I developed pretty deep feelings for one of my closest friends. I ended up telling her and after she didn't end up sharing those feelings, I told her I needed to separate myself from her for a while and went no-contact temporarily. 

I actually ended up doing pretty well during this time, my mental and physical health improved and I really felt amazing. I started getting over her and had a few flings in between. After a year or so she reached out and we ended up talking again on a very limited, infrequent basis. 

Fast forward to the beginning of this year, she breaks up with her long time boyfriend and we start to talk and hang a lot more - back to the same amount we did when we were kids. But it's killing me inside. 

I know this makes me a terrible, abysmal friend and that's weighed heavily on me for the last few months, but I just can't keep going on like I am and I need to be selfish. I get a rush of happiness when I get to see her, then a pit in my stomach when she brings up her most recent date. Reasonably, I know I should be fine hearing this, I just can't. I've tried therapy and drugs and seeing other people, but nothing works. Does anyone have any advice in this situation?

ANSWER: You can’t handle being just friends, which is completely fine. Go no contact and don’t reconnect

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend (25M) just broke up with me (23F) and I feel like maybe I’m meant to be alone.

I (23F) just went through a breakup after 8 months of relationship and I’m trying to understand everything instead of blaming him or myself completely. I could really use some perspective.

My boyfriend (25M) broke up with me because he felt like he didn’t really know me.
Some reasons he gave:
	•	I don’t have friends and he wanted to meet people from my side.
	•	I never allowed him to come to my flat.
	•	I sometimes lie about small things and then later come clean.
	•	We seem incompatible in a lot of ways.
	•	His love language is physical touch, mine is acts of service.

On my side of things:
I have ADHD, social anxiety, and depression. Maintaining relationships is extremely hard for me, whether romantic or friendships. It’s not that I don’t care, I genuinely do, but I mentally shut down, isolate, and disconnect even from people I love.

I moved to Bangalore to escape my family. I don’t stay in touch with old friends; not because I don’t want to, but because I freeze and avoid. I’m also scared of being judged for my living situation, so I never let him visit my flat and I’m working on it, searching for new flats. I know he wouldn’t judge, but my insecurity screams otherwise.

And I hate this part about myself: sometimes I lie first because panic/trauma response kicks in, and then later I confess because guilt eats me alive. It comes from a childhood of being scared to tell the truth to my parents.

He’s an extrovert, very close with his family and friends, loves quality time and physical affection. I need alone time after social interaction to decompress, which made him feel unwanted. We tried, but it felt like we were speaking different emotional languages.

Now he says we’re just incompatible and he can’t continue like this.
And honestly… I get it.

And it’s not like I didn’t care about this relationship, I cared a lot. He overthinks everything and is extremely sensitive emotionally, and I spent so much time reassuring him and trying to make him feel secure. I never felt tired of doing that for him. I actually quit my job right before we started dating, and I didn’t even try to get another one immediately because I wanted to give my 100% to this relationship. Every time the topic of work came up, he would say that if I got busy with a job, I wouldn’t have time for him. I was never tired of him, I just feel like everyone always gets tired of me. That hurts the most.

ANSWER: If you honestly feel like the problem is you then why not consult a counselor or therapist so that you can work on yourself?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Boyfriend (21M) talks about what other women are wearing a lot. I'm 19F and it's my first time in a relationship. How do I talk to him about this?

It's my first time in a relationship and ive been dating this man for about 2 and a half months now and he will often mention how revealing other women's clothes are, such as comments like "come on woman put those things away they're almost falling out" and "why are their so many woman with massive tits today", I was slightly uncomfortable especially as I know he has a past with cheating (he's my friends ex, she said she forgave him and doesn't think he's the same now as it happened a long time ago so I gave him a chance) but thought they may just be statements. I'm autistic so I often say things that can be misinterpreted but are just observations so thought he may be the same but the other day on call he said there's been so many women wearing revealing clothing and it's making him horny and that he wants me with him right now (I'm back in my home town for summer), this comment rang alarm bells for me and definitely needs to be addressed in my opinion but I'm not sure how to proceed. I'm very bad with confrontation, please give me advice.

ANSWER: So this dude cheated on your friend and you decided you wanted a piece of that?

"I find the way you talk about women's bodies is disrespectful and judgemental"

And then he'll dismiss your feelings and get angry because he is not a good person

QUESTION: Feeling stuck 23F and 25F

I went against my guy and ignored my truth. Now I’m stuck. What now?

I apologize for the lengthy post but I need women to help me out. I 23 F and my now wife 25 F, met when I was 19 and she was 21. I had a history of always needing to be in a relationship, so jumped from one to another. I met her while I was in active addiction she was too. Both of us are sober now I have 3.5 years she has 2 years. The first 2 years were great, we settled into our routine, we lived together at this point. Spring of 2024 we had found out she was going to have to be on a work assignment that was 2 months away from home. It was definitely a bummer and hard to stomach and looking back I wasn’t mature enough to handle it because I didn’t know how to take care of myself. Anyway, we talked about marriage a lot. I told her I wanted to wait to do anything until she got home. Well fast forward to 3 weeks before she was leaving we got into a fight about something dumb and she got upset and said “well I’m proposing tomorrow in-front of all our family so I’ll just cancel and tell them we are in a fight” i immediately felt awful and took responsibility for ruining the proposal even though I wasn’t ready for that step and I expressed it. So the next day I had to pretend it was all surprise. I didn’t even want to get out of bed, i felt so anxious cause I knew it didn’t feel right. Everyone was so excited so I thought “this must be good, I should be happy” . Fast forward she comes home and wants to start looking to buy a house. I told her countless times, I was not financially comfortable to buy a house and wasn’t ready, I thought she was listening to me but she just told me you’ll never be ready and it was just anxiety. I made myself believe that against my gut. And guess what now we own the house. As of April 2025. I was still feeling like this wedding wasn’t a good idea, and I couldn’t speak up for myself. Not once I was so scared (still am) of how people would perceive me. So we got married. And now I feel awful. Cause I feel stuck. I ignored my own body, my truth, I have no identity outside of this relationship, I have a partner who cannot communicate without internalizing everything even my own feelings. And I have no idea what to do. I have so much love for her. I know I need to be honest but I don’t want to hurt her. I did this to myself. And I don’t know what I want next. Support, comments, criticism welcomed. Thanks.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Long-Term, Long-Distance Relationship Issue with no solution (M23 & F23)?

I never post on reddit and I'm sure this is going to get back to him but I really just want advice overall because neither of us know how to proceed and im beyond caring. For context me and my boyfriend have been dating for 7 years, since we were 16 years old. He was my second ever boyfriend and I was his maybe 2 or 3 girlfriend. 

As juniors in highschool we kinda decided once we go to college, long distance wasn;t our thing and we would breakup, but obviously easier said than done. I ended up choosing the same college as him to stay together with both of us being pretty close to home. Throughout college though I studied abroad twice, with both times being pretty bad for the relationship. Moreso for him. We aren't good with communicating often and I knew that was something I could be better at. 

Fast forward to a year ago when we graduated college. I moved to a larger city about 3 hours away for an internhsip which turned into a job after 4 months. Now, 10 months after I moved, he's telling me that the long distance is getting to him and he had a breakdown about it. He said the only way he can get past this is if he feels less attached to the relationship so it doesn't weigh on him as much and he's scared how he'll feel after 6 months (which is when his lease ends and we plan on trying to move in together). He says when I was gone the other times it was really hard for him and he would end up isolating himself form his friends and whatnot. He is having some doubts, but he doesn't want to break up because it won't solve missing me. 

For reference, the long distance obviously isn't fun, but it's not something that weighs this heavy on me. I see us as 2 separate people who don't complete each other but make each other better and i know that eventually we'll be together and it will be just a dot of time in the rest of our lives together. I did a lot of work to not have my life and happiness and mood rely completely on my relationship. He says I'm in the miniority about this not affecting me as much. I never once doubted our relationship. 

After this revelation I don't really know how to feel. I know long distance is a lot harder for him, but I feel like this comes with the territory of dating in our most formidable years (high school, to college, to starting our careers). I feel like it's more unrealistic to think that we would stay together physically through every big transition in this time. 

On top of that, I now have to live with the fact that only one of us has full faith in this relationship and its not him. And despite him saying he doesn't want to break up, there doesn't seem to be a solution except get over it? We could try and visit more, but he said the weekends every 2 weeks doesn't really help and it's also hard. I think its unfair to complain about distance and then say trying to see each other more is hard, but he says this was a hardship he never wanted to sign up for in the first place, but he doesn't want to end our relationship.

Is 7 years sunk cost? Is there even a solution here that isn't get over it or breakup? I don't think either of us even know where to go from here.

QUESTION: 21F need advice regarding 21M ?

so today I saw my boyfriend's old chats from 2 years ago, flirting with his gm"girl friend". it was a one time thing. never happened again from what I saw in the entire chat. they don't even talk anymore. but I'm very hurt because we were in to 6 months of our relationship and he was so nice to me during that time and he still is. but it seriously broke me when I saw this chat even though it's very old and when i confronted him, hes talking as if it nothing serious and that I'm just being too much about it. Do you personally think what he did was wrong or right?

ANSWER: 6 months in and he's flirting with someone else? That's not nothing. He's acting dismissive bc he got caught and doesn't want to deal with it

================================================================================

QUESTION: Guy in friend group (33M) is in love with me (26F)

Every week I go out with my group of friends and we do something. I’ve been friends with these people for a few months ever since I moved to the area and was looking for new friends. I am currently dating with the intention of finding someone to settle down with and my guy friend knows this (let’s call him Adam). Adam texts me nonstop with a lot of trauma dumping and asking me super personal questions that only a therapist would ask and proceeds to give me his answer which is incredibly detailed and gives me more information about him than I ever would want to know. To be honest, I enjoy the overall friend group but I find Adam’s presence creepy and overbearing. He recently posted a two page love poem about me that makes me incredibly uncomfortable and seems to pose the argument that I am closed off and he needs to solve the puzzle that is me. 

I don’t want to sit anywhere near this man, he is creeping me the F out. I don’t want to leave the friend group, how do I send this guy the message that I do not reciprocate his feelings and am not interested in being friends or anything else? He’s literally entering stalker territory. He talks about how he loves to stare at me. Please help. If anyone wants the poem, I will DM it to you. It’s super creepy and he posted it to our city’s Discord.

ANSWER: Oh my God, that sounds super creepy and extremely inappropriate. I would definitely involve some of your friends from the group and hope that they throw him to the street. That is unacceptable behavior and I would definitely encourage you to never meet this man again.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I distance myself (26F) and my Mom (55F)?

I’m going to try to TDLR it as much as I can because I’m sure as you all know, families are messy. 

Let me sum it up as quickly as I can: My sister (24F) accused me of heinous things, cut me out of her life and made my whole family not talk about me to her. She has done this 5 years ago too for the same reason, except now she has a child. 

My parents hid this from me for days (I live in another state so I was asking why I was blocked to my family members) and then finally after a week, my mom told me. I got pissed at everyone who hid it from me saying “it wasn’t their information to tell”. 

So for the last 8-9 months, I’ve told everyone to keep us separate and I don’t want to hear about my sister and I don’t want her to hear about me. Mostly everyone has been respectful, but all my relationships has suffered since this. So my mom always asks “how can our relationship be better” and I always tell her, I feel uncomfortable by how close you are with my sister. She say, well your relationship is separate. And I feel like it doesn’t matter, but after talking with 3rd parties, they told me that I shouldn’t be mad at her for still being in contact and supporting my sister. 

The 3rd party also told me that it’s okay to ask for space and not talk for a while. I just don’t know what to do because I feel like everytime I see a text that says “how did your week go” from my mom, I roll my eyes because it just seems so small-talky and I hate it. But at the same time, I feel like I don’t want to share how I feel to her. I don’t feel comfortable. And during our text conversations, she always says “I don’t know how to improve our relationship” out of no where. 

It makes me mad because it’s like she’s not
happy with how our relationship is but I barely feel comfortable with where we are. I’m still angry, and bitter especially because my whole childhood, my sister was always catered towards. My mom (allegedly) took out a 20k loan at some point to help her. And I’ve never asked for anything, but yet even just talking to me isn’t enough for her. 

I’m really close to just saying, I need space and I don’t want to talk for a while but I know I’ll hurt her immensely. I just need some advice on how to proceed with protecting my peace but also not shoving everyone out and making more people pissed off.

ANSWER: She accused me of sexual abuse when I was younger. By her approximation, she was 4 and I was 6. I have zero memory of this, and she accused me of this 5 years ago too. We DID message about this 5 years ago. I told her that “I don’t remember/don’t have the details of what happened, but apologized if there were any actions that hurt her.” I also told her I was sexually abused as a child, by a trusted adult, and she said that she felt better about it because of the trope of “sexually abused children go on to do the same behavior because they think it’s normal”. 

So yeah, it’s really embarrassing to post and talk about so please, don’t make me feel anxiety for sharing.

QUESTION: My (27F) boyfriend (31M) got me something I told him I did not want for Christmas. Does he not care?

My (27F) boyfriend (31M) and I have been together for 2 years, and he thinks he knows best and doesn’t actually listen to what I have to say. With Christmas coming up, I have been giving him a lot of Christmas ideas but he has kept telling me that he doesn’t need any ideas because he knows what he is getting me. Anyways, I was cleaning his apartment for him the other day and came across a Tiffany bracelet that he had hinted towards a few months back. When he hinted at the bracelet, I told him that it was cute but that I would not want it, and that I would never wear it, but he kept saying that he thinks I should have something like that to wear although I disagreed with him. I know I should be grateful that he spent that kind of money on me, but it’s only going to sit in a box and never be worn. I wish he would have listened to my Christmas suggestions and gotten me something I wanted, or something I could put to use. Also, I know I shouldn’t have looked, I didn’t intentionally go looking for it.

ANSWER: Remember how you wrote that he doesn't listen to you?

You already know the answer

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (25F) am having thoughts about leaving my bf (25M) but we share a child.

For a bit of context, me and my bf have been together since highschool, 7 years to be exact. I can say our relationship is something i’ve cherished from day 1, which resulted in me basically being blind to everything he did/does because i feel like he’s my soulmate.. we have never cheated on each other but our issues were always emotional battles or arguments because he talks to me like he’s my Dad or my Owner lol. 

we broke things off in 2021 because i wanted to move out of my moms house & live alone; he wanted me to move with him and do 50/50 but i put my foot down that time & did what was best for me..came back together in 2022 and i immediately got pregnant so i left my apartment high and dry to move somewhere together with him.. 

fast forward to now, we have a 2 year old & everything has been good until a year ago, 2024 when he messaged one of my family members - my close and only aunt,  asking about videos of her private parts. sure enough, i found out & completely got brainwashed as he told me he didnt feel like himself when he did it & that the devil got the best of him… yea

few days after, i just didnt feel right. i felt betrayed & that i couldn’t trust him & he literally told me “ if you cant trust me then you dont need to be sleeping at (our address)” im like wow, you ruined the trust & now i feel like the bad guy. of course i swallowed my sadness & moved on bc i work from home, have a child here and i cant just move away like that. 

fast forward to present time, we had a small issue regarding me coming back from a vacation with a small cold. we both knew he would get sick but when he did boy was i the worse person in the world, he basically told me to fuck off bc he was sick and i was better which i was just trying to be a mother/girlfriend and nurture him back to his best. which was a slap in the damn face. we didnt speak a couple days after that and i had time to think on it.. i would rather be alone then feeling sad then getting treated like the problem. 

after 3 days of silence in our home, i completely lost it after one day of him being locked in the bedroom all day and not coming out ONCE to help me with our son. we argued and he told me he didnt help because i was acting like a clown…? so one morning i texted him while he we were both working and said i want to move out before the year is over. he then texted back saying oh i love you, please dont leave me, i need you. rushed back home mid shift, turned off the circuit box so i couldnt do my work at home . started literally bawling crying which i have never seen in the 7 years of us dating..called his mom over and she tries to sit down telling me how he is a good man, good dad and provides for us. mind you, we are 50/50, i stay home all day and night working and caring for an autistic child while he lives his best life and comes home to play video games all day. 

he then tells her all kinds of stuff like why my name isnt on the lease- saying i had no job when i have always had a job. told her my credit is messed up which this is only bc i left my apartment for him and our kid. meanwhile he is the golden child hiding all his dirt from her. so after about 45 minutes of listening to him yell and her tell me how much of a God he is i just got up and left, walked around the complex for a bit to get my mind right. 

We did make amends that night but i cant help but think everyday how im so unhappy, trapped in this house all day and not really anything to myself, for myself. i really just want to get my own place, work a job i want to work, not one that i work to make sure everyone around me is happy, and just do my own thing. i dont want to keep him from his kid or anything but i want to be happy.. i have nothing here and threatened to be kicked out is something i never want to experience again. 

im not sure how to go about this, i do still have so much love for him but i want to be alone.

ANSWER: This dude is abusive, a shitty partner, and a deadbeat dad all in one. LEAVE HIM. STOP allowing him to manipulate you into feeling like you have to stay. You can do better on your own!

================================================================================

QUESTION: I(18F) am receiving mixed signals from girl(18F) I've seen casually for a month now

I(18F) matched with a girl(18TF) on a dating app a little over a month ago. On both our profiles we had "looking for casual relationship, open to serious." Our conversations have been deep and exciting, and obviously, I think she's really cool! We went on a date and ended up going back to her dorm and having sex(which she initiated.)

 It was... different than I'm used to? She's really affectionate, gives praise, holds eye contact, and actually provides aftercare, which I am just not used to, especially outside of an established relationship. I left pretty quickly after we finished but it was a nice experience that had me feeling pretty giddy all week. That was two weeks ago. 
This weekend we hung out, and that ended up happening AGAIN. After, we cuddled and watched a movie. She kept playing with my hair and kissing my forehead and even let me wear her shirt for a couple of hours. It all felt really intimate, like I've never experienced anything close to it outside of a long term relationship. Emotionally, I feel all messed up, though. First of all, obviously, I've been kind of slut-shaming myself for doing that on the first AND second date when we aren't together. Plus I have visible hickeys on my neck that I have to cover up every morning... 

What's most confusing is that we only really talk every other day. Genuinely, We'll talk on a Monday, a Wednesday, a Friday, but never a Wednesday and then a Thursday, and so on. We initiate conversations pretty equally, but I'm not used to talking so infrequently with someone I've been so intimate with, I guess? My biggest fear is that she sees me as friends with benefits or a hookup, which is something I'm super not into because of past experiences, and I had on my profile that I wanted a relationship. I know I should probably just talk to her, but I am terrified of pushing her away, and I feel like she's been less interested this week. I initiated our conversation yesterday, even though she always wakes up earlier than me, which is seriously messing with my head. 

I''m just trying (unsuccessfully, I guess) not to think about it and spiral. I've already lost sleep over it(but I'm a lifelong insomnia so that's not out of the ordinary.) I'm not sure if it's just too early to be thinking about more, like maybe I sound neurotic and obsessed. How tf do I figure out what she actually wants without seeming immature or needy?? Does it sound like she's using me? How long are  you supposed to wait before discussing a relationship?..

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (18M) Feel Like My Physical Attraction to Partner (18F) is Gone

I’ve been dating a girl who I fell head over heels for for about 7 months. She went a manageable distance for college, while I’m still a senior in high school (4.5 hours). It has been difficult to see her, since she is a softball player, but I was always super excited to see her coming home for a weekend or would be overjoyed when my parents let me go up there for a weekend, too.

Sometime about 2 or 3 weeks ago, I began to use porn again. Porn was an addiction I had and struggled with vastly, and about 2 months into our relationship, I quit using it. However, I began to use it again for about a weeklong period, and the guilt ate me alive. I told her about it and she graciously forgave me, saying if there was any issue, we could get through it together (something I always said to her).

But ever since then, I’ve felt nervous/anxious every time I thought about her, and not really in a good way; I’ve been feeling guilty, almost like there is an unaddressed problem. Last night, we had the biggest roadblock in our relationship, and we both decided to take a break until both of us felt comfortable to talk again. I didn’t know what was wrong with me, or what I could have done to her. She’s simply the most amazing person and I didn’t want to admit that my feelings have changed.

I believe that the big issue is I am no longer physically attracted to her. I feel an emptiness when we had sex, and before, when I longed for his physical touch, now when she touches me I almost get uncomfortable, and I don’t want to kiss her or lay next to her.

Is it possible to get that physical spark back that I once had? Are we just done with the honeymoon phase? Or is the relationship done for good? I’m having a really hard time sorting out my feelings.

Maybe I just don’t want to admit that it’s over, because she is such a good person, but I seriously don’t know what to do. Two months ago, I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, and now, I don’t even know if we are going to make it though the day. 

Any help is much appreciated.

TL;DR - My long distance girlfriend came home and I feel as if I don’t have the physical connection I used to. Is our relationship over?

QUESTION: my(24F) fiancé(23M) didn’t react

my(24F) fiancé (23M) and i have been together for over a year (we just got engaged over the weekend). just to preface - he is the healthiest most loving man i have ever been with. he knows how to make me feel seen, loved, and is so communicative when we have problems. anyways, we haven’t ever been intimate but this morning on facetime i decided to show him myself in my bra. before i did, i asked him if he would be comfortable if i showed him, and he said he would only be comfortable if i was too, so i decided to show him. but he didn’t really react much. now it’s not that i was expecting him to jump off the walls and start jacking off but i at least wanted some sort of validation or compliments. i kinda felt awkward so i covered myself up after and he said he was gonna go back to sleep. when he woke back up we talked and i asked him if he didn’t like what i showed him or if he thought it was underwhelming. but he said no and he started to feel really bad and started apologizing and saying that he just didn’t wanna react in a way that made me feel objectified or in a way that would make me think that that’s what he cares about. i do believe him but at the same time i jsut feel like that was a big decision for me and i just felt kinda stupid after. he then just said “i’m gonna take a shower.” and then left without saying anything else so i ended it. i’m not necessarily mad about him not reacting but im kinda upset that even after i told him how i felt vulnerable he didn’t really give me the resssjrance j needed and decided to leave after i expressed my feelings. how do i go about this?

ANSWER: I think he genuinely didn't know how to react and just kind of froze up. With you both being virgins, he probably has almost no experience expressing sexual desire to a partner, and was not sure what was appropriate or what was too much (this is doubly true if you two are religious). Something that may be helpful is to not worry too much about what happened that time, and focus more on what you want to happen in future experiences. Let him know that the next time you two do something like that, you would like to hear positive feedback. Feel free to give him some guidelines. It could be anything from, "You are so beautiful" to "I wish I was there right now to kiss you" to things that are a lot more overtly sexual than that.

If you try to have this conversation and he is not receptive to it, then that might be a reason to worry about whether you two are on the same page about what you are looking for in terms of intimacy/sexuality in your future marriage. It's awkward to have these conversations sometimes, but talking about it now is how you help make sure that this is the right person to commit yourself to.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Am I (26F) being too controlling to my bf(27M)?

So it’s been 3 years we’ve been dating, and previously he used have frequent night outs, now its like once a month or two, in someone’s bday or celebrations or for a drink.

We don’t live together and he texts/updates me whenever he’s out with his friends etc. Yesterday he had a bday party, and told me he’ll live by 11pm, I asked him if I can call we talked and I slept, later in the morning i saw his texts and he came home at 12:30 am. 

And that didn’t sit well with me cause it’s dangerous outside and we’ve had this discussion of coming home on time, 2 months before too when he came home late, and well before that as well. So I was angry, cause I’d prefer a partner to be home on time - be responsible and careful and accountable. He kept apologizing and saying sorry but this just feels like a repeated cycle and he didn’t say it wont happen again, so it will. We didn’t argue, cause well I am angry and he was apologizing, but he also said “it was a bday celebration and he has to think of his friends, cant just leave when everyone’s there plus he left as soon as possible and didn’t go clubbing etc, all his friends did”

And when he’s out with his friends, he smokes and drinks (i hate both), and i could say he has had a rough day, but no he meets his friends frequently cause he doesn’t do 9-5 job (which is fine cause he does business & just cause i do 9-5, not gonna force him). 

Now i think he doesn’t have boundaries when it comes to his friends but also not cause he can’t say no, he doesn’t want to. And I overthink, always need to go with a plan kinda person think that in future what if this becomes the norm, i would hate to have a partner who comes home late and always out with his friends.

I feel like this is also a trauma from my parents relationship, in short my dad prioritizes his friends more than my mom or family, always out with his friends drinking smoking and does whatever his friends say basically ruining our lives and def doesn’t love my mom doesn’t care(should’ve gotten divorced but chose to traumatize us) 

Anyway ik a partner should not be controlling, i am not my bf’s mom, there has to be compromise. He is very loyal, and when I hear my friends partners story, i do believe my bf is a good person tho. Help me see the light am i being too controlling? 

Also i feel like i have resentment stored? My bf doesn’t have high EQ and I basically have to tell him to how to love me or care for me or like this is what i need, and he does whatever i say but it’s tiring teaching all the time and when he cannot see for himself when a need has to be fulfilled. He cannot plan or do surprises even on my bdays, he gets me expensive stuff and says or complains it was expensive. I plan and pay sorta like 50-50 whereas he spends on his friends or buying branded stuff. I just do things after noticing or without the need to be asked (idk older daughter things ig) I just want to be taken care of honestly, want to be loved in my love language. Doesn’t call when he is with friends but I do when I am out, he’ll call when he’s alone at home. Stuff like this makes me question.

ANSWER: Yes... You are being controlling, throw exhausting on that list too...  I'd end things with you without breaking a sweat. Not even a question.

You don't live together, it doesn't matter when he returns home. Even if you did live together, he's allowed to stay out past midnight. He's not a kid, he's a fully grown adult.

This whole "be home on time" nonsense, is parenting him. Parents give their kids curfews, you're giving him a curfew. Shouldn't happen in the first place.

He rarely goes out with his friends anymore, maybe 1-2 times a month. That's nothing.

And a lot of nights, its a play by ear. Might say he is thinking of calling it early, sometimes it turns into a late night depending on how the night plays out. Either way, its still his decision to make for himself, not for you.

To sit there, tapping your feet angry like you have to be home on time even though I don't live with you... Is insane. He shouldn't have to provide you with a time in the first place.

The guy is out with his friends, enjoying himself... And you're ruining that.

Oh, but when he is with them he smokes and drinks, I hate when he does that... You're not his parent. If you don't like it, leave... Its common for people to smoke and drink when they go to parties, have you never been to one?

Trying to twist it too:

 it was a bday celebration and he has to think of his friends, cant just leave when everyone’s there plus he left as soon as possible and didn’t go clubbing etc, all his friends did
 Now i think he doesn’t have boundaries when it comes to his friends but also not cause he can’t say no

What boundaries? No boundaries with his friends are needed. If he is enjoying his time, let him enjoy his time ffs.

You just don't want him to have fun... That's what you are. Life draining.

Him hanging out with his friends, enjoying himself, not wanting to leave... To turn that into: You lack boundaries with your friends. Is wildly controlling.

Its you who lacks respect and consideration for his social life that he is enjoying. He doesn't want to go home yet, you're the one forcing him to go home otherwise you will be pissed. 

Compromising doesn't mean you call all the shots. Him texting you constantly when he is with friends is plenty compromise as is. I wouldn't even give into that.

I ignore my wife when I am with my friends, you don't need my play by play updates. Leave me to enjoy my friends in peace, I expect to be left alone. Same stuff I give to her too. Not expecting an update every 10 minutes from her, its exhausting. Go spend time with your friends and lost in the moment, its important.

Not going to tell her "times up! You must come home now. Its 11pm and past your curfew. Even though the party is just getting good, you had enough fun for tonight. Screw your friends. Send me a picture to prove to me you're at home in bed"

That's madly controlling.

He has been compromising for you, you just want to eat the whole cake and hold all the power.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [F25] Feel like my bf [M22] cheated. Even if he is telling truth about not cheating, still feeling betrayed by his actions. Can't trust him now..

Me and my bf are together for 1,5 years. We lived together for around 8 months and then transitioned to LDR.

Sorry in advance for a long text.   
  
During the LDR, our relationship was kinda shit after first two months. He was often angry, snapping at me, and distant. Communication was reduced to quick, 5-minute phone calls at the end of his day, only after all his friends and activities were done.  This lack of engagement led to the conflict. I mean he always choosing to hang out with friends instead of spending at least one night with me. even on his day off he would call me and in 5 minutes say he gotta go shower/eat/watch reels or somtehing else. Like literally anything. I was offended that i was the only one wanting to do something together (talk, watch smth, play games, ANYTHING)

Now this all led me to checking his followers (yeah insecurities too of course). Also the fact that he was alwyas critical about what i wear, the fact that i dont wear make up or cook wrong or clean wrong. One time, after noticing his usual following of models (which also makes me mad me but anyway) I saw that over a couple of days, he followed around 20 new, regular(!) women with private accounts. I immediately confronted him. Because how can you even find private accounts (later he admited he followed them from 'suggested' section)

He stonewalled me for several days, claiming he was "busy" and making me wait in distress. At the same time he was texting like nothing happened, updating me that he is eating or he is hanging outwith friends (WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR HIM TO ANSWER WHO THE FUCK ARE THOSE 20 WOMEN) When he finally spoke, he gave the first lie: "It was accidentally."

For the next month, every time I brought up the topic (because obviously I didn't believe the "accidentally"), he would get mad, claiming he "already explained everything."

When I finally broke up with him because i mean he can't even find a time to talk with me + this shit situation that i considered cheating , and you know, usually when you did not do something you are accused of you are running to prove them wrong, not avoiding it. So he begged for a call, begged for a chance claimed he loves me and im his biggest love.  i called and he still tried to lie again, repeating the "accidentally, but I'm sorry, i don't know how it happened i did not cheat or anything" line. Only after repeated questioning, he admitted it was not accidental but still claimed he "didn't know why " he did it.

And this behaviour continued, sometimes I would find some girls and he would say he doesn't know how he followed them, this time it was more like 1-3 girls in a 1-3 days. And one of them actually for some reason blocked me, but bf doesn't follow her anymore .

Only last night, after FOUR months of trying to get more details, he finally made these contradictory admissions He admitted that he was overwhelmed by the seriousness of our relationship (money, responsibilities, being young) and wanted a break, but didn't tell me because he was afraid of losing me since he sees me as special and he loves me. Which would sound normal, considering his age, alright, but what the hell it has to do with cheating.

He admitted that he was sending requests to those girls because he was thinking to hook up with them when I asked like 26273 time why he chose regular girls and not porn or models. (I am still extremely confused about how being "overwhelmed by commitment" logically leads to seeking casual sex, but all he says he was confused about life and future???)

Then he said he blocked this feeling and he did not even text them, he just looked and that's it.

Also he thought about escort but he did not "use" it.

  




Also there is a thing of him hiding me in insta, like he would hide my tag outside the photo or not tag at all (if we go with friends, he would tag them), not even not posting me, but I'm telling you not even tagging. First he was giving me excuses like my profile looked embarrassing, or I dressed bad on that photo, last final excuse "I don't post my relationships". But here's the thing: he once posted our photo with his loving text, but now I'm sure it was hidden since when I asked him to just add it to his highlights, he refused ANGRILY and when he finally added, in 1 day he 'accidentally' deleted it. Now again after i asked the truth about those follows, he posted again story with our (as he said before bad) photos and his love text and refuses to put it to highlights cuz he doesn't post his relationship (but he already did no? If it's not hidden of course).



I mean I'm drained and feeling betrayed by couple facts. the fact that he was going to hookup(or did), I mean it's not just thinking, its acting on it, its almost cheating no? I mean even if he really did not cheat.



 And the fact that it took me freaking 4 months to gather these pieces of truth. And due to that I am not sure he just followed them.. I mean if you really "clean" and did not do anything "illegal", you should be the one to beg me to talk about it and rip your ass off to make me trust you again.. but he.. he just was blaming me every time for bringing this topic up (howevr, it made sense, since every month i was finding out something new). (He is really active on insta, really active!)  
  
additionally, when we reunited for a week on a holiday, he did not seem to be so desperate for sex, as for a person that did not have it in 6 months, and in the first night he brought up the topic about threesome (of course with woman), which i told him no about when we lived together year before. When he brought up threesome not only i was offedned by this fact but also since it was our first night together after long time..

tldr Bf lied me about his active following of girls on insta for 4 months, afterall he admitted he was thinking to hook up with them but he did not. Claims it was because he was overwhelmed with how serious our relationship is. But for 4 motths he was lying, and blaming me for bringing up this topic, since he is tired answering questions.  
In meantime he constantly refuses not only to post our photo on insta (from our trips or activities), but even refuses to tag me, only tags others. Everytime i asked, i heard multiple different reasons to not do it.

ANSWER: Sounds like your relationship is bad and should not continue. You can't be with somebody who you can't trust, and he has shown himself to be extremely untrustworthy.

QUESTION: I (22M) am having doubts about me and my (25F) girlfriend's relationship

Hey all - so recently I've been having doubts about my relationship with my girlfriend. To give you the gist, I'm in the military and met her while living in Puerto Rico. We got together and after I was able to get an apt, she moved in shortly after. We were living together for the next few months and eventually I started to lose feelings.
There was definitely a difference in libido, hers being lesser than mine, and I placed a lot of value on sexual comparability. She wanted to be in it for the long haul and that scared/stressed me out. Eventually we broke up, spent a few months apart, and then got back together.
After a while, I had to transfer units and go back to the states. We agreed on her flying out when she was in a good place to do so to move in together, and now we're renting a place together and both working.
There's still a difference in libido, and recently I've been feeling just really down/depressed in general and I still feel like I'm not ready for something truly long term. I know she wants that - marriage, kids, the whole nine yards. I'm not sure I feel the same way.
I've been thinking about bringing my feelings up to her so she knows what's going on in my head, and I've been wanting to get into therapy to work through my feelings and whatnot and will wait to make any but decisions until then.
I've talked with my mom about my feelings before and she told me that I'm still pretty young and still trying to figure life out and who I even am and want to be. Maybe I'm just being fickle or something? I just don't really know what to do and could really use some input. Thanks.

================================================================================

QUESTION: person i was dating fled after 4 months? he partly blames his ADHD, i think it's mostly overthinking. do i talk to him or let him go? 24F 28M

24F & 28M

I've been seeing this person for about four months, we didn't know each other before. At the 2-month-mark he actually broke up with me for fears of the future, himself, his mental state and general chaos and overthinking, then resurfaced on his own after about two weeks. I've already known about his depression and ADHD before this, so I understood why he acted the way he did. He apologised profusely and said that he wants to give this - us - a real shot. So we continued!

He's so lovely. Caring, and thoughtful. I genuinely enjoyed being with him. He said he did too, that I'm wonderful, and that I add value and warmth to his life. We connected deeply I'd say :)

So yeah, I thought we were going in a good direction! Then one afternoon we got to talking about how I'd feel a bit more secure IF I could know where exactly this was headed (I have a slight case of anxious attachment, but it was under control, since I could feel his efforts and there were no mixed messages, etc). But I also ensured him that for now it's enough for me that I feel us growing closer, that we're taking steps ahead, there is no need to really lock down the future. After this, he started growing into a sad mood, which then resulted in another talk in the evening: he's not sure if he can give me what I want. That although we're good together, and understand each other, he thinks it's best if we stop, to avoid possibly hurting me in the future. He said, that when he's with me, he feels good and thinks we have a good thing going; but when he goes home and thinks about us he believes it is an uneven dynamic, that he's going to overpower me with his ADHD-specific rambles (his words). I told him that I enjoy him rambling about whatever- he said he knows, he sees that I enjoy it, but still, he thinks he will create disharmony between us.

Next morning, he broke up w me. We cried together.

What do y'all think?

(he also only had 2-3 months long dating phases since his toxic LTR ended 5 yrs ago)

ANSWER: Evidence-Based Thinking (EBT) teaches us to start with what we can see.

Here’s the evidence.

He left at two months.  
He came back.  
Then the moment you asked a simple, calm question about the future, he folded again.

I would trust the repetition.  
I would trust that he feels good when he’s with you but can’t hold it when he’s alone.

One question.  
If nothing changed, would this be enough for you?

Here's one more.  
Do you want a man you have to stabilize?

I’ve seen this play out a lot.  
When a man’s pattern is flee, return, flee, return, he’s showing you his limit.

You are not responsible for fixing that.  
Should you have to talk him into wanting more with you?

You decide if this is the life you want.

We breakdown situations like these everyday in r/daughtersofevidence

Let the evidence lead the way.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (22M) don't know how to interpret this guy's (20M) behavior. Any advice ?

Hi everyone, I'm kinda new to reddit (and recently figured out my sexuality) and I need your help. 

To make it short, I met this guy at uni back in April. We’d only known each other for a few days, but he was very warm with me: complimenting me (and only me) in front of my friends and in private, sending pretty intense Instagram DMs, asking if I had a partner, etc. 

Maybe I misread things, but at the time it felt a bit like he was flirting pretty strongly, and it made me think he was looking for something else than just friendship. When I subtly hinted that his messages surprised me, he said it was “just how he is, since he doesn’t go out much and tries to be super sociable.” 

After that things got cold and we basically stopped talking. I eventually unfollowed him, assuming we had just miscommunicated and moved on. Fast-forward to about two weeks ago : we randomly ran into each other on campus and after some stares, he came up to me and asked me if we could talk. I agreed even though I was busy : he apologized to me for how things went back in April before adding that it sucked that we stopped talking so abruptly and would really really like for us to talk again. 

A few days later while I was out partying with some friends, I decided to follow him on Instagram again, and he refollowed me instantly even tho it was quite late into the night. Since this happened... nothing from him. We sadly don't cross paths often since I'm in a Master's program and he's an undergrad, and I'm also quite the shy guy so making the first step is hard. 

So here I am, having trouble understanding what his intentions toward me are. And if there is something on his side, is there anything I can do to help things move forward ?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [24M] feel burned out by my [21F] girlfriends constant insecurities. What can I do?

Hello. We have been dating for 10 months. I'm on my whits end and kind of felt like maybe posting here might help.

The relationship started off strong, but it's just been on a steady decline for the past 3 months and I'm about to break it off for my mental health. We went on plenty of dates, hung out all the time, overall had a good time together.

The main issue I have is her insecurity. I understood at first that she needed to feel secure. So I listened, validated her, and I did everything she told me to do to help her. Because she would get in these moods where she felt the world was against her and everyone hated her and anything I would say or do would just make it worse. 

I would always cave in and give her more and more. I  got into this almost weekly cycle of her saying I didn't see her or talk to her enough, so I would do more. This kept building up until one day I just was fed up with it and burnt out. I realized I was spending 4-5 nights a week with her, if I wasn't at her house I was on a discord call with her from the moment she left work until she fell asleep, I never had time to even take care of myself, I wasn't hanging out with my friends anymore, and I loved my hooptie project car hobby that just kinda stopped. I knew something needed to change.

I was transparent with her that this was too much and I needed to back off or the relationship was going to fall apart. She started going to therapy for these issues and I backed off for my mental health. I gradually backed down to seeing her one day a week, usually we would hang out all day on a weekend, maybe spend the night. I backed off the constant phone calls and would have a couple usually 1-2 hour long calls a week. I thought it was working, I felt a lot more relieved. I started visiting friends and family more and started getting back into my hobbies.

Now she's going down the road if I don't do enough again. Super insecure, saying I barley ever see her, and that I do the bare minimum. I thought we were in a healthy groove. She now wants me to see her more and do more to show she's special to me. It's getting bad again.

Like this past weekend she was busy all weekend. Her girl friends planned a birthday celebration and she had some other stuff going on. I was also busy and we didn't expect to see each other that weekend. 

I got done early and was at a friend's house to pick up a transmission. We decided to hang out. Having a good old time. Well one of her plans got cancelled and she was available. She said she wanted me to come over. I told her I was at a friend's house and we were working on a Porsche and that I already told them I was going to stay for dinner. She demanded I come over and see her. Threw almost a mini temper tantrum. Ruined my mood for the whole night and they noticed I was off during dinner. 

This happens a lot, I will actively be doing something without her and she will ruin what should be enjoyable experiences with friends and family with her insecurities. She thinks she needs to be with me all the time when I'm with friends or family. Sometimes I think that's fine, but I also want to spend time with them alone. I didn't think that was unreasonable, she sees her parents and friends all the time without me and I never had a problem.

Monday we talked about the weekend and she blew up on me saying I had an opportunity to see her and I didn't take it. That she now won't see me for a week and a half because she's going on vacation with her parents. Saying "so you aren't bothered that you wont see me?" in which I said "no, because I know I will see you when you get back and I know you're probably having a good time." She then went off saying "you didn't even do anything for my birthday, so do you just not care?". For context her birthday is next week, while she's on vacation with her parents. I had planned a night out for when she got back because she spent this past weekend with her girl friends for her birthday and she knew I was planning something. But because I didn't tell her the plan because it was supposed to be a surprise, she just assumed I planned nothing and went off about how I don't treat her like she's special. I was just so frustrated and angry I just went to bed.

Yesterday I sent her a text where I wrote out out the issues I'm having as a last ditch effort to understand I'm burnt out with this stuff. She replied with "I think I need to call it" and "I hate to do this over text" giving me a slew of instructions to pick up my stuff from her house. I thought it was over, filled with anger I called her out for ending the relationship over text and that it was cowardly, then explained when I was picking up my stuff. I thought that was it. She then went "oh I messed up, I thought that text before was you breaking up with me". At this point she already went and deleted any pictures of us on her social media and some other stuff. She told me she broke up by accident and that she said she wanted to talk. Then last night it was just the same I don't do enough, I don't give her reassurance, I don't complement her on her looks enough, I don't say "I love you" enough, I don't see her enough etc... 

I told her if this is how she truly feels there is no reason she should be dating me and that I just feel like a horrible boyfriend. That if she's been telling me these needs from the beggining and I haven't met her them she needs to cut me off. I straight up told her I can't meet these needs and that I'm at my whits end and I don't know what else I can do.

Basically I feel like we are right back to where we were. My self esteem is in crisis, I have no energy, and can barley focus anymore on daily tasks because I'm obsessing about the one thing I'll do wrong that'll set her off next. I'm trying to stop myself from just going to her house today, grabbing my stuff, and leaving. Maybe I'm delusional, but I wish I could save this. I just want the fun times back.

TLDR - my girlfriends insecurities are pushing me away and taking a toll on my mental health.

ANSWER: I feel like I need to let her go. She talked to me about previous failed relationships and I think this behavior is why they left and why she got stuck with an abuser for a long time. I can totally see it.

My fear is that I will leave and she won't understand. That she won't fix herself. She has this mindset where she needs to always be with someone. That she will hop into another relationship way too quickly like she did with me and absolutely drain the next guy and not know why they left. I don't want that for her or the innocent guy that may end up in my shoes. It's a personal hell.

I knew something was really wrong when my friends kinda had a mini intervention with me this past week because they noticed my declining mental health and self esteem. I literally have everything I would have ever wanted in life and I'm miserable. I traced it back to this relationship, when I backed off I perked up significantly and now I'm being dragged down again.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My bf’s (23M) mom (50F) put a pic of his ex (23F) and him in their front hall. Toxic/deliberate or a simple mistake?

My boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have been together for almost 2 years. But about a month ago I noticed his mom had recently put up a picture of him and his ex in their front hall. 

There are a lot of reasons why I’d say his mother (50F) is toxic, but this reason in particular- I’m either being gaslight like crazy or it’s honestly a simple mistake.

 About a month ago, I saw there were new pictures up in their front hall. My boyfriend still lives with his family, just in the basement. I didn’t notice at first but when I got a better look at the pictures, one of them (and it was a pretty big pictures in a nice frame) was a picture of him and his ex (23 F).
They were together for 3 years but I am told repetitively that I’m “way better than her” (I honestly don’t need to be told that, but okay?) and that his family likes me way more. 

They have no pictures of me up mind you. I wouldn’t NEED my picture up but I found it strange how his ex’s photo is up but nothing of his current girlfriend… 
I asked him about it and said it felt very disrespectful, because it did. I was told to never mind it for now. Maybe a week later- still having a feeling in my gut like something was wrong, I brought it up again. I mostly just wanted to know what was going through his mother’s mind. My boyfriend told me that it didn’t mean anything, in the same breathe he tried to tell me that it was disrespectful but he didn’t want to say anything. He then said that he’d talk to his mom about it (I know confusing..) 

When we saw each other again, he said that his mom said it was “a really nice and expensive photo” but she would take the photo down but ONLY if we got a good photo of us to put up. My boyfriend is a photographer and we have like billions of “good photos” of us. Some in really nice outfits even. So I don’t think that it being a “good photo” was the only reason the ex’s photo was up (like I’m being told).

Am I going crazy or is there something weird going on here?

ANSWER: If you break up with him and he starts dating a new girl, that picture will be replaced with a picture of you and him. This is a tactic, that and calling the new gf by the old gf's name, that is indicative of an enmeshed relationship between your bf and his mom. Now, it doesn't mean that your bf is a momma's boy but it does mean that his mom gets jealous of his gfs.

I would definitely be on the lookout for signs of your bf being a momma's boy because he has already shown a few. If he is, he'll be saying things like "that's just the way she is" and he will defend her instead of standing up for you. If he's a Momma's boy, he will have mommy as his #1 priority and you as a far second.

================================================================================

QUESTION: What changed with me [31M] and her [32F] ?

Hello everyone, i would like to share my story and hopefully get some answers from people that have gone through the same thing because it's eating me inside.

I have been in contact with a girl that i really like for the past 8 months (the last 4 were intimate, first was more casual). I've found her through socials randomly and we clicked instantly. The communication was unreal and the level of intimacy on our conversations was very deep and unique, like ive never felt this way with any other girl in my life..For me, she checked all my boxes for a partner and i would really like to see where this goes. But all this time we couldn't meet for various reasons. Two weeks ago she told me that she could get days off and i could finally book tickets to meet her. Everything was great, i was feeling ecstatic, until she started a conversation about our future (which she didnt have to really, it's too soon) phrasing it somewhat wrong, as if i would be the only one to fight for our relationship, and my brain went "wtf, why is she saying all those things?".. Three days after that i woke up feeling completely void of emotions, numb and having no interest talking to her. I was scared, panicked and cried because it hadn't happened to me before, only seen it on friends and been done to me by one other girl. It was unfathomable for me how this could happen. I am feeling dissociated and i cant sleep or eat all those days.  
I communicated to her that i need some space and she took it personally and started deactivating herself..She said she knew she is too much and suffocating (as was expected). I started therapy because of that and because i don't wanna lose what we had and the therapist told me that i was triggered because i created so many unrealistic expectations of me in my head and i am afraid that she would leave me if i didnt meet those, so my subconscious decided to turn it all off. But i have to stick it out and continue communicating with her, even casually.She even insisted on us meeting even if we are not feeling like it..

TLDR: I got scared because of unrealistic expectations set by me after coming close to the love i crave or is it something else?

Thanks to anyone that reads my story and i would appreciate any help!

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I 23F stop myself from losing attraction for my boyfriend 23M bc of his teeth

My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 years and not that I believe in soul mates but hes the closest thing I imagine a soul mate to be. He's my best friend, my rock, my cheerleader, my human foot and hand warmer and so much more. He is the most fun loving, passionate, funny, caring person youll ever meet. Hes a living ray of sunshine and a gem of a human and there hasnt been a day ive woken up where i havent been lucky to call him mine....but he has, what I unaffectionately call...a "uni-tooth" (not that ive ever told him that). He has a literal wall of tartar encasing 5-6 (only 2 stick out from the tartar so im not sure how many are in there) of his bottom teeth that makes it look like one big long yellow tooth and its been very heavily affecting my attraction to him.
 Its been over a year now that ive been asking him to go to the dentist or to go and get his teeth cleaned or to do anything at all to remedy the situation and everytime he responds with "ill make an appointment soon"/"im just waiting for the right time"/ "im working on it" ect ect but like....nothings been done and no appointments have been made and I dont know what to do at this point. Its been going on 14 years that hes been to the dentist.
Ive even straight up told him a few times that while I still love him im starting to lose my physical attraction to him, I dont want to kiss him on the mouth bc I can taste it, his morning breath is getting to be offensive and that being the reason why intimacy is becoming few and far between and he always responds with "ill make an appointment soon" but never does. Ive even gone as far as to offer to make the appointment for him or go with him to the appointment but declines and says he wants to handle it himself. Ive asked him if hes scared of the dentist or if hes nervous or if theres anything at all i can do and he said no. In every other aspect of his life hes responsible, reliable, clean and his hygiene is great, its just when it comes to his teeth that things fall apart.
I love this man with my entire being. We've never had any issues in our relationship. After 7 years the only negative thing I have to say about him is literally that he wont fix his teeth and I wish I could magically make this not be an issue for me but it is and im starting to not be able to look past it anymore. I cant even kiss him outside of a peck on the lips and I fear its becoming a deal breaker. 
Do you have any advice on what else I could say to convince him or things I could do to change his mind? Or even how to make this be a non-issue that i can look past? am becoming desperate and I really don't want to bring a breakup or an ultimatum to the table.

ANSWER: You already tried everything you could, even tho you said you don't want to bring out the ultimatum, it is a deal breaker and maybe the only solution now. Or be harsher, make the appointment and take him there, he obviously can't handle hit on his own. Teeth is also about health, you are worrying abour his health that should be enough to "overstep" his boundary yk

I talked to my GF this morning about future goals and my current mental state. We hang out everyday day wasting away days and enjoying each others company, but looking back at all the time, less could have been spent hanging out and more should’ve been spent studying or going to the gym or doing anything productive. The problem lies in communicating to her about how I feel, changing my routine, spending less time with her and working on myself a little more. When I brought this up, she made it seem like I don’t want to spend time with her anymore and got upset. I’ve been missing classes and been behind in school because of the time we spend together, sometimes it feels like she doesn’t care about or respect my wellbeing and gets upset if something doesn’t go her way. I’m stuck in this loop of productive thought and careless living. I don’t know how to move on and tell her I need more space without telling her- in her words- I want to be away from you. Advice?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I think my (20M) girlfriend (20F) is lying to me. Is it realistic she got with no one during our break?

So me and my gf have been dating for 5 months now. We were talking and dating a bit, but then she ended things with me as she was recently out of relationship and didn’t want to date yet. She wanted to continue talking and being exclusive just not “date” which I understood but I wasn’t interested in doing all that and not dating so I decided we should stop talking. We went on a 2 month break before we rekindled things in which I told her during that break I got with no one and she also got with no one. She told me she hasn’t even kissed a guy during the break. She likes to go out a lot and some of her friends are boy crazy. She told me during our break she was going out a lot every weekend and even sometimes within the week. I find it hard to believe she didn’t even kiss a guy because during our break she admitted she said yes to a date but didn’t go and she would flirt with some guys and give them her snap when they swiped up on her story. I know she can get bored sometimes and get horny. She’s been good while we’ve been together but I’m just afraid she’s lying to me. I just think it’s unrealistic for a girl who is conventionally attractive and gets hit on everytime she goes out to bars every weekend to not even have kissed a guy during those 2 months. Do you think she most likely is telling the truth because I just feel like she knows I’d be upset if she got with someone and just has decided to just lie about it.

ANSWER: It's unrealistic for this relationship to continue if you don't trust her.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (29M) support my partner (29M) while he figures out life?

TLDR: My partner's difficulties pursuing life tasks is beginning to cause real impacts. How do I support him in managing this?

I (28 M) met my partner (29M) through a mutual friend earlier this year. It's been great and we have a ton in common, he's been a dream. However, he got laid off about three or four months into us dating and he has yet to find another position. Initially, this was awesome to get to spend long summer nights together as he had a good savings for seeking a nice new job (he hated his last one). Though through the weeks and months, he's become more distressed towards life. He's always struggled doing things like renewing his ID, getting his car inspected, going to appointments, etc. But now it seems like he's been paralyzed, not applying to jobs, not reaching out to friends, not leaving our apartment. I've been able to support him emotionally at times but other times this has been challenging. I'm looking for any advice on how I can support him and or myself through this time as I'm concerned for him and the potential consequences of this paralyzation. I don't want to be his parent but I'm feeling helpless. How can I support him?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (19F) suspects that My (19M) boyfriend is being weird and a bit toxic

So, five days before I arrived to class, I was on the phone with my boyfriend. We said “I love you” to each other and hung up around 8. Then around 10, I found out my boyfriend had unfollowed me on Instagram. I know it happened that day because when I woke up, we were still following each other. I was confused because everything was fine.

  
So I texted him, “Why would you unfollow me?” He replied, “hehe  I didn’t, what are you talking about babe?” I told him it’s not funny, to follow me back, and asked why he was doing petty stuff. Then he said, “Follow my spam.”

WHICH I DIDN’T.

I told him how weird it is for my own boyfriend to unfollow me on his main account and then want me to follow his spam. He said, “Nothings that deep, it’s not serious, people have worse problems, you’ll be okay.”

I told him he wasn’t taking accountability and was dismissing my feelings when I was calmly communicating. At first, I was overthinking and wondering if I was being insane, but the truth is… it hurt. And if something hurts me, I’m going to speak up. I know it’s just social media and I honestly don’t care about that stuff, but it is weird for my own boyfriend to not follow me. It happened five days ago, and I’m still not over it because it hurt me.

ANSWER: I (29/F) don’t even know if I’m young enough to understand the problem anymore. I don’t know what a spam account is. I don’t know why he wouldn’t want to follow you, and I don’t know why he would be making it a joke of it.

What I do know if you need to talk in person to resolve this. If you talk in person and what he’s saying makes you feel like you’re going crazy (like he’s blatantly lying or has re-followed you just to prove you wrong), yeah he might be toxic. In which case I wouldn’t even stick around to find out why, I’d just leave him.

It also perfectly possible that this is just some dumb miscommunication, in which case you should just talk it out like adults.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I need dating advice (F30, M37) do i still have a chance with him??

Men, what advice do you have for me?

I need dating advice pls

Do I still have a shot??

I started dating a man 2 months ago & I really like him. I’ve been single for 2 years and this man really intrigues me in so many ways. We do long distance but I visit his state often for work so anytime I get a chance to- I’d go see him. We’ve made plans for him to come see me too or travel places together. The distance really helps our situation because we get to know each other without the physical aspect of things. 

Anyway, things were going really well. Until I got very drunk on my birthday. He was at work, and I blew his phone up :( i don’t know what I said to him but it really hurt him. I woke up remembering context of breaking up, and was sooo embarrassed seeing how many times I called him or spam texted him and he responded that he’s at work, and he’ll talk to me tomorrow. 

We got to texting a few days later and he told me I do /say effed up things when I’m drunk :( (if you see my profile, I’m an alcoholic who broke sobriety this year and thought I could drink casually again) I felt horrible because I don’t have any issues with him so idk what I could’ve said to him. 

I pleaded with him and apologized. I really like him and I definitely took him for granted. He told me he needed time to think about things and he’ll call me so we can talk over the phone. But not now. 

I spiraled again (drunk again) and spam called/texted. He called me again to say he’s at work, and that he’ll call me. I sent him voice memos that made no sense whatsoever 😭😭😭 I apologized again for the last time and told him I’ll give him the space fr. And I have. I’ve stayed sober since, I know it ain’t much but I really want to reconcile and make things up to him. 


It’s been 8 days 😭😭😭 do I still have a chance? I definitely plan on keeping my end of things and give him space. I’ll be quiet until he breaks the silence. I’m just bedrotting and doubtful 😭😭😭 


For context I am 30 F he is 37. He’s grown, mature and intentional. The time we’ve dated, he stays true to what he says he’ll do so I know I’m not being ghosted but I still wanna know if I still have a chance. He’s never called me out of my name, he’s mature, respectful, kind. 

The silence has made me reflect a lot, and I’ve been in toxic relationships before so it’s refreshing to find a man who communicates well and is still respectful even when I’m being an asshole. But I’m unlearning toxic behaviors because I want to be the healthiest and best version of myself, for me and for him.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Loss of attraction? Or just not sexually compatible?’24M’ & ‘23F’

So I ‘24M’ am married and have been for around two years now. My wife ‘23F’ and I have problems like everyone else but our sex life has definitely taken a turn for the worse. I make attempts to have the conversations on what she needs sexually and they seemingly go nowhere I ask what she needs and she says she doesn’t need anything or that we can try talking her through sex. It’s not my usual personally but it’s what she needs so I try. She makes attempts at getting me sexually interested but she’s either dry downstairs, or only wants it when it’s convenient for her. I’m not interested in making her have sex when she’s interested so more often than not I end up in the bathroom with ole reliable.🟧⬛️✋🏾 
I have no issue doing foreplay, I’m always excited to go down on her but nothing really seems to get it going or start the mood. Lately I’m tired of trying to the point where we tried having sex last night, it barely felt good and there was too much pausing while we tried. I straight up got frustrated and lost interest, I said nevermind it’s fine and just went to lay with her and cuddle.  I’m sexually frustrated, I don’t plan on turning to infidelity, but on top of everything else we have going on a bad sex life is definitely shifting the dynamic from bad to worse. 
I express patience through the difficult times, understanding, interest in being sexually generous but extremely I’m fatigued at this rate!!!

ANSWER: I would elevate your situation to needing marriage counseling that specializes in sex. A sex therapist if you will. My understanding of your situation is that there is an underlying issue going on with her. Could be trauma, could be depressions could be many things. You guys need to discover the root cause a d then come up with an action plan to.remedy the issue.

Note that people do fall put.of.love and do lose sexual attraction BBBUUTTTT!!! You can also fall in love again and also regain sexual attraction. It goes both ways at any time. Relationships sre.not a stagnant thing. They are an evolving thing that obviously changes with time a d circumstances. I lost track of the number of times I asked myself why do I keep going with my marriage only to then say wow, how lucky I am to be in such an awesome relationship the week after. So yeah, there will  e both good times and hard times. In your case I think you could use proffesional help.

There is no shame in seeking proffesional help. For example, I fix most things around the house, my car etc but there are many things that are beyond my capabilities so I hire proffesional help. Everybody dies that. Changing break pads and rotors is an easy job but replacing lifters on a head is not or at least not for me. So one I do myself and the other I pay for. I've gone to marriage counseling and it was one of the best desicions in my life. Our issues were beyond what we could solve on our own.

ANSWER: "how do i let her know how i feel without accusing her?"

You accuse her? Nothing she's messaging is okay in a healthy relationship.

That would be a relationship killer for me. Find someone that values you bro and move along.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My 20F girlfriend wants to live in another country for an extended period of time, but I 20M am worried about what to do about it.

So, I'm currently a sophomore in college studying Aerospace Engineering. My girlfriend is the same age and year as me. She's studying to be an accountant. We go to different colleges that are 4 hours apart, but we live in the same hometown. Next year she's going to be transferring to my college. Recently, she brought up the fact that she feels stuck because after college because she doesn't want to stay in our hometown and settle down immediately. She told me she wants to travel and possibly live in another country for some period of time. She didn't specify how long, but she gave a range of 6 months to a few years. She also claims that she wants to do so alone as it will improve her experience. We've talked about settling down and having a family in our mid to late twenties assuming we're financially ready to do so. I've heard that working as a foreigner for Aerospace is difficult because of security reasons, and I know the industry is the biggest in the United States. I would also love to travel but not live in other countries. I want to stay in the United States for my future, but I know my girlfriend wants to travel. When I talked to her about it, she told me that it was her decision and that the more we talked about it, the more she felt pressured by me to stay. I told her that I understood but that he decision would ultimately affect me and our future together as well. She agreed, but I decided to give her space. She also said it take her a long time to decide on what to do. I don't want to handle working a full-time Aerospace job and a long distance relationship, but it feels like it may go there. I've communicated this, but I'm still unsure how to feel as it's all very fresh still. I understand I'm very young, so this may all seem very silly, but I just wanted to get it out because I can't talk to her about it right now. What's my next step in approaching this?

ANSWER: She wants to go alone so it really doesn't matter what the other country has to offer an Aerospace Engineer, right?  

The cool part is that she can go after school is out and she lands something, then you can come for visits.    Don't pressure her to stay, just live as if after school you'll both land jobs where you want to live and do LDR for 6mo to about a year.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I feel like a roommate than a husband in our marriage because me and my wife don't have intimacy. Is that ok? (25M, 25F)

I am a 25M and my wife is also 25F. We haven't been intimate in over 3 months now because she have said she's scared to get pregnant. I believe this all started because she started taking politics seriously all of a sudden and it's been affecting both of us in a bad way. It did get to the point where she would cutoff all her friends if they had a different political view. I manage to talk sense into her about it but there are times when it does come out of the box. Another thing she does more is spend nearly all day, on tiktok live even sleeping on there sometimes, which I don't understand why she's doing that. We still go out on dates, hold hands and stuff and she does teases me sometimes but everytime I try to do the same thing she says I'm doing too much. It has been affecting my self image lot and I don't feel like I'm attractive anymore to her but everytime we talk about this she thinks I'm demanding sex from her which is not my intention. I want her to feel intimate towards me and want her to have that feeling so she doesn't feel forced but any attempt I make, washing dishes, cleaning the house, walking and feeding the dog, doesn't me feel appreciated by her. She have said she appreciates me and does find me attractive but I'm starting to doubt that since she spends more time on tiktok than with me. Even during serious conversation I have been shut down because I asked her to put her phone down since we are having a conversation but I'm hit with anger from her. I starting to feel like I'm just a roommate in my own home than a husband because I'm not appreciated by my wife and she's only teases me because she wants to get a reaction out of me. What am I suppose to do?

ANSWER: I mean there is something else going on. ’m fairly political, but with your partner, you are supposed to be safe and comfortable. Have you discussed couples therapy? Because there seems to be a breakdown in communication. You might be trying to discuss things, but doesn’t seem like she is sharing much. Seems she is addicted as well to social media. If she’s not willing to open up or work on lessening her time online vs being together as a couple, not sure what you can do to salvage things.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I M22 hate my bf M33

Tried posting on r/vent but karmas a bitch

I (M22) met my boyfriend (M33) when I was 19. His grindr said he was 27, and he kept up that lie until a few months in, when he got a new license. I caught him thirsting over people on snapchat, messaging and begging them to suck him off. Desperately. 
I forgave him everytime. Relationship continued, 1 year in and I move in with him. 
I am autistic and don't work, I pay my half through my benefits, which he rarely pays towards as we live in a house his mother owns. (She lives abroad). He also claims benefits by lying saying he can't get a job, even though he works for cash in hand. 

We've been together over 3 years now and we're so different, all he talks about is politics, religion, conspiracy theories - all things I frankly couldnt give a fuck about anymore. He makes me feel small and dumb, trying to get me to debate these topics with him.
We don't have anything in common. He and his mum said when I moved in, we could decorate however we'd like but everytime I brought up an idea with him, he shoots it down.
He complains about having no money, despite earning more than me, rarely paying his half for the house, and the only reason he's constantly broke is because he won't stop buying things for himself. He's constantly window shopping and has no impulse control when it comes to purchases.
We're barely intimate and when we are the focus is all on him. 
He's picky and won't buy cheap food, it has to be branded, same with clothes and practically everything he buys. I hate going food shopping with him. 
He uses so much fucking toilet paper. He's gotta be eating it because he can use a whole roll for one shit. He went to wipe the toilet seat (which he never picks up) and literally pulled like 15 squares of TP just wipe the seat. 

The other day his mum, while on facetime - drunk off her face, grilled me about getting a job, set up some supposed deadline of Dec 1st.
I'm genuinely terrified of getting a job, for all the obvious reasons, but mainly because then I'll be stuck here. I feel like I have some sort of safety net right now of "I have nothing concrete here so I can just easily pack up, leave and nothing can hold me back". 
But even though I say I could easily pack and leave, I can't. My room at my mum's has been rented out to a lodger, I don't drive so I can't just leave whenever; I'd have to plan it all with my older brother, who's barely reliable. 

I have tried to leave him, told him I want to break up several times but everytime he clings to me, crying, claiming he cant live without me and every fucking time I cave in and stay. I hate him. I hate him so much and I hate myself for getting into this situation. I'm pathetic for not being a normal fucking adult.
This is a vent but a questions required for this sub so : How could I go about leaving him that won't give him an opportunity to manipulate me into staying?

ANSWER: Whatever self preservation instinct moved you to be brave enough to write this post is the same impulse you're going to use to get out of this situation. You have an income, so you have options. You may also be eligible for some kind of subsidized housing if you don't have family to go to. It's going to come down to your own will and determination.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My [33F] partner and I [31M] had a talk and broke it off. I’m not sure how to handle it.

My, 33F and I, 31M, had broken up over the weekend after being together there for over a year. While I was very understanding of the why (not happy with herself and feels as though she wants to have a break from relationships) I’m left more confused as time passes. 

While we talked she had mentioned that I treated her the best she’s been treated, that she actually could look at me and know I love her, things like this. While I did feel better seeing her and knowing that it wasn’t just hard on me but on her too, I’m also left confused as to how I should think of this. I’m not sure if this is a break or breakup, especially since she and I had both said we want this to work out in the end but recognize life is uncertain. 

When we spoke, I expressed my reflections I had about my faults in the relationship and how I want us to keep moving forward together. The answer remained the same with her disagreeing with my faults, and placing the blame on the failures of the relationship on herself. 

Because we are very similar, I’d think that her attachment style and my own are the same, avoidant, as we both became distant from each other when life became overwhelming rather than talking. 

I’m not sure how I should approach this now? I talked to some people and they had said that if I think this is worth fighting for then I should say something, since I have nothing lose and/or I get clarity as to what we’re doing moving forward.

ANSWER: Look: nobody breaks up for no reason. The way I read it when she says she’s not happy with herself, read that as not happy with the relationship or you. Sadly for you, I think it might be someone else on the horizon. By all means ask if the breakup is definitive and tell her you cannot wait forever not knowing. Better make the bandaid quick. You cannot just changé how you are, “moving forward”. If she is that vague, she’s putting you off asking other questions. The only way you might look more attractive is if you make moves to move on.

QUESTION: How do I [33F] communicate effectively with my husband [41M]

TLDR: My husband [41m] and I [33f] seem completely unable to communicate anymore more. What else can I try? Or do I just accept we're no longer compatible?

I feel like hes repeatedly missing the point and asking for black and white instruction. I get frustrated repeating myself and explaining that feelings dont come with instructions and its not fair to make me set all the rules. 

For background, weve been together 8 years, married 4. Our physical intimacy took a hit 6 months in when he cheated. I forgave him yesrs ago but the intimacy never recovered. Our emotional intimacy, in my opinion anyway, has been falling away over the last couple of years. I think in large part because I got tired of feeling like the only one putting in effort.

Ive added an example of a recent conversation before...what can I do to try and get us communicating constructively again?

I dont want our marriage to end but I also cant continue like this. 


....................


Husband: I want to reinforce and clarify this message, as I am still there.
Recently we had a huge blow up.
I don't know what I did (the straw that broke the camel's back) that made it happen. I asked you a lot and you told me the reason was you were exhausted, exasperated, at the limit of your endurance. I understand that's a horrible place to be and I'm so sorry that I put you there. From those answers, I cannot really understand what I did to make you feel that way.
At one point I tried to clarify that it seemed slow progress on therapy appointments was a major issue for you that I had misunderstood as just one "part" - but I think you rejected that. 
I said that my previous understanding was that you were happy I was making progress in my own way and you didn't want to interfere in my process. I can't reconcile that with the "failing for years" understanding I got from you in the blow up.
I get that you want to increase our intimacy and connection. Because I don't understand what I did wrong, or any conditions that you would consider adequate progress, I don't know whether I will suddenly trigger another blow up. Because of that, I am struggling to be vulnerable with you. Because of that, I continue to feel quite distant.
Can you help me understand what I did or didn't do?


Wife: You persistently chose not to address the issues that you identified as the root cause for our lack of intimacy. 

You let me beat myself against rocks, exhaust and humiliate myself, trying to make a difference but didnt do the thing you knew would actually make a difference. 

Then you became emotionally volatile and attributed that to the same underlying issue. And still didnt try to address it.

You worked out what the problem was and did nothing until earlier this year. You left me on my own, trying, even though it was a waste. Through your inaction, you showed me that I was not important enough to you to effect change and resolve the issues.
And that you were willing to let me give until I have nothing left while not doing the same.

It has taken me getting to breaking point for you to hear this

And you are still saying you dont understand


Husband: OK, so it's the lack of intimacy and the slowness to address that?


Wife: And the betrayal and abandonment and taking me for granted

Husband: OK, it's the lack of intimacy, slowness to address that, betrayal (can you help me understand this?) and taking you for granted


Wife: The betrayal is not choosing us. Not acting in our best interest. Letting me make an idiot of myself and waste so much energy. My husband shouldn't me someone who causes me embarrassment and shows me through their (in)action that I'm not worth their effort.

Wife: I see

Husband: So what was the "straw" that made it blow up?

Wife: Have you heard the cliche "if the wanted to, they would"?

It was walking in and seeing evidence that you didnt want to and I was still stood there letting you show me im worthless anyway that broke


Husband: Ok
I appreciate you sharing your feelings. I'm sorry.
I'm looking for a way to gain some safety in our relationship
I haven't looked at porn since we clarified thats not ok. Is that good?


Wife: Yes, thats good

Husband: And I'm doing all the things I set out in my plan
And I am highlighting to you where I'm struggling to find confidence in what you're thinking and what's OK, and explaining why it's a blocker. Is that good? Bad? Other?

Wife: Yes, good

Wife: I dont think that I can offer safety and honesty at the same time. 

I dont yet feel confident enough that you're going to follow through and resolve this this time to be willing to let me guard down and reinvest. Youve had false starts before now.

Emotionally I am in limbo. Mentally I gave myself a year in March - I won't let myself stay unhappy for longer than a full year. So do I want this to work and for us to rebuild, 100% yes. Am I willing to remove myself if, after a year, I am still unhappy and hopeless, sadly also yes.

Will I make any decisions before then? No, not unless you make it categorically clear that you won't effect changes.

I dont know if that is helpful or unhelpful clarity...its the best I can offer right now


Husband: I recognise the threat
Right now, I'm asking about how to avoid a blow up

Wife: I'm not sharing it to be threatening. Im sharing it to explain that I cant give a sense of safety I dont have

Husband: I get it
But I'm asking about how to avoid a blow up

Wife: I dont know the answer to that. I cant give specific instructions on how to do that...what I do know will make the most positive impact is you showing up through your actions

Husband: Things to avoid to avoid a blow up

 saying that I'm ashamed / weak / worthless etc
 not following through on the things I said I'd do
 anything around porn or other women
 backing out of conversations / locking up

ANSWER: You don't need to communicate better.  
You just need to reconnect. You know how to communicate. When you first dated you knew how to talk and express your emotions. The problem is that now you have lost that important connection, and anything you or your partners say to each other feels like a threat.   
1) First, Reconnect  
2) Later talk.

QUESTION: Advice please? Or general perspective/input on this situation 'M30' 'F26'

dating for 6 years.

I '30M' recently found out my dad is dying. I also moved states and have been struggling with it as it was before finding out the bad news.
When I was younger I used drugs primarily meth. I got clean and despite the occasional slip up have been doing well over the past 7 years.

Lately the stress got to me me and I used again a few times.
My girlfriend 'F26' found out as she went through my phone (which I am not happy about her invading my privacy like that). We had a huge argument about it and I have explained why I chose to use (not that it's an excuse it's just what pushed me into making that choice) as I reverted to old ways of coping.

I explained that I didn't feel comfortable talking to her about this before she found out as she keeps going and telling her mother every negative thing that happens between us. I feel like I can't talk to her privately as she repeats what I say and this has caused a lot of issues with her family.

So tonight I got some stressful news at about 11.30pm which I had to deal with and she has started to accuse me of using again and pulled out a drug test and demanded I do it. I do not have an issue with the result if I was to do the sample as it will be clean,  however I do have an issue that she had that on hand and was waiting to throw it at me. I feel like I may as well be locked up and forced into doing something I don't want to do.

My issue is any time she considers me to be acting "weird" she accuses me of using drugs which is further adding to the stress that I am going through which was an attributing factor to me using in the first place. I don't want to get to the point of being that stressed out that I use again and I don't know how I can get her to understand that all of this is not helping me.

I really feel guilty being over this side of the country while my dad dies and not being able to afford to go over there and see him before it's.too late and I need her to understand that it's hard for me right now. I am sorry I messed up in the first place but I can't deal with being accused of this every time anything happens.

Please help give perspective on this

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (28F) husband (30M) hates the holidays and wants to stay home and it is stressing me out. What can I do?

My (28F) husband (30M) and I have been married for 3 years and always get into a stalemate around the holidays. I want the family gatherings, and he hates it and just wants to stay home for the holidays (This includes Thanksgiving and Christmas, but we will focus more on Christmas since that is where more family gatherings happen).
 
A bit of background on why I want the family gatherings, and what it looks like to me. I grew up with a big family that always got together for the holidays. My parents were split very early, but my dad's side always got together for Christmas eve, and my step-dad's family welcomed me in since I can remember. Both sides were about 15+ people at each get together. My dad and I don't really have a good relationship and I don't see his side often, but I come to the holiday party for everyone else in the family and it is peaceful. When I was a teenager, half of this was ripped out from under me (TLDR: My step-dad had a falling out with my mom and his whole family pretended I didn't exist anymore). It was gut-wrenching, and now I feel I am trying to grasp onto a sense of a family. I know I won't get what I lost back, but my dream was to keep a peaceful family holiday tradition.
 
Background on my husband. His holidays were just his immediate family of 4. I got to join them occasionally once I started seeing him, and it was peaceful and lovely. A year after we were married, he had a falling out with his family. From what he's told me it was mostly to do with his dad. I won't get into that too much, since it is its own story. I ended up getting stuck in the middle of communication, and eventually he started speaking to his mom again at least. He is also very uncomfortable in social gatherings, which I try to accommodate by either telling him he doesn't have to come, or coming up with a game plan on leaving early in case he gets overwhelmed. This usually ends up with him never coming to most of my family events.
 
He dreads the holidays, and hates going to my dad's Christmas eve party in particular (Doesn't like how my dad was absent on me when I was younger). The past few years I have gone back and forth with him on the topic and it ends with me going to my family party alone (and being asked multiple times where he is and if he hates them) and him forcing himself to spend time with his own family and my mom (who is alone otherwise) for my sake. But this all ends up with me being extremely stressed for 2-3 months leading up to the holidays. And I feel selfish for asking him to just suck it up and go to the gatherings, as I really want him to be happy. But he is not happy on the holidays no matter what I do.
 
Earlier this year, he promised to go to the Christmas eve party so I can get a break from all the questions and being alone. He also wanted to see my baby cousins, because they love him and have known him their whole lives. I was very excited, but now as we get closer he is saying that he doesn't want to do the holidays again. I can feel the stress building up again, and it has been exhausting. How do I communicate to him how important this is to me? Am I being too selfish, or am I blind to something?
 
TLDR: My husband promised to go to my family's Christmas eve party and is now backing out. I am big on family and am getting stressed over all of this.

ANSWER: Go without him. Let him be alone. I know it sucks but he'll be miserable if he goes and you'll be unhappy if you don't.

QUESTION: Relationship Question F27 M25

So I’m 28F and my boyfriend is 23M. We’ve been together for almost 4 years now! A couple of months ago we started talking about adding another woman into our relationship. Over the weekend we started discussing an open relationship so that I wouldn’t overreact when he starts talking to another woman. I’m very loyal to him & I don’t want to sleep with someone else but he likes the fact of another woman being in the bed with us. He’s told me that if I don’t want to sleep with them (him and the woman) then I can just watch. One part of me wants to share him but the other side is telling me not to. A year ago he was cheating on me it took me a while to get through it. In the back of my mind I want him happy because I can’t always have sex with him but the other side is scared that he will fall in love with the other person.. I want him to be able to have fun and try it once but I’m having bad thoughts about it. What would you do in this situation? Would you try it once?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Torn between my (25F) future or my relationship (32F)

My girlfriend (32F) and I (25F) have been together since 2021, we moved together Dec 2022 and have been living together since. She struggled with depression and anxiety, which she still deals with, after we moved together due to a toxic situation my family put her through. We took distance and she took time to heal, but this prevented her from working and functioning, she would often get sick either emotionally or physically. Out of 3 years (2022-2025) she worked ocasional side work, like she would pay 2 months of electric bills, 2 months of groceries or 2 months of telephone bills and she'd stop for months. The longest time she worked was for about 4 months at a hotel, but she had to leave it due to losing her work permit. I've worked my 9-5, 4-5 hours side gigs 5 days a week or even 7 days a week when needed and donated plasma for about 2 years.

Don't get me wrong, this was a mix of her not wanting to take any job, feeling like she couldn't do much due to mental health and me not communicating properly what I needed from her so she could do it. When I communicated is when she found the job at the hotel. We have not been financially responsible either, she would put on debt she couldn't pay and ask me to pay it and I would add debt that I could pay working more than I already was. I stopped that now, but she didn't. Last time she did something like this was while working at the hotel, she took a loan she couldn't pay because she was only doing a part time that covered the bills I gave her and nothing more, and she would also miss work very often. She asked me to pay it and this time I said no.

She's been good to me in every other aspect of the relationship, she's supports me and my goals, but she is not financially responsible at all. Right now we're dealing with her losing her TPS (benefit that prevented her from getting deported) and her work permit. She has options to stay in the US, but of course those options require money. I'm being fortunate enough to have my company try to help and sponsor me, which would give me the chance of giving her a status again so she can stay here. The only problem is that if we do it on our own or through my company, I have to keep working like I am right now (9-5 + side gigs 5 or even 7 days a week) to keep up with bills and the debt we would have due to fees, lawyers, etc. I'm not sure if my company would cover all cost, which I wouldn't expect them to, but even if they did and I didn't have to work side gigs, my 9-5 income would be just enough to cover bills, we would have 0 money leftover for savings, emergencies, dates or anything that comes up which means I would have to do side gigs for anything extra. During this process she would not be able to work until year 2 (it is a lenghty process) so it would be me supporting both of us for 2 more years, possibly giving up my goals due to money and time.

Am I selfish for thinking it's better to not do it? Because she would go back to her home country, we would break up (I cannot leave the US until the sponsorship is done which would take about 2 years or more or until my asylum is approved which I've been waiting for 8 years already) and we cannot do long distance for that long with no plan. I'm terrified of breaking up, but I'm also terrified of spending 2 more years living like this.

TL;DR: I'm torn between choosing my future and goals or choosing my relationship and helping my partner stay in the US.

================================================================================

QUESTION: No intimacy. 24F /  27M.

I am a 24F, my boyfriend is 27M. Earlier this year in May I found out he was messaging girls, which really domino effected our relationship. I knew he was doing that for a few months, but I really was too scared to look through his phone until I had the opportunity. I decided to stay because it wasn’t physical, and I do love him. A part of me thinks that there isn’t a relationship I’ll be in where that doesn’t happen, so I just kind of accepted it. (Yes, I realize that is a horrible mindset but I truly have yet to experience one where it doesn’t, even my own parents). Anyways, things had gotten significantly better after that. He did put in the effort, and he did put in the work to try and mend our relationship. 

But, around July intimacy completley stopped on my end. I stopped wanting to have sex. I don’t know why. I’d try to, but I’d feel awkward and uncomfortable and would have to stop. This really upset him. He took it as a huge hit to his ego, and all the other romantic stuff stopped too. This made it harder for me. I wasn’t sure why this happened, but I figured I was going through something. I have a traumatic history with CSA and my first relationship was very traumatic on top of it. I thought it had something to do with that. 

Since this was effecting my relationship so severely I decided to go to therapy to see if I could find out what was going on. She pointed out to me it could be a little bit of everything from my past, and also how he is acting now. She also brought up that my neurodivergence can have a role in this, as well as my sexuality. She brought up being asexual, or liking girls more etc. But that particularly terrifies the hell out of me. On top of this I struggle with something called MRKH. I was born without a uterus, and my vaginal canal. I had to do dilation in late adolescence so I could have a normal sex life. So often I find myself thinking of sex as a chore, that I curated my whole life around for a man. I don’t experience sensation internally, but the pressure feels okay sometimes. And the more I think about sex with men the past few months, the more I really despise it. I love everything else but that. I feel like my whole life has revolved around it in a weird and twisted way, that I can’t escape it even in society. 

Every relationship I’ve been in this has happened at some point, I just stopped wanting to be intimate and I get this same feeling. I’ve only been with men, and I never have considered myself to possibly be asexual. This is taking a heavy toll on my relationship, and I do love my boyfriend. I’m just afraid it’s cooked at this point because he’s getting more upset and more to himself and secluded which is the opposite of what I want. I brought up him being more romantic in other ways, and he hasn’t really done anything. I asked how I can be romantic / intimate for him without needing to have sex and he could not even give me an answer. He said he didn’t know. I’m just not sure what to think anymore or what to do? Has anyone had a similar experience? I’m just afraid my issue is too loaded so I feel like the only one.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Is my (F25) ex boss(M33) flirting with me?

There is this person who used to be my boss and he recently left and joined a new company. We were on really good terms. He used to trust me with almost every work and he was super nice. Initially I didn't think of it as anything. I just thought he's a nice person. I noticed him stealing glances at me several times but I didn't think it meant anything. Few days before he resigned from my current company, he started getting too friendly. He started texting and calling me out of nowhere. Then he told me he's planning to leave and offered me to come with him. Since the offer sounded considerably good, I told him I'll think about it. He then started calling me on most random hours. We both work in a different city from our home city. And there's this town which falls on my way to my work city and he lives in that town too. So we both were on a leave, planning to go back to work. One night he texted me to come and meet him in his town, stay there for 1 day and then suggested to travel back to work together. I felt it was weird cuz I didn't share that kind of bond with him. I didn't reply and I kinda ghosted him because his suggestion felt inappropriate. I was super mad at him. When I came back, he acted like nothing happened. So I decided to let bygones be bygones. And I started acting normal too. Then I started sensing the change in tension between us. I could sense there was something going on in his mind. He used to stare at me and he started finding reasons to talk to me. Even the people around me started noticing it. When he left, he again started texting me. He now sometimes send me most cringeworthy memes. I don't know what to think of it since he's almost 8 years older than me. Also from what I've heard, he's about to get married in 3 months or so. What is up with him?

ANSWER: Sounds like he’s into you. I would steer clear since he’s getting married and almost 8 years older than you.

QUESTION: I need opinions. 35F & 40M

Hello! Please I would like to know your opinions.

I am 35 years old and my fiancé is 40.
We met through an app and we maintain a long-distance relationship but travel a lot to be able to live together as much as possible.
We met in August 2024 on an app and in September of that year we had our first date since I happened to be traveling to Europe. Living on different continents, I didn't take it as a relationship and I continued dating in my country but I made the mistake of not telling him and acting like a girlfriend from date number one. Big mistake...

In January he came to my country for two weeks and stayed with me, and from that moment on I began to consider ours a relationship and stopped seeing other men. During his stay we had a run-in as I received messages from another man with whom I had had an emotional sexual relationship in recent months, but without being a couple, and when he asked me, I felt intimidated and denied it. The same thing happened when he asked me if I had gone on any other dates since I met him, I also denied it because I didn't feel safe. It didn't seem relevant to me to tell that part of my life, for me it was the past, in fact I never had anything with him again and I rejected him when he tried to approach me again.

In April we went on a trip together for two weeks and the questions began. He was very interested in my past and I didn't like his reactions when I told him. In my life I had two long relationships, but in between, when I was single I was with many men (loneliness problems)
Apparently that intimidates him, given that he was married for 10 years and didn't have much of a single life.
The point is that he asked me and as soon as I gave a little information I noticed an ugly reaction, which motivated me to not talk about it anymore and start hiding.

In June I traveled to their country for a month and met their children. He proposed to me and I accepted, but the issue of lack of trust began again. I knew that I was not being honest about my past, but it was my past...and since I had already denied some things and omitted others, I did not want to change my version of the events, I felt that it did not add anything to do so and I did not want to have bad times. On that trip he grabbed my cell phone and reviewed my conversations. He told me that I had been lying to him and that I had been on dates since I met him until January and he didn't like it when I told him that I had been on dates, that I didn't consider our relationship a relationship until he came in January and that if I hadn't told him before it was because I felt like I was in a snowball of lies and omissions motivated by fear of his reaction. Ultimately we talked and decided to leave the past behind.

I returned to my country and when we were separated I did everything possible to help him feel safe, I called all the time, shared every smallest detail of my life and felt that I lived in a state of having to justify every second of my day. He returned to his country in August and when we were together the topic came up again, he did not accept what had happened and considered it a betrayal. I was already getting tired of that...we had a few more run-ins, but as soon as he saw that things were about to get out of hand and I was thinking about breaking up, he took two steps back.

Last month I made my last trip to his country and I received a message from a friend, I went to listen to it and respond away from him because I simply needed silence and my space and he thought it was a message from a man. In those days he took my computer to check my WhatsApp website and found a message from the man who had written to me in January, he had sent me a message for my birthday a few months ago and I asked him not to write to me and he blocked me. When he asked me if that man had written to me, I denied it, again I felt cornered...I knew that I had not asked for that birthday message and I knew that I had asked him not to write to me anymore, so I preferred to skip the topic, I did not want to open that chapter again.  But he accused me of lying to him and hiding things from him, and at this point I defended myself, as long as I respect him I feel that I have the right to my privacy, and I don't like that control he wants to exercise. He supposedly understood it, although he made me tell him my whole life, and I tried to tell him the whole truth about everything (at least what I remember) he even wanted to count how many men I had been with and that made me indignant and angry...I don't owe him how many things about my past and even less so if he is judging me.

After that episode I decided to try to minimize any type of risk of a new conflict and I began to block people from the past who could try to contact me and I even entered dating apps that I had uninstalled to delete the accounts. In my opinion, uninstalling the app was enough, but I knew that it could be a problem for him and I preferred to delete them.

Last night he called me (I'm back in my country) and told me that he had been searching the dating app where we met and that he found me active. I told him that I had only logged in to delete my account and that I couldn't (when I tried I was in his country and the app asked me for telephone verification by SMS and I didn't have that service covered abroad)
He started to think that I was using the app again and asked me. I told him the truth. Although it was a much calmer conversation without accusations, the way he wants to control me bothers me.

Until now: he got into my cell phone, he got into my computer and he tried to track me on apps. His distrust is justified, but the way he handles himself seems extreme and scares me. I am processing the idea of ​​getting married, moving to another country and being a stepmother of two children. While he controls me like that.

I know that he is afraid that I will end the relationship and the truth is that these behaviors drive me to do so. It makes me sad because without these behaviors he would be ideal for me. We have the same life plans and I know that I can be faithful to him and that he would be faithful to me...he does everything possible for me to be happy in his country and in his life. But this control scares me.

Am I exaggerating?

Thanks for reading.

ANSWER: You SHOULD end the relationship. A jealous insecure man is a man who will control and abuse you. Ask me how I know... Get out now while you still can.

QUESTION: Gifts or trades? F 21 M 23 (2-year relationship)

My boyfriend just bought me some stuff rounding to about $120? He said he did all of that because earlier in the morning I was venting to him about how painful our past was due to his mistakes in the beginning of the relationship (constant micro-cheating for the first year of our relationship) and how it affected me mentally and emotionally. He said he feels for me and reflects heavily on what he did before. I know he changed and I could trust him now. But some of the stuff he does is just kind of confusing. He bought me stuff worth $120 and was very happy to the point I could see him teary. He then brought up how he wanted dutch bros and I was more than happy and excited to get him some. Then when we were about to sleep he starts off by saying “idk if I’m an asshole for saying this but I feel like I also deserve something because I bought you those things” and I asked what he wanted and he answered “maybe a shopping spree?”. I grew up with a mom who always uses things she does for me against me and this was very triggering and he also knows that history. I am always happy to get him things but I feel like whenever he gets me something, he expects something back. I know he doesn’t mean anything bad but to me it’s just confusing. Thank you guys for taking the time to stop by my post! Have a great day!

ANSWER: He bought you $120 worth of stuff but if you decided to spend $120 is this what you would have bought? When he turns around and says now he wants you to buy him things because he bought you things it is time to tell him to stop. You would rather choose how you spend your money so if he is going to spend that much, you would rather choose it for yourself. His gift comes with a huge string attached and that is never good. 

Save gifts for formal occasions where you each have an expected amount that you spend. He can buy you small "I'm thinking of you items" but he can't spend $120 and then tell you that you should buy him things that he wants. He should buy his things without making you do it. Otherwise, it is all transactional and manipulative. He needs to leave you out of the middle of his wants.

QUESTION: I M20 want to confess to my crush F20

Since the beginning of my second year in college I've had a huge crush on this girl and I've never felt like this before, I'm in my third year now and I couldn't have the enough courage to tell her how big of a crush I've had on her. We have took a couple of classes over the past year and I can't hold my feelings anymore, I've never felt this way before even though I was in a relationship, my love for her is unbelievable, she's so pretty and very wifey material. Now I've decided that's enough, for the past 14 months I couldn't stop thinking about her, she's really shy and beautiful. I have sent her a follow request before on instagram but she neither accepted it nor declined it although I made it really obvious that I like her. I was never able to analyze the eye contact we barely made, I really couldn't tell if she wanted me to make a move or not, but at the same time I just couldn't do anything. This semester we don't have any classes together but I see her every now and then and every time I see her I feel a rush in my stomach and get nervous. I can't hold my feelings anymore and I just wanna tell her everything. Any advice you guys got?

ANSWER: If you’ve had a crush on her for over a year and you’re still unsure how she feels, the kindest and safest approach is to keep it simple and low pressure. Since she didn’t accept your Instagram request, it may mean she prefers distance or isn’t sure who you are, so confessing “everything” all at once would likely overwhelm her. Instead, try one small, respectful step: the next time you see her, say hi, smile, or make brief casual conversation. If she seems receptive, you can ask if she’d like to grab coffee sometime. That gives her space to say yes or no without pressure. If she doesn’t engage or keeps her distance, take that as your answer and let yourself move on. You’re not wrong for feeling strongly but approaching gently, without putting your feelings on her all at once, is the best way to respect both her comfort and your own dignity.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How can I (30F) help my parents (67M, 60F) during their split?

My parents (67M, 60F) are splitting up. They have been unhappy for a very long time, and while my dad planned to stick to the status quo for the rest of his life, my mum has reached breaking point and said she wants to separate. I'm trying to figure out how to best support them both during this, but I honestly feel a bit out of my depth and could use the advice.

My parents are SHIT at communicating with each other. They have been and are great parents to me, but they are terrible partners to each other. My dad has been diagnosed with depression since the 90s and refused to acknowledge it or seek treatment, is always in a bad mood, and does very little around the house even though he is retired and my mum still works in-office and is out the house Mon-Fri 8am-5pm. They are constantly butting heads, constantly fighting, and nothing ever changes. I don't doubt that they love each other, but they are an example of two people who probably should not have gotten married in the first place.

The issue is, we live abroad. I moved at 17 to take advantage of an incredible scholarship opportunity, and my mum came with me to live and work here because they did not want to leave their only (and underage) child move across Europe alone. My dad was supposed to retire a year later, but due to a change in my country's pension age, he ended up going back-and-forth for eight years. Even though he has been here for five years now, he has not learned the language, has not managed to make friends, has no hobbies, and hates the weather and food here. He is absolutely miserable, and will likely have to move back to our home country after they separate since, aside from me, he has nothing here, while he has family and his friend group of 40+ years there.

I can't blame my mum - I understand why she wants to separate. I love my dad so much, but he is an extremely difficult person to live with. I am doing my best to stay neutral, help them mediate and support them both, but honestly, all I want to do is forcibly drag them both to therapy by their ears and then have a good cry. 

What can I do to help and support them both through this? If they were younger, things would be easier, but at their age I honestly don't know how to handle things.

ANSWER: > help them mediate

Yeah, don’t do that.  You may not be able to drag them to therapy, but you can be clear that’s the place for them to sort out any non-legal issues.  You’re their kid, and you love them both, which is why it’s not fair or helpful for you to be in the thick of sorting out their issues for them.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (M22) found pics of gfs (f20) ex in her phone and more

Hello, im going through a problem in my relationship that i have been in for almost 2 years now, since the start of our relationship she was very stern with making sure i did not have any women still in my phone, followers, following, pics of old exs, didnt like to see if a lustful post pops up on my feed etc… well recently i had checked her friends on a platform i dont use ever, and i noticed there were 20 men all around our age, attractive men, mirror pics as pfp, and i know for 100% fact that she had accepted them recently after i had held her accountable to her own standard (making sure theres no other people in our social media)  where before over 4 months ago there were no guys she was friends w, but when i checked last week there was that 20 guys… now i see this as a hugeee issue due to how she would treat me after seeing even just old friends that are women in my friends list and stuff to find out she not only went against her own standard but they were ATTRACTIVE, not old friends, she couldnt even tell me who they were… so i know it was for a lustful reason and eventually she had admitted to me that she lied when saying “those guys have always been there you must of missed it before” she even said “ill turn blue in the face before i say what your implying bc its not true” to eventually admit just that. now she claims she did it because she wanted attention bc (and i will be honest) i have not been there for my girlfriend like i should be, i work 60 hours a week and by the time i get home i dont want to just talk i like to relax, play my games, do my own thing.. but that drove her to feel lonely, its not an excusable reason but it is why she did it. so after i found out she lied about that i demanded to go thru her phone which i have never done before, and i found 1 picture and 2 videos of explicit things of her and her ex that once again she swore she didnt realize it was in there. (she takes nude photos of herself all the time that she keeps in her hidden) so part of me wanted to believe that but my gut is just telling me that she had to of known they were there with how she likes to take pics like that.. mind you they had to of been there for over 4 years… and then lastly, i found 3 videos of her mastrubating in my shower (we do live together) in her my eyes only on snapchat which is odd bc she also has nudes of herself in her hidden in her photos app, so why would you need to record 3, 6 to 10 second long videos of you doing that and then keep them in your my eyes only… id understand if it was just one but it was 3.. making it look like she was sending them back n forth with someone. so between the lying of accepting attractive guys, sex tapes and pics of her ex in her phone, and the 3 videos in her my eyes only, i am so fucking tore up with everything, i didnt catch her cheating technically but it really feels like it. and i know that since she wouldnt admit the her approving guys there was no way in hell she would admit if she was sexting those guys on her snapchat or whatever, the whoke situation is extremely sketchy to me and shes full on apologized, lets me go thru her phone if i want to, and has tried to be patient with me due to what i found but i feel like i need some second opinions. what would you guys do?

ANSWER: Something sounds terribly off. 

Me and my boyfriend live together, i moved to where he lives, i know nobody here, i only have 1 friend who lives a 2 hour flight away in my home town, i am currently not working as its been a struggle for me to find work here so im a stay at home "wife/girlfriend" my boyfriend also works so many hours during the week and on Saturdays so I only get to see him Saturday night and Sunday when he is home. 

He also games and so do I so when he gets home, he showers eats and plays video games until he has to go to bed.

I 100% understand the lonely aspect of it but I have never had the desire to look at other mens socials or chat with other men because I respect our relationship and my partner. 

Also what is she taking videos and photos of herself for anyway? If not to send to you then whats the purpose? 

Double Standards and if she can lie about 1 thing she can lie about anything/everything else. Snapchat deletes messages after twenty four hours, so it is easy to hide conversations on there. You know, for a fact that if it was you in that situation, she would be beyond pissed off and would very likely break up with you about it. Because she will never trust you again. But she expects sympathy when she went and became a complete hypocrite, twisting her own standards and demands prior to your relationship. 

Perhaps your relationship could be salvaged or it could be done. And you just need to accept it and move forward. But just know your relationship will never be the same again. And you will doubt her every word her. Every action and it will play at the back of your mind. Every single time, unfortunately, that'll take a very long time to get over and That is something you need to choose. If you want to accept and acknowledge or call it quicks, take some time and find something that's truly meaningful.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (21M) gf (20F) if unhappy with me

My 21M girlfriend 20F gets annoyed all the time by me, she thinks I’m not listening to her for example when my phone cuts off or when there’s a loud sound nearby or she just doesn’t explain well enough and I misunderstand, she gets mad over all that and wants me to leave, wishes I didn’t visit her today etc.
She tells me not to do stuff an then when I don’t do it it’s wrong because I should have done it.. We’ll be moving in together starting December and I’m scared it’ll be the end of us, she gets extremely mad at me and wants to break up over the smallest inconvenience and wishes we never met and stuff, also says she’s with me only out of pity a lot but I believe that’s because of her anger.
I try to do everything for her- cook, ride her to uni from uni listen to her, talk to her but she always finds something that annoys her one bit and everything that she didn’t mind in the moment turns into something horrible and we are breaking up all over again. I feel like I’m not funking up that much myself and she just misunderstands me half the time and thinks I mean wrong. In bed we also haven’t been too lucky as she says she doesn’t enjoy it anymore (said when mad), we’ve been together for 3 years now and our sex has been amazing until like a year now when “the usual” moves and positions stopped working and she couldn’t reach climax for a while now. What can I do better or different to make her happy and not fuck up like I use to all the time now?

ANSWER: I can't imagine being in a relationship with someone who treats you like this. So I assume that she treated you differently before. When did this change and do you have an idea what might have caused the change?

Also, you're asking the wrong question. You need to ask yourself what you need to do to make yourself happy, because the most important relationship you have is with yourself. Don't be sacrificing for someone who treats you like you're worthless.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My teammate (32M) and I (36M) are both in love with the same guy (33M)

For context, this is a recreational sports club, and despite being in the same team, said teammate (let's call him A) and I are not close. Among the new batch of joiners this season, is a guy (let's call him B), B (33M). I think it was pretty much love at first sight, physical attraction at first, but as I got to know him better, I also came to admire and love his non-physical sides. 

Unfortunately, my teammate, A, also has the same crush on B. A wears his heart on his sleeve and is practically an open book with his behaviour and interactions with B since day one.

After some time, I made the first move, and asked B out on a dinner date. He accepted, and during dinner, I just told him the reason I asked him out. He replied politely that at this point in time, he does not have any romantic feelings towards me, and everything needs to start from being friends first. That is a perfectly reasonable rule, but at the same time I also told him that his feelings matter. At the end of the day, if he doesn't want to pursue it, we can let it drop and still stay teammates/friends.

Fast forward to last week during a team dinner, the team was talking about sports as a topic and suddenly, it somehow diverted to A's crush on B and then it just snowballed from there. It became open knowledge to the majority at this point and everyone seems to be very supportive and hoping it will work out (basically shipping A with B hard). B was not present at the dinner that day and he was also quite a mysterious character as he is quite a shy and introverted person. Only a couple of people in the team (one of which being me) talks to B regularly, and soon, some of B's closest friends within the team were asking me for more information about B and whether if A's chances with B was good.

I smiled and just shared what I could, basically giving A tips on how to build better interaction with B. But honestly, deep down, it felt like I was stabbing myself with a knife with every word I said. The team just got more and more excited, teasing A, while A himself was flustered silly. Although, he started to get braver with his actions and finally acknowledged his crush on B.

And just yesterday, an instagram story was posted by A, he had asked B out on a dinner date. I spoke to B a little afterwards, and it seems that he is aware of A's intention from the start. Similar to the answer he has given me, he does not seem to possess any romantic feelings for A at this point in time.

Is it okay for me to still continue my pursuit of B? The team isn't aware of my crush on B, but after the team dinner, I feel like there could be potential drama fallout here if people found out, and possibly mistakenly thinking I'm being two faced and underhanded (considering A has a lot of close friends within the team).

ANSWER: No I don’t see why there should be a fallout, if this new guy rejects him, and then he tells you that he likes you, it would be really juvenile for them to like hold it against you, you’re all grown adults at this point and have the emotional tools to now freak the fuck out

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (M35) girlfriend (F30) never takes any accountability for our arguments

Not American. English as a second language.



Hello!

I (M35) have been with my girlfriend (F30) for about a year at this point, and we've lived together for 5 months.



I think I get unfairly blamed for all our arguments. My girlfriend refuses to acknowledge that what she says has impact, because she thinks as long as she perceives herself to be speaking "neutrally", no one could possibly take offense, and if they do, that's their problem.



I have some codependency issues stemming from dealing with a highly emotionally volatile girlfriend for 7 years. I am aware, trying to deal with it, and I am seeing a psychologist for this. I'm diagnosed with Asperger's and ADD.

She has codependency issues stemming from dealing with an unpredictable mother while growing up. She does not acknowledge this, but instead claims she's an "Empath" with a borderline psychic ability to detect changes in other people's moods. She has no diagnoses, but I strongly suspect that she is on the spectrum after knowing her for two years and having met most of her family.

I have had previous relationships, but I am her first.



I just want to point out before the rest of the post that my girlfriend is an otherwise sweet, caring, and friendly person. I love her dearly and I don't want to end the relationship. I want to be able to work this out. I think we have very different communication- and arguing styles, but other than that, I really do feel like we are good together, like we're a good match. Of course the issues in this post will be magnified and made to look like it's our entire relationship, but we have good chemistry and we like to be around each other. It's just that every couple of weeks, we have an argument that turns sour, where I will be perceived to be 99% at fault, and I will, without fail, be the one apologizing, which kind of bums me out, to be honest.



One reason for writing this is just me wanting to vent my frustrations into the ether, another reason is hoping to get some recognition that my feelings are valid, as I don't really feel heard during those arguments, and whenever I communicate that to my girlfriend, I feel dismissed. I actually don't know how to communicate past that point.



She believes she always says things neutrally, always means well, always expresses herself clearly, and is never responsible for how she comes across.

And I, by default, am always reading too much into things, imagining things, misinterpreting, overreacting, attacking, and being defensive. 

I feel like I'm being gaslighted, but I'm not sure if it's just in my head. 

She has accused me of gaslighting her during our arguments, which I don't truly believe that I have, but I will act as if I have, and try to adjust my behaviour so she doesn't feel that way in the future.



I feel a higher than normal pressure to keep up a jolly appearance, as in her family, negative emotions were a big no-no; displaying anything but positivity meant you were not allowed to participate. Be it activities, or just hanging out with the family. 

She obviously doesn't like this part of her upbringing, and says she doesn't want to perpetuate it. But she does, consistently. She is incredibly affected by the smallest changes in my mood. If I've sprained my ankle, and my positive outlook goes from a 10/10 to a 9/10, she will notice, and be quite bothered by it. 

We've had couple of arguments where she will pathologize me not being jolly and merry and positive for at least 98% of the time we spend together since I moved in, saying I probably have unresolved issues or maybe depression or straight up tell me that something is just always wrong with me and she doesn't understand why I can't just be fine, like her, and her family. 

She says it hurts her to be near me if I'm not smiling and upbeat. However, she also says it's okay to feel down and bothered if there's a reason for it. It's just that there's very few reasons that justify feeling down and bothered for more than 5 minutes. In my estimation, she has not learned to properly handle negative emotions.

So that's a general description of our issues, from my perspective. Now on to the latest argument that led to me writing this.

  


My girlfriend saw a documentary touching on the subject of the masculinity crisis, spoken about by some people who could loosely be connected to 'the manosphere' in our country. She said she felt provoked by it, by these men talking about their experience of being men and what the expectations are of men in today's society, and she ended it with saying:

"I don't understand why men are so preoccupied with talking about their gender, when women aren't." 

That phrasing doesn't strike me as neutral at all, and I think that I was totally justified in interpreting this as being a bit condescending and dismissive. This is also a pattern of behaviour, where she downplays men's problems and says they're entirely self-inflicted, while she stresses the importance and urgency of women's problems. Due to that, I think it was only fair to assume she was making a value judgment with that statement. 

Anyway, I was a bit confused about this, because I think that women DO talk a lot about their roles in society, what femininity is, and what it means to be a woman in today's world, and I think it's only fair that men get to express that too. So I asked her to clarify what she meant by what she said.

She couldn't explain any further, except continuing to stress that men just seem to be so busy talking about what it means to be a man, and that she doesn't get it, because women don't do that. 

I mentioned that I do understand on some level why there is so much discourse around it, because I can relate to some of those issues they speak of, because I felt treated differently for being a boy in school, and my view on dating and relationships were fundamentally negatively warped by the discourse in the early 00's. 

She asked for examples of how I was treated differently, so I told her about being constantly compared to the girls and belittled for not being like them (by teachers). This provoked her, and she called me out, saying I went on the attack and was playing the victim. From my point of view, I was trying to stay as neutral as possible, despite being somewhat agitated because I felt she was invalidating me and my experiences. She claims that she always says things in a neutral way, (they don't often come off that way to me, as she usually has a tone) and I get punished for not interpreting her in the best, kindest, and most gracious way possible. I think it's worth noting that she never gives me the benefit of the doubt in these situations. I always get interpreted in the worst way possible, and not once during our entire relationship has she uttered the words "I misunderstood you."

I also just want to point out that in no way did I say anything to minimize the issues women face, and I've always validated her when she's shared things from her perspective. 

Towards the end of our argument, she said that she didn't do anything but pose a neutral question, with no opinion or value judgment tied into it, and that I made a whole thing of it. 

This is always the given reason: She says something totally inoffensive in a completely neutral way and I just completely blow up over it. 



The details of the argument itself are obviously not important, so please refrain from commenting on that unless you deem it absolutely necessary to get some point across. What I deem important is the asymmetry; everything I say and do is an attack, everything she says and does is neutral. Ever since this first happened, I've tried harder and harder to speak as calmly as I can in these moments, and I think I've improved my composure a lot. It has not made a difference to her, though, as I think the mere fact that I become agitated at all is enough to set off her defenses. 

It bothers me, because not being allowed to be upset when someone is invalidating you feels controlling and dismissive to me. I do not get personal when it gets heated, I have never called her mean things. I just sound a bit out of breath because my heart is beating faster and harder.

She has also said that sometimes she might not want to validate my feelings because the problem is me being too sensitive. I fully admit that I am an above average sensitive person. The thing is, she is too. But that doesn't stop me from validating her feelings even if I might actually truly think that her complaint is overwhelmingly rooted in her sensitivity. Feelings don't care about facts.

We've had a number of arguments where, from my point of view, she will say something a bit incendiary, or conflict-seeking, maybe about a social issue, and I will respond to it by asking for clarification on what she means, and I will give my opinion up-front so she doesn't get blind-sided if there's disagreement. I think I do this very calmly and neutrally. This, however, instantly leads to her feeling attacked, and claiming that I turn into someone else, someone she doesn't like.

In all honesty, I can get a bit agitated; my blood pressure spikes and my heart rate becomes elevated. However, this only shows up as me seeming a little bit out of breath. But I think this is completely normal.

She claims to have been able to have such conversations with other people without a problem. She has also said that she and all her friends all agree on basically everything, though. 

I believe she brought that fact up to further pin our disagreements on me, but I haven't had any problems with conversations like these with other people either, despite common disagreements with my friends.

For some reason, we simply can't talk to each other. I'm fine with us being roughly 50/50 at fault, but she pretends like it's 0 on her and 100 on me.

I feel really misaligned by her, like she sees me as an unreliable narrator; she never trusts my interpretation of any conversation, regardless of whether it's between us or between me and a friend, colleague, or family.



I could probably write pages about this, as I'm an excellent ruminator, but I should just stop here and pose my question:

Have you managed to salvage a situation like this? Have any of you had any luck in couple's therapy with issues like these? 

Is there a reasonable way forward, considering I don't want to end this relationship? Any advice on what I can do to just break the cycle?

I know people will be inclined to recommend breaking up, as we haven't been together for that long, but the connection we otherwise have is not something I want to risk losing, so that will be an absolute last-resort.

Thank you for reading, and I wish you well. 

Apologies for the post being a bit all over the place, it's my first time posting anything on reddit.

ANSWER: You want her to argue by your rules and the way you think an argument should take place. That's not going to happen. This is her first relationship so you may want to try some counseling but don't expect the therapist to tell you who is right and who is wrong. If the goal is to get better at listening to each other, then it should help.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (20F) girlfriend (26F) refuses to get a new job and is horribly depressed at her current one. How can I help her?

Hi there! Sorry in advance if my english isnt the best, its not my first language.

Anyways, ive been dating my girlfriend for about 3 months now and we are very happy. We met in March working together when i started a job at a pizza place where she had been working for two years prior. My girlfriend HATES this place and is miserable at this job. She said me working there was the single good thing that ever came from it.

After 5 months of working there, i had to leave due to my mental health. She stayed, but her resentment towards that shitty job grew each day. Recently, she decided that she finally wanted out, but first wanted to get a second job so to not be without an income.

Thats when the trouble started. She tries so hard, spends so much time searching but is incredibly picky about what jobs she wants to apply to. She didnt go to university so the jobs she is applying to are mostly retail and stuff that only require a HS diploma. The thing is, she applied to maybe 3 ou 4 jobs and called it a day. Thats not how it works!!! I was also looking for a job to have during the weekend because im in university and applied to about 15-20 offers and only got 2 calls back. I now have a job and i keep pushing her to send out more applications but she says nothing sparks her interest, and that she is losing hope, saying stuff like "i will be stuck at \[pizza place\] forever" and when i try to cheer her up about it and say that no she wont, she says "its easy for you to say, you left and found a new job" YEAH, cause i applied to well over a dozen jobs!! I try to send her interesting job offers but she always has an excuse as to why "it isnt a good fit" for her.

Im worried for my girlfriend because this job is really taking a toll on her mental wellbeing and i just want whats best for her. i love her so, so much and as much as i try to help her find a new job, my efforts seem futile. Its like she does not really want to leave that damn place as much as she says she does. What else can i do??

Thanks for reading

  
TL;DR: My girlfriend is incriedibly picky when it comes to applying to jobs so she remains at the same shitty place ans wont stop complaining even though i tried to help her, and its rlly affecting her mental health.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Am I (33F) being disrespectful? Or is he (38M) being intentionally difficult.

This is between me (F33) and my husband (M38). We’ve been married for almost 6 years. 

We have a toddler childtogether, I am working full time, he stays home with the child. 

Tonight, I put the baby to bed which was a long process (toddlers, eh) and then was picking up the toys in the bathroom. My husband came into the bathroom and started talking to me about something that happened today. 

I was engaged in the conversation, was not ignoring him or being dismissive, however while carrying on the convo I continued picking up the toys (the task I was doing prior to him entering the bathroom). 

He flipped his lid and told me I was being disrespectful for continuing a chore when he wanted to talk to me. I told him we WERE talking, I’m perfectly capable of carrying a conversation and also picking up toys.

This was a few hours ago and he’s still mad despite me trying to smooth things over by explaining that for me, it’s easier to quickly get my chores done and then spend time together rather than stopping mid-task to chat/cuddle then start the task again. 

He is insistent that what I did is ridiculously rude and means I don’t want to spend time with him - which is a slap in the face tbh as I’m usually the one asking to sit together/watch a movie/have sex/etc. 

Anyway I genuinely am confused and seeking an outside perspective because while I can see where he’s coming from, I think he’s overreacting and just got pissed that I didn’t (literally) drop what I was doing for him but he is saying that I upset him by being disrespectful and not spending time with him.

ANSWER: On its face and taken in a vacuum, it seems like an overreaction on his part. 

But I’m guessing there’s a lot more to it. Maybe I’ve got it all wrong but here’s what I think happened from his view.

You are gone all day working and interacting with adults. You probably often have work stories you share. He’s home all day with a toddler. You come home and dive right in to seeing your kiddo, maybe making dinner or doing bed time, pick up, whatever. You’re busy. You’re important. He wants to share something about his day and picking up toys takes precedence for you—making him feel like his day and his contributions aren’t valued. 

And as this probably happens more than you’re even aware of, he doesn’t feel like having together time and sex because he doesn’t feel seen except for when you want something.

I totally feel it from your side too. It honestly kind of pisses me off when my partner cuts in while I’m busy making dinner or cleaning or whatever to tell me about some insignificant (to me) thing or shoves a phone in my face to show me a reel. It interrupts my momentum and derails me a bit. (ADHD and evenings are the worst after my meds are wearing off)

But I do stop what I’m doing and look at him and engage else his feelings will be hurt. It honestly IS rude. Even if you feel like you’re engaged, it doesn’t look like it. I mean…let’s say you were running a meeting and one of the participants was looking down at their phone and typing away. Would you have the impression they were listening and engaged? Probably not. Lots of people CAN multitask but it’s considered poor form to not be looking at the speaker. 

I dunno. I could have it all wrong but I don’t think so. I think he’s feeling less than.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My girlfriend (20F) and I (20M) have been together a year, but her hot-and-cold behaviour is draining me and I don’t know how to keep going

After a year of constant confusion, mixed signals, and emotional ups and downs, I’m starting to feel completely worn out. We’re both 20 and in the same class in college, so every day I’m carrying this heaviness into the classroom with me. I never imagined that someone I care about would also be the person who exhausts me the most. I like stability, communication, and feeling understood. But she switches between affection and irritation so fast that I’m always on edge. One moment I’m important, the next I’m told I drain her. She says I’m slow to understand, that I talk nonsense, that I’m not comforting enough, and that she needs “me time”  which is fine  but sometimes that “me time” feels like I just completely disappear from her world.

I keep trying to catch up to what she expects, trying to adjust, trying to improve instantly, but nothing seems enough. And because we see each other every single day in class, there’s no real space to breathe or clear my head. I’m not even angry anymore  just tired. Tired of feeling like nothing I do lands right, tired of trying to match someone whose moods flip without warning, tired of feeling like I’m walking on eggshells with someone I genuinely care about.

What I’m struggling with is this: I know something is wrong, I know I’m emotionally drained, but I don’t understand why it’s so hard to deal with it or step back when every part of me feels exhausted. How do you cope when a relationship starts to drain you daily but you still have to face the person in class every morning?

ANSWER: Find someone else. Your expectations have failed you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (30M) always wanted to move overseas, getting the feeling partner (27F) does not. How to navigate discussion about it?

Relationship is relatively new still, 8-9 months, and when we first got together I expressed how I wanted to live overseas in Europe for about 18-24 months. She had wanted to travel and live in different regions of our home country, and so was also up for the overseas adventure. 

The start of the relationship was long distance, about 3-4hr drive, seeing each other most weekends. And then when she moved back to her home town it became more difficult, needing a flight to get there. We've made it work so far, and I am moving down there in 2 weeks time.   
  
I said to her early on, that moving to UK was pretty much a non-negotiable for me, and that if she wasn't on board for that, I would have completely understood and we'd go our separate ways. She said she was definitely keen. 

Initially I had planned to move around March/April 2026, however after meeting her and her explaining she wouldn't be able to make that work due to a few factors (saving for mortgage buffer, savings to move etc.), we decided to essentially push this out a year to March 2027. 

In the last two months or so, I've noticed that any time we've discussed the move in passing or she's mentioned how she's chatted with friends about it, it seems it's becoming increasingly pushed back. One comment a couple weeks ago "I was talking to 'xyz' telling them we might be moving mid 2027 to Europe.". And then tonight, discussing budgeting etc. when we move in, she was making a bit of a song and dance about how much she'd have to save to move, with enough money saved to cover mortgage repayments (even though it's tenanted and new lease for 12 month has just been signed). 

I get the stress of owning a house is hard, and wanting to ensure financial buffer in case the worst happens. 

However I'm getting a sense she's starting to prolong this idea of moving or maybe even sway it to not happen. For extra context, my best mate and his partner arrived in Europe last month, and my original plan to be there in 2026 was to be there with them. Come March 2027 I'll barely get 2 months with them before they head back home, any later and half the point of the move will be gone (to explore new countries with my best mate). I feel like she hasn't factored any of this in from my end. 

I know I need to discuss and bring this up with her, but how do I navigate that conversation in a way that isn't accusatory in nature or will cause tension?

ANSWER: So you're planning on uprooting your life to the UK to be gooseberry to your friend and his girlfriend for a couple of months. That's quite a half-baked plan. What's in it for her? That's likely what she's thinking.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I 31 F and my partner 44 M have been together 4 years long distance

I recently expressed my feelings of not feeling loved or seen and this was his response … how would you interpret this??? A little reassurance would have been nice you know…

Me-  What I saying in 4 years … for the past couple weeks I’ve been thinking and as I said before, you don’t make me feel safe emotionally, you don’t make me feel loved or seen, there is no clarity, a lot of confusion, there is no trust,  this relationship doesn’t feel like a partnership, it feels more transactional and as I’ve said multiple times I’m a burden in this relationship and you have agreed. And you have called me selfish on a couple occasions and I can say now I agree… I am selfish, selfish in the sense like… you have 4 kids kids.. different kids mothers, and that’s all fine but I can’t compete with that… I rarely see any direction or leadership. You have supported me a lot and I appreciate that and i appreciate you helping me financially. I love you.. I care about you alot.. but something just feels different and I don’t know what it is… if someone have your time and attention that’s fine .. just let me know … idk if it’s the distance or the hours I’m working… but you don’t give me the vibe that you want to be with me long term…. And that’s weird cause it’s almost 4 years…. Idk… I could be overthinking ..: but that’s how I’m feeling right now

Him- No one have my attention actually but it’s kind of crazy how all of a sudden you’re saying you believe youre selfish and saying you can’t compete with my kids mother which you never had to do. What you’re doing is trying to feed me bullshit with that statement. This relationship is transactional and you don’t feel love and seen are you serious. Like honestly speaking everything you do the first place you refer to is social media and this is from the beginning of the relationship. You don’t respect anything I say even if I’m trying to provide leadership or even support. You try to hide when you’re trying to do good like I have some malice against you. I share everything with you but that’s a one way street. What I’m trying to say is you don’t need to make excuses if you don’t want to be with me. Do not beat around the bush, just come out and say it. You have your eyes on something else or this is not what you want don’t waste my time.

I have contemplated on what you wrote and said and honestly I don’t know what to say, there is no accountability of any sort from you on your role in this relationship. I’m not going to write a long message but all I have to say is I’m not going to rush into anything especially when I’m not seeing  certain qualities. I have realized that no matter what I do it is not enough for you and I have done a lot, but still for everything positive I do there is always some negative reasoning in your mind where I am concerned. This stage in my life I’m not trying to sway anyone mind about me, so what I’m trying to say is if you’re feeling so discontented your best option might be to walk away. The only thing I ask is once you do decide to go, no matter if you miss me stay where ever you want to go. I don’t mind being friends but let’s do it from a distance. I am tired of the merry go round with you where I do and you think it’s trivial, but you’re willing to go someone just because they take you on a date and do the most you see no problem with it and be disrespectful enough to send it to me because you did not like what I was saying. I on the other hand fly you out, give you money, plus herd you saying you wanted to go Croatia, get money and accomodate that and all you see was I ain’t give you enough spending money. Honestly speaking yea this relationship seems transactional because the  only times I get interest from you is when I’m digging in my pockets. So you decide what it is you want and just tell me and I will abide by that.

ANSWER: If you don't see him up to 6 months the relationship is going nowhere. Surely you're better off with a local guy you can see every day?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I(35f) exhausted with husband (35m) and our communication is breaking down, how do I fix our issues

Length of relationship: 10+ years

Situation:
I’ve been with this avoidant–dismissive personality for a long time, and at this point, I’m tired of discussing in circles. I’m highly logical and empathic in my friend circles and at work according to friends and colleagues, but my husband perceives me as highly emotional.

After every argument he turns it into “who is right vs who is wrong.” I’ve explained to him a million times that we are a team. He is highly argumentative and takes everything through logic, and anything I say while fighting is “irrational” to him. He thinks emotions are not facts, and not indicators for any assessment. Meanwhile, I consider emotions as information.

We have a communication mismatch. For example, if I tell him “what you did was hurtful,” he immediately starts defending why he is not wrong. I’ve tried to make him understand that what I feel is what I feel. I have the right to feel hurt. Because he gets too defensive, we can’t move forward and resolve anything. He goes in circles, and it’s exhausting.

When I cry or get upset (even about something unrelated), he invalidates me by saying things like “You are feeling upset unnecessarily. It’s not a real reason.” If I tell him his comment upset me, he insists he hasn’t said anything mean and keeps justifying himself.

His mother sometimes makes subtle comments like, “Well, we know our son better than you do,” and he never says anything. When I bring it up later, he tells me it wasn’t a taunt and there is nothing to feel bad about.

When we go in circles like this, I get super overwhelmed and I cry very hard. I know I need to work on how I react, but the invalidation just breaks me. According to research, his personality is practical, avoidant, and dismissive. I’m an ENTJ with short-term anger issues, and after my anger passes, the invalidation drains me until I cry.

We also have a dead-bedroom situation. If I don’t initiate, nothing happens. I’m self-pleasuring all the time. He will only do the things he enjoys (cooking, tech research), and nothing that helps our relationship. I also need to stop bringing this topic into every argument, but the whole situation is connected and overwhelming.

Right now, I feel clueless and tired. I feel like running away. Couples therapy is extremely expensive where I live and has long wait times.
He says, while we wait for it, we should do a psychometric test, I don’t know whether that will be relevant and useful 

My question:
Using everything I wrote above, how can I communicate with someone who is avoidant–dismissive without ending up in circles and emotional exhaustion every time?
I’m looking for specific strategies that don’t rely on therapy, since that’s not immediately accessible.

Edit-
- He loves to cook for me and when I’m injured and can’t help much around the house, he will do everything selflessly without any complaints,so I wouldn’t say, love is not there. His love language is act of service I think. However, I want us to work on how we take care of ourselves our emotional sides and reducing conflicts. Because at the end of the day we both agree that, these fights impacts me a lot more on the health side.

TL;DR:
Long-term relationship with an avoidant–dismissive husband. Every conflict turns into right vs wrong, he invalidates emotions, gets defensive, and nothing gets resolved. Dead bedroom, lack of initiative, and no curiosity about improving the relationship. I’m exhausted and need advice on how to communicate without going in circles.

ANSWER: I'm afraid that you have psychoanalyzed the shit out of the situation and you're unable to see the plain truth: Your husband is emotionally unavailable and your relationship is dead. You have 10 years of this pattern, it's not going to change without therapy (it's not going to change with therapy either most likely). It's an illusion to think that if you just communicate in some special way, things will click for your husband. Communication is a two way street, you can't compensate for his bad communication by putting in more effort. It has to go both ways. And he doesn't seem to care much.


You only have two options: accept that this is your life (would not recommend) or divorce.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (24F) can't get past my feelings for my best friend (24M)

I (24F) have had feelings for my best friend (24M), for the better part of the last 9 years or so, and can't seem to move on from them because of this "gut feeling" that "someday it could happen" (which I do view as ridiculous, and tell myself as such).

For the back story: He and I met back when we were about 10 or so (it has been so long, I can't remember exactly), but became better acquainted and started talking more when we were around 12 or 13. We met at our church's youth group, which happened every Wednesday, and at the time, did not attend the same school. Our conversations at the time consisted of mainly gifs and memes on FB messenger, but in person, not much would be said unless it was meme related. Even though I had a small "crush" on him at the time, I felt strongly for someone else, which he was aware of, and we had conversations about that as well. Sometimes we didn't talk for a few weeks at a time, but the conversations would always start up and continue like we hadn't stopped talking at all (I attended a different school than him up until half way through my junior year of high school).

I started attending the same school as him after I turned 16 (and by the way, he was the only one out of the 4 people that I invited that actually attended my birthday party). He was a grade below me, as I started school a year early, but we still had a class together due to some of my transcripts being messed up. In said class, we didn't talk or sit near one another (he preferred the back, and I preferred sitting near the front due to my eyesight being bad), but we would bump into one another in the hallway occasionally and walk to class together making jokes about random things. At this point in time, my feelings for him were apparent to me, but I hadn't said anything to him or acted upon them, as I still had strong feelings for the other person (the same one from when I was 12).

Lots happened in a short amount of time after starting to attend the same school as everyone else from my youth group (like the last year and a half of school flew by). The guy who I originally had liked more, and who had been stringing me along with empty promises for the better part of 4 years, ended up having a girlfriend (who he had been with on and off for a few years at the time). I spiraled a bit and in an attempt to make him jealous, got together with someone else, which ended poorly due to a girl I thought I was friends with. Jumped to the next relationship quickly afterwards, this one being with one of his friends, but that ended abusively (I had also graduated while in that relationship (2019)). My initial plan was to be single after that relationship (and said guy I had "stronger" feelings for and I stopped talking at this point), but I kind of stumbled into a relationship with my coworker which last nearly 2 years. At some point during high school, I had admitted to having a crush on my best friend, but he played it off as if he had feelings, just didn't want to admit them. (My time in the public school system was not ideal, and I realized that)

During all the relationship chaos I had, my best friend and I still talked, just with more gaps at times while I was working and he was still in school. The feelings for him were there, but muted and pushed aside as I was in relationships. He was always there for me though, and we would hang out occasionally, which he was always a gentleman and acted as such (i.e. walking closer to the street, insisting on paying for things, and getting out of the car to greet me and my family whenever picking me up). A few months after my 2 year relationship ended, I realized I still had feeling for him, and once again told him, but he said he wasn't interested in a relationship with anyone because he wanted to focus on his school and job, and said he didn't feel the same towards me.

There has been jokes and playful flirtation between us for years. I have known that it's unhealthy to continue this infatuation I have for him, but even when I stopped talking to him for months on end, once we were talking again, the playfulness and feelings came back almost instantly. I've been in another relationship recently, which ended back in March of this year, but have been single since. My best friend and I talk nearly every day, and I'm sure it's apparent to him that I have feelings for him. At this point, I don't want to ruin our friendship because he has been there for me through thick and thin (LOTS of other things not listed in this post). He always says stuff like "maybe in the future" and "if it happens, it happens" when it comes to talking about relationships (he has never once been in a relationship the entire time I've known him). My family loves him, and he even comes over to help my dad work on his truck (even if I'm sick and can't be around (I live on my family's farm separately from my parent's currently while saving money after my last relationship flopped)).

Do I just continue on like normal? I'm not ending the friendship or cutting him out of my life. He's one of the only friends I have, and I know from experience that distancing myself somehow only manages to make the feelings come back stronger. I believe I'm to the point of, "if it happens, it happens," but I'm also a tad distraught thinking about him getting into a relationship with someone else in the future, and I feel like that could be what ends the friendship. Not that I would want it to, it just feels like it would fizzle out, and not be the same. In some part of my mind, I can envision a future with him and I together, but I keep pushing it back because again, I don't want to ruin the friendship.

I did used to think he liked me back, and at times I can still see it, especially given how he treats me (one example being, he hates hugs, but knows that I love them, and will always give me a hug when he sees me, even if I don't ask). It's like I'm fighting myself consistently over what I see, and what I want to see. Recently it's been getting easier to just get past the feelings, and there's been times where I've thought that I'm over him. However, he goes and says something incredibly dorky or sweet, and I just can't help the feelings and thinking to myself how much I love this man..

Has anyone ever been in a situation like this? Is there a way to move on from someone while still talking and keeping in contact with them? I know it's not a healthy thing that is occurring, and the best thing to do would probably be to cut ties completely, however, after so many years and having him as a constant in my life, I can't bring myself to do it. Maybe I just ignore the feelings and leave it at "if it happens, it happens"?

ANSWER: I’m sorry if I’ve missed it because you’ve given a lot of information, but have you actually told him how you feel? If he doesn’t reciprocate and you’re committed to not cutting him out of your life then you’re also committing to suffering. Some may disagree, but for me it’s no longer a real friendship when one person has romantic feelings for the other.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (20F) don’t know if I like this guy (28M), any advice?

I feel so stupid man. Thing is I don’t think I’ll ever really like anyone ever. I’m neurodivergent + other mental health issues which have fucked my relationships with ppl 😞 I used to think oh I want to get married in my early 20s and live that life, so stupid ahh 😭 I don’t even see myself getting married atp, dating even. It makes me feel sick 😭

This guy I matched with on freaking tinder in maybe may or end of April. I have a VERY specific type lol, and he is that. I didn’t think anything would even happen, his account wasn’t very filled out I thought I was gonna get cat fished ngl 😭 And I made that tinder acc, cause while I don’t think I see myself dating I wanted to have sex and try that instead. Me and this guy barely talked over texts, and even when we matched he started off very sexual in the convo. So I just assumed ok he’s a fuckboy but that’d work for me 😭 I just wanted like a casual hookup or fbws maybe. I also thought he’d maybe even ghost me after the first time 😭 

I met him twice and slept with him, but that was in June. I don’t live in this country rn, but I visit every year and I’m back again now. I plan to move here anyways after uni, and getting some job experience. Or potentially doing a year abroad to. 

Anyways idk 😭 idk how I feel about him. I genuinely wish this just was just someone that doesn’t care about me at all 😭 but then like, we never message, this isn’t dating 😭 I don’t mind just sleeping with him. And thing is he only really messages me anything sex related. So like I’m not crazy for not seeing this as any normal relationship? I’ve never dated before or done anything before this btw 😭

I also don’t know what my level of people pleasing is, and how high it can go 😭 Cause I somehow already feel like I got myself into this mess and I don’t see how I would even leave this relationship even tho we’re not dating 😭 He’s said love you through texts, and it makes me feel ble. Obv he doesn’t mean it and it’s casual cause like we barely know each other 😭 And then today he said babe through texts and uhh it makes me feel sick thinking about it 😭 Ahhh. Right now I’m tried from traveling so I feel more off but then sometimes I see his pics and I’m like yeah he is hot dammit 😭 and I wanna sleep with him again but then like I don’t think I wanna date. Idk any advice? 😭

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (28F) Fiancé (31M) doesn’t get my love language, advice needed

Super long post apologies. I don’t even know where to start. I just got my MS diagnosis after my second relapse and I’m so exhausted all the time. This is my first ever post and I feel like such a horrible person. 

Me(28F) & Fiancé (31M) recently got engaged and the wedding is less than a year away. We started dating when I was 23 and after a string of shitty relationships through college I finally felt like I found the one. He was a breath of fresh air honestly, always extremely respectful and genuinely an amazing partner. Very thoughtful, something I never experienced (ex: anticipating my needs and extremely trustworthy) After being cheated on in the past, it was nice to feel like I was with someone I would never have to question. Loyalty is extremely important to me.


About two years into our relationship I noticed the effort slowing down and it gave me a pit in my stomach. Then my first relapse happened. I was bed bound for 8 months. The entire 8 months he stayed at home with me in case I needed anything which I felt awful about but of course deeply appreciated(most guys in their late twenties would have ran for the hills) However, I would be crying in bed so depressed because I didn’t have answers about what was happening to me and he would be in the living room, basically just ignoring me because he “didn’t want to stay in the bedroom.” I was extremely suicidal at the time because my symptoms were unbearable. When I say suicidal, I gave myself 3 more months to get better or I would end it.  It hurt, but I try to think that him even just staying home was good enough support. 

Fast forward to my recovery, the efforts (planning a date night, spontaneous surprises) were still not there. I had a conversation with him about why things had changed compared to when we first started dating and he said “well because we’ve already been together for so long” I guess I understood but felt like I had still been putting in the effort on my end so it hurt. I always felt like in relationships passion will go up and down but that you need to make the effort and the choice to keep it alive. 


I tried confiding to my mom about it but she said no one else would have dealt with me being sick for so long. And that I should be grateful. 


Fast forward to our engagement after talks about our future, I was over the moon. But I still had a pit in my stomach. My thought was what if I stay with someone that is never going to start putting in effort that I need to feel loved. This is important because I know he loves me - but it’s the things I need that aren’t there. I always get a big gift from him on holidays or anniversaries, but all I want is a handwritten card. Something personal. In 5 years,  I got one card and it was after practically begging for it so it didn’t end up meaning as much as I thought it would. 

Emotional support. The amount of times I’ve cried myself to sleep and he’s fallen asleep next to me snoring while it’s happening. Even after the death of a family member. When I brought this up, he said he doesn’t expect emotional support from me so he’s not used to giving it.

Taking interest in MS and coming to one of my doctor’s appointment. That was also like pulling teeth. He has no issue bringing me there but to actually stay and listen to what the doctor is saying is I guess annoying for him. My friends and family fight over who’s going to be there with me during my appointment. He couldn’t care less to be in the room and would rather just hear from me after. 

Any part of wedding/honeymoon planning. He visually gets irritated if I even bring it up and just wants me to make all the decisions. Not because he’s not excited, but because he doesn’t want to deal with any planning. Literally won’t even help me pick a menu.

He’s an amazing guy. Truly. I feel guilty even making this post because I love him so much. And for every negative thing that I’ve mentioned, there are a million things that I love about him. But I’ve thought about calling off the wedding multiple times because of that pit in my stomach and it terrifies me. 

I also think he might be depressed because he hates his job but has been having trouble finding a different one.

Are these normal things? I try to rationalize by thinking about the good for example:

1. Yes he may not want to come to my appointments but he always takes out the trash 
2. Yes he may not be emotionally available at times but he never makes me carry anything heavy 
3. Yes he may expect me to do all life planning but he’s loyal to me and stuck by my side through a scary diagnosis
4. He never makes me feel guilty for needing to rest, calls me beautiful all the time
5. Yes he may not know how to give emotional support but he didn’t grow up in safe place to talk about his emotions so it can’t be his fault


I’m not blind to the fact that there will never be anyone that’s perfect, neither am I. I’m extremely emotional and always need attention from my partner. 

And I can’t picture having a life with anyone else. But I’m scared. I’m scared that I’m never going to receive the love language I need. And yes, I had the conversation with him and told him I was second guessing the wedding because of these feelings. Didn’t get a card for our anniversary but got some pretty flowers. Also terrified the stress of this situation is going to send me into another relapse. Have been taking Xanax daily to manage the feelings.

ANSWER: You have thought about calling off the wedding many times.  You have a pit in your stomach.  Please postpone the wedding.  It bothers me that you have asked him to go to doctor appointments with you but he won't go.  In sickness and in health means something.  My ex wanted life to be carefree with no problems, no bills, no stress, etc., but life isn't like that.  Your fiance continues to mentally and physically check out of the relationship repeatedly.  You need someone you can count on.  We all do.  I wish you the very best.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [30M] think my partner [40F] is cheating on me. What can i do now?

We are together for more then a year. We dont live together and she prefers to meet at her place. Due to my work schedule, i can go to her place every two weeks. I mean, every day of the said week. I think that things are going pretty good between us. From daily troubles to bedroom, everything works. Heres the thing.



Shes recently chaged job. For the first few months everything was fine. In the last few weeks otherwise.... Suddenly, she become distant. Due to my job, i cant afford to always pick up the phone, so i prefer messages, but ofc, after work i totally fine with it. Lately, she doesnt want to talk in message. She always want to talk and if i cant pick up we dont even talk. Just seeing what i wrote, and thats it. Then i hear that a I dont care about her and we dont communicate. Out of nowhere, she started picking fights. She started to stay at workplace cuz theres a so called gym bycicle what se can use to workout. The thing is, she has a pretty good one at home, and also a running pad. When we talk, she isentioning another guy from work, from time to time. Most of the time, it looks like shes mentioning him unintentionally. After she mentioning him, her face changes, realizing that was a mistake and she changes the object. A few weeks ago i had to go to her new workplace cuz theres my dentist. The guy who her mentioning lately saw that shes come to talk to me. That we are close. (At that point, i didnt know anything about him, she didnt mentioned him yet.) That guy just looked at us so strangely. Like something is wrong. Like something doesnt addig up. It was weird. When we walked up on the staits we walked past by him, and they just started at us first, then started a conversation with her. She just shutted him, like "we will talk later".



We had fighting in the past few days, and i told her that i have this feeling. I assured her that i dont accuse her for anything, just that something is not okay, something changed. Right now, shes trying to reach out more again, want to write messages again and want to meet again.



For the questions about trust comes up, shes cheated on her husband with me before divorce, cuz he neglected her, abused her and was not able to "stand up in bed". I was not the first one shes cheated on him with.



From my experiences, i guess shes hooking up with that guy. I have a strange feeling about this all. Once im the best partner she ever had, then out of nowhere she has problems with me, no time for me, only to fight.



Pls, would you like to share your opinions with me?

ANSWER: I think you know the answer, dude. You don’t need us. 😕

================================================================================

QUESTION: AIO? fil (70m) has been living with us for 3 months now by myself because my partner (30m) refuses to create boundaries

First time poster long time scroller. I’m on my phone as well so sorry about any grammar mistakes. I’m going to get straight to the context because it’s a long one. I (30f)  have been with my bf (30m) for about 2 years now. He is originally from UK and I am from Australia. Partner moved here 12 years ago and has stayed ever since. We have both been in long term relationships previously that haven’t worked out, which is why I got so excited when we started dating because I knew he was everything I didn’t know I wanted. Kind, funny and so considerate to my feelings. Him and fil own their own boat over here and so his dad comes from uk for about 6 months every year and stays on the boat. From the get go I have loved fil. We get along so well and he is so generous and loving towards me which is where my confusion is. My partner and I were staying at my parents for a while (massive house and completely rent free) but recently moved out into our own little apartment which we love and rent. This was 3 months ago. The boat was also out of the water and unusable as it needs a new engine and insurance work done which took ages. His dad still decides to come over from UK even though partner said don’t come I don’t know where you’re going to stay. In a rush we bought a mattress so he can stay in our spare room 3 days after we moved in until the boats done. We moved on our own accord, not because of this. The only thing is, this same week my partner has been spending his weeks away working meaning that it has just been myself and fil most nights. No warning no nothing from bf just “yeah, dad has to stay with us” but it’s not us it’s just Me. Nobody asked me if this was okay, not even a text from fil or a discussion with partner if I feel okay about this. The boat is now back in the water and fil can stay on there to give me space but he chooses not to. Is it weird that I stay in this house by myself just with his dad? Context: when we were at mum and dads bf never stayed there without me and we were more like guests which is why we moved because we wanted our own intimate space. Being a big house too it was easy to avoid each other and am so grateful to my parents for allowing us to do this. This apartment is so different and so tiny we live in each others pockets but my partners not here. I’m angry at my partner because not only does he not know how to set boundaries with his dad but doesn’t even talk to me about how I feel before he just up and leaves? Now I feel like I’m resenting both him and fil for putting me in this position. Fil is also an amazing house guest and so kind and thoughtful still and does almost all the cooking and housework which is why I’m getting really down because the guilt of me resenting him is killing me. I have a really stressful job and just want to go home and not talk to anyone. All I want is my own space and not feel like I have to entertain anyone after work. So I have now channeled all of these feelings onto my partner because I think the way he up and left and just left me to be okay with everything and not even talking to me about it is so weird. Giving fil a key and also I never know if I go home if fils going to be there or not because sometimes he stays on the boat which is now fully functional for him to stay on. I’m currently writing this sitting on the river avoiding home because I know fil is there but at the same time my bf is gaslighting me (while away) saying I should go home because fil cooked me dinner. Any advice on how to tackle this without ruining my relationship with both fil and bf would be amazing. Help a people pleaser out redditers

ANSWER: You are mad at your bf for not setting boundaries with fil. But at the same time you are not setting boundaries with your bf

Just sit your bf down and actually talk to him about this and set some clear boundaries.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Help please!! I (25F) want to break it off with a situationship (24M) that just began, how do I navigate this?

For context: we had began texting just right before Halloween and honestly the conversation was very boring and dry in the beginning before we had seen each other. It started to feel like pulling teeth to get to know the person and I honestly would stop responding but he would always text back and I just didn’t understand why? It had been like a week and he never brought up plans to meet so finally one night I did cause I was lonely. I also was only looking for casual sex/fwb type of thing, I never wanted anything serious. So I invited him over and we honestly had a good night and it was nice company to have in getting to know one another. After that, he started saying how he liked me a lot and would repeatedly say it. And I mean I liked him too but I don’t think it was much as he did. Fast forward, he comes over again and we pretty much do the same thing we did and again, it was a nice night but he has gotten very vulnerable very fast. I allow him to vent and ask questions because I know some people may need a safe space and I’d be happy to be that. He seems so be suffering from severe depression and anxiety because his life isn’t in order. I just try to be encouraging in that area. Lately though, he has been saying things that indicate he clearly wants a lot more. I never saw us being together and definitely don’t want that now as he clearly has his own problems he needs to figure out and I don’t think someone like him should enter in a relationship with anyone at this point. I don’t even see why he would? It’s been a week and a half since we have been seeing each other physically and it seems to be moving very fast forward him. Recently, he has shown suicidal ideation which is scary to me and I’m unsure of what to do. I actually want to break this off because I don’t mean this in mean way but I did not expect him to have this much baggage and I feel like I got way more than I bargained for. Not only that but I even gave him money because he said he didn’t have enough to cover his phone bill and needed something to eat when he left my house..I have never done something like that and it really turned me off because we are not together and it’s only been a week and half, well a week when that happened. It also has made me question, does he like me so much because I have my own place, a car etc? I also don’t want him to get comfortable enough to ask for even more favors like driving my car or staying in my place without me there…We are now at a week and a half when the suicidal ideation came because he also just recently lost a friend like very recent. I want to be there for him but I also want to let him know I just want to be friends although I know he damn near wants me to be his wife! I don’t even think we should be having sex anymore because of his mental health struggles, I feel at this point it’s just taking advantage of him although I know he wants to still. I just feel so bad because he’s been so vulnerable and I don’t want him to think I’m judging him. I’m just concerned. It’s still early so I want to nip this in the bud before I feel really stuck. I also want to be sensitive to his situation. How can I navigate this?

ANSWER: Just be blunt but chill. Hit him with something like, “I think you’re going through a lot, and I’m not in the place for what you want. I need to step back from this.” Don’t ghost, but don’t make it about fixing him either. Keep it firm

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I talk to my boyfriend about handling arguments? 20f 22m

Hi all! I am really struggling with a situation in my relationship regarding emotional reactions on both sides and am not sure what to do about it. Should we stay together despite these things?

Me (20f) and my boyfriend (22m) have been together for almost five years. We started dating in high school and moved in together about 2 years ago now. Things were really great our first two years, hit a rocky patch our third year for a few months, and came back from that patch better than ever some time after that. Now, for the past 6 months or so, both of our abilities to remain calm and/or productive in arguments and discussions have been called into question.

My boyfriend has struggled with anger issues his whole life, and I have been very sensitive and prone to emotional freakouts my whole life, though I have never struggled with anger in any way -- all of my emotional instability has been primarily stress related. We talked about it in high school a lot and we've been able to help each other through these things for our whole relationship. Lately, that seems to have been changing, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the direction things are going. When we're not arguing, things are wonderful, and I truly think that there is no one else I would rather be with in those times. Our arguments, though, have been so intense lately that I'm not sure I can handle it.

The last argument we had was related to how I was making a recipe in the kitchen. He is a much more organized person than me, so we try to avoid being in each other's way when doing certain tasks (for me, I cook like a madman, and he doesn't react well to seeing the kitchen in shambles. I can't handle his particularity when washing dishes, so I steer clear lol). This particular day, he was frustrated and started asking me about everything that was out in the kitchen, why I had utensils out, why was this dish out, etc etc. I get frustrated when feeling micromanaged, thus was the case in this situation, and he perceived my shortness as a sour attitude. I explained I was feeling micromanaged, and he expressed that he felt like the rules we had collectively established were being ignored and he felt unheard. Upon trying to explain my reasoning for some of the things he criticized, he got angrier and angrier to the point of this whole thing becoming a screaming match, him claiming to feel unheard and me claiming to feel harassed. I asked if he could just leave for a moment which made him respond even worse, and he started saying some really awful things about himself and me, to which I started shutting down, crying, and left the room. He apologized for the things he said but was still just as angry after apologizing, and this cycle just kept continuing, with him in my face and me feeling cornered and unsafe to some extent (even though I KNOW he would never lay a hand on me), and my lack of participation in the conversation making him more and more upset, neither of us being able to calm the other down or deescalate the situation as a whole.

The thing that scares me about this is that I truly cannot understand how he gets to the point he does. He has had a much more traumatic upbringing than me, and I have heard similar things from many people in my life, but I just can't comprehend ever saying some of the things he says to me when he's in the height of his anger. He always apologizes deeply after we have this level of argument and he calms down and realizes the weight of his words, but I think he goes red in the moment and I have zero idea how to handle it. What makes things worse is that we've discussed how he needs to feel heard in order for him to calm down from his anger and I know what methods will help the situation, but I literally become stunned in these moments and cannot move, speak, or think. I've tried to explain this to him but he has said that he can't comprehend not being able to say anything just because of a minor confrontation. It's difficult because I believe the root of all of this truly is that we both have vastly different bars for what type of confrontation is acceptable and what is not. Because of this being a foundational issue, I really don't know what to do to solve this recurring problem. I feel lost, and so does he, because we keep finding that we fundamentally cannot understand each other's perspectives on these types of conflicts.

Uh, yeah! That's the gist. There's more lore I can get into but I think this is the main issue at hand. Thanks in advance :)

QUESTION: Finally leaving my(22F) relationship of 1 year with a 25M. Suggest if I am doing the correct thing?

✓ blamed me for his credit card application being rejected??

✓ Called me bitch, how and what not to the extent I doubted my existence and wanted to commit suicide conflicting damage to my body and having a surgery and still defended him in front of everybody

✓ Called me the reason for him not being selected and for not being his lucky charm when he applied for an institute because I snatched my phone after he tried to message my parents that I am having a cyst in my throat when literally the next day I had a conference to attend and I barely got time to spend with my parents

✓ Called me his bad luck, that I bring bad luck into his life by staying with him

✓ Called my mom cold hearted multiple times (jokingly) and my parents forward thinking and too modern and judges me and family calling me an idiot and immature

================================================================================

QUESTION: I(26M) Not very experienced with serious relationships and I’m concerned that I might possibly be getting emotionally abused by my new partner(24F).

Would like to preface by saying I’m(26M) really hoping for some perspective on my situation. I’ve only been in one other relationship in my entire life and don’t really have the friend group my partner(24F) has to constantly lean on for relationship advice and to back me up.

We’ve been seeing each other for about 4 months with things really ramping up in the last two. We met through mutual friends that she is much closer to, I’m worried I’m going to lose them because they don’t see my side of things. 

Lately my partner has been needing reassurance for everything what seems like every hour. Tonight, she accused me of liking one of our mutual friends(her best friend) and I thought it was utterly ridiculous to even suggest that. I had a horrible day that included crashing my car, this mutual friend checked up on me while my partner kind of brushed off what I was going through. Because I mentioned the friend’s support it came off as her thinking that I like and share more with the friend. I truly was not in the mood being perpetually exhausted of having to constantly reassure this person while as a man not feeling like I have that same expectation to keep my own feelings in check with others.

So I chose not to play into what felt like a very obvious attempt to guilt trip me into reassurance once again. This was after I had mentioned having a horrible day. She just kept trying to pry reassurance and validation out of me for the 100th time today. UPDATE: She’s now apologizing after carrying this on for over 2 hours.  She acknowledges that she knew I was upset and yet kept pushing me but can’t explain why other than “she may be insecure but ultimately knows how I feel about her”

We had a mini-episode of something similar this past weekend, and our mutual friends got very angry with me calling me immature because I told my partner that I just felt like this insecurity and need for validation was starting to feel toxic, manipulative, and exhausting. Almost like I was indicating that my partners feelings were invalid and that my side was no factor. However, I truly feel like I’ve been trying as much as I possibly can to communicate and reassure them but days like today where I’m just drained I couldn’t. 

Story may have 100,000,000 holes so all questions are welcome. 

At what certain point, can constant reassurance and validation be used as a manipulation tactic and where do I go from there?

ANSWER: Personally, that kind of behaviour is a deal breaker for me. I understand that it comes from a place of insecurity and low self value,  but it is unfortunately not one you can fix with love and reassurance, the individual doing these behaviours has to work on their self esteem and communication. This behaviour usually will cause consistent problems throughout your relationship unless you isolate yourself from friends she reacts like this about, which is never an acceptable option and if you do go down that route then the behaviour won’t stop it will just be about any random you interact with like women baristas, waitresses etc… 

I would not call it a manipulation tactic, it’s clearly a missguided form of communication and call for affection. Sometimes in relationships you must provide more intense reassurance for your partner and vis versa. 

This definitely warrents a big talk between you, you gotta ask her to communicate to you when she is feeling insecure so you can give her some reassurance before those feelings grow and become an outburst. 

But if you go down the route of increasing open communication and this behaviour doesnt stop, then it probably won’t until she personally works through her self esteem issue.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Is this normal (24M & 23F)

For context me (24M) and my partner (23F) have been having a lot of issues with our relationship recently which led to me temporarily moving out, during this time my partner contacted me requesting I come home to sort things out, when it came to discussing why we are unhappy I brought up that I would like to have privacy because they have a habit of using my phone and going through conversations with friends and family then will use anything said that has nothing to do with them as a way to cause an argument, at this point they turned to me and said “privacy has to be earned”, since hearing this I am struggling with that concept, I don’t have anyone I can speak to about this and I would like to see if this is normal or a breach of my human rights YES or NO?

ANSWER: this is…. odd. i get the fun of being like hm what do you talk about with so&so? but to the point shes fighting over it is an issue and a huge red flag. you are grown and it’s clear she’s looking for a reason not to trust you. she’s trying to control you and to me it seems veryyyyy unhealthy.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (20F) am scared my boyfriend (23M) will break up with me because I’m too depressed…

As long as I’ve been alive, I’ve wanted to die. Some are born happy some are born sad. 

I’ve always wanted to die, I’ve tried to kms a few times over the years. Since I met my boyfriend it’s like I’ve been reborn.
He has changed my perspective and mindset on a lot of things.
The one thing he has not been able to change is my perception of life.

Now he’s told me that he at times is unsure if we’re ever going to last since I still hate everything. I really want to be the best for him but it’s like whatever I do I just can never be happy.
I understand him so fucking much, while he tries his best to get his life to a perfect point I just drag him down again.
I get him, I understand him. Being with a depressed person is literal hell.

But I don’t know what I’d do without him, I am so scared to even think of a life without him. He’s the only friend I have he is the only person that I care for. I live for him.
And that is so horrible. I feel so bad for him. I want to change and I want to get better but it seems fucking impossible.
I hate so much about everything, nothing matters at all. I have no purpose (except to have children) but that’s not possible rn.

I am so overwhelmed and feel like I’m at a crossroads not knowing what path to take. I don’t want to be a burden on him, but I know I will probably never be genuinely fucking happy. Especially without him.
How do I get better, how do I keep him loving me even though I get depressed? I feel like I have no options…

Ps. I do go to therapy, I’m still in the beginning stages. And I know it takes time and is a journey and all that but I just can’t loose this guy…

ANSWER: are you sharing these thoughts with him? do you share with him that you’re trying and making steps in a direction that can be beneficial.

you getting into therapy is making an amazing decision for yourself. don’t put the value of trying to change your life on this relationship. all it’s doing it giving you the space for hope. for possibilities. sometimes that comes from life and sometimes it comes from people. something out there wants you to stick around and right now that’s him. 

you can do this with or without, you’re doing it and i’m happy you’re here. tell him, be vulnerable and keep going <3

================================================================================

QUESTION: My [20M] long distance girlfriend [22F] lives with two dudes [25M and 28M respectively] and I don’t feel like she respects that it bothers me.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for just over three months, and lives with 2 guys, about 70 miles away from me. I knew this before we even started dating, and it didn’t really bother me because of the circumstances plus I trust her fully. However. I had to leave to Boot camp for 2 months and since returning the situation bothers me a lot more. I still do not have any distrust towards her, but she spends way more time with these guys and seems to include them in everything. Always wants to play video games with all 3 of us, when before it was just her and I. One of her roommates she works with, carpools with, and she cooks them both meals so imo she spends a little too much time with them. As adults they should all be independent but they do almost everything together to a point where it seems excessive. 

I told her this and instead of trying to understand my emotions and maybe find a compromise, she just repetitively gave me reasons to “not be worried” and it really hasn’t helped at all. The last couple days we’ve been having way more arguments and fights over petty stuff and it’s very hard to deal with with the distance between us, only being able to communicate and connect through phones or video games. I think that’s a part of the issue, as she’s been playing games with just her two roommates a lot and that hurts because it feels like that’s my only time to connect with her during the days… in the evening, but I also think a huge part of why I’m getting irritated is because I’m holding resentment over this roommate situation. 

How do I talk to her about this without sounding insecure? I want to address it not as a trust issue but a matter of, I’ve been gone for 2 months and want to spend as much time with her as I can. just her it’s our relationship, not ours and her roommates. I feel like so far my feelings aren’t being validated, and it’s causing me to be more harsh with her when that’s the last thing I want. Any other advice is appreciated

ANSWER: “I knew this before we even started dating”

“dating for just over three months”

i wouldn’t change my whole living situation or friendships for a guy i barely know, and who knew about the sitch before getting with me.

You HAVE to talk about it from the standpoint of “my emotional need is spending at least xyz time with you per week. I miss you. etc”, rather than mentioning the guys.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (21M) girlfriend (19F) is spiralling out. What should or what can I even do?

Hello all,

Before I say anything about my girlfriend, I must say she is a great person, otherwise I wouldn’t have fallen for her. We have been together for one year, and we both study the same course at the same college, together with our friend group making up 5 of us.

This year 4 of us got invited to an award dinner by our head professor, leaving her missing out. She expectedly felt very upset about this as anyone would when facing academic disappointment. However, the disappointment turned into targeted anger very quickly. In text messages she began to call all of us very bad names and wishing for horrible things to happen with the head professor and his family. I told her I would not go to this thing if it made her that upset. 

When we talked in person she eventually fully broke down and decided that we were over. I knew this pattern before because when she is really scared and angry she does this - she used breaking up as ammunition. I did not fall for it, and I said if that’s what she wants and will make her feel better then let it be. However the more I let her talk it out she eventually stopped acting crazy angry. She said sorry and said that I should go to this award, and after I said “no but I said I wouldn’t”, she said she would be more affected at me not going out of pity than otherwise.

So we made peace. I helped her clean her room; I told her to have a nice relaxing shower; and I tucked her in bed and embraced her. The next day (day of award) I cooked lunch for her, and she revealed to me other stuff she was really worried about in her personal life, and I was there to support her throughout. She continued to tell me me to go to the award and so I decided to continue with it.

Big mistake. Just before I was about to go off to the award I check my phone to see she said something along the lines of “are you actually going to this” along with name calling everyone. After the dinner she was very angry at me for going and accepting this award and was blaming me for not standing up for her.

Ultimately, I am honestly doing her justice by giving this account with this level of detail. It was a lot worse. And I’m not trying to frame this narrative to benefit me, but seriously… I get invited to this, together with our friends, but she gets upset at me and threatens to break up? Then she gets better but quickly loses it again?

I don’t know what to do here, or what I can even do. Right now I’m telling her that I don’t believe in her accusations, and I won’t turn it into a court room because I don’t need to defend myself, but if she’s willing to be sensible I’ll talk to her.

Let me know what you guys think

ANSWER: Just end it. A good girlfriend would be happy you were getting an award, not trying to guilt you out of going. She needs to grow up, sometimes you don’t win, that’s life. Just tell her it’s not working anymore, and be done with it. Way too much drama.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [34M] and my GF [29F] hid the extent of her past encounters with her partners and i recently found out and I need advice on how to handle it?

Hey everyone, so this has been bothering me for a long time now. Ive been dating my girl for two years now and the first time she hung out with a guy friend i had a bad feeling about him since she said she knew him from collage. She was honest with me and told me they hooked up in college way back in the day when i asked if there was any history. Btw we are long distance so its hard to be there all the time and keep an eye out. Second time she said she was invited to a concert that her friend was throwing. I never heard of this guy and felt uncomfortable right away and i asked her if there was any history since she knows him in college as well and she said no hes just a friend. Eventually she didn't end up going to the concert cause she saw uncomfortable it made me feel. Fast forward last February and shes visiting me for my birthday and she gets a snap from the concert guy. She opens it buy doesn't respond but when she goes to the shower I get curious and I go through her snap. I see back in the day maybe like 6ish (maybe more) years ago they shared explicit sexual messages with each other. I call her out when she gets out and she tells me they just made out in college and it was nothing. I take her word on it thats all it was cause the way she worded it and described it it was a one time thing.

Recently we got in a fight a couple of months ago where we didn't talk for 2 days and when we started talking she mentioned one of her friends reached out to her for dating advice. I never heard of this guy so i started asking alot of questions. To cut this short it was late night conversation at 4 in the morning and when i wanted details about this conversation she couldn't remember cause she was drunk so i ended it with her because no girl that has a guy should be on the phone with another guy at 4am drunk especially when her boyfriend has never heard of him. The next morning when she was sober she was ready to tell me everything. She lied to me until i made her show me the texts and than she told me the truth so after that I had my doubts about everything including the two other friends she told me about. I gave her the ultimatum tell me everything now or im out.  So that the first guy she had a huge crush on in college she ended up telling me they slept together 2-3 times in college. When i started dating her, she told me this was her best friend and he even had a cute nickname that i told her was inapporpriate. I got upset at that because her wording and the way she made it seem it was a one time hookup and nothing more. Maybe it was my fault for not asking the extent but I feel like I shouldn't have to ask.  Then I asked her about the second friend. I learn to find that she was in college but he already graduated and they met on tinder (which was never mentioned). After grilling her I find out they made out 25+ times including the last time was 2 years before she met me in 2021. Obviously im pissed especially considering how long it happened. She said there was no feelings and it was just something comfortable when they were drunk.  So basically 6+ year thing but hiding that from me and only when i found evidence she down played it with her wording. She said they never did anything more than make out . They dont associate or talk anymore and the last time she hung out with him was in 21' on his bday when the last made out. Anyways I'm having a hard time getting past this. I know she loves me and she regrets her past. The second guy she claims is ugly so I ask her to show me a picture of him and she would be like he deleted his instagram (cause he is in trouble with the law now) until I gave her another ultimatum that you show me or its done. Right away she was able to find a picture. P.S. yeah i dont know what she was thinking choosing that for that many times.  I know she hasn't cheated on me since she's met me but her lying about her past and having guy friends that she has hooked up with while she was with me and didn't tell me about leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

Ive told her about all my sexual encounters. Including one friend who was legit one of my closest and only girlfriends that I made out with once 5 years ago who she made me stop talking to her and made me block her. I did that without hesitation cause I would do anything for this girl.

Oh and also i told her to tell me any other guys she's affiliated with if there is anything I should know and she said no until one day her best friends boyfriends best friend (her and her best friend were roommates and the two guys are roomates) who also became really close friends with her cause they hung out all the time. One night she called me crying saying "dont get mad but i have to tell you something" and she told me she hooked up with him a couple years ago  cause she was in a bad place because the guy she liked led her on and she found out he had a fiancee. So she was really upset that day and got really drunk and ended up sleeping over at his place and sleeping with him. I hated that cause i gave her a chance to come clean and she didnt. I was visiting  her last month at her best friends. boyfriends birthday and all everyone infront of me would bring up or talk about was him. Like "did you see him" "have you spoken to him?" "did he say hi to you?". Like hella fucking disrespectful and annoying as fuck.

Just looking for some advice as I really love this girl but its been really hard for me to get past it especially the second guy cause it went on for so many years and she told me there was no history when i asked even though they only supposedly made out 25+ times. Do i let this go or how do i try and get past this?

ANSWER: There is no reason this guy should be in her life and also no reason she should be so defensive except if she has an emotional connection with him. Also lying again and again means who’s to say she won’t lie about the extent of another circumstance? Lay down clear boundaries and if you don’t get met with agreeance and respect then you have your answer

================================================================================

QUESTION: I F20 am worried my BF M24 isn’t attracted to me.

I am worried that my bf of only 4 months is not attracted to me. I am worried that my bf isn’t attracted to me anymore. For context we have lived together two month yes I know that’s fast but it kinda just happened and there’s been no issues with it or anything in the relationship at all besides this which I might just be making up in my head. When I first started talking to my now bf we would talk about our relationship goals and what we wanted and they aligned perfectly and still do without issue..except for our sex life he told me one thing but now I’m thinking something’s up…I told him from day one that I was very sexual person not in an unhealthy way it doesn’t impact my outside life at all I just have a very high sex drive like I’m talking I want to have sex everyday multiple times a day pretty consistently BUT I do not expect that from anyone because ik that isn’t normal I would be completely satisfied with not that. When we first started talking he told me that a high sex drive is something that he would want in a partner and I told him the same thing and that I do have a very high sex drive so much so that when we first met to hangout for the first time we did have sex wich we discussed if it was ok that if when we hung out would that be on the table and we both agreed (I brought it up). After we started hanging out in person we would have sex everytime we saw each other before we moved into together which was almost every other day sometimes hanging out for weeks at a time. Now that we have been living together I feel like the frequency of us having sex keeps going down. Keep in mind I haven’t changed any physically I haven’t stopped trying to be appealing to him I keep up with my hygiene and trying to be hot or whatever for him and I initiated things on occasion tho I have slowed that down because he has turned me down a few times and also when we do have sex it is always him asking like “how’s dinner, sex , sleep sound?” He makes it sound like a chore that he has to fit in asking isn’t the issue it’s that he only does it this way and never just lets it happen naturally nor does he make time for it to even if it could we have a very scheduled and routined life which I like for the most part. I do not bother him or ask him anything about it or tell him I want more  because  knows that I want to have sex all the time but I don’t and have never pressured him into it or anything else. Some time I ask him if I can give him head just because at first I thought maybe he just is tired from work so I just was trying to focus on him  and making him feel good and like I’m attracted to him and also I enjoy it a lot. Just to clarify our sex isn’t like hours long or crazy or anything it’s extremely normal sex that last for like 20-30 mins MAX. I am sorry this is so long and poorly worded I just am worried he isn’t attracted to me anymore and I really want to have more sex with him without pressuring him or making it feel like a chore.

I was going through a really tough time (primary caretaker to a dying parent with cancer, who passed a couple months ago, I'm currently holding my family together) and it was nice to have him as a partner, even though he sometimes took more effort and energy than my dying parent.

He has significant mental health issues that he refuses to address (extreme emotional instability, inability to get a job/house/car, narcissism, etc.) and after our break up a couple of months ago, he won't stop trying to sabotage my life.

He didn't come to my parent's funeral or support me in any way when they passed, in fact he was upset I wasn't supporting him in the last few days my parent was on this earth, so the breakup was very easy for me and a weight off my shoulders.

It wasn't for him. He's devastated and acting out. We both belong to the same semi-pro sport community in our city, and he has been terrorizing all the men that play with me, assuming I am having sexual relationships with them. I'm not. My ex is the only person I've been with this year. I very recently started talking to a new guy, and of course he's heard about that and threatened him too now.

He just lost his job because I reposted a video of the community sport facility that he works at on Instagram showing me playing there with my friends (nearly all higher level players play there), and he assumed I was sleeping with a guy who works there. He threatened him and was fired from that facility.

I've already told him, multiple times, we are no contact. He ignores this and texts me consistently with nonsense and accusations, which I have not indulged in defending. He spreads random rumors about me being a terrible, toxic person, but has no facts to back this up because all I do is work, play my sport and support my family. He cannot handle the fact that I will never be with him again.

What else can I do to get him to stop trying to sabotage all of my friendships in this community and stop threatening all the men in it? Some people are starting to avoid me now simply because they don't want to be threatened by him, which is understandable.

  
tldr: super salty, emotionally unstable ex won't honor no contact, is spreading rumors about me, and threatening men in our mutual community for existing in my vicinity - how do I get him to stop contacting me and threatening others?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [19M] broke up with my first love [19 F] and am broken. How do I cope?

I finally decided to tell my girlfriend of 5 years that I wanted to break, and saying that I just wanted better for both of us.

That was yesterday and I was strong about it at first, but tonight, I’m completely destroyed. This looming feeling of me being unlovable just keeps looming over me. I tell people what I did and my decision, and they said that they agree that if I was putting myself first, I did the right thing. I like to think I did so too, but god. I can’t help but feel terrible, like I ruined everything. Our friend group is broken now. I lost my best friend. Everything just feels wrong.

She was my first love, my first kiss, all of it. I need to know how I can possibly cope with this. I don’t know if I’ll ever meet someone that I can trust like this again. I’m scared that I’ll never find anyone that’ll ever love me the same. Or even anyone that can be accepting of me.

I always struggled building connections with people, as I’m terribly socially anxious, and often misread social cues. I’m so defeated. I feel like I failed her and myself.

ANSWER: Keeping a relationship going for 5 years at such a young age is impressive, you guys have grown up together but are now coming into a stage of life where both want to do better for yourselves. It’s good, it’s okay and of course it’s hard. You have lost someone you love, even maybe still love them.

First love is the hardest but another will come around again and you’ll be stronger, maturer and you’ll know what kind of love you want when you’re ready. 

It’s okay to feel broken. Just take it easy, one step at a time.Take this time to reflect on yourself, how to become better, I’m not much older than you are and this is the prime time for you to focus on your goals.  

Also, If your best friend was truly your friend you shouldn’t have lost them completely. I hope the relationship didn’t end on a bad note, seems like it’s the type that ends with “I love you, goodbye” in a way that’s harder than the toxic breakup. 

You’ll be okay i promise.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I, recently turned "20M", like a "18F" and have absolutely no idea what to do. Does she like me back?

Okay, long story short, I liked this girl, and she found out I liked her. After that, it got kinda of awkward between us, but someone pointed out that when a girl likes you, she can be awkward around you. I caught her looking at me, and she would catch me looking at her. I was kind of scared, so after I found out she liked me, I sort of avoided her for two weeks. During the two weeks when we meet IRL, she says hi to me first sometimes. And also she talks to me. I had to go on a trip to Italy, and she knew, and I told her (and her friends) that if they wanted anything, I could try and get it for them. She still texted me to get her something even though she knew I liked her. The reason I think she doesn't like me back is that when we text, she is pretty dry... is that the big giveaway? Is there any way to get her to like me back? Does she like me back?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Feeling disconnected (25M) with my boyfriend (21M)

I've (25m) been feeling disconnected from my bf (21M) for the last 3 months. We've been together for over a year.  

After a very bad date I started to question a lot of things about the relationship and how I got here. Some of those things: 

 I don't really feel loved, there are certain little unintentional things people do that let's you know "Omg this person cares for me", in his case I feel like if I got into a car accident, he'd first ask me "Why where you in that car?" "Who else was there?" "Why was that person with you?" and then he'd ask me if im okay or how I'm doing. Another instance, live location, I did this in the past and it felt like a security meassure, but with this guy it feels like im being observated 24/7 instead of security meassure.
 It's been hard to picture myself with him in 5 years... I care a lot about my professional growth and I've been doing so since school and college. Right now he only does college and I hate the feeling of him not caring about it, or failing some classes while having the free time to study.
 I've noticed that since the begging of the realtionship we have had this dynamic where I'd put his limits first and be so aware that he feels comfortable because I was scared that if I stood up for my limits he'd leave.
 I have resentment towards him for things he has said or done in the past, where I didn't even get a my bad from his side...

I hate myself for doing this, but I've started comparing him with past relationships, I would never directly tell him, but sometimes I be thinking "This wouldn't have happened in any of my previous relationships"...

Some things I know can be talked and solved, but some other issues... How do I tell a guy he should care more about his future (since he is just studying at 21) or that he should care more about making me feel loved than controlling me or studying who follows me on IG.  
  
I've also noticed for the last few months he has been treating me better out of the blue... This has made having the conversation harder....

I know after a conversation about this, I'm going to have more clarity, but how do I even start that convo?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Thoughts on this between 18F and 18M?

Throughout pretty much my (18F) entire high school life I’ve had a big crush on a friend of mine (18M). In recent years I’ve made it pretty obvious, basically confessing to him and every time this happened he would play along but as soon as anything actually serious would happen or intimate he would act disinterested. So immediately I stopped and had told myself that he wasn’t interested in me. And then not even a couple days later he would go back to texting me and flirting with me. This cycle happened for so long (I can’t believe I let it) and it pretty much destroyed any confidence I had.

Recently, after his best friend had told me he (my crush) wants to hookup with me at this 18th party we were both going to, he sent me a long message apologising for everything he’s done saying I was super pretty and genuinely a good person but getting with someone was a big deal to him. To which I replied that I really respected that he was able to stand by that and I thought he was lovely and ultimately told him he didn’t need to be sorry because he was just confused. I was absolutely heartbroken, I had exams which I managed to get through but it was a really horrible time. For about a week I just felt like crying all the time because it was finally over. In this time I had only told a few of my friends and kept it secret.

When the 18th party came around I had a lot of fun, managed not to drunk talk to him or anything which i was proud of. Afterwards we (all my close friends-including him) went to my house and we just chilled cause my parents were out. Here he spent the whole night with one of my few friends I had told this whole situation about on my couch. I tried to be a good friend and be respectful but when I asked her about it she told me that he kept coming up to her and asking her to hook up and get together which left me feeling sick. Furthermore, when she said it’s disrespectful to do on my couch he said “please, we can just go outside.” Basically just chasing after her the whole night.

I also heard some other things from friends, as we are all in a pretty tight group, that he had only written his apology message to me because my close friend he was interested in didn’t feel comfortable with him leading me on.  I’ve been feeling horrible about the situation, of course I feel sooo angered by him but I’m mostly sad about my friend. I had noticed she had been acting weird around me for a couple weeks so I’m assuming she was texting him, but I think she thought I didn’t like him anymore. Also mutual friends between me and her were acting weird to me, and it’s making me overthink so bad. Even after talking to her and settling everything out, I thought we were ok but she’s been acting distant and honestly I just don’t know how to feel. If you’ve got this far, does anyone have any advice or just been through something similar?

================================================================================

QUESTION: M21 crush on coworker F21. Advice?

I'm a 21 year old guy, and I have been working at this pub part time for about 3 years as I get through college. This past summer, I didn't work for about 3 months due to an internship,  but then I came back once it was over. When I was gone, a girl my age started working there as well. Its been a few months, and I now realize I have a huge crush on this girl. I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how I could potentially navigate this. Personally, if she turned me down, it would be no big deal for me, as its just a work crush, but the last thing that I want to do is to make it awkward for her and everyone in case she's not interested.

The reason I'm really hesitant is because one shift she told me how one of our other coworkers asked her to hang out, and she lied and said she was talking to someone else in order to turn him down.

I know this industry is known for coworker relationships, but I am still young and very new to this kind of stuff so any tips on how to approach or test the waters would be appreciated!

ANSWER: Don't sleep with coworkers if the relationship fucks up things get messy at work. Also be aware if you ask her out she can complain sexual harassment to management. Its not worth it. Keep her as a coworker I am sure she does not want to get hit on.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (20M) girlfriend (19F) refuses to get the help she knows she needs and it frustrates me to the point of considering ending things

My girlfriend (19F) and I (20M) are both in our second year at a large public university. She has recently been having a lot of trouble with her mental health and well being in the sense that she feels consistently “out of it” and is acting more depressed and down than anything else. When we first got together almost 9 months ago, I was drawn to her super optimistic and positive outlook on life and how friendly she is. I see myself as kind of the opposite of that, being much more introverted and I tend to be pessimistic. We have fought very little throughout the relationship, with only two prominent arguments that stand out to me. The most recent of the two was due to issues that I had that made me consider ending things with her. I run very differently to her, as I will go crazy without time to myself with my own thoughts, where she on the contrary needs constant activity and social interaction to stay sane. I began to feel like spending time together was a chore and I didn’t have any desire to set up even the smallest hangout. We talked it over about three weeks ago and I felt like we were in a much better place. We have both struggled with mental health issues in the past, and importantly to this issue is her therapy. She used to see a therapist weekly until about 3 months into us dating. Her parents, who were paying for her families health insurance, decided that it was too expensive and they no longer have any health insurance at all. As a result of this she could not afford her therapy appointments anymore and lost the spot with her long time therapist. She has been progressively getting worse and worse since then, with her self described bad habits and tendencies coming back. She is getting worse at communicating how she feels, as well as just being generally in a bad or anxious mood the majority of the time. This was not how it was when she was still with her previous therapist. I told her that it might be a good idea to get a new one and she agrees, but it almost feels like she is making up excuses not to. She says she can’t afford it, which is fair, but our university has resources that provide counseling for free. Then she says she doesn’t have enough time to start over and rehash past traumas and explain why she is the way she is. This frustrates me because I tend to try and fix things for the people I care about even when it is not my place. This is an issue we have discussed, but I still struggle with it. I try and be there to help her but I know I really cannot do anything besides be present and listen. I offer ideas for solutions and ways she can get better, but that may not be the right thing to do. I just can’t understand why she wouldn’t pursue therapy or other things that she is certain would make her feel and get better. It feels like I am dating a different person than who I first fell in love with. Reflecting back to our last argument I think this was the main thing that fueled my original feelings. I wanted to break up with her not because she is in a bad spot but because it seems like she is doing nothing to try and get out of that bad spot. She has made me a better person and helped me improve myself. I have gotten myself out of mental lows for her sake and with her help. Is it unfair of me to expect the same from her?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (20F) feel like I hardly get to see my bf (21M) and I'm not sure how to deal with it?

I want to preface by saying that I have a good relationship with my bf, and I'm not one of those Redditors who is just saying that to cope. We're respectful of each other, we get along well, we communicate well, everything. I just feel like I have a bit of a hard time dealing with the fact that I don't get to see him all that much. 

I just feel like his job takes up so much of his time. He gets a couple days off but he pretty much has a full-time job with hours that makes it difficult to see each other on his work days, so we just don't. We wait for when he has a day off, which can sometimes also be a gamble because he also has school and his family, which is totally valid. But I'll eagerly wait for him to have a day off, then when it comes he's busy and can't see me. To be fair, this doesn't happen all the time, but when it does it's hard not to feel disappointed since I'll have to wait practically another whole week on top of the one I already waited. We're not at a stage in our relationship yet where we can visit each other's houses (he's met my family but I haven't met his) so that makes things a little more difficult. 

I really do love this guy. It feels like everything else works with us except for this one thing. I would talk to him about it but I feel like that wouldn't be a productive conversation, I can't just tell him to quit his job or find another. Also, before anyone asks, yes I am my own person outside of the relationship. I do have hobbies, I have school, friends, and a part-time job. It just feels like I have way more free time than my bf does, and there's many days where I'm alone and bored and I miss him and just want to see him, but it's not possible. One tiny part of the reason I started dating him was because he lives close by, so it would be easier to meet up, and I'm someone who feels more fulfilled with in-person quality time. It seems like he wants to see me too, he says he misses me, it just feels like there's this huge roadblock between us sometimes and it feels like it's out of our hands. I don't know what to do.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (M25) committed to my LDR partner (F25), but we haven't talked in 2 months. How do I define this relationship moving forward?

Hello everyone, I (M25) am really struggling with a confusing situation. I feel like I'm committed to someone who isn't committed back, and it's making me feel stuck.

The Background:  
This is the first serious relationship for both of us.

Duration: Known for 5 months, officially dating/exclusive (on my side) for 4 months (since July).

Distance: This is a Long-Distance Relationship (LDR). We live about 2 hours apart.

The "Commitment": I told her in July that I deleted my dating apps and was only focused on her. She said I was the only guy she was talking to, but she later told me she "doesn't like labels". The lack of a clear, private label (like "boyfriend") wasn't a big deal to me at first, but now that I'm seeing no/low effort from her, is making me wonder about the status of our relationship.

The Problem:

For the past few months, I've felt like I am the only one putting in effort, and my relationship goal (finding a solid, serious partner) is stalling.

Firstly, communication has tanked. We used to text and talk daily. Now, we haven't spoken on the phone in over 2 months. I initiate about 80% of the texts, and her replies are short (few words) and more delayed than they were when things were warm between us.

Secondly, she makes no time for me: She is in dental school and legitimately studying/working 16 hours a day, 7 days a week (until late December). We last saw each other in person 2 months ago. I offered to visit, and she said no, stating she was too busy and would feel bad if I traveled for such a short visit.

This leads me to conclude that our priorities are misaligned. I am prioritizing this connection, but it's clear I am not a priority for her. I feel like a convenience or a distant friend rather than a partner.

I raised these issues multiple times, asking for better consistency. 

The core of her response was:

\- She values me and the "friendship/bond we share."

\- She is genuinely "overwhelmed by school, exams, and family pressure (she is stressed about marriage pressure)".

\- She needs me to be "understanding and patient, but without expecting constant communication."

\- She wants to continue the connection but needs a "more relaxed, more understanding rhythm."

\- She says things will ease up after her exams at the end of December.

My Dilemma:

I genuinely believe she has the potential to be a good partner (she showed great effort in the first month we were dating). But right now, I am functionally single while being emotionally committed to her. By committing myself, I feel like I am wasting time I could be using to search for a genuine, active, serious relationship.

Any advice on how I should proceed?

1. Is there a healthy middle ground between being fully committed to her and breaking up? (E.g., stepping back into the "talking" stage, and being open to dating others until December/January?)
2. How can I effectively communicate my needs for basic connection without burdening her severe schedule? She's so busy that she skips meals and only gets like 5-6 hours of sleep on average. I don't want to ask for too much, but only a few minutes of texts/call a day can go such a long way.
3. Should the lack of effort and her avoidance of the "boyfriend/girlfriend" title signal that I need to change my level of commitment to her?

I want to be practical, and I am willing to wait another month (until end of December) to see if her schedule improves. But I'm exhausted being in this LDR that feels like a solo mission and is not moving me closer to my goal of a solid relationship.

TL;DR: I (M25) committed to LDR partner (F25) who won't use labels (called me her "best friend", but doesn't refer to me as her "boyfriend") and has been too busy to talk on the phone in 2 months. She asked me for total patience and low expectations until exams finish in December. I've been super patient and understanding even though the lack of connection has been quite frustrating and uncomfortable for me. I feel like I'm wasting my time being functionally single but emotionally committed. Any advice is appreciated.

ANSWER: I realize dental school and med school are different, but you should read this - [https://www.self.com/story/dating-a-medical-student-advice](https://www.self.com/story/dating-a-medical-student-advice)

She told you you won't get her time until December. She is doing 16 hr days. This is the reality you signed up for, but you can end it too. I'd suggest people in med/dental/vet school shouldn't even bother dating.

QUESTION: Mixed signals? M29 F23

So I have a group of friends I’ve just recently acquired through my real homie. There’s this girl in the friend group. Since I met here she’s been chill but she’s definitely a “friendly” girl. Like flirts with whoever she wants type. Apparently she doesn’t date black guys which is no sweat to me. But she often rubs up against me. Like comes into my vicinity and does it. It’s been multiple times not just one occurrence. Also when she hugs me she rubs my back slowly. A lot  of times it’s a side hug, but sometimes she wraps me up. Not much pelvic touching but yea. She’s actively talking to someone so I’m not pressed. Im just curious as to whether this is friendly or she’s slightly into me.

ANSWER: If you like her, ask her out. If you don't.....dont let her rub your back and nake those gestures.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (M 21) need to know if this girl (F 20) likes me or not

I (M21), I have never dated anyone in my life, I’ve always wanted to but never have out of fear of rejection, about two months ago I met a girl at work, we’ve gotten along together really well from the beginning, and recently have started to hangout a lot more. What I need help with is figuring out if she likes me or not, I feel like she’s been dropping signs and hints, but I’m afraid I’m reading into it way too deep. The first sign was, she would ask me if I wanted to go and get food at one of the nearby fast food places (we live on a college campus), I would say yes, we’d get our food, eat, and end up hanging out for like two more hours after we’ve finished our food, talking the whole time. She laughs and smiles at the things I say, and looks me in the eyes (I can’t even remember the last time a girl has done that to me), and recently has been wanting me to accompany her at the gym every night (I started going to the gym recently). Almost every night for the last week now we’ve stayed at the gym for around two hours til closing, and would hang out for an hour or two after, talking the whole time. Whenever I mention a place I’ve never been to before, she says we should go together. She’s the only girl I’ve ever met in my life who actually responds to my texts in a timely manner and actually shows up when we make plans. She does things like playfully hitting or punching me, and whenever we sit down she sits so close to me we’re almost touching. I’ve never been friends with a girl in my life who’s done stuff like this. I’ve never dated a girl before, so I can’t tell if everything she’s doing is just friendly stuff, or her trying to say she likes me, I just don’t know. What do you think I should do, guys and gals?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (30F) love my boyfriend (42M) but I’m terrified I’m wasting my time and losing my chance to have a family.

I’m 30F and my boyfriend is 42M. We’ve been together for a 2 years in December and I genuinely love him. He’s my best friend, we spend almost all our free time together, and we get along insanely well.

I turned 30 this year, and becoming a mother is one of my biggest life goals. Lately, the fear of time passing has been hitting really hard. I cry about it a lot. 

The problem is… our relationship isn’t moving forward.
There’s no talk of engagement, moving in together, or long-term planning.

He already has older kids (17 and 19), so I understand his life stage is different from mine. I’m also currently unemployed (laid off recently), and part of me wonders whether that’s why he isn’t bringing up the future. but another part of me feels like if a man wants a future with you, he talks about it regardless of your current job situation.

I don’t want to give him an ultimatum.
I don’t want him to commit because he’s scared to lose me.
I want him to commit because he loves me and sees a future with me.

But I also don’t want to silently lose years waiting for someone who may not be thinking about the same things I’m thinking about.

Any advice from people who’ve been here?

ANSWER: He has kids and is not motivated to be on your schedule.  Plus he is 12 years older than you… it seems like he wants your youth.  Not really a family

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [20F] am unsure how to approach this with [20m] and don’t know what to do

Is this relationship even worth saving? For the straight to the point people, my ‘20f’ bf ‘20m’ was a substance abuser, verbally abusive., and emotionally abusive. We broke up in June 2025 and after months in September he had a revelation of everything he did wrong and why he did and apologies and tears and he wants help and he’s sober and he wants us backs and he wants to change and wants it to be me. Been together for almost 3 years. This is going to be long so bear with me, I ‘20f ‘have been with Eric ‘20m’ almost 3 years know the last couple months being patchy and rocky. We were ok for a good bit for the first couple months of the relationship the he started using substances which I was unaware of. Then his girl best friend messaged me with a text about him trying to meet up with her and see her but she had no proof to back it up. He stayed on substances till the end of 2023 and then got clean. Every time we’d have really bad fights he’d get in my face, blame me, tell me I wasn’t listening, call me derogatory names. And then I would call him out on this and it would stop for a little while then start back up again. He ended up starting to unblock and message this girl best friend and tell her about how I was so shitty and toxic to him and he was the victim to her and then I’d find it and beg him to get rid of her and he did then it would happen again and again the it finally stopped. Sometime early this year he started using again. It was very bad. In June he was on on a work trip and we got into a childish argument where he accused me of cheating when I didn’t and he called me horrible names so I broke up with him. We were no contact for a litter while and if we did talk it was nasty. A couple months ago he started texting me saying how he realized everything he did wrong and he wants to make it right and he’ll prove it to me and how I’m his soulmate. We’ve been talking and trying to work it out but it just feels wrong now. I feel on edge sometimes when he gets mad and I get nervous and feel scared sometimes. I’m nervous he may cheat again or use substances again. I always feels stressed and it’s so exhausting. I’m in a mix of emotions where one day I love him so much and the next day I’m thinking about things from the past that were toxic and I wanted to forget and the I’m upset with I’m so exhausted I don’t know if it’s from this or from work but idk. I love him so much but why did it take me having to leave for him to realize when I begged him to change for him and for us. I just wanted to vent this out as he is truly and amazing boyfriend an he’s doings better. Do you guys think there’s any repairing the damage and trauma he caused, even after all the terrible things he did and names he called me do you think it’s possible to move on and forget and the spark between us will ever come back. I would also liek people opinions on if I’m crazy for feeling the way I feel towards him right now.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I 26M and my gf 22F have been struggling

So this is actually my first time ever posting anything, so I apologize if I don’t do everything correctly. Me 26M and my gf 22F have been having, what feels like to me, a lot of issues. I am genuinely unsure what to do because I feel like I have tried everything. When we got together it was right after a breakup she had with a her ex. I at that point hadn’t dated anyone or had any type of relationship for about 4 years due to poor past relationships. I was ready to start something new for a good while and she and I had become very close as just friends. When her ex broke up with her we were at that point in two separate states but decided to start dating and about 3 months down the road we moved in with each other. I will admit it was definitely too soon, I’ve never lived with a girl before and it sounded exciting and frankly it still is very nice having her here with me but I’m not sure if that’s just because I like the company. Since we have been together I have noticed that she has VERY bad communication skills due to how she grew up and has very little to no emotional regulation. I go to the gym and try to stay healthy. She is a bigger gal so I knew I wasn’t getting in a relationship with a gym rat but she has been so lazy. I work from home and I make a good enough income. She doesn’t work the hours I work and when she is home will sit on the couch all day if she can. There will be chores that need to be done or she needs to do things for herself like shower or clean her clothes but more often than not she won’t. I try to tell her she needs to do these things very gently and not with too much pressure or guilt, I try to show I’m coming to her loving and caring and supportive. She will absolutely blow up on me though. She often times will actually blow up on me for the smallest things. I know she loves me but I think a lot of the times she does these things because she knows it’s something I want. Truthfully I just want her to be happy and live a fulfilling life and I know what she’s feeling because I’ve felt it all before. I have had countless conversations with her about my needs in the relationship or that I don’t want to be talked to the way she does sometimes, also about her laziness. Nothing ever changes, and I’m left sitting and feeling lost on what to do. I love her a lot, and I want her to be happy, I feel though a lot of times I sacrifice my own happiness for hers. I am a very physical person and getting her to snuggle and make out or anything sexual is a mission. I have had faith this whole time she will eventually change when she matures more and have been patient, and she has changed a little but not much. Sometimes I think I’m expecting the change to happen faster than what she’s capable of and others I don’t think she ever will. I have always believed in working through the hard times in a relationship but I feel like I’m always the one sacrificing and putting in any effort needed but it’s never/rarely reciprocated. Am I holding on to something that just isn’t there? Or are these just common problems we have to work through and how?

ANSWER: You’re doing all the work while she coasts. Wanting basic respect, communication, effort, and affection isn’t too much. You’ve talked, nothing changes, that’s the pattern. Love isn’t enough if you’re constantly sacrificing your happiness. She might never meet you halfway, and holding onto “potential” isn’t a relationship

QUESTION: I (21F) don't know what to do about my ex (23F)?

Around 2 weeks ago my ex gf broke up with me. We dated for a few months but it felt very deep. We would talk about future and see each other when we could. She broke up with me because she said she couldn't have a text conversation with me a day because it was overwhelming or call. That being said when it was in person it was very different she would pay for everything, drive everywhere, and was very attentive. We also align with each other morally very well. That being said with recent events with ice coming to communities she's reached out to me to check if I was okay and offered to drop resources off for me or my family. She went to an informational session with me tonight but it was awkward. I still really care about her and I know she does about me but idk what to do. Shes not a bad person so I'm just at a lost.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 19M and 18F together 1y4m, now long-distance for college girlfriend says the spark feels different and mentioned a break. How do I understand what she really wants and fix this?

Me and my girlfriend have been together for about a year and 4 months. she started college 4 months ago and now we’re 3 hours apart. ever since she left for college things been rough at with college and partying and stuff normal teen relationship worries ig but we are past that. 

Anyways she’s mentioned a few times that she feels off in the relationship like things feel repetitive, she feels disconnected, and the spark doesn’t feel the same as when we first started dating. she told me she still loves me, but the excitement we had in the beginning of our relationship doesn’t feel the same, We still talked and stayed together, but she kept saying she didn’t know how to explain what she meant, just that “it doesn’t feel the same,” not that she’s losing feelings

Then recently we were on facetime and she was raising her voice, got sarcastic, and was kinda mean without realizing it. i was talking to her calmly and respectfully, and it seemed like she kept on acting that way, so \\ i reacted out of spite and said “fuck you” under my breath because it felt rude to me everything she was doing the way she talked and her tone was just taken the wrong way by me. I didn’t mean for her to hear it, but she did, and she got mad. then we started arguing and i apologized, but i also told her she was being rude first. After all that she said i never take accountability and that i’m immature when we argue, even though she was being disrespectful first and I  admitted my part and apologized for what i said.

after the argument, everything came back up again. she said she still feels off, disconnected, and that our relationship isn’t how it was at the beginning. she said maybe we need more growth or closeness again. then she suddenly said “maybe we should take a break,” but took it back right away because she thought i’d get mad (which i would’ve). she kept going back and forth with it and just kept saying “idk.”

now i’m confused.  
i don’t know if she’s actually bored of the relationship, scared the spark is fading, overwhelmed by college and the long distance, or just emotional because of the argument.

QUESTION: I (F18) am feeling very insecure about my boyfriends (M18) ex

We’ve been dating for a year and everything has been good. Any disagreements we’ve had, we have been able to talk through without getting in an argument. We always listen to each other. In the first two months of the relationship I noticed that he mentioned his exes quit a bit. Once we were at a gas station and be mentioned he saw his ex there some time ago, another time I told him I went to a coffee house with my friend and he said that his ex used to work there. Both of his previous relationships had ended very negatively, one involving cheating, the other was nasty the whole way through. I told him it made me uncomfortable and insecure when he brought up his exes and he understood immediately and apologized saying that they ended on such a bad note that it haunts him. 

I still felt insecure that he thought about them at all because mine had not crossed my mind since entering this relationship. He stopped bring them up and all was well. I felt very insecure at the beginning of the relationship about it as his most recent ex was my old best friend named Lily. She had treated me horribly through out friendship, she encouraged me to harm myself, laughed when I opened up to her, and bullied me into having an ED which caused me to lose 60 lbs in four months. His first ex, Cassie, I did not know at all. Since he had his first everything with Cassie and I was having my first everything with him, it made me very insecure.

Our relationship has been good since then and I have been extremely happy happy. Recently I was talking with one of my friends who works with Cassie, she did not know she was my boyfriend’s ex. She was telling me about her and kept going on and on about how similar we were with personality, interests, hobbies, etc. My heart dropped. Lily and I had been very similar too, mainly with our appearance and sense of humour. Since my friend told me this, it has haunted me. I feel like a replacement for his ex who he once talked about often and have had many dreams of him cheating on me with her since then. 

I told him about my dreams and he said he was sorry I’m having them but it’s ridiculous since he loves me more than anyone. He reassured me he has no feelings for her and obviously I am not similar to her or we wouldn’t be dating. Since I resolved my eating issues, I have been working out constantly and developing a healthy relationship with food. Cassie is extremely this while I am more toned/muscular. I keep comparing myself to Cassie and thinking about her often. I have lost weight since to try and make myself thin like her. I don’t know what to do to get her off my mind, is there any advice to help mitigate this?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (F23) boyfriend’s (M23) mother (F40s) treats him like a child. Do I let it go?

So back story- BF’s mom and dad got divorced when he was 5(?) and mom moved to a different state without saying anything.
Dad has full custody, mom gets to see him once a year for about a week. 

BF turns 18 and it’s still the same way. 

I came in the picture 3 years ago, we’ve been making the trip once a year to go see her. And it’s getting unbearable now. 

The first year it was okay because we were still “new” and we were trying to figure out our relationship but his mom still did some “weird” things. 
Like she started to pack my bag for me… all of my dirty clothes- undies, pants, bras. I was really uncomfortable with it so I said something about how I’ll pack my own stuff. 

Second year. Being honest I don’t remember much, I just remember being so ready to leave. 

THIS YEAR. 
I’m not sure if it’s because we live together and we have our day to day lives figured out. 
But she started being “oh Seth did you see this” “Seth do you remember this” “Seth have you ever tried this” “here open, I think you’ll like this” 

And it just gave me the ick. She even came in our room to wake us up even when I had an alarm set. 
We went to Walmart and got some food for us at their house since it was a 10+ hour drive, we didn’t want to bring anything. And she called and said “will yall get ice cream. Seth can just pick us out something, I’ll like whatever he wants” 
Like whaaa. Just ick. 

I get that’s his mom and shes wanting to be a “mother” since she wasn’t around much. But it’s too much, he’s 23 not 15. 

Something bad happened in Seth’s life and she sent some chocolate for him… HE DOES NOT LIKE CHOCOLATE!!! 

I talked to him about it and he got extremely defensive and said “yeah that’s just how she is. She’s my mom” 
But it’s borderline obsessive to me. 

Do I need to just move passed this and get over it or is this something I should keep pressing over?

ANSWER: I’m not seeing the obsessiveness based on what you have posted. Sounds to me like an overbearing mother who is trying to make up for lost time. Which is her own fault, and it’s shitty for a parent to move away from their child. 

So he doesn’t like chocolate and she sent some. Maybe he can let her know that he is not a fan but that someone ate it. Not the end of the world. As far as packing your stuff and coming into the room to wake you up, that is too much and I would lock the door/ not let her near your stuff when you visit again. 

It sounds like it’s once a year, and she just needs some firm boundaries put in place as far as how she treats you both when you visit, but nothing you posted sounds overly weird to me. Overbearing, yes, but not obsessive.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (23F) boyfriend (24M) is still close friends with girls he’s tried to get with before we met.  Is this weird?

So my boyfriend and I have been officially dating for a little over two months, talking for about 3.5. He is way more social than I am and this is my first time truly experiencing a large co-ed friend group. Early on before we were dating he mentioned one of the guys, let’s call him Brad slept with (let’s call her) Hannah. Brad is now in a relationship with Jennifer. Since we were on the topic, I asked my bf if he had slept with anyone from his friend group. His only answer was no. Fast forward some time, he has a wedding back in his home town for an old coworker. Another insecurity sprung for me when I found out this coworker friend group comprises of two girls and him. One of the girls being his friend for 7 years that’s he’s mentioned briefly says loves him. (The context was him saying he’s weird about saying I love you, even when she tells him it, she has to tell him to tell her it). I’m already uncomfortable and more so when I find out I haven’t been invited (we’re officially dating at this point). He goes to this wedding and ends up not texting me all night so my head goes to the worst of places. The next morning he says his childhood friend (let’s call her Jodie) had her boyfriend drive him home after he got super wasted. So she had a plus one? I was upset, explained to him why the situation made me uncomfortable and eventually we moved on and it didn’t get talked about much. Well the other night I had the not so great idea of going through his phone purely because I wanted to see Jodie’s Instagram which was private to me. Last year she had a photo of the two of them posted at a football game where his hand was on her lower back. It looked like they were a couple. I immediately panic and start trying to find more evidence. Searching through his messages I find one of my boyfriend telling a buddy he needs to “wife her up” in reference to Jodie. I also find a message he shared with Jodie about how he tried to kiss Hannah after taking her on a date until 3am so I’ve found out he’s had a thing for two of his female friends he still has around. There were several messages between him and Jodie that confirmed he’d been telling her when he and I got in disagreements which was also upsetting to me. Jodie, Hannah, and he all have partners now. But I’m so uncomfortable and anxious. I feel like he’s interested in one of them and only with me because I’m into him and they weren’t. How do I manage these feelings? Is he wrong for not telling me these things?? He did apologize and said he felt that it wasn’t a big deal and that he was worried it would make me more anxious. We hang out with Hannah often and I don’t know how to go about it in the same way ever again.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How can I (f22) express to him (m24) that my emotional needs aren’t being met?

As the title says

We’ve been together for almost 3 years. 

I’m not a perfect person. In fact, I think that in a lot of cases I’m the drama (multiple mental illnesses and neurodivergent). I’m a difficult person to be close to period. I don’t hurt people, just myself. I have an anxious attachment style and trust issues which can be hard on him because I get paranoid. We’ve had many conversations about this and our relationship standing. I’m in therapy and taking meds and trying to get better. He has expressed he wants to stay with me through that.

I can’t imagine my life without him. And I don’t want to not be with him.

He’s not a very expressive or talkative person. I can’t change that about him. But earlier in our relationship he seemed more affectionate and eager to spend time with me. I know he’s capable of that. I guess he’s gotten used to me. I’ve told him what my love languages are and asked him many times if he could try and do some of the things that make me feel loved but nothing changes.

I get lost because he doesn’t want to break up with me. He wants me in his life. But I don’t know how I’m valuable to him because I feel like there aren’t many ways to know that other than proximity and routine and that he can’t be goofy around me. I’ve boiled it down to I’m just so exhausting of a person that of course he can’t do these things for me. And maybe I’m not getting healing fast enough. I told him that too but he disagreed with that pov. I asked him why he hasn’t done those things for me and he brushed it off

I asked my friend but she told me that I should just tell him if he doesn’t step it up that I will leave. But that’s not true. But also, I’m not sure that I’m happy. And I don’t know if he is either. And I wish I could talk to him but he’s at work right now.

ANSWER: He's brushing off very reasonable requests. You aren't sure you're happy, and you can't possibly be happy if you don't feel like your needs matter in this relationship. He isn't leaving because he knows you will put up with him not putting effort into your relationship.  

Stop telling yourself (or letting him tell you) that you're the problem. You deserve someone who makes you feel loved.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (28f) am frustrated by my partner’s (27m) constant venting

Hey all. I’ve been with my fiancé for a few years now. He’s the kindest person I have ever met and he lives to make other people’s days better. He also has adhd, can be a bit intense when he gets going, and he really struggles with self-discipline. I often feel like he steam rolls his needs over my own. He doesn’t even realize that he’s doing it, he can just be so intense and wrapped up in himself and I’m such a people pleaser at heart that I often let it happen because it’s easier. 

He is currently very unhappy at his job and he has been stuck there for a year now. There are a couple of coworkers that really get to him. One of which is in charge of the schedule so he routinely works awful hours. In general, he complains that they don’t do or don’t know how to do anything, everyone is stupid, and they give themselves the good hours. I feel for him and fully understand his struggles. I have been listening to him vent about it every day for a year. However, I am losing patience with his need for me to be constantly available for it. He will drone on and on and on for like 10 minutes at a time, multiple times a day. Even on his days off when there’s nothing going on that should be prompting him. He also talks on the phone with his family a lot so he vents to them too. Some days he will vent to me a couple of times and then I have to listen to it another couple of times when he’s on the phone. It literally feels like the only time he isn’t talking about it is when he’s distracted by video games or scrolling on his phone. He just returns to the topic when he gets bored of what he’s doing. His schedule really does suck and there are frequently days when we don’t see each other unless the other is unconscious. So when we finally have an evening or a day together, it’s really frustrating that our time together is spent like this. I know he just needs to get it out but I feel like one 10 minute vent session should suffice…

At this point, I feel as though I have tried everything. I have given him advice, offered other perspectives, suggested what actions he can take, going down the rabbit hole with him and egging him on, changing the subject, and just straight up listening without really responding much and just letting him vent. None of it helps. If I just listen passively, he gets annoyed that I’m not responding enough and will literally just goad me to respond in a way that eggs him on. Every time I try to explain that I need him to redirect his energy on something else, he shuts down. I definitely hit a breaking point last night and I didn’t even let him vent at all, I just shut him down immediately and explained that if he’s just going to vent about the same exact things then I really don’t want to hear about it. I know I handled that wrong. He feels like I don’t want to hear about his day now and he won’t even really tell me anything that happened today because of it. He’s the type to tell me every minor detail of his day so not hearing about literally anything is very unlike him. I apologized for how expressed my frustration but reiterated that he really needs to redirect the negativity. In general the phone conversation seemed productive, we both explained our perspectives but I know he’s still hurt. However, I am not budging on this issue but I am having a hard time articulating my point of view without sounding like an uncaring partner. The people pleaser in me is telling me to just suck it up but the frustration of always doing that is turning me into an asshole. 

Please can someone offer some perspective or new advice? I want to have a more productive conversation about it

================================================================================

QUESTION: ‘M29’ what could I do know to try and rebuild trust with my gf? ‘F28’

I met my current girlfriend 1 year ago. When we went on our 1st date we chatted about how we both had been married before, she asked me if I was divorced and I said I was, but I wasn’t. My divorce was under process but not finalized. I felt scared and uncomfortable to tell her I wasn’t divorced, I liked her and wanted a 2nd date and more with her. We ended up dating more and continued a long distance relationship, on our first month dating we broke up… she had a meeting with her therapist and she told her that it was crazy to be dating someone that didn’t even live in the same country (I was traveling there every month), about a month later she traveled to me and on the 2nd day together she told me she wanted us to be together again, and I agreed. But I was still afraid it felt very fragile, she was very unsure of what she wanted and it was visible in many occasions. 2 months went by, we were still together and long distance, I moved out of my apartment and was planning to move more permanently with her to her country. When I moved out of my apartment my ex wife moved into it, she knew the owner of the apartment and was able to close a deal with her to stay in that apartment, I knew she was moving in but was not involved in anything regarding that, I even found it weird she was moving there with her new boyfriend. My girlfriend asked me in a very nervous way if I knew my ex moved into my old apartment because she had seen a story of my ex in it. To this I lied again, I said I had no idea my ex was moving there. My relationship felt fragile, my girlfriend felt unsure of what she wanted and me saying I knew felt like it would’ve been a tilting point. Regardless there’s no excuse, I lied and maintained that lie for several months, at this time my divorce was finalized but I never revisited our conversation and told her “hey I lied back then, the reality is I was not divorced but I am now”.

My girlfriend became very insecure, it didn’t make sense to her that I didn’t know about my ex moving into my old apartment, she started thinking I was talking to my ex behind her back, that I maybe still wanted something with her, that I was helping her, etc. So she would question me almost every week about this, and many times I’d answer and calmly explain I wasn’t talking to her, a many other times I would be annoyed at the constant questioning and would tell her that she was very insecure.

1 week ago, she asked me to see my divorce documents, I showed them to her and they showed the later date, not the one I mentioned when we first met, she got super angry that I lied to her and started to suspect I’ve lied about everything, she asked me for my exs phone number, I gave it to her and she contacted her, my ex immediately said I knew she was moving into the apartment, that I didn’t help but I was aware of the move. My gf immediately messages me “you knew” and broke up with me. Now we’re barely talking, I’m devastated, this is my fault, I should’ve been honest and my fear of loss got the best of me. What advice would you give me to try and re approach a possibility of being back together?

ANSWER: Consequences.  You habitually lie for convenience, you got caught, and you got burned.  

I don't see any way to rekindle this relationship.  She's on to you.  But if you truly want to change so you can be better in your next romance, please schedule an appointment with a professional therapist.  Habitual lying is an eaay habit to fall into, and an extremely hard habit to break - it's going to take a lot of practice.  I wish you well.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (25M) am not sure if I have a real crush (31F) or if If I am limerent. What do you guys think?

I (25M) have been with my SO (24F) for almost 6 years. I was a failing computer programming student and she was an art student. We met on tinder and I very quickly had the thought that she was different than many of the women I had texted (never met anyone else in person from the app except her) and that if I could get her out of the 5 people I was talking to I would likely be the happiest. I was smoking weed everyday and my previous relationship had ended due to her not wanting to do drugs anymore and me not wanting to stop doing them (among other reasons). She also smoked and we clicked very quickly over text. I tried for months to get her to come meet me in person but she would always cancel last minute. When she finally admitted that the distance (over an hour bus because we both could not drive) was the reason we stopped talking for a bit. Eventually she did give up on NC and we did finally meet.

Around this time I also made the decision to switch school programs to Greenhouse stuff so I could get into the cannabis industry. This change in schools turned our hour long bus into a 2.5 hour bus one way which meant that she spent long stretches of time at my house which I was used to anyways because it was COVID and my parents were pretty strict on being around others. Point of this being we were in love and enjoyed each other very much.

Around 2 years in I started my first job-esque experience doing a co-op at a garden center and was working 72 hours a week to get my hours done as fast as possible. This was also the beginning of my first bout of limerence as I always had the tendency to identify the most attractive woman in a room but this time I had to see her for hours on end. I still remember the first interaction between this LO and how she asked me to hang something up and how she called me a god and how intense that first hit of dopamine was. I then started to talk to her more and more until it was pretty much every time I could. After 2ish weeks of both of us not talking about our respective SO's she finally mentioned her SO and so I took it as an opportunity to tell her about my SO thinking okay, at least I won't catch feelings if we're both in a relationship. This I soon found out was not how feelings work.

I thought about her all day and would go home to my girlfriend who would sit around my house for 12 hours just to see and hang out with me for like 2 hours before I had to sleep and repeat. It got so bad that I would have trouble paying attention to what my girlfriend was saying as she was saying it quite often. My girlfriend is extremely jealous to the point that if there is a pretty girl in a TV show she feels uncomfortable that I am watching it. This, and a lot of self-esteem issues made me refrain from telling her the truth about how I was feeling. I also had an abusive boss that would yell at employees for literally no reason which made this LO feel like a warm ray of sunshine in a hellscape. My favorite part of the day was before opening the store because she would sweep and we would eventually find our way to each other and have a half hour conversation.

After 2 months of this I finished my hours but enjoyed the fact that I was making money so I just started taking every weekend off as I wanted to have a Summer with my friends a go to the cottage. I didn't realize that My co-op status did not mean that I could just take excessive time off and when they sent me an email saying that I couldn't. I replied saying that I was submitting my 2 weeks and they basically said hope you got your hours, pick up your stuff whenever.

I followed the LO on instagram and we texted for a couple weeks but when I went up to the cottage for a week with my SO I stopped texting her as I didn't want any unnecessary questions or jealousy. I think this helped my LO not respond and like that no more contact. I thought that it would be the end of it but for over a year thoughts about her invaded my brain often. At one point I got the advice to tell my LO and so I looked at her instagram and she had deleted it so I never did. I chalked up the crush to an extremely toxic work environment and being overworked. Up until 3 years after that the thought of her still haunted me to a degree. I remember vividly having a dream about her (I smoke too much weed to dream usually) and almost crying when I woke up beside my SO. She is still with the same guy to this day. I know because I never really let it go.

Eventually like all things, it faded and life moved on. I finished the rest of college and got my degree and eventually moved out of my parents house and in with one of my classmates and have worked a job in cannabis for 2 years. I got one promotion but the industry is not what I was hoping it would be. More bad leadership and a sense of not going anywhere deteriorated my mental health. In addition I was heavily allergic to the work and started getting eczema on my hands as well as asthma so it was hard to be happy at work. I was also heavily addicted to cannabis, nicotine, video games, porn, and youtube. I slowly switched to self help content and quit video games and porn(mostly) but am having lots of trouble with the rest due to ADHD. My motivation to do anything has gone to shit which makes figuring out what I want to do with my life very difficult.

Then one day my foot starts to hurt and I get put on modified duty in packaging for 2 weeks. This felt like an awakening. I went from working with a couple of guys who were at least 10 years older than me and had clear mental illness who I could work with but not really get along with and 30 degrees greenhouse as well as excessive physical labor for close to minimum wage to sitting with a few girls who were mostly younger than 10 years older than me and putting stickers on things for pretty much the same wage. I finally laughed while working for what felt like the first time in a very long time. We just yapped all day and I found myself enjoying my time.

I particularly hit it off with this one woman (31F) who I had heard had a child. She and I quickly became close and I could feel what I had learned what was called limerence coming on. But quickly the 2 weeks ended and after my new team asking me to stay a few times I caved and took the pay-cut because the work was far more enjoyable and the hours were better (4 days a week). Deep down I worried that I was secretly switching so that I could spend time with my new LO but didn't really care as I was fed up with the shitty leadership of the other department.

This LO is entirely sober and has never once mentioned that she has a child to me in 2 months of us talking for hours every week. What is strange is she always wears a mask, even to and from her car at work which means I have never seen her face beyond instagram which is crazy to me. I have watched myself become addicted to the look in her eyes when she laughs' especially at something I say. Within a few days of working together I had gotten quite good at making her laugh consistently more than anyone in recent memory which makes me wonder if maybe she likes me too or if I'm just delusional from limerence. I describe it as farming dopamine through her laugh.

I also had the classic constant daydreaming about being with her and telling her how I felt but don't want to put her in an awkward position in her workplace that I still kind of feel like a guest in. Her best friend who also worked in the department was on a multiple month vacation as well which I guess left a void for her that was filled by me. I have now belly laughed to the point of pain with her on multiple occasions (I can't remember the last time that happened with my SO) and am feeling extremely guilty because I haven't told anyone directly in this department that I have a girlfriend and at this point I feel like its gonna be a thing if I do because I'm constantly making googly eyes at my LO.

Her best friend is back now and feels cold towards me and I have watched my SO ask her to come sit with us (she's sitting with people who don't speak English like 4 feet away instead of with the group) and both times her friend basically ignored her. Part of me wonders if she knows I have an SO as she is close friends with someone I used to work with that I definitely told about my relationship. I also deleted my instagram, partly to end doom-scrolling and addiction, partly so that when asked I could say I deleted it, thus prolonging the reveal of my SO. I also feel bad as I think she might be jealous that I stole her best friend but maybe I just overestimated their closeness when seeing them constantly together before I became friends with my LO

I love my SO a lot and she makes me feel secure, wanted, loved, and gives me space to be with friends and whatnot. I feel like I can be myself around her completely (minus anything that would make her jealous even in the slightest so maybe not lol) I did also get my license a year and a half ago which made it easier for us to travel and not rely on our parents entirely and I don't really mind driving us for road trips. She does struggle with neurodivergence and depression so I have cut her a LOT of slack when it comes to life goals and agency but as I come out of the haze of constant cannabis use whenever not on the job and enter the haze of limerence I have started to question the longevity of me relationship a lot. I have issues with executive function as well but for a long time I was ready to clean after dinner but her constant apprehension has made me adapt to it and delay it as well.

Part of me says I have watched literally all of my favorite shows with her and have played many of my favorite games and if we were rich and could just smoke weed and enjoy life until we died I would die happy. Another part of me says that I am only holding onto the relationship because of our history and is ignoring the reality I live in and that I need a job that I can get paid well in if I have any chance of ever retiring in this economy and that her art passion is iffy with that dream. I think my LO represents a more stable lifestyle to me as she is sober and works out (something I want to do but don't yet have the motivation to do so). All this even though my LO is 31, might have a kid, and is only at this job because it is comfortable, easy, and has good benefits/hours.

My LO also does not say good morning or good night to me at the beginning or end of the day which I find quite strange as everyone else does but then she will proceed to try include me in conversations with the workgroup. I have told my LO that I do not plan to stay at the company for very long and that I want to move back in with my parents an hour away from here. She seemed somewhat upset by this in a way I wasn't really expecting for how close I thought we were at the time. Slowly I think she has become my new closest work friend and her mine. When she's not talking with me she often stares blankly as she works and I just fiend to put some life back into her eyes.

I know that this is likely grass is greener where you water it effect but I can't help but think that maybe I should leave my SO and have a fling with my LO before I move off. I have realized that maybe the fire isn't in my relationship because I am more distant than I could be as well as the fact that often when we are together we usually get baked and watch something without talking too much together. I also discouraged phone calls because my first relationship was long distance and I used to spend hours on end in a call and have associated calling and negativity together.

My SO missed her deadline for school this year and has been struggling to get a job, even at McDonalds. My SO's parents both decided to move to different countries as well as her brother so she has no family in the immediate area anymore and her parents were never good with money to begin with so her support system is shaky at best. This has also left her feeling fairly abandon by her parents leaving her in a difficult mental state that I do not want to worsen by leaving but also don't feel like I currently have the capacity to help with. This also means that unless I teach her how to drive which is illegal for another 2.5 years in my country she just has no plan to learn. Part of me thinks that no job and no license at 24 is a huge red flag but to be fair I didn't have my first job until I was 23 and didn't have my license until I was 24 so I feel like I should cut her some slack.

My SO also pretty much has no real friends at this point while I have so many that I alternate between like 5 different groups per weekend. All of these groups are used to her being around so its not the biggest issue. My SO is also quite feminist which has left me somewhat tired of hearing about how every show we watch was made by a man to please other men. She also struggles with some trauma which makes some more intense shows very difficult for her to watch (we made it through game of thrones and sopranos but man it was tough).

I worry that I hang out with her as an excuse to drink and smoke and am also worried that without my addictions to cannabis and watching something constantly that our relationship would not last as I don't know if I'm still IN love with her like I feel I should be or if we're both just struggling with addiction. I might just not know what to expect when it comes to a relationship this long though. I never really expected it to last this long and now suddenly I'm 25 and time is moving fast and I don't know If I want to marry my SO or if I'm just comfortable. My SO is often struggling with being happy and my LO is constantly laughing and upbeat and makes me happy in a way I never really expected but maybe this is a façade for work, idk. I don't want to string her along, she doesn't deserve it but part of me thinks that I'm just being stupid and should stick it out and work on our problems.

I'm starting therapy soon and am hoping to get some ADHD meds so this limerence chills the fuck out. I am attracted to my SO but with her having little interest in working out and her instant distaste of the idea of me not thinking she's the most attractive person to ever live makes it a difficult topic to bring up. Her weight fluctuates a lot more than mine which I cannot really relate to but It's not really about that and more the willingness to bring up her self-esteem in a healthy way. Especially since I prefer to rock climb instead of going to the gym as well as play dodgeball which both scare her. She's open to trying rock climbing but is apprehensive and does say no when I give her the option to.

I am so conflicted as when I'm with my LO I convince myself that my relationship is faulty and that I should just give up on it but once I get home and the limerence wears off a little bit I start to think that I should put more effort in to fix it. When I'm with my SO, however, I do feel very close to her and so comfortable and so secure because I know she loves me so intensely and I do really enjoy the relationship that we have; faulty as it may be. It also bothers me that my LO is older and clearly has some similar issues when it comes to wanting a well paying career as my SO. Like at least my SO has some idea of how she's going to make some money in the future and has a good chunk of time to figure it out.

Part of me wonders if this bout of limerence is more about me not knowing what to do with my life and projecting it on them. I also wonder if it has something to do with me trying to quit my vices all at once and being dopamine deficient. I think my relationship might be codependent as she often asks me to reassure her of my love (even before the limerence) as well as does extra stuff for me that she doesn't want to because she worries that I would leave her if she didn't. I also think that I don't want to fuck up the pure innocent soul that my LO seems to be with my mess of a life even if it was something that she was interested in.

With my SO's intense jealousy though and my tendency to have limerence my brain says maybe were just incompatible as I would maybe never feel comfortable talking to my SO about it. I also haven't really even talked much about my relationships with my coworkers since I switched departments because I feel like her mind would go to the worst possible outcome without me confirming that it basically is in fact reality but worse because I'm just mentally ill and this is something that I may struggle with throughout life. I still wonder if my LO is hiding the fact that she has a child from me which I guess I can't blame her because I'm hiding a fucking SO from her but the limerence has pretty much overshadowed the importance of not dating someone 6 years older than me with a kid. I especially don't want to fuck up her life if she does have a kid.

TL;DR  
I have limerence for someone at work and I cannot tell if she feels the same as the best hints I've gotten are prolonged eye contact as well as long, consistent bouts of belly laughter. I also have a relationship which now that I'm more sober and experiencing limerence, I am starting to see the cracks in but also because of the limerence, makes me want to abandon. Common sense however says I should just shut up and wait it out as well as put my energy into making my relationship better for the both of us.

ANSWER: This reads like someone who just learned about limerence right now.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Is it normal for my (22F) partner (23M) to want so much time alone?

I've been with my partner for 6 years and I've always struggled with the amount of time he wants to spend with me. He's thinks I'm clingy and we're constantly having conversations about boundaries and how he needs more time alone. We moved in together 2 years ago (with roommates, not just the 2 of us) and I feel like it's only gotten worse since then. He's an introverted person but loves to spend lots of time with his friends online. He also works full time in education so some days can be pretty socially draining for him; wheras I work part-time from home so I like to talk to him in the evening to fill up my own social battery. The nights where he wants to be alone can be difficult for me as most days I haven't spoken to anyone other than him.

We've never been able to find a balance between his personal time and time we spend together. And the time we do spend together tends to be either functional (like running errands) or passive (watching TV). But when we do things like this he considers it to be good time spent together and will complain if I ask for more. 

Recently we went to a 4-day convention and had a great time, and afterwards he said he needed some space to recover from all the socializing, which is totally fair. But it's now been 2 days since I've had more than just a text conversation with him and the boundaries thing came up again when I asked if he wanted to watch a show together tonight. I feel like it's odd to not want to see your partner every day. When we were living seperately I would have loved to see him every day if I had the choice, I thought it would change when we moved in together. Is this normal for couples that are an introvert/extrovert match? 

Edit: Just want to clear up our living situation. We live in the same house but I occupy the basement that has a bathroom, kitchen, living room, and separate entrance. He shares the upstairs with our roommates. So in order to see each other it has to be  intentional as we don't cross paths naturally

ANSWER: Wait you guys live together and haven’t spoken beyond texting in 2 days?? Do you not share a room??

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (23F) is considering break up with my bf (22M)

Hi I'd like to ask for advice since I'm planning to break up with my bf soon. I'm a date to marry person but I personally don't see my bf as someone i would marry because our lifestyle and goals don't match. We mostly argue as well about it. But I know also that finding a kind guy is difficult nowadays. I lost attraction and feelings for him so I think it's unfair to stay. But I'm not sure if I should settle because I don't know if I'll find someone like him again, and I feel guilty because I don't want him to feel hurt. He also keeps saying I should give the relationship another chance, but I'm really tired of the cycle. I'm more open to becoming friends with him but not as a partner, but I'm not sure if that will even work.

Any suggestions how I can end things amicably?

ANSWER: thanks for the advice 🥹 I'm just scared to be alone again and the dating world nowadays is very scary (All previous relationships of mine just wanted the physical aspect without commitment). I lucked out on finding someone not like that but it's sad that our life goals aren't a match..

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (F19) just got cheated on by my (M20) boyfriend. Advice on how to trust again?

For context I was in a tumultuous 4 year long toxic on and off relationship with my (19M) ex. It completely shattered my self worth and ruined my trust completely. I found out he was cheating on me earlier this year, which hurt, but wasn't completely unexpected because he was an all round shit boyfriend. I swore off dating and thought I wouldn't be in a relationship again for a very long time until I met my (20M) now ex but at the time boyfriend. 

He treated me better than I could've imagined, bought me flowers without asking, showered me with compliments, did basically everything I ever dreamed of my first boyfriend doing without me asking. I genuinely thought this was me getting the happy, healthy relationship I know I deserve. And then I found out he cheated. 

At least with my first boyfriend, I knew he didn't treat me well and I knew I deserved better but I just loved him so much I gave him so many chances to try and be better for me, which he never did (I didn't take him back after he cheated, I only found that out months after we'd broken up). He never pretended to be "perfect boyfriend", or if he did it lasted a week maximum. 

My most recent ex went above and beyond to prove he was different, that I could trust him, just to be cheating on me the entire time. I never really spoke about my ex in detail to him, but I did tell him that I'd been cheated on and he said how disgusting it was he could do that to me, knowing he was cheating on me at the same time. 

I know I'm young and I know I'll meet someone that will treat me right but how can I trust it's not all just a facade. I genuinely thought this boy was everything I had ever dreamed of and it was all just a lie. 

I posted on this sub before we started dating, saying how I was worried about getting into a new relationship because I had such a bad experience with my first ex and I was so worried that it would happen again. The comments were all telling me that I was ruining my chances with a good guy and I was still hung up on the past. But I was right. I shouldn't have trusted him, I should've kept my guards up. And now it's made it 10 times harder for me to ever trust anyone ever again. 

Obviously, I will be taking a long time to heal before trying to date again. But when the time does come, how will I get past this? How can I trust that even the nice guy who does everything right isn't secretly disloyal?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (26F) want to visit my parents a few days early for Thanksgiving but my husband (25M) wants me to wait so we can travel together. How do we compromise?

We’ve been married for 2 years and have been together for 7.

I can leave for Thanksgiving this Saturday, but my husband has to work a half-day on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.

I want to go early to spend extra time with my parents since I rarely see them but my husband thinks I should wait to leave until he can come with me.

We had a huge argument about this where divorce was brought up because my husband feels like that I keep disregarding his feelings. 

This situation happened a few months ago as well.  I left for a weekend to go home to visit my parents and my husband was very upset. He couldn’t believe I was leaving without him. He didn’t want to come, but I wanted to see my parents. I still went home of course. 

He doesn’t like the idea of me doing things alone. I’m pretty sure he would be uncomfortable with me traveling alone ever. I don’t understand it because I would totally allow him to and have often encouraged him to travel alone.

My husband wants me to wait for him. His reasons: • we’d arrive separately • safety concerns about me driving alone • he doesn’t want to be alone • he feels married couples should travel together • this is a “family” holiday, so we should travel together as a family

I feel torn, because I don’t want to dismiss his feelings, but I also really value the extra time with my family. I really don’t want to stir my husband up or create conflict but I also don’t understand why I can’t go home alone and he meet me there when he’s able to?

I understand that he doesn’t want to be alone. I wouldn’t like it either if I had to work while my spouse was on vacation, but I also feel that I would encourage my spouse to go on vacation / visit family even though I’m not able to. In fact, I have numerous times in the past.

He says it’s disrespectful of me to do this to him. But I don’t understand how. I know it may go against his wishes, but I don’t feel like I’m being disrespectful.

What am I missing? How do I handle this situation?

ANSWER: > He says it’s disrespectful of me to do this to him. 

He’s confusing respect with obedience. It is extremely concerning that he tried to prevent you from visiting your family - isolating you from your support system is something abusers do. How does he generally act when he doesn’t get his way?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I'm (23F) giving the man (24M) that I'm talking to space but I don't know when I should stop waiting

So I (23F) have been talking to a guy let's call him Peter (24M) for about two months now. We have a lot in common with hobbies and interest and text basically every day with having a phone call every now and then while we play video games or just to talk. For context, we met on Hinge and we're long distance (a 2+ hour drive from each other) so we havent met in person yet but were arranging plans to meet soon. 

Recently, I was preparing to go to a wedding and had to get my hair done which was expensive. We're a different race and he was fascinated by how much money my race spends on getting our hair done and he wanted me to send a picture of what "expensive" hairstyles look like. We were texting all day even while I was at the salon. I forgot about the promise to send him a picture of my hair and only remembered while I was getting ready for the night. I took a picture with just my bra on and used an emoji to cover up my chest to not make the picture inappropriate.  After I sent it, I got radio silence from him. Not a single text. Of course, I got worried and insecure about the photo, if it was too much or if he didn't like it. This happened on Tuesday. I wasn't going to text him just in case something happened and was going to give him by 8pm Friday to respond, otherwise I would consider him ghosting me. 

Friday morning, I sent Peter a text if I scared him and started my countdown. He didn't make the deadline but he did text me at 10pm sending long texts about how he was really sorry and told me he was scared not of me but of something that happened to him recently. Whats making me question this situation is that this situation happened to start right after I sent the photo; but I felt bad for him and sent him encouraging texts saying that it was okay and that he could talk to me about it since he was handling it alone but he said he wasn't ready to talk about it yet which is understandable. He said he will talk about it on the next day we call each other which hasn't been set yet. (Don't know if this matters but in the middle of his apologies, he complimented my hair.) He left my last encouraging texts on delivered and hasnt replied since (this was four days ago from posting this).

I'm giving him space now to calm down and see what he wants to do next. However, I dont know how long to wait. I really like Peter and want to meet and start a relationship but I don't want to seem overbearing. How much time can I give him to contact me again? Would it be too much if I send him another text after a few days? Note that I haven't liked a person this much since my ex and I went on a few dates in between my ex and meeting Peter and haven't felt this way with any of my other dates.

ANSWER: Space is fine but four days is kinda wild. i’d give it one more simple check in then stop chasing. if he wants this he’ll show it. if not you’ll know fast. don’t sit around waiting forever.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My bf (29M) has shattered my trust (26F) recently and I don’t know if this is fixable or blaring red flags and I should trust my gut.

I’m struggling to figure out whether the issues in my relationship are normal growing pains or signs of deeper problems. I (26F) have been with my boyfriend (29M) for several months. In many ways he treats me amazingly, like an absolute princess. Very loving, caring, and attentive, but there are patterns around jealousy, insecurity, and honesty that are getting harder to ignore.

A big thing that’s always been in the back of my mind is how we met. My best friend of 14 years and him had a thing with him about 10 years ago, they hooked up a a handful of times in high school and almost dated. I’ve tried to accept it, and I’ve gotten better about it over time, but it’s always been a sensitive foundation. They matched on Tinder before he met me, that’s actually how we met, through her. And before he met me in person, he would sometimes message her asking to play Fortnite, double-text her, etc. He always told me he “wasn’t attracted to her” and only matched because she was an old friend and wanted to possibly meet one of her friends instead. After recent events, I’m not sure I believe that anymore.

There’s also his child’s mother. They haven’t been together in 8 years, but they lived together as roommates a year ago to help each other through bad living situations. He constantly talks bad about her, that she put him through hell. But admitted that if she’d made a move, he would’ve slept with her. Now, with everything else going on, I’m questioning whether they really didn’t hook up during that time.

The situation that blew everything up happened recently with another girl, M. Before he and I met, he clearly had interest in her, they became internet friends, flirted lightly, responded to each other’s stories, sent each other memes here and there. I didn’t think much of it because he made me feel secure. Last week, after we’d been drinking, I asked if he found her attractive. She is pretty hot, even posts lewd photos of her in thong bikinis and tight dresses showing off her nice body and curves. But he denied finding her attractive repeatedly. I checked the messages and saw that he told her “you’re quite attractive” three weeks before he met me. The issue isn’t that he found someone attractive before me, it’s that he lied about it. And he continued talking to her after we were together, even though their “friendship” was built on past interest, intention, and attraction. He recently saved a meme and sent it to both her and me, which felt intentional. What complicates it is, ever since being with me, posting me on his story & such, she recognized me from school & she hypes up our relationship and they sometimes talk about me. He openly tells her he’s in love with me and talks highly of me, but I can’t help but feel like she’s on the back burner. And she didn’t reciprocate his message he sent to her about how he thinks she’s attractive. But why continue the friendship with her, especially considering the boundaries he has set for me very early on, some of which before we were actually even dating. 

He has had very strict boundaries for me from the very beginning, many of which have been rooted entirely in jealousy, not actual concerns or harm I’ve done. He doesn’t want me replying “thank you” if a guy compliments me on my story or post. He’s gone through my phone multiple times while I was sleeping “for reassurance,” even though I’ve never given him a reason to doubt me. And I never go through his. Hes had countless nightmares, all the time, about me cheating (and I have no clue why or what that means?) He’s commented on my outfits, saying he doesn’t want me wearing short skirts without him there. He’s blown up about harmless interactions, like me dancing at a party before we were official, or a long-time internet friend I’ve never flirted with. This internet friend, B, has been my internet friend for about 8 years now. Never flirting, always platonic. I told my bf about a harmless joke I made nearly 6 years ago when B was in the military. Saying “we should get fake married so I can get the benefits of the military, the big house, the traveling” and my bf was pretty upset to the point of not wanting me to be friends with him anymore. He has since softened, he met him online & isn’t threatened anymore. But his initial reaction was a bit extreme. 

Meanwhile, he was maintaining contact with a woman he once pursued, lying about details, and keeping a connection going behind the scenes. The double standard has really damaged my trust.

I love him and there are good parts of our relationship, but I don’t know if what I’m dealing with is fixable insecurity or red flags that point to long-term patterns: jealousy, dishonesty, and a need for female attention. When this came out, he was defensive, tried to flip things on me, then eventually apologized. Since then he’s been “overcorrecting” flowers, handwritten notes, chores, deactivating social media, promising he’ll never talk to her again. But it feels like panic, not real change.

The cherry on top is, I’m supposed to sign a lease with him next month. We are supposed to get a place with my me, him, and my disabled mother. But due to him breaking my trust, I don’t know if it’s a good idea to potentially trap myself in a lease with him. It’s really the best option for me at the moment, but I don’t want to be trapped. 

He really has made me feel so secure, I’ve built so much trust in him over the course of our relatively short relationship. I felt like I was on cloud 9. Like I was the apple of his eye. But now I don’t know what to trust or believe anymore. I wish he could’ve just been honest about M. Maybe saying something like “yes I found her attractive, and I told her that, but I don’t anymore, I only see you, and if it makes you uncomfortable, I can remove her” but instead he lied until I found solid proof. He would’ve been very upset had I done the same. 
And now I feel like he lied with his intentions with my best friend, who he’s regularly around due to me. I feel like he’s been desperate when it comes to women & hookups in the past. For example, the situation with his child’s mother when they were living together. He’s had a track record of poor judgement, stuff that I haven’t even mentioned here. And it makes me think he’ll have poor judgement one day when it comes to being loyal to me. 

My biggest fear is being cheated on and lying in a relationship. This has shattered my illusion of feeling safe, secure, my trust in him. Is this something that can realistically be worked through, or am I ignoring red flags that will keep repeating?

ANSWER: I think you need to reevaluate how secire he has made you feel previously because the firat half of your post makes you sound insecure. 


This man has some pretty serious jealousy and control issues if hes gone through youre phone repeatedly while youre sleepimg and you cant even thank another man for a compliment. Not to even mention the double standards he set

================================================================================

QUESTION: Do I (34M) correctly talk to my fiancé (30F) when she is upset/crying about the distance from our LDR?

My fiancé and I are in a long-distance relationship (5,000 miles apart). The distance is hard for both of us. Sometimes she cries because she can't be with me for little moments, like going to the store, going on a walk, or getting coffee. I get it, I am with her, I miss those moments so much. I am wondering if I can improve my behavior in those moments. 

Usually, when she begins to cry, I try to validate her feelings by saying, "I hear you. Yes, I am sad too. I want to be with you in this moment very much. I feel you." Then I ask her if she needs anything, "Is there anything I can do for you?" If she says no, then I say, "Okay, I love you," and I remain quiet and let her cry. I won't say anything unless I am spoken to to give her space.

If she asks for something, such as reassurance or connection, I will try to make space for that as much as I can. 

Is that okay? Being silent doesn't feel very good, but I don't know what to say. I also want to give space in those moments.

ANSWER: When will you actually be living together how long is the wait and why are you not living together since you're engaged? LDRs are super hard.

================================================================================

QUESTION: To me (40F), partner (37 M) seems terminally unhappy w/ our family life, despite loving us. IDK how to shake it off and can't tell if I'm overreacting, if this is normal for millennial US couples, and whether separating would be better for all of us.

I've made things bold to try and make this easier to read because I'm long-winded; sorry for the length of this :| It keeps looking like it came from chatgpt but it didn't, I've been painstakingly editing this with my squishy lil human hands for like three hours. New acct cos he knows of my reg one.

Context: 

Together since 2010, married 2014. Two neurodivergent kids, 9 and 5.

Finances are tight. He's been laid off for over a year and I don't make much.

We live near his parents who help with the kids sometimes but aren't really 'kid' people. The kids don't feel allowed to cry around them for fear of being reprimanded. Getting help usually means hella meltdowns, like saving up the work we would've done and hurling it all at us at once when we get home. No fault of the kids', just, it can be exhausting. 

My fam is out of state and I don't see them often.

Everything disclosed has been talked about. We have a lot of communication once things deescalate, and it usually works out ok(?), only to keep having shitty run-ins over and over. It feels like being told I'm loved but being treated like I'm a burden.

What I don't know is if the types of interactions we have are common and I'm overreacting; or if they really are toxic and worth separating over. 

Description of our marriage & life (cw, sexual descriptions):

There is affection between us. We express love to each other each day, hug, snuggle each night. We're usually very physically affectionate and usually kind to each other. I do genuinely love him and think he does love me.

I can't remember the last time we had sex. He'll occasionally (1x / month) initiate things like masturbating (with consent) while I'm in bed w him, but I'm the initiator for anything more than that, which leaves me feeling like a butt he can get off to (sorry if tmi). That doesn't inspire confidence and I've mostly stopped trying. He's on an SSRI so I figure that's got something to do with it.

We love being together, but hardly do anything outside the house together anymore because we have young kids and little money for sitters. I also got tired of being the only one initiating, planning, executing, etc, after asking for more effort from him periodically for years. It's possible to go on dates when the kids are at school, for example. It's possible to have special time together someplace like a park or even at home making a meal together or something. But he says doesn't have the energy or doesn't know how to make plans bc of tight finances. Now if I mention missing him or wanting more time together, he starts complaining about feeling like he’s never enough for me, and the whole conversation shuts down.

He struggles with depression. He takes an SSRI. I do too. We live in a gloomy state and it's hard. 

We've gone to couples' counseling (another thing I made happen for us) and I have a therapist (since 2003). He had two diff therapists off and on for about two years (one of whom I found for him) but he hasn't had a therapist in over a year.

I've been the sole source of income for months. I am also managing most of the domestic stuff. He's been the SAHD for a year+, and while he will certainly do \some\ things, the comparison to when I was the SAH parent is so disparate; I'm still doing most of that work PLUS being the (admittedly modest) breadwinner.

Daily, it's obvious that the kids' presence and needs are burdensome to him. They cry to me about missing me when I get home and how he was short with them. Right now I'm stressed about taking time to write this instead of going home to help out. They (especially the older one) sometimes describe feeling like he doesn't like them, or when I get home they say "daddy was all stressed out today." "I wanted a snack but daddy was stressed out so I just skipped it instead of asking him." 

He loves me but it seems like he isn't \in love\ with me. When I ask if he's in love with me, he says things like "I mean, I think so, I feel like I'm in love with you." There's no urgency, no, "omg honey of COURSE I'm in love with you, how could I not be?" etc. It's like the light is gone from his eyes when he looks at me, and has been since we became parents.

For years he would say I'd talked him into having kids and that now he has to grieve the life he could have had, the things he could have done, the money he could have made, etc. He doesn't talk like that much anymore and has said he doesn't feel that way anymore, but the vibe is def that he doesn't feel great about his life, even if he says he loves it or he loves his family. 

(I did pressure him to make up his mind about whether he wanted to marry me and whether he wanted kids or not, because I was pushing 30 and wanted kids and he was dragging his feet for years; he never said he didn't want kids or marriage, and eventually chose marriage and kids only to disclose after a few years that he had been dishonestly people pleasing, which is unfortunate but also not my fault.)

Anyway. What led to this post today was the same kind of interaction we'll often have, that I'm expected to just sort of move on from. 

We both woke up tired this morning. I realized about 30 mins into the day, wondering why I was so tired after getting 8 hours of sleep, that we (the grown ups) hadn't eaten dinner last night.

This afternoon, I was being sweet and affectionate with him. The kids were at school. I'd given him kisses and cuddles and I'd complimented him and I'd shown up for conversation with him and listened to his woes about a job interview situation he had going on. I was in a light, good, friendly mood. I'd just taken the dog for a huge muddy hike and then bathed her though, which I was worn out and overstimulated from.

When our conversation reached a lull:

Me: "hey, I realized why I was so tired this morning: I didn't have dinner last night." 

Him: "ah, you gotta be more careful about that!" 

Me (thinking about it, then playfully): oh, but neither did you tho! (poke him affectionately, smiling warmly)

Him: (skeptical grimace)

Me: "probably would've been an easier morning for you too if you had." 

Him (irritated): "I wasn't hungry." 

Me, laughing a little: "you know no one in this family is any good at noticing hunger cues." (SIDE NOTE, he REGULARLY says he's not hungry then when he is shown food or starts eating is like "holy shit I was SO HUNGRY," it happens SO OFTEN y'all)

Him: "I wasn't hungry. I don't want to eat if I don't feel like eating." 

Me: (quiet) (dropping it bc he's seeming annoyed)

Him, matter-of-factly reiterating: "I'm don't want to eat when I'm not hungry. So, that's a THING." 

Me, confused what 'that's a thing' meant here: "low blood sugar is also a thing, so, cranky stressed mornings are also a thing you've complained about before. .. I just wanted to share in case it was helpful." My tone of voice still had a playful edge but I was starting to feel uncomfortable, unsure of whether we were arguing or not

Then:

Him: (walks off to leave the house abruptly. He'd already been preparing to run an errand but there was a suddenness about his leaving. As he got to the door he said, in a loud, sort of snide, angry voice, "look, I already put all kinds of shit in my body that I don't want to, just so that I'm not MEAN to this family ALL THE TIME."

Me, surprised: "...oh."

Him, matter of factly, laughing kind of sarcastically: "Sorry, THAT'S the guy you married."

Me: (blinks, not sure what to say)

Him, annoyed: "what, have I freaked you out now?"

Me, still slightly playful but a bit hurt: "I don't know, I haven't processed what you said fully, but (dog) and I are gonna go hide in the pantry now :(" 

(I often resort to comedy to diffuse tension and I think that was what I was going for?? ugh. The dog walked away from me, completely disinterested in my coaxing motions, which was honestly kind of funny.)

Him, coldly: "(dog) doesn't wanna go hide in the pantry with you, looks like you're on your own." He walked out and called "love you, bye" over his shoulder, sarcastically? more like a habit than like he meant it, the door shutting before I'd responded.

This is the kind of interaction we have every 2-3 weeks or so.  I lived in NJ and NY for years and know how to give each other shit lovingly; this is not it and when I bring it up it's never like "oh I was kidding," it's always more like "I should just stop telling you how I feel" or "I didn't mean it, I was just frustrated." But it hurts!! And he's been doing it for like a decade!!! 

Every time I start feeling better about our relationship he says something like that. Some, "sorry, you married this guy and he fucking hates parenting" or "gosh if I didn't have these kids I could just go \\\ myself but instead I have to just be around to be screamed at and told what to do 24/7 for the rest of my life" or such.

My family was a fucking mess and a half (thus therapy since I was 18) so my barometer is likely off, and IDK if it's off as in, "this is normal and you're too sensitive," or off as in, "wtf this isn't what a partnership looks like, get out!!!"

He's always listening to YouTube or podcasts on his headphones when we're around, and to talk to him, we need to interrupt and wait patiently for him to pause stuff so I try to give him space with it because it's obviously annoying for us to interrupt his media. 

I handle so much parenting and household chores and also working and also making most of our social calendar stuff happen and I just don't know why he's so stressed and depressed about our lives together when he spends so much time doing his own thing in his office, or playing video games. He has so much more 'time off' than I do, SO MUCH more time at home alone, and somehow I do more with my time off and my time at home than he does. He commonly remarks about having 'no time' for projects or 'no time' to catch up on this or that, to exercise or to learn how to make a new meal or to do any of the other things he talks about wanting to do. 

If you're thinking, "you need to let him fail, you need to let him have more responsibility, he probably feels like you don't trust him to make mistakes and fix them, or to be able to get it right the first time," I totally hear you and also have tried. I let him fail often. I don't always fix his mistakes. 

I probably give him more advice and more feedback than is healthy but usually remember to ask if he wants advice before trying to fix vs. just listen. And the kids end up paying the price when I let him fail too much for too long, and there's only so much I can let him fail at that when his choices lead to objectively unhealthy consequences for them (same underwear for several days on end and yeast infections he wouldn't even have noticed, then calling the doctor because he wouldn't get around to it even once informed, then taking them bc it's private and sensitive and they want me and not him, for example). 

I'm not perfect either, I can be cranky or distant, but usually it's because I either feel unsupported or because I feel hopeless about our relationship / miss feeling wanted and like someone is in love with me. I have codependent tendencies I've been working on in therapy since I entered adulthood. I'm trying my best and I'm leaps and bounds better than I was in my 20's.

Tl;dr: husband on one SSRI regularly says things like "I already put all kinds of shit in my body that I don't want to, just so that I'm not MEAN to this family ALL THE TIME."  Promises he loves us but seems perpetually burdened.

How could I shrug it off versus letting it ruin my day? 

Would separating be worth the trauma to everyone, or more traumatic than staying together?

ANSWER: Please, separate, or more. Let his parents deal with him. It would be less work for you. No, this is not normal. He does sound depressed, but also he hasn't worked in a year and also seems entirely uninterested in being a husband, father or member of your household, or decent human being. It must be like having a surly teen. Set him free. You deserve better.

QUESTION: To flirt or not to flirt? [25f][25m]

I[25f] recently joined my coworker [25m]’s friend group. his best friend [25m, Clark] and i got along well enough to where we spent most of a saturday group hang dancing. i mentioned to coworker that i want to get to know his friends better, including clark. coworker said “oh he would REALLY like that especially since his situationship just fell through”. 

idk what i want from clark as i’m just reentering the dating scene after an almost 2 year single streak. i’m nervous to cause drama within this new friend group or make it awkward that i’m not invited anymore. i also dont think i want a full on relationship?? just a side piece? maybe?

i’m stuck between inviting him to an event (that everyone else in the group declined so it would be solo), waiting for him to make the first move, or  just not at all.


tldr; new friendgroup through coworker. chemisty with coworker’s best friend. help

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (21NB) am exceedingly confused by my friend’s (20M) behavior around a falling out between us and a friend group (19-22, mixed). How do I proceed?

Hey Reddit, so this is bizarre. Incoherent, even. There’s a lot characters. 

I run a club with some friends in an industry that most of us are going into. This semester with it has been a bit of a nightmare socially. 

I was invited and then uninvited on a fall break road trip. I was upset about it due to some stuff with Ignatz (20M) inviting me and then sending the fact I was no longer invited. That caused a fight where a lot of things were left unsaid, and as such I still kinda have no clue what happened or why. Hilda (19f) apologized to me, Lorenz (21M) told me about some things we had miscommunicated about, and Leonie (22F) didn’t say anything to me. Ignatz and I had a longer heart to heart. For Ignatz, the trip apparently sucked and he was used as a driver the whole time while the others wouldn’t talk to him, and it really made him change his perspective on them. From what I can tell, he was also scapegoated into being the one who had an issue with me, as I got conflicting stories from everyone, with Lorenz telling me that the miscommunications were issues everyone had, while Hilda stated it was just a Lorenz and Ignatz thing. Leonie did not talk to me. Honestly everything with that ordeal could be it’s on Reddit story. 

I eventually just decided to let the matter go past that because it became clear that I wasn’t going to get answers or an apology from most of them and I have a job. What I’m left with is Ignatz telling me that some of it was simply me being caught up in the blame for something that doesn’t have to do with me. I press the matter, and he doesn’t elaborate. 

Fast forward to this week. We’re planning an event and evaluating who runs the club next year and who should run for the board. I am no longer eligible so I do not have a horse in this race (graduating). We’re doing one last event that was Hilda’s idea, but there hasn’t been movement for weeks, and a lot of the work has fallen to me, even though it was not initially supposed to be my job as I was super busy with work. 

Ignatz notices this. He then vents to me about the fact that Hilda has been not doing any of the work and that he’s been having problems with them, leading to him leaving the club (or planning to, anyways). He’s still got a lot of upset for Hilda, Lorenz, and Leonie. I don’t blame him, as there’s been a pattern of those three pushing work and responsibilities onto us while reaping the rewards of it. 

He explains some more context of the interpersonal drama. Ignatz asked for help at a party with protecting someone who was very clearly too drunk to consent to anything while someone was hitting on her. It blew up with a lot of shittalking from there. He and Hilda have been fighting. Ignatz threatened to resign. 

I was informed of none of this as it was happening. It’s been going on for weeks, if not months. 

I ask if any of this has to do with the fall break trip and why I was uninvited, as this was an interpersonal drama that had nothing to do with me and then escalated. Matches what he told me after we made up, right? 

He responds that he can’t talk about the interpersonal drama that led to me getting uninvited as it is embarrassing for at least one of the people involved. Doesn’t confirm nor deny that it’s the same situation, although it may be implied as a denial. 

I press for more information, saying that “I’m in no place to judge.” He states that people say that, but that this is simply so embarrassing that he cannot divulge. I wonder who he’s protecting, and he says he that it’s one of them (meaning Hilda, Lorenz, and Leonie). This is despite the fact that he despises them now. 

That is all the information I have. 
I don’t know if I should press for more information. I have a lot of questions. What could possibly be so fucking embarrassing that he’d protect them even now? Is he protecting himself? 

I have no answers. I have no context. I know the logical answer is to leave. It’s what Ignatz is doing. I just don’t know what to do.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend M24 has anxious attachment. What do i F19 do?

Hello! Im Karl. Im 19 and ive been together with my boyfriend for about 7 months. Ever since the beginning i knew he wasnt very secure with his mental state. He didnt seem to let it take him down tho, so i was fine with it. Im not a person who can personally handle dealing with people like that since im not in a good state myself and dealing with it for too long becomes draining and makes me resent the other person. 
Well, after about 3 months of dating i noticed that he started talking about feeling ignored because i dont reply fast enough or how we dont spend enough time together. I awnsered by saying that ill try to fix my texting habits atleast as much as i could and that i cant really change anything about how much time we spend together because we both work and every free day we both have was already filled with us hanging out. After that i thought the problem was fixed. I tried my best to text him more and tried planning cooler dates for when we hang out so maybe hell feel better. One thing to take notice of is that he isnt amazing with english and its the only language we can both talk in. That made his online conversations extremely.. bland.. so even when we did text, it was about quite shallow topics and it didnt really go far. 
After the first time he told me about his feelings, he started bringing the same topic up, but not by saying that i should text more but by randomly texting comments like "i wish you loved me like you used to" or "can i even text you? Am i bothering you?" Which was suprising at first because ive never expressed things like that. Whats more is that this started happening weekly. Every time it happened i had to explain the same things again to him. 
If i dont reply, im busy and i tried texting him too when i was busy. Yet, the comments remained. 
With every comment I've grown more and more resentful and defensive. Ive started to feel like im a bad girlfriend and that im doing something wrong because why does he keep saying stuff like that. This has caused a few fights and its making me question everything. I love him so much and ive given him many tips on how to overcome anxiety and depression but it often feels like he doesnt care about overcoming it. Once saying that "i wont change for anyone or anything". I simply dont know what to do anymore. HELPP

================================================================================

QUESTION: (31M/29F) How do I deal with intrusive thoughts comparing new gf to an ex and move past my own superficiality?

I (31M) am in a new relationship. We started dating 3 months ago and she (29F) is absolutely wonderful, beautiful, and incredibly understanding/easy to talk to. The problem is, I think I have more baggage than I realized because I find myself having invasive thoughts about superficial things that really aren’t that big a deal, and comparing her to my ex. I don’t know how to get rid of these thoughts or if having them at all sign that I'm not ready for a relationship and should break up with her despite how much I like her and feel like she might be my dream girl.  
  
The comparison to (and even missing) my ex has only been in my head for the past 2 days, and I don’t really know what triggered it. I should note that we were together for 3.5 years and broke up 10 years ago and I hadn’t thought about her at all since like 2017. I was definitely the problem in that relationship and I would not have grown into the person I am had she not dumped me how/when she did. I’ve been in 2  (short term) relationships since then, but these thoughts never came up with or about either of them. Maybe it’s because around this time last year she messaged me out of the blue asking to get together for drinks and catch up. It was weird; she brought her boyfriend, and I left feeling good that we weren’t together anymore because she hadn’t grown as a person at all.

Now for the current relationship: I don’t believe in check box lists, but if I did, she’d hit all of them. We have similar interests, communicate in the same way, and have great romantic chemistry. I feel like I’m experiencing the “honeymoon phase” of dating for the first time in my life and am much more affectionate/committal than I’ve ever been this early on. She’s gorgeous and fun and nothing but green flags. But for whatever reason, superficial things keep popping to the forefront of my head, not enough to ruin the feelings I have for her or get in the way of intimacy but they’re bothering me more than they should.

IDK if it matters what those things are specifically, but in case they do: she doesn’t trim/shave and she goes several (3-4) days between showers. It’s her body and I respect that, I don’t want to care but I do and I feel like an asshole. It’s not even a ridiculous amount of hair and she doesn’t (usually) smell bad. Why is this manifesting as comparisons to my ex? and why that ex in particular, if it’s just superficial?

I fully recognize that this is a dumb internal problem on my part, and maybe it's two separate problems. I definitely wouldn't break up over something so insignificant but it still bugs me. How do I get these thoughts to go away?

ANSWER: I think the core Issue isn’t that you‘re comparing your girlfriend to your ex, but rather the 19yo college girl mental image of her. Meeting her again, has likely reattached that mental image, devoid of all the bad memories, to her.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Bf 18M complimenting me 18F

Are compliments important in a relationship? 
Me a 18F is upset that my bf 18M never compliments me. This is an issue that I have brought up many times throughout our 2 1/2 year relationship. It has especially been brought to his attention over the last year. I noticed that he never compliments me even when I am very obviously trying to impress him. It gets to the point where days that I feel pretty I have to forcibly ask if he agrees. Which is pretty much the only “compliment” I can get out of him. 
When I bring this up he says that he does believe I am pretty and just doesn’t “think about it” which makes me more upset because that just means when he looks at me he doesn’t think pretty or beautiful.

ANSWER: If your bf isn’t meeting your relationship needs it’s best to move on instead of attempting to change his behavior.

If you’ve told him that you need to hear positive feedback to function well in your relationship, and he isn’t doing it — then it’s not important for him to maintain your relationship.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Scared to move in with my boyfriend. Will I be sorry? F 50 M 51

I (50F)and my boyfriend (51M) are planning to buy a house together and this is the first time we’ll be living together. I’ve known my boyfriend for more than 20 years and when we first met at our job, (I haven’t worked there for over 7 years now) he was in a relationship with the mother of his son, who is now grown and moved out.  About three years ago, they went their separate ways and we have been officially dating for about 2 1/2 years at this point. We both own our own houses and have lived separately this entire time. We live just over an hour away from each other. I have lived alone ever since I bought my house almost 22 years ago. We have a good relationship, but sometimes I think things are too easy. I might just be overthinking it since we are obviously older with a lot more life experience. We are both independently taking care of our own money and households. We do not share money and we always take turns paying for things. With all of that in mind, I would say that my biggest concern at this point is that I don’t want to get a house together, move in and feel like I’ve become a caretaker for him. He insists that he can take care of himself and does not expect me to do anything more than what I want to do for him. I don’t want to feel like I am doing more to take care of the household and subsequently wind up with feelings of resentment towards him and the relationship.  I’m wondering what are your best pieces of advice to keep me from taking on more chores or responsibility than I want to? How do I keep both of our expectations in line and not regret making the move in together?

ANSWER: It sounds like you really don’t want to move in with him because you know you’ll end up taking care of him. Keep your own house and just move in with him and see if it works . If it doesn’t work you can move back into your house

QUESTION: is this just me? F21 and m20

so this guy, M20, is my first ever bf. we started dating literally like 2-3 weeks ago. since he is my first, i have absolutely no experience in anything sexual. when my bf and i makeout, i feel like im overly concious of everything. every hand placement, every angle, just everything. i can’t seem to just fall into the kiss. and when i do kiss, im so focused on kissing that my body just can’t relax. i forget to put my hands on him or in his hair. im just stiff and my lips are the only thing moving. why is this the case?? is kissing supposed to be like this? is it because im not 100% attracted to him?

QUESTION: Intimacy fast F25 with M28

So this guys been trying to talk to me for years. I’ve always been really sheltered. I’ve only had 3 relationships and sex maybe 10 times total? I’m 25 female btw. My first was in high school 2 times cause I wasn’t able to get more chances . My second only happened 2 times as well but it was cause I wasn’t actually into him. And my last only 6 times cause of covid.  Either way majority of my experiences have been limited for usually something out of control. I’m not religious but I am a lover girl and I feel like my minds programmed to believe loves suppose to come first before sex. And honestly I get really nervous when people touch me physically. Even a hug because I’m not use to it.  

This guy clearly desires me. (Hes 28m, been wanting to date me since we were teens) He talks about sex a lot. Wants me. But I’m scared, and he thinks I’m playing games with him due to it. 

I have this fear of being used, but also this fear I’m missing out on life, fun and experiences . I feel really torn 50/50. Also worried if I’m not even good in bed due to my lack of experience. So many fears and insecurities I hate it.  I do sexually desire him back. He even got tested so I’d feel safe. Idk what is wrong with me 

Can I have some advice here? Please.

ANSWER: 13 years is not fast

If you don't hurry up you'll be too old for the age gap to continue exciting him

QUESTION: Ex (29F) misses me (27M)?

Hey y'all, I (27M) have been dating 29F for the past 5 months. She went on a trip recently and a couple days after her trip she ended our relationship. It's been about a month since we have now been broken up and this past Sunday, I received a couple texts from her that are confusing me. She was the first to say "Miss you" and then she went on about how she was struggling. Upon further questioning, she responded that she was struggling with our breakup. I didn't want to do the conversation over text so I asked if she was ok with meeting in person. She said "yes" and when I asked her if we could meet this week, she responded with "I'm super busy this week, maybe next week." To which I responded with, "Alright well, just let me know." She responded back to me saying, "Will do! If I don't text by next week just text me again, I probably meant to." I just don't know what to do.

ANSWER: She was happy to break up with you while on the high of vacation fun times, and even now is being kind of tepid about meeting up to talk about reconciliation.

She is already lukewarm at best about your relationship.

Is that the kind of love you want for yourself, or would you prefer to hold out for someone who enthusiastically wants to be with you?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Advise on a regretful text i sent to someone i was dating. I (M32) her (F28)

I (M32) dated a girl (F28) for a little over 3 weeks. In that 3 weeks we saw each other quite frequent. 3 dinner dates, she came over twice to hang in the garage/drive way (I live with my mom and invited her in ofc but she said at the time meeting my mom is too soon and she was cool with my living situation told her if we got serious i could get appt asap; she lives with her family so understood), also the reason why she visited those two times was bc she was visiting a friend in town and stopped by bc it was close. Every time we were in person it was very flirty touchy feely and we made out constantly.

OCT 22nd was her bday and i decided to take her to a hockey game that friday (NHL) and saturday we agreed the week before to go to Cedar Point (amusement park). We had a blast everything was perfect and fun. That sunday (OCT 26) we were texting and i mentioned zoo lights in december and i maybe felt her tone change. I thought oh no i mentioned a date 2 months ahead and she in the beginning wanted to take it slow so felt like i maybe put pressure on her? IDK. Ill add for every date i paid for everything, held/opened everydoor (even my truck getting in and out, we told each other gm/gn, shared personal things and got along great). Monday Oct 27th comes around i was overthinking. I asker her if i was doing too much and she replies (paraphrasing) that to her it feels like im trying to hard to make this work, she can get easily spooked, and can pull back/away without noticing. I was just thinking to myself well yeah im trying to make this work, im invested, i care about you and we both want long term. So i just said okay loud and clear i respect your honesty. Things back to being fine. 2 days ago i sent her 3 rather lovey dovey tiktok DMs and no response (and weve been sending those othen so it wasnt out of the blue so i thought that was odd, could be overthinking). On tuesday 21st i mentioned her coming over to cook arepas (bc we talked about that on saturday at cedar point and my mom would be out of town and id have the condo to myself) and she mentioned that she could come over today (21st). I was like oh wow like today today like awesome i get to see her. I was very happy.

She comes over everything is great. After dinner she mentions me washing the dishes and I said ill get it later and she rather insisted doing it now so i was like okay yeah sure and she got visibly and verbally upset at how i was washing the dishes bc i was wasting so much water my method. I was kinda joking about it and playing around and she was zero having it. She was telling me her way and I was like trying to do that and apparently was not and she said i dont listen and stuff, again i was like being funny and trying and called me a toddler (maybe she was kidding but like she wasnt laughing). I kinda played it off and we started making out and eventually having sex for the first time. It was okay. Like to me first time isnt going to be wild or amazing but it was nice. To me she rather leaves kinda abruptly (930pm) and was overthinking it bc we'd stay out until midnight before. But we leave on good terms and id always say lmk when you get home and drive safe. She does and both say gn all good, im feeling great rn.

Next day we text good morning per usual and i text her around 915am (my break time) with a pic of leftover banana bread she made and brought over saying "thanks babe so excited for this". Comes to be noon and nothing from her. That was a first bc she always texts around the time back and def before noon. around 130pm i send another text saying "youre more than welcome to come over again this week, hope youre having a good day"-paraphrasing-). Sent her a IG dm reel too and saw she seen it and no response. She texts back around 230pm "it did come out really good lol just waiting on more bananas to go bad" and "Ill let you know if I can okay?". Around 330pm i hearted the message and said "busy day today? being outside for work was rainy and cold with sucked lol" then "can I call you after work or w/e youre free just to talk. Good vibes". She gets off at 5pm (she works from home). 6pm comes around, no response. Its now 10pm and still nothing so im freaking out that i did something wrong or my worst fear getting ghosted.

At 10pm i call her and it rings and rings then voicemail. So im in panic mode rn tbh so i text her "I dont know what i did to make you avoidant today? Yesterday was fine? I honestly dont know what you want. We have fun together in person and over texts now this. I dont think we should continue this. I think im falling for the idea of you and not actually you. Im more than willing to talk about this but i think your silence says it" Trust me, i know. Sounds like i exploded but i promise my demeanor was calm and i just wanted to talk it out. She replies an hour later (11pm) saying, and also paraphrasing, "Hey i took some meds which made me groggy and sleepy and just work up. Honestly? IDK. i like you but dont feel like we're compatable idk what it is. Ive been ignoring your red flags and trying to see the bigger picture but i think its best to not continue as well."

I get to that text in the morning (Oct 29th) and im freaking out, also what are my red flags? I didnt ask but ive treated her so well and felt like i did a great job of showing her that id be a great potential bf. So i text back saying "i dont want us to end, esp over a miscommunication/misunderstanding, maybe yesterday we just needed the day to ourselves, if youre busy or not feeling well tell me and i would absolutely understand. I just dont want to part ways over one day. Are you feeling better?" Nothing that whole day. I told myself maybe she needs space. The next day I text saying "can i call you later if thats okay?" in the morning and nothing. she gets back to me around 530pm saying "Hey I didnt want to leave things on a bad note so i wish you the best, however Im not willing to give a second chance. You said you didnt want to cont. things and i agreed. I hope you meet someone that checks all your boxes heart emoji". I respond saying "Okay. When i said that with not continuing i didnt mean it and you do check all my boxes. It was me who made an issue. Im sorry again and you made me happy". I text again saying if i never made that text would things be okay and she says thats the thing you were impulsive and exploded. I mentioned what did you expect of me not hearing from you since 2pm and that i asked to call before you got off work and didnt reply. She rather dodged that and said i should have waited for a response and not everyone is going to say when they are napping. That my text was childish and to say i didnt mean it was insane. I proclaim that i was afraid of losing her and freaked out and that i was sorry. Id be better and youre right about it. I just wanted to talk it out and that i regret that text so much. She then said im sorry but not giving a second chance.

Weekend rolls around and send her a tiktok DM regarding "we should have just talked it out instead of ending things" and commented on her IG story of her at the gym saying "proud of you, always lift heavy!" and blocked on both. Next day i texted her saying how im truely sorry for everything and know im not getting a second chance and missed her and know i messed up. That i thought i was being ghosted and made a mistake with the text. Nothing back (didnt assume i was getting a reply).

So everyone, now im sitting here, miss her a ton, im so upset with myself over that text that night bc i panicked and should have waited. I regret it and feel like it costed us a ton more time together. But i would have never done that to her. Her not hearing from me for 8 hours and not wanting to call her if she asked. No way she didnt check her phone and i feel i was ignored which i dont like. I just hate how it ended so abruptly after everything.

EDIT: I wanted to make this edit as i have gotten some very good feedback with the comments here. IMO, hindsight, all of this could have been saved if she just would of taken 10 secs to text "hey not feeling well ttyl". I would have totally understood. I just value communication and i would have 100% done that to someone im seeing. No?

EDIT#2: Also wanted to add, if she saw my text about just wanting to call, why would she ignore that? Wouldnt she want to have the person she like call? Me wanting to call i just thought would be nice just a quick convo on the phone is all. But IMO theres no way she didnt look at her phone for 5+ hours and didnt see my text. Like she chose to ignore it which i guess i dont understand, ya know? Like to me that just shows lack of interest?

ANSWER: Look up anxious attachment style. You have it x10000. This reads as obsessive and insane. Trying to end it and then backtracking/not meaning it is also manipulation. You're not emotionally healthy or stable enough for a relationship right now.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I 19F feel like my boyfriend 21M doesn’t want me anymore

this is my first post please be kind
I 19F and my boyfriend 21M have been dating for almost a year. When we first started dating i felt like i had known him forever. Every date we would just talk and talk and it felt like everything clicked. But now I feel like he doesn’t want me sexually anymore. 
We first had sex around a month after we started dating(2-3 months after we started talking). We both agreed that we wanted to take a little time and not rush into anything especially since i had gotten out of a 3 1/2 yr relationship with my emotionally abusive ex. When we first had sex, it was great, we would normally have sex around 3-5x a week. I felt so loved and cared for throughout the relationship and we have rarely had any problems at all and when we do we communicate well and everything is okay. 
Recently, He started playing video games more and more that i go over to his house. He is on his game majority of the time im over and gets off when “he feels like it”. I have brought it up a couple of times sharing how i feel like he isn’t giving me enough attention. We spend a lot of time together so maybe that’s the problem? We have had conversations about spending less time together and doing our own thing more often, but we never commit and i end up over at his place. I also feel like i have initiated majority of the times we have had sex. I am rarely turned on now when we have sex because i feel like he thinks it’s what I want. I do not want him to do anything he is not willing to do. Maybe i should just stop initiating things and see where that takes me? I honestly have no idea what to do.

ANSWER: I think maybe he got into the comfortable phase where he feels like he doesn't need to put much effort anymore . You should have a talk with him and say whats bothering you. I'd lie if I said my man doesn't do the same sometimes but I just talk with him or enjoy the time for myself while he plays. About the sex thing, I also get it , and you should be honest with him and tell him you want him to initiate more. Also if he finishes, then he also wanted to, you don't need to worry about that. I was too but my man assured me he said he's just not that horny as a person but if he does it then he wants to.
And some man are less horny, I really thought it was gonna be the other way around too lol.
Just talk to him, most likely he got too comfortable and he isn't putting effort anymore . Tell him how you feel but also don't let him gaslight you or stuff like that.

QUESTION: my bf M20 keeps making everything sound “unfair”  and i F19 am getting so tired of it

(btw we are long distance)
Most times when we are arguing he brings up that i did smth and he didnt do, for example: he told me he was going to call me for hours later after work. i was glad cuz we dont call that much, but when he called he said we was going to call me for about 1-2 hours. i was pretty sad because 2 hours isnt too much compared to how much we used to call for (up to 5 hours) and i was sad abt it. when i get sad i get non responsive because my brain is trying to process everything. ok now for the example. he said “oh once u said we shouldnt call for long and i wasnt upset about it”. for one i do not recall myself saying that and don’t believe i would say that. second thats the problem he does. he sets a standard where everything i do, he doesnt do. he makes me sound so horrible, like i am always doing smth wrong. i feel like its okay for me to be upset about something and if its turned around he doesnt have to be upset cuz he can choose what he feels and does. i feel like i always have to act better. am i going crazy or is this how u are supposed to act in a relationship? are u supposed to act the same towards a situation?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I 24F want to do what makes me happy this seems to hurt my 23F partner- How much of yourself do you sacrifice to your relationship?

I (24F) my partner (23F) have been together for almost three years. We started living together a year ago. We are very much in love and for the most part really happy together. I'm struggling in our relationship to know my own boundaries as im a very relaxed person and my partner knows what she wants. She has no problem asking or making decisions which I love about her. I'm in therapy to work on my people pleasing pushover part of myself. However in our relationship im noticing this dynamic forming that she gets what she wants more than me. In a lot of cases I dont have a problem with this as her wants are often my wants and seeing her happy makes me happy. However, in the winter time one of my biggest hobbies starts, skiing. I’ve veen skiing my entire life and its the only thing that makes me happy outside family, her and friends. I put a lot of time and resources to be able to do this hobbie on the weekends working full time. However my partner does not like skiing the way I do. I have accepted this but when I try to go away for a weekend on a ski trip she makes me feel guilty and like I am the worst person for doing that. I asked her going into winter how we can navigate this and what her needs are. She asked for me to give her a calender with all the weekends I will be away. I did this and she made a comment about how the calendar didn't have enough effort put into it. I told her I spent an hour on it; she let it go. Then I asked her since I have a week off before Christmas and she doesnt if it would be okay for me to go skiing for 4 days and stay with my friend. She said the dates make her uncomfortable and told me not to ask when I have already made up my mind. I apologized and said I didn't know how to bring it up because I didn't want it to feel like I was telling her. She told me she needs space and she is very upset. She asked how could we possible have kids when I just leave. I feel that this is dramatizing what is happening as I am not just leaving im trying to give her a heads up. I feel sad she doesnt know I would never just leave her with our kids. I feel frustrated, controlled, and not seen. I want her to accept that this is a part of my life and be happy that im happy exercising and outside during an otherwise bleak season. I've tried to incorporate her into the sport but she said she doesnt like it and felt pressure. So I backed off and I invite her to my ski weekends still. This one trip is just during the week while she is at work full time anyways. I guess I feel frustrated that she wants me to sit around at home while shes at work instead of going and having fun. We both work full time and she has more holiday time than me. So to have the week before Christmas off is a big thing for me and I want to make the most of it. It is also my birthday week (ill be home with her for my birthday). We still have christmas and the week after together and we live together so i see her everyday. What do I say to her ? I dont want to invalidate her feelings but I want to be able to go away for a couple days here and there and not feel awful about it. I encouraged her to go on trips without me with friends all the time (Miami and Vancouver) and it just feels hurtful she doesnt do the same for me especially right before my birthday. Winter has been a point of contention and I tried to be ahead of it this year but that didn't help. It seems I cant do anything except stop doing what I love.

TLDR;

My partner doesnt want me to go away the week before my birthday and Christmas when I have the week off and she doesnt. We dont have other responsibilities. I would like to follow my passion and im sad that doing so hurts her. How do I communicate and make this easier for her and remove my guilt around going. How much self sacrifice is normal in a relationship?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Is it okay to do 20days no contact ? Me[F25] him[M35]

Hey, i am a (F) in a LDR for few months with someone that i truly care about, we decided to take 20 days break (no contact) to focus before my exams , tbh it was my idea because i want less distractions for this short period of time. He told me that he was okay with that ,since it s concerning my future . Deep inside i m scared that he s going to forget me after those 20days , or his feelings will fade, or pass to something else.. I genuinely like him .. howIs this going to affect our relationship?

ANSWER: IF he can forget you after 20 days then there wasn't a huge commitment there. Why would you waste your time with a man approaching his mid-life crisis, when you're in your mid-20s, finishing school?

================================================================================

QUESTION: What do I [27F] do next in my relationship with [28M] ? need big help

I [27F] am in a  very weird and ambiguous relationship with a [28M]. We had an on and off relationship since 2020. I was obsessed with him. But time went by and I started moving on, until he had nowhere to go and I had to move him in my studio apartment. 2 days after moving in he started going out to clubs without me, pulling all nighters and stuff. Didn’t think much of it since our relationship wasn’t defined at that point (we had sex right away, but that was it) but then we started living a looot like a couple. We both worked all day went home had diner together took care of each other, without saying it, we were it. Until February of 2025, I went to charge his Apple Watch when I saw he sent a message to a girl telling her he thought she was cute, and he wanted to see her again, and she didn’t respond (he works in delivery so I assume it’s a girl he delivered for)

It got me so upset, it was such a choc to me even though looking back it was obvious he was seeing other girls cause he was still going out nearly every single weekend with his friends, never with me. At that point I decided to check his phone, and boy was I in for a ride. He kissed girls in the club he added girls on instagram just to sext, he tries picking up girls in every app he used that has chat in it, like constant. But I gather no sex.

Thing is.. I was already in deep, I didn’t want him to leave. I was happy day to day and well.. he was nice to me. So I swallowed my pride. I felt like shit for months. I kept looking through his phone for months and not say anything. He eventually figured it out and told me that we didn’t owe each other anything, that we never told each other we were in anything serious. I swallowed my pride and just agreed.

I started chatting here and there with some men, just to fill up my time and give myself something to get my confidence back, while still in the same nice cozy happy relationship with the same guy, living together. With time I learned to roll with it and it worked wonders, until today. He got randomly really upset and didn’t want to talk, I assume (and I think I know him enough to be confident I am right) he looked through my phone and saw some texts I had with other guys (they are super soft but you know a little flirty) He is upset and distant. What the fuck is going on. I am very anxiously attached to him and I feel like I am crumbling inside.

It’s important to note: he is not into communication at all. He has never confronted me about anything ever he just shuts down and be really mean and distant.

ANSWER: If you want to be in a monogamous relationship, then this isn't the right guy for you. Break it off and get into counseling so that you can learn about healthy relationship progression and behaviors, as well as learning to set and enforce healthy boundaries. For the future, you don't ever have to let anyone move in, and if somebody doesn't communicate with you, that's a very good sign that they aren't a healthy choice for a relationship partner.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I ‘27M’ got in a sticky situation with my best friend’s sister ‘21F’. Did I messed it up?

I recently reconnected with a friend I’ve known since school. We lost contact for over ten years and just reconnected last year. Back then, we were never very close, but now, as adults, we’ve become closer. I didn’t even know he had siblings until last year.

Over time, I developed a connection with his sister(in the last 3-4 weeks). We’ve both been flirting whenever we see each other, and we genuinely enjoy each other’s company. One night, myself, two of my best friends (let’s call them A and B), and A’s sister (C) went out to a party. As the night went on, the tension between C and me became noticeable. A and B both picked up on it. A tried to stop me because he knows my past, and I tried my best not to pursue C.

At the end of the night, we went back to the hotel, where we had booked two rooms. C asked who she would be staying with. I told her it was up to her, she could stay with her brother or come back with me. She didn’t say much and walked toward my direction, and the tension grew again. A stopped me and warned me not to play with her feelings.

Back in our room, C and I started getting close, but I stopped myself. I told her I didn’t want to treat her like just a one night stand and that she deserved more. She was upset and repeatedly asked for more, but I reminded her she was drunk, and I don’t take advantage of drunk girls. I told her that if she still felt the same in the morning, we could try again.

The next morning, I made the first move while we were intimate, but I realized we didn’t have protection, so I stopped again. She was upset again, but I knew that if something happened, her family would be extremely angry. We cuddled and talked for a bit. I checked on her the next day, but she never got back to me.

As time went on, I realized that I was starting to develop real feelings for her, and I couldn’t get her out of my mind. But I feel like I might have messed it up by trying to do the right thing for her by trying to be a better man and treating her the way she deserves.

I always thought my feelings for her were just brotherly, but now I realize I might have been mistaken. Did I ruin my chance with her by trying to do the right thing? (I confessed my feelings towards C to A, he gave me his blessing. But I don’t want to force myself into her life)

HELP MEEEEE

ANSWER: She was upset you didn't want to have sex with her without a condom? Yikes! Might want to ask for a STI panel before sleeping with her.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Idk if I (18F) can get over this with (18F) partner.

Me and my 18f partner have been dating for around 5-6 months now. We have dated in the past and it didn’t end so great. She told me to kms/get r@ped. 

I have forgave her as we were both in bad places mentally. This happened around 3 years ago. I can’t forget this and I constantly worry this time around it’s going to end the same way. 

We rarely speak at the moment and have been like this for weeks. I will get left on delivered for hours whilst she’s active posting tiktoks. I know other things will come up and she will get busy but I shouldn’t I atleast deserve to be told that she is going to be busy? 

I have brought up this fact of her ignoring me multiple times and she says she will change and I have tried to be better with messaging her more often but with both of us being long distance now (as I have moved a couple hours away), our different sleep patterns, different lifestyles. I don’t think it’s worth keeping this relationship going if it’s not getting better and things aren’t improving between us. She has begged me to not end the relationship but I don’t think things will change and I can’t get over what she said to me 3 years ago. 

For context it was me who asked her out, I missed her, I genuinly loved her she was everything to me but she got back in contact with me and the feelings flooded me again and she had proven herself with saying she changed and it showed for a little bit but it slipped backwards quickly. 

I’m also thinking I want different things to her, we both want to live in different locations once were able to move out of our parents homes, I’m wanting somebody more closer to where I live and my parents are currently trying to move again witch will causes further distance. 

I have talked to her about this and she still wants to be with me despise all the different things we want in life. She says she’ll do anything as long as she will be with me but I want her to get what she wants in life aswell and to not put anything aside for me. 

I guess I’m lost because I don’t see things changing and with us wanting different things  and want somebody’s perspective on this. 

All of my friends are begging me to leave her as they can tell she’s not changed and that it’s bringing me down mentally, and she wants me all to herself she hates me contacting friends and not her. Their telling me she’s controlling me and being a manipulator (I can’t personally see it)

ANSWER: When some rando online says things like that they're not to be taken seriously and emotionally healthy people are able to brush it off. But when someone you're dating goes there it's a much bigger deal. This is because the level of irrational hatred someone who knows you would have to have to do that isn't something that just goes away in they happen to wake up in a better mood the next day. On top of that she's practicing coercive control on you and trying to isolate you so you'll have no other emotional support system. This is something disordered individuals sometimes do because they think it'll guarantee that their partner can't leave them. IMHO based on all you've said here this is a person with a lot of problems who isn't mentally/emotionally healthy enough to be in a relationship. Maybe listen to your friends on this one.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My ex 28F is a narcissist and I 27M was blinded by love. I hope Karma does its job

I am 27M and my ex is 28F and the relation was for just over 2 years.

Hey, my ex broke up with me and i am currently retrospecting the whole relationship and need you advice if my ex was toxic, or just a narcissist? This was my first relationship. 

She had anger issues. Her emotions used to control her actions. She used to take tests or create fights. Once she asked me to order few things frok decathlon and i did and paid for it. One week after she asked how much was it and i reluctantly said the amount. She paid me and i accepted and said "thank you" and she started giving me silent treatment for a week because i accepted it. She said that she can't depend on me financially and it was a test. Then she declared me money minded.    

She used to give me silent treatment whenever she got upset over something which i hated. I communicated this to her several times but she still did that.

Some weeks she said she really likes me and suddenly she says she is not sure about me just because i failed some tests etc.

Once we had made plans to meet after her exam. We both were waiting for this day as we were to meet after a long time. But after she gave her exam  she told me she don't want to meet as her mood was not okay because of the exam and stress. So i accepted it.

Now the story of the breakup.
She went to her hometown and i was doing a water ski course at a place 12 hrs away via bus. In the middle of the course she said to come meet her and her brother and we will discuss our future like marriage. She said it was really urgent. I reluctantly agreed,  then i had to leave the course in the middle and travel and went to meet her and her brother.
We went to a restrobar and her brother offered me drinks and i accepted it. Her brother drank 2X times as me and was  driving intoxicated.  Next day she texted me that she wants to breakup as i shouldn't have accepted  the drinks from her brother and i have no etiquette. She refused to meet me.

I asked for a proper closure the next day after i returned home. She said she was looking for stability and i was looking for love. She said i am emotionally weak. She wanted someone with abstract thinking and i am technical minded. She wanted someone to understand her without even her saying anything. The she said she was 95% sure to reject me but still called to me her and her brother and after i accepted the drink the remaining 5% was gone.


Its been a month. Now i know there were lots of red flags and these were not okay in any relationship. 

Was she a narcissist? I am just trying to understand how can  some girls be this cruel and selfish.

Once she said that  she was moody, rigid, stubborn and acts on her emotions which was dangerous

ANSWER: She wasn't narcissistic, she was just a very difficult person. Karma won't get her. Karma doesn't mean what you think it means.


I found that exes generally never got what's coming to them. The best way is to just live your life move on and don't worry about her or her getting what's coming to her.Because she probably won't.


Next relationship reflect upon why you tolerated such a difficult person and do better next time.

QUESTION: I tried to work it out with Babymomma and now I think different.m22 f22

 Recently was about to send a text to her replying to her message she sent me saying I gave up from the beginning. I never sent it instead left it alone. Here
 (And I don’t think I’m going to to continue… I’ve learned a lot of valuable lessons and a lot about myself. I’ve ran from the beginning because  I was in denial that this was it. I’ve cared for you but I’m just too young and too dumb to know what real love is. Mabey this is the way real love feels? I would never know without having more experience. And for you to wait on me.. I’ll hatch when I’m ready. I don’t want you to miss out on the opportunity of being “his one of eight million” when I know I don’t feel that way about you. )

 Context  BM (f22) me (m22) have two kids together and is renting my mom house. (F3)(m1) we have been together for almost six years now. 

 We have separated twice  and got back together. We have had  ups and downs and it’s not necessary that bad just little things here and there. 

    Since we really started dating I felt like I have not connected fully with her almost like our souls don’t align. Unfortunately the baby making was made before I realized my feelings for her. But I kept with her because I thought I would gain more affection and desire for her  but nothing has changed yet.

  I guess what I’m looking for is has anyone else has something like this happen to them? And so how’d you deal with it?

I’m 18M and there’s a girl in my class (18F) I’d like to get to know. We’ve never talked even though we share classes. I used to have low self-esteem because of my appearance, and even if I look better now, I still overthink everything.
My problem: I want to start a normal conversation with her, but I don’t know how to do it without making it awkward. She’s usually either alone before class or talking with classmates, and there’s no natural reason for us to interact.
My question is: What’s a simple, natural way to start talking to someone in your class when you’ve never spoken before and you want to make sure they are not dating someone else ?

QUESTION: I [F20] looked through my boyfriends [M21] instagram link history and don’t know what to do

Okay I know I fucked up going through his phone that was definitely wrong of me but I had a very bad gut feeling the other night and while he was asleep I went through his phone. I looked at his instagram link history which can show what links they have been clicking on the app including vsco links that most girls put in their bios. What I found was TONS of girls vsco links, some of which are my friends and worst of all his ex girlfriends vsco link MULTIPLE times. His ex girlfriends vsco link was there the most and so was another girls who he snaps and talks to a lot. Some of these girls were younger too and I just feel so sick to my stomach. I’m also like fourth on his best friends list on Snapchat and girls who’s vsco he had looked at are above me on his best friends list. It also shows the days he has done this and it has spanned from October 28th to November 14th so this is extremely recent and I think he has deleted some before in the past or there is just so many that it’s not showing any older ones. I don’t even know how to approach this situation I feel like an imposter trying to act normal around him knowing what I know. I have been doubtful about this relationship before and have been feeling as if this isn’t where I want to be anymore but I feel like this is the nail in the coffin. It just sucks because we have an apartment together and our lease is up in April and I have no idea what I’m going to do. I’m sorry for the rant I just am at a loss for words and I don’t know how to feel anymore. Is this cheating or is this just extremely disrespectful and gross?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Me 29F married to 29M for 11 years. Trying to rebuild with an intentional separation but mixed signals. Need perspective.

I (29F) and my husband (29M) have been together for 11 years. We have a 1-year-old son. We are in an intentional separation and I need outside perspective on whether this is repairable.

We met as teenagers and grew up together. He is my best friend and the person I have shared almost every life stage with (adulthood, job transitions, infertility, IVF, we became parents last year). We always had a deep emotional bond, he’s seriously my best friend) but communication has been a long term struggle on both sides. My pattern has been anxious, reactive, intense communication, especially when I feel disconnected. His pattern has been shutting down, withdrawing, or avoiding conflict when he is overwhelmed. This has been going on for years, not only postpartum. Our patterns fed each other and created a cycle that neither of us broke early enough to be totally honest 

I also set a poor tone in the relationship during stressful periods. I could be harsh, frustrated, or critical in moments. I take responsibility for that. At the same time, I have a habit of over owning our conflicts, at least right now. I do not want this to sound like everything was my fault. He had his own part in how we got here, including a long history of emotional avoidance.

We also struggled sexually. Our sex life has been poor for a while, with mismatched desire and emotional disconnect.

A few months ago, I found messages between him and another woman from one of his office’s partners (he works with her but they’ve never met in person due to distance/her being overseas). It was emotional and slightly sexual. It crossed clear boundaries and deeply hurt me. After I confronted him, he said he felt resentment, burnout, and emotional exhaustion. He said he needed space to breathe and reset, that he has been unhappy for awhile. He moved into an Airbnb but said he did not want divorce. His goal was to rebuild slowly, not commit to any permanent plans. After many talks, We agreed on a three month separation with a plan to reconnect at a steady pace.

It’s been about a month and half, and now We see each other a couple of times a week. In person, things feel warm and familiar. We get along easily, we laugh, and there is emotional and physical chemistry. We have slept together a few times. He initiates small gestures and does not feel cold when we are together, planning dates and intentional moments of spending time together as a family but also as a couple. 

But outside of in-person moments, things are unclear.

• He does not want to sleep over because he says he is not ready
• He texts slowly or minimally, which triggers me (after 2 weeks of streams of messages to that woman)
• He says he does not know what he wants, that he wants to save our marriage and commit to trying but he doesn’t know how we can do that
• He says he does not want divorce but also does not feel ready to return right now
• He still has resentment
• He is not engaging in deep inner work (at least to me) 
• He seems relieved to have time alone
• He continues extending the Airbnb each month

I have been doing a lot of inner work to stay regulated, patient, and open. I am trying to break my old patterns. But this situation feels unbalanced. I am the one thinking about the relationship daily, while he takes a slower, passive approach. Tbh, I feel lonely, confused, and scared. I miss the stability of partnership. I miss having him as my person. I want clarity, but I do not want to pressure him. I love him and want to rebuild, but I also do not know if I am holding on because I am afraid to let go.

What I need perspective on:
• Is this amount of distance normal during an intentional separation?
• Does this sound like someone who is slowly working their way back?
• Or someone who is staying half in and half out
• Is it fair to want more commitment or clarity?
• Am I reacting from anxious attachment?
• How long is it healthy to stay in this in between stage?

Any neutral outside perspectives would help me understand what is realistic and what might be wishful thinking.

ANSWER: I think you either need to divorce or do couple counseling. He’s trying to have his cake and eat it too but you also need to be kinder to yourself and put your foot down and demand that you mutually work on your issues or cut your losses. It sucks. But also how can you expect to repair a relationship when neither of you are acting like you are.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (19M) move on from someone(18F) who emotionally destroyed me? I can’t work, can’t focus, and I’m falling apart.

Throwaway for privacy. I’m not trying to expose anyone. I just need advice because I genuinely can’t function anymore.

I want to start with a bit about myself, because context matters.  
I didn’t have a childhood I would ever go back to. My parents used to fight constantly. We were broke. My father used to be well-off when he was younger, but we lost everything and ended up in a bad financial situation. I still went to a good school only because of their old contacts, and I had to lie constantly just to fit in.

Between 2016 and 2019, someone from my family died every single year. Grandparents, close relatives… and then finally in 2019, I lost my dad. After that, financially we fell apart even more. COVID was one of the worst periods of my life. Before this girl, I had feelings for another girl who also hurt me deeply. I think the truth is I just want to be loved. That’s all I’ve ever wanted.

Now to the relationship.  
It was an online relationship, but it felt real. We called every day, talked constantly, shared everything, and yes, we exchanged nudes. We officially got together on April 30, 2024. I was all in. She felt like the only light I had during one of the darkest phases of my life.

But every month something happened that broke me a little more.

In May and June she had exams. Then on June 22, she sent me her nudes. I thought it meant something, but on that same day she told me that if I didn’t convert to her religion, she’d marry another guy, have his kids, and later leave him and come back to me. I cried like I’ve never cried before. But I stayed.

She’s Muslim. I’m from a religion her family would never accept. I won’t mention which, because it’s not relevant. All that matters is that she wasn’t supposed to date someone like me in her culture.

In July and August she went to a MUN event, took guys’ Instagrams, talked to them, and shook hands with one of them after promising me I’d be the first person to physically touch her. That promise meant everything to me, and she broke it casually. People might say I was insecure for being upset, and maybe they’re right, but she was the one who swore she wouldn’t do these things. She promised out of her own mouth. I didn’t force anything on her.

Around the same time she joined an NGO as a co-founder. I supported her completely. I didn’t complain, I didn’t fight her about it. In fact, we barely talked during that time because she was so busy with the NGO, and I missed her so much that I even joined the NGO myself just so we could spend more time together. I tried to be supportive. I didn’t say anything even when she talked to literally hundreds of people for new admissions and projects. I wasn’t controlling. I wasn’t stopping her from anything. I was a supportive guy until everything she did slowly destroyed my trust and made me so insecure that even today I’m scared this insecurity will never go away.

But eventually I found out she was getting very close to the two male founders and another guy in the NGO(spending hours on call and talking alot). She did tell me everything & I saw screenshots. She told me they were just friends, but later I found out all three had feelings for her. She blocked them when I asked, but by then my trust was already falling apart.

In September she went to another MUN and told me she didn’t talk to any guys. But then I saw a story from the event’s page where she was sitting on the back row bench, pointing at a guy in the row in front of her and clearly talking to him. here i did some self harm, which again i learnt from her. people might say it’s normal, but she had promised me she wouldn’t do that. Why promise something if you're going to break it?

In October and November she slipped up and mentioned kissing her cousin when she was younger. I had asked her this before and she always denied it until that day. She also told me she had sent nudes to a random guy in 2021 just because she was horny. Now, She told me i'm the first guy to ever see her nudes and how i'll be her first kiss. Every time I tried to rebuild trust, something else broke it.

December and January were full of lies too. She told me she was out getting groceries, but she had actually gone out to try a drug her sisters recommended. She went to another MUN and stayed out late with her cousins driving recklessly. We fought a lot. I ended up saying things I’m ashamed of because I was so hurt and frustrated. We were gonna breakup then too and i was not as attached but she cried and said can we please work this out and  that broke me so i instantly calmed her down and gave her another chance,But through everything, whenever she wanted anything digital (since she couldn’t receive physical gifts), I bought it. If she even looked at something or mentioned it once, I got it for her. I spent the last money I had trying to make her happy.

From February to May I found out she was secretly using Reddit to talk to guys for relationship advice and study help. She even messaged a guy for an exam paper instead of asking me, even though I had told her she could come to me for anything. now again just say u won't do it or u can't do this, why lie to me and do this behind my back it really hurts alot

Then in June she told me the worst thing of all. She said she never actually loved me, that she only dated me to prove to her ex and her friends that she had moved on. She said she had planned to cheat later on and the only reason she didn’t was because she had sent me her nudes and felt guilty. and how she started loving me or so i thought..

That destroyed me.

About the breakup, I want to be honest. On the day we broke up, she had a fight with her family. I don’t know what happened there, but right after that she suddenly said she wanted to break up with me too. She started saying hurtful things on purpose( mentioning guys and  how she had lied about not talking to guys when she went to the MUN in December,things she knew would hurt me) I was crying and begging her not to leave. I was emotionally overwhelmed.

all of this really upset me and i said nah now it's over, you just watch, i said this back and forth while i really was just crying my eyes out thinking on what to do next and then she said, “What, are you gonna send my nudes to my dad?”  
I had never said anything like that before she said it. She said it first. And in that moment, while I was breaking down, I said yeah i will that I regret deeply. I wasn’t actually going to do anything. I didn’t mean it. I was hurt, scared, and losing control. when i said that she just started begging me to not do it and how she will stay and how she's sorry, that day, after that moment it was as tho she lost everything she had for me cus

She said she could never forgive me after that. We talked on and off until around October, where she blocked me multiple times, unblocking, fighting, coming back again. It was a trauma bond. The last proper conversation we had was around October 18. where we were calm and she said she's not gonna come back for a while and left

Now I’m here.  
I can’t move on.  
I can’t focus on work.  
I have goals, responsibilities, a mother to support, loans to pay, and yet I feel mentally frozen. I sit down to work and my mind just stops. All I can think about is how me and her are done, how I’ll never be with her again, how all the plans and dreams we had are gone.

It hurts knowing she’ll live the life we talked about, but with someone else.  
Someone else will see her smile.  
Someone else will look into her pretty eyes.  
Someone else will get a version of her that I wanted so badly.

I miss her every day.  
Honestly, almost every hour.  
My brain refuses to let her go

i don't know what to do anymore  
I don’t know how to let go of the dreams I had with her.  
I don’t know how to rebuild myself after everything that happened.

I really need advice on how to move on from this, because I feel stuck in pain I don’t know how to escape. she left me like it was nothing, wish i was that heartless

ANSWER: So here's the thing coming out of an abusive relationship, it takes TIME. Lots of time. This is still RAW for you and that's understandable. Look into therapy to help process all of the emotions and know that TIME is going to be the biggest thing.

================================================================================

QUESTION: [25F] Nervous about going on a proper date with a guy [26M] after two years of talking

Next week I’m finally going on a proper date after two years of talking to this guy. Our connection has been on and off, not because of him but because of me. At first I didn’t feel a spark and ended things, but we kept talking here and there. I still don’t feel a huge amount of chemistry, but I want to give him a real chance.

I wrote him off after our first meeting without really getting to know him, but he’s been persistent, genuinely serious, and overall a really nice person, so I want to see where this goes.

When we first met, I didn’t give him a hug. I had recently experienced abuse and wasn’t comfortable with physical contact, though I didn’t tell him that at the time. He was fine with it, and honestly, because of our cultural background, minimal physical contact is normal. The most I’d ever do was give him a quick fist bump to say hi and bye, and he never questioned it. He just matched my pace without pushing anything. Over the past two years we’ve met for casual coffees, but nothing more.

I’ve been on plenty of dates since, but this specific date is making me really nervous. We’re dressing up fancy, heels and everything, and I’m worried about how I’ll react if he tries to kiss me.

Has anyone been in a situation like this? How do you navigate it without feeling pressured?

Length of relationship: Two years of talking on and off

TL;DR:
Going on a proper date with a guy I’ve been talking to for two years. Minimal physical contact because of past abuse and cultural norms. Nervous about how to handle a potential kiss.

ANSWER: >Next week I’m finally going on a proper date after two years of talking to this guy.

This is already off to a bad start. So much investment, for something that should have been figured out by a 15 minute coffee date. It puts a lot pressure on something that you could realize in 10 seconds is not for you.

>At first I didn’t feel a spark and ended things, but we kept talking here and there. I still don’t feel a huge amount of chemistry, but I want to give him a real chance.

You shouldn't date people you aren't interested in. It is not fair to them, or yourself. I mean, you gave him a chance already, and you didn't feel it. How are you going to treat him going forward? Now imagine months, years from now, when a relationship really gets hard. You barely liked him to begin with. What are the chances it will work out?

>I’ve been on plenty of dates since, but this specific date is making me really nervous. We’re dressing up fancy, heels and everything, and I’m worried about how I’ll react if he tries to kiss me.

Because you don't actually like him?

>Has anyone been in a situation like this? How do you navigate it without feeling pressured?

You can't You are doing it to yourself. You shouldn't be pressured to go on a date. You should be feeling nervous and excited. Including feeling something sexually/physically! And I don't mean you need to have sex. I mean, you should be naturally attracted to the other person. That's part of why you decide and accept to go on a date!

If you just want a friend, make it very clear. But, really, you should probably leave this guy alone. You are giving him false hope. He could have spent his energy on someone else, who is actually interested in him. You are not doing him any favors by doing this. You are only prolonging the disappointment and wasting his time.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I reach out to my (f24) ex's friend (M25)?

I broke up with my ex earlier this year as we were incompatible. We are still friendly with each other, as the breakup was mutual.

The thing is, there was a period where we had broken up previously for a period of time and I've gone on the dating app and talked with a friend of his (let's say Jake m25) - at the time I didn't know they were friends. I really enjoyed my chats with Jake, and we had a lot of things in common. 

However, I eventually found out from my ex that Jake was my ex's friend, and he was moving to another state the following week. So I never really had the chance to see how things would have gone.

Eventually, I got back together with my ex to see if we could work things out, but it didn't work. 

So now, here I am, finding out Jake is permanently back in town. I kept thinnking about back then and want to see if we could start something again, but how do I do it?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I 28F feel taken for granted by boyfriend 25M and idk how to deal with it

My boyfriend (25M) and i (28F) have been dating for over three years now. Lately we both have been going through stuff, for me i lost someone close to me and he has an important deadline at the end of this month. Because of his schedule we haven’t been hanging out much. The issue is he cancelled a few dates, doesn’t have time to hangout with me, doesn’t have time to call and yet he finds the time to go to bars with co-workers and friends, rave, have discussions with his female roommate till 3 am etc .. A while ago i mentioned that it feels like he treats me differently from the rest of his friends (negatively as in he gets embarrassed if I’m clumsy, micro-manages me, completely ignores me in group hangouts etc) he said he doesn’t feel excited to hangout with me and that it’s something he needs to work on and maybe go to therapy for, fast forward to recently i expressed feeling hurt he always puts me last, (he is always late, he doesn’t want to partake in activities with me that he immediately the day after does with others, our time is always the time that gets sacrificed etc)  and he said that he just needs to find balance. He also has a past history of developing interest in other girls and i suspect based on his behavior that he is having similar tendencies lately at best and emotionally cheating at worst. I don’t want to be a jealous girlfriend or insecure. I don’t want to beg someone for their attention. I don’t think he realizes that I am not forcing him to be with me nor is he obligated to spend time with me if he doesn’t want to. I can’t break up rn because i don’t want to be an asshole (since he has the deadline and i don’t want to add more stress for him) but i genuinely don’t know what to do. I mostly struggle with feeling hurt, angry, disappointed, disrespected and frankly disillusioned with the whole idea of love. Any advice on how to manage these emotions is highly appreciated. Currently i’m trying to focus on myself and who am I outside of the relationship. I have also stopped asking for his time and have given him all the space yet try to be supportive for his big deadline. But dealing with my emotions is getting more difficult every day how does one go about dealing with emotions without harboring resentment 
?? I am being taken for granted?? Am i unreasonable and too needy? Is this how all relationships are?

ANSWER: The resentment is inevitable. Yes, you are being taken for granted. No, you are not unreasonable or too needy. You can breakup with him at any time, and you should. Fuck his deadline. You’ll be better off without him.

QUESTION: need help, 23F/21M

Hey everyone, I need some honest advice.  
I’m 20M and my girlfriend is 23F. We’ve been dating for about a year.

I’m in love with her, she’s also my first love, we connect deeply, talk for hours, and I’ve never felt this way about anyone.

The problem is a mismatch in timing and life plans. She’s 23 and wants to marry young and start a family soon. I’m 20, still in college, and still figuring myself out. By the time I’m even ready to consider marriage, her life plans will likely be so far ahead like waiting for her second child far.

We’ve talked about the future and she’s been very honest about what she wants, but she hasn’t hinted that she’d wait for me or adjust her plans for me,

I feel like even if we keep dating, this timing mismatch will eventually separate us. I love her deeply, but staying together now feels like it splits my energy and slows down my path, because she is also kinda self centered which i don't mind but can sometimes drain my energy which i don't need, especially since I’m graduating next year and then I have a mandatory military year which doesn't help my case

I’m thinking of giving it a month to see if a realistic plan could work, but I’m scared that’s just false hope.

My questions:

1. Is it worth trying to find a compromise for this timing mismatch?
2. How do I balance loving her with the reality of our life plans if we keep seeing each other?
3. Does it make sense to end things now to prevent a bigger heartbreak later and focus on myself more, even though I love her?

================================================================================

QUESTION: How to break up with my [M24] girlfriend [F24]?

TL;DR: I've lost feelings for my girlfriend of 1.5 years and know I need to break up, but the timing is difficult. She's studying abroad, still happy in the relationship, and would be blindsided by a breakup. We work together in close proximity, which complicates things. I'm torn between breaking up during my upcoming visit (giving her freedom to explore abroad but leaving her alone with the pain) versus waiting until she returns home (prolonging an unfulfilling relationship but giving her support system access). I'm seeking advice on timing and approach.  
  
My girlfriend and I have been together for about 1.5 years and I am at a point where I know that I need to break up with her.  
There is nothing either of us did wrong, just the fact that I lost my feelings at some point and noticed, that this is unfortunately not the woman of my life for me.

The time we spent together felt and feels more like a chore at this point and not things I look forward to.  
She is currently studying abroad for a semester (we are both part time sudents) and I feel more pleased and happy with life than before she left.

That's the reason why just holding up this relationship any longer will just risk becoming toxic and won't be a valueable and uplifting relationship anymore.

However there are a couple of reasons which make it hard to break up for me at this moment:

 She is still quite in love with me and happy at the moment with our relationship. I still value her incredibly lot as a person and it pains to think about causing her an immense amount of pain.
    We have not communicated at all in this regard, and a direct breakup would be something completely out of the blue.
 She is my first girlfriend and we kind of slippered into this relationship, as she is a coworker of mine and we met at work. We didn't tell at work that we are dating, but many definitely know that something is going on. We work on the same floor at the same open office, so on days where we work we have at max a distance of like 10 meters.
 We have planned to spent Christmas together at her place where she is studying abroad right now. At least another friend of hers will also be celebrating Christmas with us, so she wouldn't be completely alone.

I will soon be visiting her (prior to Christmas) and am unsure if I should hold on with telling her the truth until her semester ends and she returns, or if I should do it now already.  
If I would do it now already I feel like she could already go ahead and explore herself and meet new people and enjoy her life while studying abroad, however on the other hand she would basically be alone with her grief, which also seems very unfair, as she doesn't have her friends or family close to her at this point in time.

Has anybody been in a similar situation? Any advice on how to go forward in such a situation?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (25M) feel like my GF (20F) is becoming distant after 1 year together.

TL;DR: First relationship, I have trust issues. Early boundaries I tried to communicate (past FWBs, a guy who sent her an explicit pic, etc.) were dismissed stopped bringing things up because my feelings felt ignored. Now she's becoming distant but says everything is "fine." Not sure if it's my anxiety or if something is actually wrong.

I"ve (25M) been dating my girlfriend (20F) for about a year and half now. It's my first real relationship, and I know I still have a lot to learn. I'll admit upfront that l've always had trust issues and low self-esteem. Early on, I was constantly worriec she'd replace me with someone "better." 

I also believed that if something bothered me in the relationship, the healthiest thing to do was to talk about it openly. 

in the beginning, a few things really messed with my head like her stil following/liking posts from past FWB situations. There was also a guy who hac previously sent her an unsolicited explicit picture, and he messaged her again in the middle of the night. I told her I'd feel more comfortable if she unfollowed him She said she wouldn't because she didn't want people judging her for "dropping friends"now that she's in a relationship.

I tried to talk through these things, but every time we had a disagreement it felt like my feelings didn't matter. Eventually, I stopped bringing things up altogethe because it always led nowhere. Maybe it's in my head, maybe it's real but that's how it felt.

Now, I feel like she's growing distant. She takes longer to reply, doesn't send me reels or videos anymore, and overall feels less engaged. But when I ask i everything's okay, she insists everything is fine and that she still loves me. 

I still have a bit of hope, but honestly, I'm starting to feel like I've given up. I don't <now if this is just my anxiety talking or if the relationship is actually fading

How can I set healthy boundaries without feeling like I'm being unreasonable or ignored?

ANSWER: The best way to get a sense of where you're at is to stop asking her if she is fine and start telling her you are not. Name the behaviors.

"I can see you're taking longer to reply, you don't send reels or videos, and I can see that you're not as engaged. I need you to start connecting with me more by doing those things again, and to make an effort to engage emotionally with me more. I love you and I want this to work - can you do those things for me?"

Her reaction to that will tell you everything you need to know. If she apologizes and makes an effort on the things you asked for? Then you're in great shape.

If she does anything else - either insisting it's all in your mind, downplaying it, acknowledging it but not changing - then she's detaching and things are probably ending.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Me(21M) newbie to relationship ..with an experienced (21F) opinion on my situation?

So starting off with an introduction me 21m not so good looking (chubby with hair loss) with no relationship experience (she being my first) and she is 21f looks like an angel with an hour glass body with a lot of prior relationship experience (5 to 6) and we both are medicos currently in 3rd yr . We met in the first year and things were a bit difficult back then(will tell everything if this post gets enough recognition) . So currently it's almost 2 years to our relationship.. well not completely ,to be precise we got together then broke up in 3 months and then re entered after a 2.5 month break and now it's almost a year and half happily together. So as I was saying I'm new to this but I was raised in a family with an abusive father and innocent mom so learnt how to not treat a women at a very early age and learnt to respect them. This helped me win her heart and we got into a relationship then there are many things to discuss but currently keeping things short ...we are in a very happy relationship explaining further she just loves me too much like she can't live without me we stay together the whole day in college still miss each other as soon as we get back home( we are day scholars) and stay on call while studying and till we feel sleepy . Im saying these so that u people don't suspect on her just using me for now she truly does love me. So coming to the main discussion.. she has beem seually active since 18 not including any of her previous boyfriends and I was a virgin untill I met her.(I was the first boyfriend she had sx with) . She says she had a very high libido(sx drive) and was addicted to sex usually after her  previous breakups. She used to be very confident of herself and didn't care about anyone basically being higly self centred and selfish. Currently she is very happy with me (as I'm good in bed too). She has gained over 10 kgs in the past 1year( sign of a healthy and happy relationship ig) but sometimes she says she misses her older self like how care free, independent and confident she was and could get anyone she wanted ,but now she thinks she has become fat (still has an incredibly hot hour glass figure) and insecure and dependent on me for everything (as I treat her like a princess).she likes exhibitionism and used to post nsfw content on reddit.. that's why we as a couple  have a reddit account where we post some nsfw stuff, at first I didn't like it but slowly developed a liking to it. Now she says that she wanna be shared she has kinks(eg- gngbng that she wanna fulfill and wants me to support her in doing so(she has had previous threesme experience). She also pursues me to talk to other girls and have some intimacy with other girls as I haven't had any experience with any other girl. Avery important point here is that the other girls she wants me to talk to should not be someone she knows or from our close proximity.. like she wants me to talk to a total stranger so that it's just a one night stand but nothing personal. She is extremely possessive of me she can't bear the sight of me talking nicely or helping any of our colleagues (we have had multiple fights because of this). I told her that yeah we may try those things in future once we get comfortable sharing each other we need to keep it very slow so that we both have time to adapt to it.. recently she said she likes when some muscular guys text her on Instagram( she gets a lottttt of dms) but she doesn't entertain them and tells them that she is committed .
 I don't check her phone she tells me on her own that this person texted me I said this and that or rejected them etc etc and i just keep smiling thinking how lucky iam to have such a loyal gf (I don't talk to a single girl on any platform so I am loyal)
So what are your thoughts on my situation is she the kne(seems like it) or is there anything you people have experienced with such people and let me knw if u guys are interested in learning about the initial phase of our relationship and how she became a loyal and loving gf from a selfish self center btch.

QUESTION: Relationship advice ‘25M’ and 25F

Hey everyone,
I (mid-20s M) have been dating my girlfriend (mid-20s F) for a year now, and we were best friends for about two years before that. We’re both working so our schedules are extremely hectic. I understand that life is stressful for both of us, but lately I can’t shake the feeling that she just doesn’t care as much anymore.
Over time it feels like her effort has dropped. A recent example that hit me hard was our anniversary night. We’re in the same city and even though it wasn’t a huge milestone, I thought she’d at least want to meet for a few minutes at midnight. Instead, she said she was too tired. She lives with her parents so I know that creates restrictions, but it still hurt more than I expected.
Our physical intimacy has also become almost non-existent, maybe three times a month, sometimes less. And I’m always the one initiating. She never starts anything herself and whenever I try to bring it up gently, nothing really changes.
Communication isn’t great either. On days we don’t meet, she rarely calls. Most of the time she says she’ll call if I ask, but then she just falls asleep. I trust she’s not cheating or hiding anything, and when we are together in person things feel amazing. It’s the space in-between that feels painfully empty.
Another thing that’s starting to weigh on me is her short temper. Anytime I try to talk about something that’s bothering me, it somehow backfires and I end up apologising just to calm things down. I’m starting to keep things to myself because I don’t want another argument or emotional blow-up. It feels suffocating.
Lately, days go by without a proper conversation or even a quick FaceTime. It genuinely feels like I’m the one putting in all the effort, initiating the calls, planning the meets, trying to fix things, keeping the peace. And honestly, it’s draining me.
So now I’m stuck wondering if I’m overthinking all of this because of stress or if I’m justified in feeling like I’m asking for the bare minimum. I love her, but feeling like the only one trying is slowly killing me.
Would really appreciate some outside perspective or advice.?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [M25] feel emotionally burned out from my relationship with my girlfriend [F25] but I feel like I can't leave her?

TLDR; Over time, the behavior of my girlfriend of 5 years made me feel emotionally completely drained. But I feel way too responsible for her well-being to leave her, due to her chronic disease/disability and her current situation that makes her very socially anxious. Now I met a wonderful woman, that I want to meet again. I don't know, how I can make everyone happy.



Hi all,

I am in a very unfortunate situation in my relationship and I don't know how I can make everyone happy, including me. Or at least, how I can make sure that this is not turning into a shit show.

So, currently my girlfriend \[F25\], lets call her A, is studying in a foreign country for a few years. She left in September and will be back in March. Shortly after she left, I started living completely on my own and I noticed, that I didn't miss her. And that I can not imagine moving together with her.

I started understanding some things I have been feeling for months already, and now I cannot see a future with her anymore. Some things that are really draining me emotionally are the following:

\- I feel completely invisible in this relationship. Whenever we see each other, she just talks for 2 hours, emotionally unloads every little thing on me, and doesn't let me even answer. When I try to get a word in, she is silent for a few seconds to let me speak, and then completely ignores what I said. She doesn't give me a chance to even talk about what stresses me or weighs me down. And afterward she is either too tired and goes to sleep or is completely distracted by her phone. I only feel like I am of interest, when she is feeling lonely

\- She commented on my body way too often, I started feeling incredibly insecure and do feel uncomfortable changing around her. She often said I should suck in my stomach/belly more. I am quite athletic, I normally wouldn't care, but over time it got under my skin

\- I think of myself as a very romantic person and made it clear that I want to marry someday, without specifying when. This prompted her to repeatedly emphasize that I shouldn't propose to her, which hurt me quite a bit

\- We haven't had sex for a few years due to her chronic disease. Her doctors gave her a prescription and explained to her what to do, to (hopefully) overcome the problem (with sex, not the chronic disease). I supported her for years and never considered this a reason to leave her. But at some point, it became clear to me, that she isn't even following the directions of her doctors. This makes me feel awful, like she doesn't even want to be intimate with me

\- Repeatedly saying how I need her way more than she needs me. After telling her about something emotional, she made fun of me for it a few months later. And some other things come on top. I don't want to go into the details too much.

I always talked myself into believing that this is all my fault, that I am having the wrong feelings, and that she doesn't mean it that way. Now, after living alone for a few weeks and being way more happy, I realized that maybe this relationship is beyond fixing.

However, I am afraid of ending things, because I know she needs me right now. Living abroad amplified her anxiety. In her first days abroad, we regularly called, and she always cried or was on the brink of crying. I don't want to leave her while she is so vulnerable and doesn't feel good. I also don't know when to breakup. She will come to me to live with me over Christmas, which is also a problem because the flights are already booked.

Today, I met another woman (lets call her E) for coffee. It was clearly planned as a date, and we hit it off immediately, talked for hours. I never expected this to happen, and never told her that I am in a relationship. I know that it was wrong to go on a "date" while already being in a relationship, but I just expected to have a nice chat over some coffee and get to know an interesting person.

I really want to meet her again. But if I tell her about the relationship, that will probably and bad. If I don't, it will also end bad. When and how do I break up with my girlfriend? Or is this relationship not lost after all?

I don't think she is a bad person. She is (or was) always very caring and putting effort into this relationship. She has to wrestle her own insecurities, too.

ANSWER: You seem like you’ve thought this out a lot. 

I do not think you should’ve gone on the date, that is dishonest to both A and E. You should tell E the truth. 

Whether you should tell A about the date is a different story, I think for her sake (with her anxiety etc) maybe it’s best you just break up. 

Tell her how you feel, without placing blame on her. Just that your feelings are faded and you need time to grow alone. 

Good luck!

================================================================================

QUESTION: Having a lot of downhills already at the beginning. Am I being stupid to wanting to commit? me (F30) and him (M32)

I've been together with a guy for 6 months and it's been a rollercoaster. We always end up discussing stuff, reflecting on conflicts, and defining stuff we should change in our communication, but I feel we just get weaker and weaker. 

He is a very rational person, and a self cleamed (I think he is right) avoidant, and I am an autistic person with anxious traits. So we have the recipe for a not so easy relationship. 

We have been in a loop of
- me communicating of me feeling hurt (sometimes for valid reasons, sometimes for stupid ones),
- he getting defensive, questioning the validity of my feelings (regardless of the stressor)
- me feeling lonely, wanting to leave
- he getting upset, wanting to leave

Lately we had some discussions where we both felt the other gets it finally. We agreed on some new communication patterns to follow (e.g. start with validating feelings, having space for rational talk, reassuring the other about not want to leave, setting boundaries, etc.). Normally we end these talks with feeling heard and getting back some motivation.

Yesterday we got in the same loop, and we both got upset. We have a habit of analysing texts with chatGPT to see where things could go wrong and it helped a lot. But yesterday he said to me, that he got very concerning results and he cannot put up with what he is expected to do:
If I communicate distress he should validate my feelings and not rationalize it at first. He said he only now faced the fact that I am a traumatized person and he will have to do this forever. 

It hurt me a lot, but I understand him. It's a lot to ask. I told him multiple times I don't expect him to solve my issues, I want to work on not getting overwhelmed by my triggers, but to get stronger I need a solid ground, either in a stabil relationship or alone. 

He asked for a break for two weeks. I told him I don't think two weeks will solve much, and I don't feel strong enough to wait two weeks I rather break up, move on and let's check in when adequate time has passed. Then we ended up not breaking up, agreeing if I communicate about my bad feelings I should start with reassuring him I don't blame him and I know he doesn't mean any harm. 

I know we sound toxic as hell. I also know our story is quite typical. I just want to ask you Reddit for some stories so I can see how a pattern like this ended for others. 

When it's not a conflict, otherwise we get along well. I feel I really want to be with him and we both love each other. He has some bad traits, from not caring about his health to having anger issues. Otherwise he is a very good friend for others, quite reliable and in general we have matching interests and we value similar things in life. 

So you know, he is a normal person.

ANSWER: >Am I being stupid to wanting to commit?

Yes 

He minimizes your feelings and "has to do this forever"

================================================================================

QUESTION: Healthy compromise or disaster awaiting Me (22F) and my boyfriend (24M) ?

Me (22F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been in a long-distance relationship for a while now. Everything between us has been great emotionally we communicate well, trust each other, and genuinely see a long-term future together.

The only major challenge has been the physical part. We’re both young, have normal needs, and realistically can’t meet each other often because of distance and work/study commitments.

After many honest conversations (no fighting, no cheating, no secrecy), we mutually agreed on something unconventional:  
👉 We allow each other a fixed number of sexual partners per year,  
👉 We will be completely open about it,  
👉 No emotional involvement,  
👉 No repeats unless discussed,  
👉 And we go back to being fully monogamous once he moves back.

We haven’t started this yet  we’re still finalizing boundaries, communication expectations, and how to make sure neither of us gets hurt. But emotionally, we’re both on the same page that physical needs don’t have to destroy an otherwise strong and loving relationship.

ANSWER: Personally, i don't see this working out.

But if that's what you both want to do, you do you.

QUESTION: 21M/21F How to sink back into a relationship after a break?

A few months ago my gf, F21, told me randomly after a nice night out that her plans that night were to break up with me. I won’t get into the reasoning but that’s what she said. She ended up realizing she wanted to keep working at it and so did I, so we agreed that maybe a break is the best option. We went no contact for 10 days. We are back together and have been good since with some fights here and there but overall going well. My problem is now I have my guard up all the time. I can’t sink back into the relationship because I’m afraid that I might get hurt again, knowing that she came to that conclusion once that it may happen again. I’ve spoken to her about it and she reassured me that everything is going well in her eyes. I’m starting to develop trust issues I didn’t have before though. I always think about the words, “Actually my plan tonight was to break up with you.” Any advice is appreciated.

ANSWER: You're back together for 10 days after a break and already had "some fights here and there" and you think this relationship is going well?

Spoiler alert: It's not.

QUESTION: (33F) Partner and I are about to do long distance, any recommendations for keeping 'connected' during this? (M35)

My husband and I are about to be doing long distance (I in the US and him in Korea) for a good 6 months. The catch, is the time zone difference. I've always worried about long distance, as it's something that I feel I'd be getting too anxious about. It's not a matter of trust, as there's 100% trust and there's no concern there; it's just a weird feeling of losing our 'spark' and connection.

Anyways, I'm sure it's not that bad - but, any recommendations on how to stay connected? I know there's the couple apps, and of course daily facetimes...

ANSWER: Watch a TV show "together," and talk about it after each episode.
Laugh together. Flirt with one another and check in daily/nightly. Visit if at all possible. If not, ZOOM call one another every day or evening and chat.

QUESTION: I (30F) feel stuck on my ex (29M). Is getting back together a good or bad idea?

I am once again turning to the advice of internet strangers for my personal problems... but sometimes I feel like the exercise of posting a whole-ass novel about my woes on Reddit helps me sort through how I'm feeling about something. Thank you in advance for reading.

I (30F) was in a four year relationship with a wonderful, good-lucking, very funny individual (29M). He was the best friend I've ever had. Our relationship was very playful -- we are both very silly and would make each other laugh constantly. We lived together for two out of those four years, and would often have nights where we'd fall asleep holding hands, or have trouble going to bed because we'd be giggling about something nonsensical. The sexual chemistry was also incredible and I remain extremely attracted to him. We talked about the idea of marriage & kids, and had loosely discussed getting engaged in a year or so.

At the same time, we were not always the most stable together. We broke up three other times throughout the course of four years (he would say we "took pauses," but I think of these as break-ups). We were excellent together in periods of stability, but would often have the same fight over and over under stress. I am a somewhat anxious-attached person, and he would often rebuke my need for affirmation in stressful situations. I'd try to pull him closer, he'd push me away, that would make me more anxious, that would push him further away, etc etc. It would take some time to resolve, we'd both calm down, things would be good again.

NOTE: We got much better at resolving this type of conflict throughout the course of our relationship - but it definitely still existed throughout the duration.

We were having a particularly bad week about a year and a half ago. At the end of the bad week, I asked if we could sit down for drinks and try to talk it out. He ended up breaking up with me during this conversation.

At the time, I felt okay about this. It was of course devastating, but I was also like... "Ok! We've always been a little unstable! I'm 28 and single and it's time to go see what else is out there!"

A few months after our break-up, my ex started to try to get back together, and has continued to do so for a full year now. He deeply regretted breaking up. He felt like he needed to live alone (something he never had the chance to do) -- but now that he'd had that experience, and it wasn't want he wanted.

Throughout the last year, he also started going to therapy for the first time. He read books on attachment theory and started to understand my needs in our relationship. He apologized for all the times he'd pushed me away in the past.

But I haven't felt ready to take him back. I wanted to see what else was out there. I dated a lot in the last year and a half. I dated all the types of people I'd been so excited to try to find -- a stable lawyer, a wealthy CEO, an actor. I dated some women. I went out with all the people I'd been curious about during our relationship. I tried all the apps.

Nothing stuck. Whenever something started to progress, I would break it off. It just didn't feel right.

For the last year or so, we've been stuck in an excruciating cycle. We miss each other. We try to be friends. It's sweet and romantic. He tries to get back together. I push him away. We go no contact for a period of time (anywhere from a few weeks to six months). We miss each other. One of us breaks the ice (I've been guilty of this at least once or twice). The cycle starts again.

And now, I'm at a point where I just feel... defeated? Confused? Completely and totally lost? If he were to meet someone else and fall for them... I'd be devastated. I no longer know what I'm doing when I try to date new people. I'm 30 and I want to have kids and I'm terrified of wasting my time. I miss him. I love him so fucking much. But is just the same cycle of toxicity happening again? How much time is enough time to trust that our relationship can be different this time?

Thank you for reading & would love your thoughts.

TLDR: My ex wants to get back together and I don't know if it's a good idea to take him back.

EDIT: This post has been live for about fifteen minutes and almost every single question is whether I've also gone to therapy. Yes, I have. And I read the dang attachment theory books too. Also this is a question of getting back together after eighteen months of self-work and gut-checking and dating, not a few weeks. Just some things to keep in mind!

ANSWER: Taking back your ex is like trying to put poop back in your butthole.  Messy and toxic.   Don't do it.

QUESTION: 27F partner and I’m a 26M

So I have been with my partner for 6 months now and I constantly get made to feel not good enough, nothing I do is right, she flips everything to word it to make her seem like she does everything for me and I’m always at fault etc. I’ve responded to her in every argument respectfully and calmly but she just blows up and has digs at me sending multiple messages at a heightened level. Even when she does say some deep things I still react calmly. 

For example she wished me well the other day (meaning we were done) she said that was her decision. So I removed the posts of us on social media reason being that I didn’t want to keep seeing those photos, she then messaged me straight away saying you were quick to remove the posts of us.which means she must have been looking at my profile. 

Can anyone please give advice on this kind of behaviour and how to go about it? Everytime I try to leave touch she puts it on me that I’m so quick to leave but paints me out to be the worst person ever but has told me in the past that I’m the best person she’s every met so I can’t really win? 

Any advice or direction would be great? 
This is not the first time this kinda stuff has happened

ANSWER: Break up, block her, stop responding to her, move on. 4 easy steps to solve your problems.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 28M/28F Couples who work/study in the same domain, how do you deal with competition and jealousy?

We’re 28M/28F. I’m hoping to hear from couples who work or study in the same field, because my wife and I keep running into the same recurring issue and I’m starting to worry this will follow us through our entire lives unless we figure out a healthy way to handle it.

My wife and I have been together for almost 10 years. We met during our bachelor’s degree, both in the same field. Even back then, there was an odd sort of internal competition between us. For example, if I scored slightly higher on an exam, even in a class where she believed she worked harder than me, it would cause tension. She’d get upset and feel it was unfair. I’m sure I’ve felt competitive in my own ways, too.

After our bachelor’s, we joined the same company. And again, during our first performance appraisal, I received a slightly higher raise. That created weeks of stress between us.

But now we’re doing a master’s degree together and the same pattern is happening again: if one of us gets a better grade, there are arguments. She feels we should either have equal grades or that I should score lower than her, especially if she feels she worked harder. I understand where the feeling comes from, we’re in similar fields, we understand each other’s workloads, and jealousy between partners is human. I’m not blaming her as I know I might also have my own insecurities in different situations, and we both are career focused as well, and obviously don’t wish anything bad for her. I know she loves me and I love her, but these kinds of repeating occurrences doesn‘t allow us to keep our relations healthy.

What worries me is that we’re in the same career domain long term. So I’m afraid this dynamic might keep repeating: promotions, salary differences, recognition, academic achievements, skill growth, etc. I don’t want this pattern to turn into lifelong resentment or toxicity.

TL;DR

So my question is to couples who work in the same field is that how do you handle this kind of implicit competition, jealousy, or comparison? How do you maintain a healthy relationship when your progress is so easy to compare. Thanks in advance for any advice.

ANSWER: I imagine there’s more here, but the summary of your post suggests that your wife is an asshole. Why are there fights? I get friendly competition but it’s like she’s rooting against you. 

Why is it “unfair?” How you deal with it is having a firm conversation that this bullshit is unacceptable from both of you. You should both be happy for each other. That you’re not is insane. Maybe take a deeper look into your relationship for this to be happening and then talk about it. Good luck.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (F23) deeply dislike my boyfriends (M24) friends

Hi. I wanted to ask the married community since this is something that worries me about the long term future for my boyfriend and I.

Light backstory, his friends are from his high school years where he was not in a great place and made a lot of poor decisions. When we met, he’d already gotten sober and turned life around for himself. Truly, he got it together and I’ve been so proud of him for it even if it was before we met. He told me that stuff was in the past, but that he keeps in light touch with a few people he was very close to.

He doesn’t see them often, but of course texts them all day long most days. I dislike them because they are still doing A LOT illegal activities, sleeping around, talk poorly about women (in front of me), lowkey make fun of him for getting his shit together etc. etc.

I believe who you surround yourself with is who you are / become.

I don’t agree with their lifestyles, I don’t enjoy being around them, they make me uncomfortable, and to be totally honest there’s times I’m a little nervous when he’s around them because of the things I can imagine they influence my partner to do.

I don’t really know what I want out of positing this to be honest but I’m feeling like it’s just going to be a bigger and bigger issue the longer we’re together. 
Any experience on if this gets better or???

ANSWER: It doesn’t. Until he decides for himself that he’s done with them. Your suggestions will just cause resentment. This is something he needs to do for himself. But you can also be clear that if he chooses to have them around, you aren’t really sure that there is a future here. Because honestly, there probably isn’t. He doesn’t prioritize your comfort at all.

QUESTION: I 21m and my partner 21f I think are having a confusing time

I 21m and my best friend 21f have started to be dating over the last 3 months but she doesn’t know what she wants. She broke up with her abusive long distance ex boyfriend this may and was very hurt and felt used during their 5 year relationship. A few months after she confessed her feelings for me (which I had to but was to nervous to act for the sake of are friendship) and we decided to try it long distance. (This is my first time doing long distance so have to learn lots) I thought things were going good and we’ve had no issues but while visiting her she told me that she misses having a best friend without the live interest part. We are each others  best friends and don’t really have many other friends. I love that my girlfriend is my best friend and I expressed that to her and she agreed but I’m thinking maybe she doesn’t actually feel that way. We are both very introverted shy people so making new friends can sometimes be a challenge and I was ok with it being mostly just her but it feels like she either wants someone else as a separate “best friend” or  want me to be the best friend but she’s expressed that she doesn’t want us to be any Less then we are. I feel bad bc she broke down crying feeling horrible about herself for feeling that way and I tried to tell her I’m happy she’s expressing how she feels but she can’t help but feel like she’s ruining us even though I told her she wasn’t and it’s ok. I just don’t know what to do should we continue as we are or would we be better off as friends?

QUESTION: I 22F think my bf 25M just being nice to me I don't feel like he loves me.

Me (22f) and my bf (25m) been together for more than a year. (LDR)  I think he just being nice to me I don't feel like he loves me and eventually will leave me.

He's usally very busy with his work. We mostly talk on weekends only. He's not really doing super good in terms his health (mentally + physically) due to work stress, Sleep isn't proper too. 
I am struggling to get a job. He's been very supportive and motivating. He wants me to keep my things on priority and not him.

So he mostly rest at home on weekends. Recently I fought with me about not informing about watching movie with a friend this weekend...
After he came back he told me he was out to watch movie, didn't responded to me(I was spamming - bad thing about me)cause he didn't see phone n it was on slient and couldn't inform because it was last minute plan. I was like okay but still cold towards him n expecting him to talk/convince/love me ( coz i didn't get to spend time with him) but he gave short replies n didn't talk.
I got angry again said mean things to him like do not cheat on me( although I know he would never do that - just to get attention) 
 
Next day he continued being cold n told me his annoyed by me..I stared same thing Continuous messages n all ( I just wanted to talk have good time but..I ruined everything)

He was being avoided when I said he doesn't respond coz he wants to make me suffer...then he responded n talked he didn't like this n cheating part told me. And told me he wants to be alone for some time and I should focus on myself (not him...maybe because he will eventually leave me? )

ANSWER: It sounds more like you’re insecure and are ruining the relationship yourself.  Nothing you did or how you behaved was okay. He’s allowed to do things on his own and not have you spam his phone.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (23 F) bf (25 M) have been together for over a year and are now “separated”

A little back story, my bf and i have been together since August 2024, we’ve also lived together since then because of outside issues (careers, past relationships and money). We never had any major issues or arguments that felt as though things were going bad until the first week of September 2025. He went out with his friends tailgating for a local football game and even though he said he’d be home that night and promised me, he didn’t come back home until the next morning. We had argued for several days before both going to therapy individually to help us see what was really going on and to get help. His therapist recommended that we take space from each other, so i had 4 days to move 3 states away back in with my mom and leave all of my furniture in our shared apartment. He is about 700 miles away from me right now and has told me that the reason he feels as though he needs the space to work on himself is because he wants to be a better person, partner, and father. He has been promising me that he still wants me and that he loves me and wants a future with me, but i’m scared that’s changing. We’ve been separated for 2 months this past sunday at this point, and one week ago we technically broke up. Friday night, so about 4 days ago he called me when he was drunk and was telling me how much he loves me and wants me to move back (i’ve been wanting to come back since i left, and i didn’t think he was that drunk). We spent 2 and a half hours on the phone with him telling me again even though we are technically “broken up” that he only sees a future with me and that nobody will ever take my place, that he will only ever love me, that he can’t have me because i am “perfect” and “too good for him” and that he doesn’t want to bring me down with him in his self sabotage. So i made plans to move back, i let my family and friends, and my boss all know that i’d be moving back to my apartment in the middle of January. Yesterday i was talking to him thinking that he still knew what he said, because he was acting like we were still in a relationship, and he said “You’re moving back in January?”. i told him everything that happened Friday night when i called him, including him telling me that he wants me back there and his response was “That is alot you just threw at me. Im sorry I did that. And it wasnt fair. But I dont recall any of that. I dont know why I would ever agree to that. Not in the position I am in right now.” I asked him to just think about it and see how good or bad it could actually be and he said he would, but today he says he “feels free” now that we’re not in a relationship anymore. When we were together full time i actively pushed him to go out with his friends but just to let me know if he wasn’t planning on coming home so i could be prepared for that and know what was going on. He told me multiple times that i was the only person to ever truly see him and make him feel heard and wanted. I’m so confused and hurt, what to do?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My [28F] boyfriend [34M] insults me we argue, but then immediately apologizes?

My [28F] boyfriend [34M] and I have been dating for 4 years, and while things are usually good, occasionally fights really feel like they get out of hand.

75% of the time, we can talk through an issue without too much of a problem, but every now and then I’ll catch him in a mood, I guess. During these times, he’ll insult me, either calling me names, telling me to “go fck myself,” tell me he’s sick of dealing with me me, etc. What hurts most is when he’ll usually bring up very specific insecurities of mine. For example, he makes double what I make, so we pay a ratio’d rent. I expressed to him once that I sometimes felt like I was taking advantage of him because of that, so in the next fight he called me a loser, mooch, freeloader, etc.

This’ll go on for a bit, but then he’ll immediately apologize and make it up to me, usually by being really sweet, hugging me, then spending the next couple of days being extra thoughtful. He says he never actually means what he says, and sometimes he ends up saying the opposite of what he wants to and “digs himself a deeper hole,” when he’s upset.

The issue is, sometimes he says things that cut deep and they’re hard to forget. I’ve expressed this to him, and while he’ll acknowledge he shouldn’t say those things to me and it’s wrong, I feel like he also kind of implies it’s not a big deal because he “only” said it because he was angry.

How can I convince him that it is a big deal and it doesn’t automatically go away just because he said he doesn’t mean it?

There have been 2 or 3 times I’ve insulted him back in response to something he said if it particularly got to me, but he claims it’s never bothered him after, which is how he thinks I should feel about it..

ANSWER: You can’t convince him it’s a big deal, because he has you right where he wants you. This is a classic cycle of abuse. The offending behavior, followed with affection and empty apologies to make you really think it was a mistake and that he’s actually a good guy!

It wasn’t a mistake. And his apologies mean nothing if he keeps doing this. Verbal abuse is REAL abuse. It is not normal to say these things to your partner, even one time.

I can promise you that this behavior will not change. This behavior is on purpose, designed to make you feel small and confused.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (20F) let go of and stop wanting revenge on my partner (20M)?

There’s a quote that says “Resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die.”
I never understood it until now.

I’m a 20-year-old woman and my boyfriend (also 20) has been my entire world for the last year. Our relationship is deeply codependent, and even though I know it’s toxic and I feel like my life is no longer worth living without him, I feel stuck and unable to leave.

When I first met him, I had just gotten out of a painful breakup. I never thought I’d fall in love again until he came into my life like a prince charming. He treated me in ways no one ever had: he paid for everything, took me on trips, spoiled me, and gave me emotional attention I never got from my parents. It felt magical and safe in a way I’d never experienced. He raised my standards and made me feel chosen.

But the whole time, there was a huge underlying problem: a mismatch in our ambitions and drive for life. 

This is where my own childhood trauma comes in. My father was emotionally unavailable and financially dependent on my mom for years. He never used his degree, refused to get a real job, and stayed stagnant his whole life. I grew up watching my mom cry about wanting to leave him. Because of this, I’ve always had to grind: I work three jobs, I study a STEM degree, I’m preparing for medical school, and I go to the gym every day. I never had the privilege to relax or explore life freely.

My boyfriend, on the other hand, spent money recklessly. He had no real job, with his parents funding him and him gambling a lot. Sometimes he would win $2-3k in one night. He’d tip $400–$500 for fun, blow through money like nothing, and I ignored it because he was so good to me emotionally. 

Until he wasn’t.

He eventually went completely broke. He started asking me for money. I loaned him money multiple times. He complained constantly about how hard his life was, while I was drowning under school, work, and stress. He refuses to get a job/apply and he dropped out of school. He would start lashing out at me too. Our relationship slowly fell apart. We began fighting every single day for hours. My hair started falling out, my self-esteem dropped. 

I started reacting in ways I’m ashamed of. I get angry easily, I say terrible things to him that I don’t mean. I can’t stop fantasizing about getting revenge on him, because I gave him everything, and somehow it made him value it less. I’m being forced to relive the same trauma I watched my mom go through with my dad: a man who refused to work, who drained her emotionally, and who made her cry to me as a child. And now here I am, repeating that story with my boyfriend. It feels so deeply unfair and like an injustice and I just want him to feel my pain, when I know the easier and best option is to leave him but the fact he isnt hurt while I have to be in pain everyday wont let me move on/leave. Any advice is appreciated.

ANSWER: So basically, he lovebombed you and dropped his mask once you had developed sufficient emotional dependency. 

Staying for revenge is pretty pointless for two reasons. First, you'll suffer more than he does in this relationship. Second, this whole thing is a battle for control over you. Staying means, he wins. Leaving means, you win. It's literally the one thing you can do to get under his skin. You'll know you hurt him when the begging and the promising starts.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 29M second guessing engagement with 32F

Me (29M) and my fiance (32F) started dating about 6 months ago. We were moving really fast and within about 2 months I was staying with her almost daily and about 3 or 4 months I moved in. Shortly after we got engaged. Things were fine in the beginning but now I am having second thoughts: 
I want to start off by saying I do love her. I do respect and amazed by her qualities and character. She is really quite intelligent funny attractive. However, recent insights have made my ability to confidently approach marriage seem insecure and unstable.

There seems to be a clear-cut pattern of control and empathy. I'm not sure if all these things are fair. This began when I moved in. She owns a home and pays the mortgage and utilities.I am a medical student (3rd year)  with small amount of loans (less than a car; on scholarship with a healthy stipend but took out loans for a small vacation; not incredibly smart but what's done is done). When I moved in I came under the impression that this is now my home as well. She has allowed me to use my monthly stipend to pay off my loans because she is debt phobic and so if we got married there would be zero debt between us. However, I also think this is a platform for some unfair/unequal treatment. 
She has been really hard on me when I make small mistakes. Things like making sure the toilet seats are down and the towels are on the towel rack. I honestly do my best but we all make mistakes sometimes.Granted, I have ADHD and I understand it can be quite frustrating when priorities are not managed properly, but there seems to be a huge impact on my self esteem with constant criticisms toward my lack of consistency and attention. For instance she doesn't care about the bedroom but I do, and when she forgets to make the bed or does something else that I care about I don't find it a big deal because we all make mistakes. Friends in public have noticed I am approaching her from a viewpoint of being almost scared of setting her off sometimes.
 
She seems to want to push me away with big things. This comes in the form of to want to have full responsibility of doing big projects, even if they cause her anxiety. She completely pays for the mortgage herself and does not let me for the sake of the fact that I have to pay my student loans (again, not a big deal to have some debt if it'll cause her relief). I find this very generous but also it seems like if we're engaged she does not want me to have a part of her life. When large issues in the home like big projects come along, She often has moments where she is "better than me at stuff" and ultimately "her responsibility since it's her house" and I find this quite hurtful and not inclusive for a happy long-term relationship. I feel she puts extra emphasis on these small things I fail at because I don't have the opportunity to help her with larger projects. 

Lastly, one of the largest issues is the fact that I find her to have an extreme lack of empathy for me. This all started or I noticed when I was returning from my psychiatry rotations and was trapped in a facility with schizophrenics and could not leave the facility (I wasn't given badge access for a week and had no escort when I was in the involuntary unit). I felt scared and in danger and she did not have any empathy for my situation. When I got into a bicycle accident (her bike) and felt I almost died (hit a car and blew out my shoulder), she voiced her concerns that she no longer has a working bike. Just the previous day I had a pretty significant emotional experience and I find this to be a complete lack of empathy. If she got into a car accident I would not be telling her that she broke my car. Her life is more than that. 

The last week was really tough. We had major conversations about her emotional participation and she seems to shut down and wants to think that emotions are a waste of time and she wants to be a robot with things because emotions are inconvenient.

Our major conversation ended with a hopeful (I don't know if I can change but I might try). I fear these issues Band-Aid resolved but they're going to be recurring issues for the rest of our life. And I don't know if I have the heart to be able to continue on like this. I find it extra difficult because I've packed up my entire life and moved in with her and now I feel slightly trapped and I would like to move into my own place. 

What are my options?

ANSWER: Getting engaged after just 6 months is a really really bad idea. It works out for some people, they’re the exception, not the rule. 

You describe this woman as apathetic and cold. This is your honeymoon phase of the relatinship. When you have the most warm and fuzzies, and see each other with rose tinted glasses. 

If you’re having doubts already it’s only down hill.

I would tell her you’re not ready for this level of commitment.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (18F) feel like my boyfriend (19M) has a weird relationship with his mom

I’ve been with my boyfriend for around 10 months now. We’ve been doing pretty well, and he treats me well, but I can’t help but feeling weird about how his mom (36F) acts around him. Her husband (40M) is in the picture and they live together.

She randomly sleeps in his bed and always finds an excuse to be in his room. She's even tried to walk in on him showering. My boyfriend does the smallest things for her that she could easily do herself, and she’s perfectly healthy. He drops everything just to tend to her. He does her laundry, and if she wants something small, he’ll run to the store to get it for her. He also cancels our plans so he can do whatever she wants, and he can never say no to her.

He keeps trying to tell me this is normal, but I don’t think it is. It feels like she doesn’t even treat him like a person, more like his only purpose is to serve her. They have no boundaries whatsoever, and my boyfriend refuses to set any.   
  
This isn’t a one-time thing, it’s probably happened 20 times in the last month.

Can you guys tell me if I’m being dramatic? I really don’t think this is normal

ANSWER: As a mom with an adult son, I can assure you this is not normal.  This is a form of abuse, called parentifying, where the child is basically treated like a partner instead of a child.  This is child abuse.

He needs counseling. Really badly.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (23M) don't know how to help my (23F) girlfriend with her sexual trauma.

I really hope this doesn't get buried because I really need to hear what people think.
I've been with my girlfriend for almost a year. I really really love her. I think she's amazing, smart, beautiful, I enjoy spending time with her and most importantly, she understands me and supports me and we like the same things.
She told me from the beginning of the relationship that she has a problem with sex, and later also detailed her past trauma from her ex and family members.
We progressed really slowly with making out, doing other sexual stuff, and it took us about ten months to have sex for the first time. Since then it's only happened once more.

 It's important to mention we live about an hour and a half away from each other, so we usually meet for one night per week.

I feel sexually frustrated almost constantly, and it really lowers my self esteem because I also haven't had much sexual experience before this relationship. When we do something, she usually enjoys it. But most of the time she leans away, tells me she's not in the mood, or intentionally does stuff like not sleep/eat too much so that she will have an excuse (she told me that). It makes me feel unattractive and like maybe she stays with me just for being safe.

She's aware of her problem, and is going to therapy, and has tried therapy in the past. I try to support her, but it's getting really hard for me because I know I want a future with her, maybe a family, but I know I want a healthy sex life. My main issue is I don't know how much to wait. I'm willing to put in a year, five years even, to be there for her and support her. But I'm afraid that after that maybe we will realize it just can't get better and I'll kind of be stuck a 29 year old with almost no experience trying to find love again.

I enjoy doing other activities with her, but because it happens so rarely I constantly think about it and it can ruin moments that would have been special otherwise.

All of this is on top of the fact that the rest of the relationship isn't perfect. I often feel like I put in more work than her. She works a lot and does a lot of activities and has dogs to take care of so usually we don't have much time to spend together, and when we do, she's really tired. 
I understand that might also be part of why we're progressing really slowly.
We talked about it a lot but I'm afraid to bring it up again and put more pressure on her. She says she wants to be more sexual and she has been in the past before her trauma. 
Sorry if this is a bit messy and long. I just don't know what to do. I feel lost.

All I want is for us to be happy together. To have a healthy relationship, and yes, a healthy sex life. I feel like she also wants that, but I don't know what to do.
I have a few job opportunities soon abroad that are really good, but will mean I will only be back for a week every month and a half. I don't know if I should take it, or if it will completely ruin our relationship. I want to help her and be there for her, but I feel like she would never really be able to trust me since at the end of the day, I do want us to have sex often.
How can I support her without losing myself, and respecting my boundaries?

TL;DR: My girlfriend has sexual trauma and it took us a long time to have sex, and it happens very rarely. She's working on it, but progress is really slow and I don't know how to help her because I constantly feel insecure and depressed about the situation.

ANSWER: Sounds like you two simply aren’t compatible. It’s not anyone’s fault, just reality, she isn’t in a place to support a relationship in a healthy way. That and you also noted not being happy with other parts of the relationship, it’s time to consider moving on

QUESTION: I (19M) am so jealous over my ex (18F)

Hey guys. Context, I 100% know that I 
 have retroactive jealousy as it ruined my last relationship. this story is nothing new. my ex reached out to me around a month ago to start talking again, so i fell into it. i played it cautious at first, not wanting to dive in too quickly. i didn’t tell her anything about how i feel. she tells me about this guy she’s talking to, im like cool ig. we continue talking for a couple weeks until we inevitably get super attached again. calling every night, telling each other they’re the one etc. i eventually crack and ask if they fucked. she says they did, twice. now keep in mind she first texted me the night she broke up with her new boyfriend, and started talking to this other guy shortly after she texted me for the first time. this meant they fucked while she was actively texting me. ofc this completely shattered me. i’m now in shambles. is there anything i can do to make this feeling go away?

ANSWER: You are 19 years old. You will feel this way about multiple women

================================================================================

QUESTION: Emotional abuse and how to get out of it? Trauma bond? Very long story. With me 30f and my 32f wife

This is going to be a very long story. I currently have no one to really talk to aside from my therapist.

So I, 30f have been married with my wife 32F for 7 years but together for 10. I’m going to talk about the recent events that have been very…traumatic for me. So, back in April I had started a new job as a scenic artist. Me and my wife were supposed to move though in a few months so I just wanted the job to have one since I was unemployed for 7 months due to being laid off at my other job. Found out we actually couldn’t move because my student loans had fucked my credit. I was always the one with stable employment so I needed to sign on for a new house where we were going to move. My wife told me I fucked everything up for us to move and now we are stuck where we currently are and it’s my fault. I apologized. I said at least I have a job now and you have a job that you love here so it wouldn’t be bad if we stayed. She got pissed off and told me I ruin everything single thing we plan together. I apologize.

So a few weeks have gone by I love my new job and I was making a lot of more money than I did at my old job. I worked 4 days a week 10 hour days. My wife hated it because I was really tired when coming home cause the job was surprisingly physically demanding and im smol 4’11 and have a lot of health issues, hypothyroidism, Pcos, blah blah. Sometimes I would work fridays because I loved the money I was making. Also I was away from my spouse and that was…nice. So anyway she was pissed off because I had a strict bedtime schedule. I also don’t drive so I am stuck taking public transit, which also pissed off my wife. Once I started making more money I started buying more health conscious foods, I love Whole Foods. My cholesterol was really high, along with blood pressure etc. I wanted to eat better. I had gotten a ham, for Easter. 50 dollars 8 pounds, bone in. Antibiotic free nitrate free, saturated fat severely low. She saw the ham on my reciept. She started yelling at me, saying how irresponsible I was and how stupid I was for wasting 50 dollars on a ham. I buy very expensive food,and how she hates being with me and wish she could get a divorce. She throws the divorce word very often. At this point I was like okay, divorce me. She said unfortunately I can’t we are stuck together because of the hvac loan. I had to take out a loan for a new hvac because ours was 18 years old and broke in the middle of summer. She had to co-sign for I couldn’t do it myself. She hates that I did that and somehow thinks I broke the hvac even though it was literally 18 years old and on its last legs anyway.

With the money I was making I started buying more skin care body care stuff. I have gotten the EOS vanilla cashmere scents of everything. I got a lot of compliments about my smell from people, except my wife. Every time I left for work, she said I stink up the house before I leave and she can’t breathe (she leaves like 30 minutes after me)how I’m selfish and don’t care about her health. When I try to tell her hey, you literally leave like 30 minutes after me, you are not in the house long and also it doesn’t smell up the whole house (my wife has a strong sense of smell) she calls me a bitch and that she hates me and that I am the most selfish person ever. I come home and all of my body care stuff is gone. She threw it away and said she was allergic.

With the new money I was making I also bought new clothes. Clothes my wife hated. I love colors and fashion. Before I met my wife I was very eccentric with clothing style but she hated it and said for me to dress more normal. I did and with me being on social media and seeing people dress how I used to, I wanted to dress in the ALT fashion again but more pastel. I bought clothes and she said I look like a child,a clown, that I don’t look good. The clothes make me look ugly. I told her people at work and when I walk to take the bus said I look great and people love my fashion. My wife says it’s because I look like a slow retard and no one is going to be mean to a person that looks like a slow clown and people are just being nice. She said I dressed inappropriately for work and I need to stop dressing the way that I do. I work in the arts. No one cares about how you dress. She said that she cares and doesn’t want to be associated with me dressing in that way. In the summer I had went on a family vacation with her family to California, her family thinks I’m adorable and said I look like a doll(which is my goal lol) and my wife would frown and scowl. And when we were in our hotel room she said that I look terrible and her family was just being nice. We went to a cafe and the barista yelled and said he loved my fit. My wife scowled. I had gotten a pink hat from the trip. I wore it to work and she saw me on the ring camera and said for me to not wear it it’s embarrassing for I’m not in cali anymore. I took off the hat. I started getting depressed severely. I was still dressing in my clothing, I wore normal clothes when leaving but then took them off at the bus stop that revealed my alt clothing underneath. My wife didn’t know about it.

At work I had befriended a woman and I’ll call her belle. She was a fellow gay. Our friendship turned…sexually charged. We never did anything other than have very sexually fueled conversations. I hadn’t had sex in two years because my wife said that I was dirty because she would get a lot of UTIs (she later found out she had a hormone issue, she got a hysterectomy and the issues went away) she would say that I turned her off because I was really awkward(which I am I’m a nerd). Or saying that I piss her off (there was always something I did that pissed her off) so we hadn’t had sex in two years. So when belle found me attractive, I was swoon for sure. Especially since I was being called ugly everyday. Belle made me feel safe, feel cared for. I would definitely call it an emotional affair since also everything was sooo sexually charged. At work and in texts.

When I went to work and belle would say how beautiful I was, it made me happy, I felt seen. I felt appreciated. She didn’t know about my wife at the time, I didn’t tell her. She also, at the time didn’t tell me about her girlfriend, whom she didn’t have a great relationship with. We had a whole talk about it. She was very unhappy in her relationship. She found out about my marriage because I was crying everyday for a week, and had told Wayne our friend, about my marriage, who then told belle. Belle wasn’t upset, but was worried about me and my safety. She checked in on me everyday. I hadn’t stopped eating, barley drinking water. She made me eat during our breaks. She watched over me. Sometimes she even made me homemade meals. Had asked me why didn’t I cook, I said I loved cooking but my wife hates the smell of my food. She complains that I stink up the house. I’m a big meat eater and my wife hates the smell of meat. My wife said since I have health issues I should stop eating meat and I said no as a foodie, it’s weird that you would say that it me. She called me a selfish bitch, and how I need to open my mind to becoming vegetarian. And that I’m closed off. So that’s when I started to not really cook, and order out a lot since I had the money for it. That’s when belle started making me homemade meals for me to eat at lunch. She worked out and was a gym rat and was worried about my health. I appreciated it. A lot of my friends have started to encourage me to cheat on my spouse. I just said me and belle are just very sexually charged friends. But everyone encouraged me to try to bang anyway. Since it was clear we liked each other. People at work also asked if we were dating, since we were attached to the hip. All the time. Another reason why I liked bell was because other than making me feel seen, sexually she matched me. My wife often called me demonic for the things I was into sexually and belle, matched me. Didn’t call me demonic or saying I need help. It made me happy even though we never did anything.

I started hanging out with my friends more and more. I’ll call them Layla and Imani. I used to be heavily into stoner culture with my wife. My wife was trying to get a job and stopped smoking but I didn’t stop. She would complain how she would get a contact high because I smoked so much, I smoked in the bathroom with a towel under the door, window open, two air purifiers on one in the bedroom, bedroom door towel under it, then an air purifier outside the bedroom door. She said I was selfish and disgusting for smoking weed everyday. How it doesn’t make her want to have sex, and it’s a turn off. She told me to stop smoking and take a break and it would Probably help my mental health. I stopped smoking for 6 months. I then started using gummies so my wife doesn’t need to smell the smoke. I only did gummies on the weekend. My wife started saying I was addicted to weed. I’m like how? I only do it on the weekends. And she’s like no you do it daily and I’m like no I don’t. I buy like 6 gummies at a time. It lasts me a month. And she’s like you can hide your addictions all you want. And I’m like……..ok… Back to Layla and Imani. They also loved weed and our hangouts involved weed 7/10 times. No judgement, just hanging out smoking weed. I missed smoking, gummies weren’t the same. I also love the artistry of water pipes and bowls, I actually want to make my own. I’m heavily into 3d printing/modeling I went to school for game art and design. Anyway.the smoking pissed off my wife, but she let me get a vape. I started smoking outside, and she said for me to stop being obnoxious with my big smoke clouds and people can see, it’s 8pm, no one outside. I stopped smoking at home. I started smoking at work instead. Since I work in the arts, it’s pretty normal for people to take weed smoke breaks lol. I hadn’t did this before. Belle noticed I was smoking at work, she does it to sometimes, so she just asked about it no judgements. Smoking at work helped me calm down for I would get degrading texts time to time from my wife that would make me cry, or panic. It also helped me eat since I wasn’t eating.

My mental health started getting worse day by day, since there was razors at work, I started to self harm. Belle noticed and was severely upset with me in a caring way. She started watching me at work when she saw my scars, and urged me everyday to leave my wife. My friends also started to urge me to leave because of the self harm. I had never self harmed before and even I was shocked that I was doing it. I started saving money towards a possible apartment. One day going to work I had lost my phone in an uber. I used belle’s computer to get on Facebook to tell my wife to pick me up because I lost my phone. I started using an iPad instead for about a week until I got a new one. Once I got a new phone I forgot to delete everything off the iPad. My wife started snooping on it and saw text messages between me and belle, me and my friends. Saying how abusive she is. She saw my apartment searches. She went through my bank history and saw I was giving money to one of my best friends who I will call Amy. (She was going through a hard time, with two kids and I wanted to help) my wife went through my diary on my phone also and my notes. she then started to text all of my friends that I was lying about my wife being emotionally abusive, and that I am mentally ill and stoped taking my Medicine and just crashing out. My friend Imani had a whole argument with my wife about my wife’s behavior towards me, and my wife was getting pissed off. My wife then started asking questions about belle. She didn’t care about me possibly cheating on her with belle but was worried that I ruined my wife’s reputation at my job, and with my friends.

So me and my wife started arguing about how I have fucked up her reputation and image and how she doesn’t care about belle because she’s fat and ugly (no she wasn’t) but she was more pissed off at the male inappropriateness at work (I used to date men but didn’t like them, I’m gay for sure but my wife doesn’t think I’m gay at all) I love love and love to give people hugs. I also love to compliment people and just overall be a nice human being. Making people happy makes me happy, and my wife hates that. She hates that I give people hugs and thinks it’s rude and inappropriate in our marriage. She called me a slut with my slutty behavior towards men. She then also called me a predator because belle is 23 and a child. And how she doesn’t like me and it’s all fake. How people at work think I’m weird because of the way I act. How I’m weird and a weird person and people give me sympathy because I act retarded. And how she doesn’t trust me to talk to anyone or be around anyone without destroying her character. Imani, and Amy started getting worried and asked for my location services to be on. I put it on and my wife saw and told me to turn it off. So I did. Me and my wife kept arguing (we were supposed to go to Ireland in two days) Imani and Amy begged me not to go to Ireland. I kept going back and forth between going and not going because my wife kept saying she wanted to divorce, then saying no, then saying she wants to be with me, to going back to divorce, to saying I don’t need to go to Ireland, to saying why wouldn’t I go, to saying why would I let my spouse go to a different country alone, I started getting mind fucked. So I went to Ireland and it was a beautiful and terrible time. For I was under severe watch, and I barely had my phone. My wife had it.

When we came back from Ireland. She had to go to work and took my phone. I started to panic. When my wife came back from work she gave me my phone and said she doesn’t trust me to have my phone without her being around. I started to self harm. I started saying how I didn’t want to be alive anymore, my wife became sympathetic? And asked if I wanted to go to a psych hospital and I said yea. She said she didn’t feel safe around me because all of my friends wanted my location and think she’s abusive and me self harming was making her feel scared. So I agreed to go to psych hospital where I stayed for 8 days. And then did an outpatient program for 15 days. My wife saw my medical records. And saw me talking about her to the counselors and psych. She got pissed off, and told me to get an addendum of all my medical records to erase all history of abuse. She said that I have really hurt her and hurt her self confidence and she now has severe social anxiety around everyone because I have ruined her reputation with everyone. How I have BPD and how I love my friends more than her, and how I don’t show her any basic respect. When I tell her I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around her, she says she feels like she has to do that with me, how I have gaslit her into being this abusive awful human being to everyone. How she feels like shit. And I feel terrible and so apologetic. But my wife doesn’t even understand what caused my crash out, like what about me? I literally feel so fucked up and so…like fucked up!

While I was in the hospital she was impersonating me, to my therapist, canceling all of my appointments. She removed all my friends from social media, she deleted my instagram. I’ve been trying to make amends with my wife and make it work. Recently I’ve been hanging out with my friends with her. Now that we have hung out a few times, she added everyone back on my Facebook. She checks my emails, my texts, calls from my mom. Like I don’t know what to do. I feel broken I feel so…..broken that’s the only word I have. I haven’t seen my mom this year at all because of work, I want to go back for thanksgiving but I don’t know how to tell my wife oh hey I’m gonna go home for thanksgiving. My wife doesn’t think I should go back to nyc because there’s weed there and then my brother died there. I miss my mom and my friends there but idk what to say to put her mind at ease, like hey I’m not gonna smoke weed (I probably will) and I will not talk badly about you to my friends (they all know everything and think it’s weird I’m not talking about her at all) my best friend in the entire world, Felicia called me when I came out of the hospital and I haven’t spoken to her at all. I have spoken to no one personally. I feel stuck and lost.

A few days ago, I tried talking to my wife about my crash out, and said that she was one of the many reasons why I went to the psych hospital because of her criticisms, and her not understanding me. She got defensive and said that I went really low, for me blaming her that I wanted to off myself. And if i wanted to go low, she could go to hell and said, the reason why I am the way I am is because “my brother raped me and my mom is an alcoholic” I was so…shocked isn’t even the word. Idk how to feel. I ended up apologizing a lot and she said that I’m emotionally abusive and that I cheated, and I’m a sociopath. Tbh I wanna go back to the hospital I feel insane. And like the most abusive person in the world.

tldr: wife constantly threatens divorce, insults me criticizing me for the way I dress and act And claims I’m NPD and BPD and very abusive. I semi cheated with a girl at work and my wife found out about me texting about abuse and removed my friends from social media. I went to the psych hospital for self harm. Now I’m out and being severely monitored for the consequences of my actions?

im bad at tldr sorry! Also very mentally…ill currently.

i have no idea what I want or what…I’m trying to get from doing this. I’m currently in therapy and my therapist says this is narcissistic abusive on my wife’s end but, my wife says I have that? I’m very fucked and confused my bros. lost af. I don’t even have a job anymore because my wife wanted me to quit. it’s almost thanksgiving and I still haven’t bought a ticket to nyc to see my mom. like idk what to do lmao

i have no idea if I’m abusive, being abused, if I’m a terrible person, if I have actual BPD or NPD, or if I’m just terribly codependent or have PSTD. every therapist I’ve seen in the hospital stay and the one I had before hospitalization and the one I have now just say I’m very codependent and have C-PTSD. I feel like literally so…fucked up and lonely. my wife says she’s not trying to isolate me and she doesn’t know why I’m not talking to anyone. then she turns around and says shit like I’m afraid of you talking to people without me there because you’ll be talking badly about me. or monitoring my conversations extensively. when I try to establish boundaries she says no because I ruined her trust and that I cheated and am very inappropriate so I need to do this for a while until she gains trust back. but she’s literally always been this way just not as bad. like what the fuck is my life lmao. I’m lost as fuck. I can’t even use social media anymore. or I feel like I can’t without getting an array of questions. I can’t go look up stuff because she looks at my browsing history.

I had a dream about black vultures and looked it up because I’m into dream interpretations. she saw that and she’s also into that and she started heavily looking into what it means. she freaked out and started saying oh it means new beginning or like having to face the truth of what youre feeling and I was like oh haha. and she freaked out about me actually hating her and thinking shes abusive and said she’s not abusive and she doesn’t know why she thinks I think she’s abusive. and getting pissed off at me. I’m like, it was just a dream bro a harmless dream. please stop…I have no idea how to contact anyone because of the IPhone Screen time bullshit either. I’m going mad.

and everything sucks because we do have our GREAT days! and it’s really….messing with me. I understand I cheated emotionally and probably would have physically. I ruined my wife’s reputation I understand. I’m feeling so extremely fucked up though and everything is so so fucked. And for some reason I can not leave, and my wife won’t leave me either. When I was planning to leave everything went to shit and I no longer have the mental capacity for anything. I can’t even get tickets to go back to NYC to see my mom and I miss her since I haven’t seen her this year, by myself.

thanks for listening I know this is alot❤️ everyone have a beautiful day. I’m sorry if I triggered anyone.

ANSWER: You two are not good together.   You need to move on for your own mental health and happiness.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (F19) Partner (M18) Is Very Tired all the time. How can i help?

My partner and I are in a relatively fresh relationship. He and I have barely any problems, except this one. He is constantly tired and often times pretty absent-minded.  This doesn't tend to bother me much at all, but he has expressed frustration with this constant state of being tired or distracted. He has diagnosed ADHD and i know this is definitely a factor that is contributing to the issue but I don't want to grill him for specifics.

He expesses jealousy over my ability to keep a routine and even told me that he wishes he could be motivated. I love him and want to do my best here. How can i help my boyfriend with this goal of being more motivated and less (in his own words) ''Lazy''?

ANSWER: Stop treating him like a project. ADHD + tired = not lazy, just wired different. Chill, hype the small wins, don’t expect him to run a 9–5 brain all the time.

QUESTION: I (25f) think it’s time to breakup with my bf (27m) but I’m really sad and scared. Advice?

Me and my bf have been together for about a year and a half and things were for the most part amazing. A few months ago his dad passed. His dad was diagnosed with colon cancer back when we first began dating and he’s been fighting it until August when he finally passed. Since then, I don’t know I just feel like he’s been so emotionally shut down. He’s been so different like he’s a completely different person which I completely understand with something as big and as traumatic as a parent passing I definitely understand. But he’s been more emotionally distant and lately it feels like it’s just getting worse. I find myself being the one to always reach out and check in on him, if I don’t call or text I just won’t hear from him. And when I do he’s just very quiet over the phone. I feel so alone even when we’re together, it’s like he’s completely shut me out and I just miss being close to him and having that connection. The only time he wants to be close is when he wants to have sex and the only time he can be emotionally open is when he’s drunk. I feel like I’ve been doing most of the heavy lifting, reaching out, bringing over food, showing love and patience for him. But I’m just so tired and exhausted and I feel so alone and it feels like he’s not really even there. We’ve been fighting and having disagreements a lot more as well. We’re annoyed with each other a lot more if not every time we hang out now and I feel like we’re just never on the same page anymore. I told him that I understand he’s going through something unbelievably hard right now but I also need a little more from him that what he’s giving me because I just feel so empty and it feels like he’s doesn’t really care. When I brought up the possibility of us breaking up he was pretty clear that he wants to stay together and that he still loves me but his dad passing is just taking a toll on him. He is starting therapy soon because he says he wants to be better. I just feel so alone and so exhausted from pouring from my own cup while getting nothing back. Sometimes it really does feels like he’s doesn’t even like me or want me around and I just feel so disconnected from him. I don’t know if the best thing for us to do right now is to take a break or break up. Just something to have some time apart so he can have the time to work on himself and use the little energy and effort he doesn’t have for himself instead of a partner and I can stop constantly feeling drained and exhausted from not having my needs met and feeling empty and alone. It’s just that I still love him so much, and I’m really scared about us not being together or talking anymore. We thought we were gonna be endgame. Now I’m not so sure. I just want him to heal and I feel like he’s not gonna be able to do it very well if he also has to tend to a relationship. I don’t know, am I stupid for giving up? I’m so conflicted.

ANSWER: yeah just end it. He’s not gonna be “better” to you in a month or whatever. Grief never ends. Just save yourself

================================================================================

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (27M) was shown a screen recording of my girlfriend's (33F) Tinder profile.

I know a lot of you were wanting an update so here we are. I will also add background info/clarification as I wrote this whilst my head was spinning 1000 MPH.

1. Her child is ten years old. I can see how the 10 M could be confusing. 
2. Yes my girlfriend is bi-sexual, yes so is Alyssa who originally found her profile. I imagine Alyssa sent the screen recording to Anna because either she felt Anna and I were closer? Or because Alyssa wasn't at work but Anna and I were? Not sure, didn't ask. But to the ones who suspect that they're just trying to break us up for no reason or out of jealousy, that ain't it. 

Ok so after my girlfriend was done with her online class and after her son was in bed, we both sat down on the couch to talk. It took me a few seconds to get the words out of my own mouth, but I told her that I was shown a video of her Tinder account. To which she replied "who showed you?" And that pretty much answered all my questions and my head started to spin even faster. I told her that I wasn't sure why that was even relevant right now but she insisted so I told her Anna showed it to me. She has also met Anna and _knows_ that Anna is straight, 6 months pregnant, and married. I told her that Alyssa had sent it to her and she showed it to me. Again questioning why this was relevant, I again asked her if she was on Tinder. She replied yes. She admitted to downloading it a week ago and attempting to match with women for flirtatious conversations/attention. She did show me the messages and I confirmed that they were all with women, that they were all just flirtatious conversations. She assured me that she had no intentions further than flirtatious conversations, and I believe that as she is 30lbs heavier now and rocking a pixie-cut, but still using photos from 3+ years ago. She said she just downloaded the app and log right back in and didn't edit anything about the profile from before. She also got very defensive. She brought up an argument from the past trying to deflect and somehow make me look like the asshole here. I called her out on it but was also trying to keep my cool in between still trying to come to terms that this was really happening.

The last year hasn't been easy for us. Between health issues, job issues, cost of living going up and getting laid off work issues; it's been rough. She said she's felt like something has been missing between us lately, that she's so lost that she doesn't know what she's doing. She sobbed and told me she made a really stupid stupid mistake, to which I agreed. I told her how stupid I felt because when I was shown the video by my friends, I almost just laughed it off because it was so out of left field and the photos were old and shit, I told myself "there's no way!" 

I don't know what to do. As said previously, we have lived together for 2 years. I contribute my income to the home mortgage and all other monthly bills. She cosigned on the car I bought because I started developing credit late and had shit credit. We have the same phone plan. We're on the same car insurance. So much of my life is wrapped up in the relationship, I don't know where to begin unraveling it. I don't know where to go.

Currently I think I am sticking it out here until I can build up my credit and hopefully my savings. I just got laid off at one job so I'm working part-time in the ER until I start my new job Dec. 1st. I'm honestly just so lost myself lol. I know I should leave, but I care about her. I am scared to put her and her son in a bad spot. After the year she's had, I don't know what she would do. She doesn't have a support system behind her, she has me.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How does my husband 33M not see what he’s doing? (me 32F)

I snapped today, and in trying to get both of our kids ready so I can go to an appt, my husband asked me why I insisted on taking our older 2y/o as he was acting up so much and I said ‘because I’d rather do this on my own, you will hang this over my head’

For context atm I’m ‘admitted’ to a mother and baby unit for severe PPD but right now I’m on leave, I stay at home and go back for appts. 

For a while now, we’ve had loads of arguments and within those arguments he constantly tells me how he does everything, how he took the kids so I could go to the gym, how he’s felt like a single dad to our toddler (he’s been on paternity leave since our daughter was born 6 months ago). I don’t do enough, I’m a massive disappointment. 

I snapped today, and I said the root of this issue is you don’t love me anymore. And he said just remember, I woke up fine you’re the one who’s moody and making problems.

I feel like I’m going crazy. I’m so fucking tired

ANSWER: Telling you that you're a disappointment was horrible. Postpartum Depression is real so he should've understand that.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Long-term friends suddenly turned me over something I didn't even realize I did. Feeling blindsided. I'm M/35, they are F/40

I (M/35) live abroad, but every time I’m back in town I usually stay with a pair of long time friends + their kid (F/40s & M/19). We go way back. They’ve been through a lot over the years. Getting kicked out of places, moving towns, financial struggles and most recently their home burned down. I’ve always tried to be there for them in whatever way I could. Our friendship has always been warm, full of laughter, venting and support. It felt solid

Before the fire, they asked to borrow money to pay off some debt. I lent it to them and they paid me back on & off. After the fire. They told me they needed to pause repayments. I completely understood and told them to take as long as they needed. I even bought them a new air conditioner – not expecting repayment at all.

But I’ll admit, it stung a little when I started seeing their Insta story showing new purchases including brand new iPhone 17. It made me feel weird bcoz if they could afford that, they could atleast pay back something, even a small amount. But I never brought it up

Anyway, here’s where everything went sideways.

 I recently visited for 4 days and stayed at their place as usual. While I was there, I paid for their meals and helped out as a thank you for hosting me. On the day I left, I packed my things, cleaned up and everything seemed normal.

3 days later, I suddenly received this message from one of them :

“Hi \\\, what a horrible human being you are. You’ve peed in our bed and didn’t even bother to inform us? Not even an apology? I waited days for you to send me a whatsapp for an apology and NOTHING. Where is your responsibility as a grown a\\ adult to clean up after yourself? I am so disappointed”

I was completely shocked. I genuinely had no idea I had even done that. I didn’t feel or smell anything when I woke up. I’ve never had history of peeing in bed (at least none that I know of)

I replied immediately, explained that I must not have realized it happened, apologized repeatedly and asked what I could do to make it right. I Told them I would never intentionally leave something like that for them to deal with.

My messaged weren’t responded at all but they continued posting stories/status, so they definitely saw it.

Look,I understand it’s upsetting but the way it was phrased felt like a full on attach with no room for explanation, especially given everything I’ve don’t for them over the years. It made me feel really hurt and blindsided. One unintentional slip-up and the entire history of our friendship seems erased.

How do I process this after everything we've been thru?

ANSWER: I think this is a lie as they would rather not pay you back. If you had peed the bed, you would have woken in the morning wet. I think by lying about this, falling out with you, they can then say “we aren’t paying you back now as you owe for a new mattress”.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (F26) feel like my Ex (M29) has somehow ruined blowjobs for me, how can I fix this?

So before dating my ex I always kind of had bad experiences with giving blowjobs. Either guys wouldn’t let me work up to getting comfortable with it and just shove my head till I couldn’t breath, even after I told them to not do that because it would freak me out (I have a lot of trauma growing up and past sexual trauma) or they smelled weird. 

And when I was dating my ex he was the first one to listen to me and let me work up to my own pace. To the point where I enjoyed it so much I would wake him up with me giving him a blowjob, and he really loved that. 
He was also really clean and never smelled so that was a bonus too. 

After we broke up he ended up raping me and since then I haven’t been able to give blow jobs or stand the feeling of cum. 

It’s been a few years now and I’ve worked on my peace and pushing through except this one problem of not being able to give blowjobs, which may be a weird problem to have? Lol

Since then I’ve met guys who were gentle with me or let me go my own pace when giving a blowjob but the minute I taste even a tiny amount of pre-cum I start to gag and want to throw up. I feel like this is costing me to be able to have more hookups/ or even continue to have a hookup buddy, and maybe someday a partner. 

What are some things that would help me get over this? I’ve tried on toys too and same thing, I start to want to vomit. I try to remember how much I enjoyed it and would love to be able to give blowjobs again but I can’t help the gagging coming back and wanting to cry/ vomit. Any advice please?

ANSWER: Its not something you "need" to get over, certainly not with any time pressure. What you have endured is serious trauma, and I am sorry. Give yourself the grace of giving yourself plenty of time. If you aren't comfortable doing it, then don't do it. Sex is supposed to be mutual. Don't put pressure on yourself and just let time do its thing. 

Maybe speak to a therapist if you haven't already and it bothers you that much.

================================================================================

QUESTION: So I 45F am being accused of 'quietly dumping' my 60M ex boyfriend of 4 years. I don't believe that I did but I guess I need more perspectives. Did I?

I think I need to include background information on how I got here. My ex 60M has neurodivergence of some sort, but refuses to get tested, it is accepted by everyone but him. He has a tendency to start arguments 2 weeks before an event, not communicate at all for the 2 weeks, then once the event is over, start text arguments to get the relationship going again. This become a routine I worked out quickly in the relationship, but basically Christmas, birthdays, funerals, any event really I would be on my own. I started to feel like a single person with a guy on the side. He also never bothered to meet my family, saying they weren't relevant to our relationship. So I ended up having to go into hospital for planned surgery I have been waiting on for years, life changing surgery for a woman. He started an argument 2 weeks before surgery and stopped talking to me. I'm so fed up with this game that I don't even bother texting anymore. I go in for surgery, he texts me good luck for surgery but I'm already in. My daughter messages him I'm out of surgery and to come visit me, he doesn't reply to her or show up. So I'm pissed and when I finally get my phone I block him on a messaging app but not on phone entirely. He doesn't bother to show up to hospital at all or to my mother's house where he knew I would be recovering. He texts me 2 weeks later saying he'll drop my stuff off seen as I 'quieting dumped' him. His family say I'm not communicating with him now so it's my fault. My family are fuming he abandoned me...again. I'm recovering quicker than expected but not sure if hormones/drugs/ me being a fed up are a factor. However I'm a firm believer in trying to do the right thing and would 100% want a guy to know why he's been dumped, but to me it should be obvious why. I loved the guy but was a bit of a door mat where he was concerned (his family's description of me).

ANSWER: He abandoned you during major surgery after years of checking out around important moments. That is not you quietly dumping him. That is him showing you exactly where you stood and you finally choosing yourself. You did nothing wrong by walking away.

QUESTION: 28F/32M: Advice for how to handle boyfriends insecurities about dick size

I (28F) have been dating this guy (32M) for about four months now. He's so kind to me, like for the first time ever I feel like my partner truly adores me. We are already very serious since we both feel like this is "it!" I love him, he loves me.  

I have no complaints about the relationship or about him, but I would like advice on how to handle an insecurity he has.  
He is on the smaller end of the spectrum in the nether region. At first it messed with my head because he was so vocal about having a smaller penis. But it genuinely doesn't matter to me, he is the best sex partner I've ever had! He knows what he's doing, he makes me feel great and I feel so comfortable and relaxed with him. His size is not an issue for me, or for my enjoyment of the sex. I actually prefer him over "bigger" ones I've been with before, that have caused me pain and discomfort. 

It's just that he jokingly brings the topic up quite often about his dick size, and I don't know how to handle it! I try not to say anything at all. At one point he implied that I wasn't getting "enough", to which I told him that he's got to stop this, he is well enough for me and I enjoy everything about being intimate with him. 

But what do I say in these situations? I want to reassure him that he is enough and that his size doesnt matter to me, but I dont know how to approach it. I don't know what to say when he jokes or talks about his size. I can't tell if he's joking comfortably or if it's because of insecurities.

ANSWER: It is probably a mix of the two. I think you communicate what you put in your post. Tell him that you don’t how to respond when he “jokes” about it. If he is the one, hard conversations are part of your future.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [24F] am disabled and my partner [28M] is too uncomfortable with me using mobility aids. What to do next?

I was diagnosed with severe Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome & a range of other comorbidities several years ago after developing an infection. I’ve been living with my conditions obviously for a long time, and the symptom severity has varied through the years but this year has been especially tough. I’ve been forced to reduce my hours at work from 40 to 18, I actually have not returned to work in over 4 months, have extreme difficulty doing house chores and grocery shopping. 5-10 minutes into any physical exertion and I become extremely dizzy, exhausted, ringing in my ears, faint, near passing out and have to sit down or lie down. This intolerance to exertion is having a huge impact on my mental health.

I’ve become more of a shut-in, not seeing friends often, not being able to travel or go out for very long, basically only getting essentials from the shops and we have to make it quick, or my partner just goes out alone.

I don’t drive due to my conditions, and i’m on government payments at the moment to contribute to the household bills until I start my reduced hours at work. 

I told my partner today that i’m struggling, physically and mentally, I feel claustrophobic in the house and want to do more. I used to use mobility aids (wheelchair/walker) for a period ages ago years before I was with him, and they helped me gain back some independence and allowed me to do things on my own. I told him maybe this is an option for me, but I couldn’t do it without his 100% support because I’m terrified of gaining attention to myself, feel embarrassed being a young person needing them, people staring at the shops etc. It’s a last resort, but at this point, I don’t know what else to do.

He said: he was uncomfortable by this. Couldn’t imagine feeling okay having a girlfriend in a wheelchair in public, that it’s embarrassing, I’d be “going at a snail pace.” and “couldn’t hold my hand.”

To which I said of course you can hold my hand, and I understand your feelings and i’m scared too, but this would help me. But he still insisted his side. He said “why can’t you do a little gardening everyday and try to get fitter?” and I explained how my illness is worsened by exertion but it wasn’t getting through. Anyway, the conversation got heated, I felt like I had to keep justifying why I needed them, and we talked about other options. I said at the mean time I’m trying my best to rely on my support network but when it comes to physical limitations, medications and my diet and exercise routine can only do so much. I’m exhausting all resources and it’s still not enough, I want to be able to go out without being afraid of flaring up and having to sleep 14+ hours the next day.

Many things were said, including me asking him if he ever felt interested in suggesting things maybe he could research my conditions because he doesn’t know a lot about them, and we’ve been together a year. He replied with a short “No, frankly i’m not interested. And I know that makes me a bad person, but i’m exhausted with how your illnesses are always talked about, always consuming everything, and I don’t want to get even more involved in it. No one dreams of having a partner with chronic illness, or a partner in a wheelchair.”

Honestly what he said kind of broke my heart. I feel like such a burden. I was hoping he’d be more supportive, more engaged and willing to talk about it kindly but I just sensed a lot of judgement and heavy feelings. We ended the argument/conversation and I just don’t know how to move forward. We do love each other a lot, I love him to bits. It’s also hard when there’s something that could improve my quality of life but he disapproves. 

I know i’m the agent of myself and I can get mobility aids without his approval, but if I do and he’s embarrassed to be with me in public, I fear that will cause serious harm to our relationship. I just don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR:
I need mobility aids due to worsening illness, but my partner of 1 year finds the idea embarrassing and doesn’t want to engage with my condition, leaving me hurt and unsure what to do.

ANSWER: Oh, girl. 

He has already nuked your relationship. 

He has zero interest in learning anything about what's literally life-altering for you, and doesn't want you to live a better life because it will embarrass him. 

Listen, I know you're emotionally invested, so it's hard to see. But from an outside perspective, this guy is disgusting. He's all red flags, zero redeeming qualities.

Please love yourself enough to prioritize your health: physical (get the mobility aids!), emotional (get some friendships back!) and romantic (get rid of the absolute parade of red flags that this guy is!)

We got in a massive fight that had me screaming about ending the relationship.

I feel awful but it makes me uncomfortable. 

I have been so sure for months that I couldn’t continue and then he turns around and does this. 

For those who have left, how did you stick to your guns? And for those who stayed after this, was is just lovebombing or did it last?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My husband (34M) had a very strong reaction to me (31F) touching his phone. Need advice on if this is suspicious?

My husband was giving our 2 kids a bath, he went to go dry off the baby and I sat in the bathroom with our toddler. My husband left his phone open on the bathroom counter and YouTube was open. Him and I warch very different things normally so I was just scrolling looking at what was on his YouTube recommended videos. Thats it. I didnt go through his phone, didnt click out of youtub and had no intention of even doing so. Was just curious about what videos he watches on an app that was already fully open on his phone. He comes in the bathroom and raises his voice at me and asked me why I was going through his phone. It was a VERY strong reaction and very accusatory in nature. When I told him what I was doing and that I wasnt going through any messages, phone calls etc. He told me to never go through it again and he snatched it and put it in his pocket. This caught me off guard becauee if my husband was going through my phone I probably wouldn't have reacted the same way. Makes me wonder if he does have something to hide and now im feeling strange about it all. I even went to hand him my phone to show him its not a big deal. What are your thoughts?

ANSWER: He's hiding something, either he's watching porn & Only fans or he has a girlfriend and messaging her.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (25F) boyfriend (25M) said he doesn't want my happiness to be dependant on him

My boyfriend is really busy with work, often working 16- to 23-hour shifts. And while he could still put more effort in, he admitted that he doesn't want to be more present because it doesn't affect him much not seeing me often. He said he doesn't want my happiness to be dependent on him and asked me what would make me happy in the long run. Not just relationship-wise, but in life. 

I told him that I want to find a job, love, and be loved, build a family, and have someone to hug before going to sleep every night. I asked what he wanted, and he said he wanted this year to go well at work and buy a house later in life. I also told him that I think happiness has many facets. I am happy with school, friends, family, and my career prospects. But I am also unhappy with how he treats me in our relationship.

I had to let him go because he had to return to work, and we have a lot to discuss, such as how he views my goals, how each of us fundamentally perceives love, his parents' relationship, and his family dynamics. For now, he said, let's think about what we should do with our relationship, what will happen when I leave the country because my student visa expires, and realistic things. He said, 'Let's not decide something right now, but think about it.'

What does it mean when your partner says they don't want your happiness to depend on them? What is the deep meaning and nuisance of it?




Edit: Thanks everyone for weighing in. I texted him late at night. I told him 

- It isn't his responsibility to make me happy. 
- I think he wants to break up, but doesn't want to hurt me, so he's trying to make me say it.
- We want different things. I want love, and he no longer sees that in me.
- I'm letting him go, and I wish him happiness.
- If he wants to see me one last time before I leave, he can reach out.


He replied just now.
- He acknowledges it must have been difficult for me to decide to let him go and say it.
- He thinks it's for the best, and he wishes I were happy for everything that will happen in my life.
- He's happy to meet me before I leave.


So many of you were right. I'm obviously upset and sad. I'm crying like a lunatic. I loved him so much, and I hoped he would love me just as much. That didn't happen. I believe he liked me to some extent; otherwise, we would not have been in a relationship. But this love story did not end like a rom-com. That's okay. I truly believe it's not because I'm unlovable, but because we didn't like each other equally. Sometimes, there's just no reason for that, and it's what it is.

It's nice to put this out there. Like I'm screaming my thoughts into a void, but people are still listening, haha. I'm going to be okay.

ANSWER: Kind of sounds like he means he wants you to lead a fulfilling life independent of him. And that's honestly not a bad way to be when it comes to dating and relationships -- your happiness shouldn't hinge on someone else.

But there's a difference between two independent people enjoying their space and coming together to enjoy each other in the context of a relationship and being totally absent while treating a partner like they only exist when it is convenient. The latter is NOT a healthy relationship dynamic and can lead to anxious attachment tendencies.

If he cannot keep a relationship in his top 3 priorities, then it doesn't sound like he's ready to be in a relationship at this point in his life.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (21F) tell my friend (19F) that the reason she’s lonely is because she makes people uncomfortable?

I met my friend through university. She’s not someone I’d typically gravitate towards, but I do like her as a person and enjoy hanging out. 

The thing is, she constantly vents to me about her issues making friends/getting a boyfriend. To put it bluntly - she cannot read people. 

She often misinterprets people and gets way too in their personal space (in a touchy sense) She’s almost too comfortable, and a few people have told me that makes them uncomfortable. She is also extremely blunt which is fine with me, but it comes off rudely at times. I’ve seen people get upset by things she says, and she doesn’t even realize it. She is not an unattractive woman at all - but sometimes she comes off creepy/inappropriate towards men. She cannot tell when men aren’t interested and keeps pushing it. There are just a lot of boundaries that aren’t there. 

I’ve considered that she may be neurodivergent which is why I want to approach this topic kindly. On one hand, it’s upsetting to see my otherwise likable friend struggle to connect with others - but on the other hand, I don’t want to hurt her feelings by telling the truth. 

I’ve gently tried to lay it out for her (not unsolicited) and she just doesn’t fucking listen. I’m honestly lost and don’t know what to do. Would you want to know if this were you? It’s like it’s at her fingertips…like I said, she’s an otherwise cool person. This just ruins it for her.

ANSWER: Try being direct with her. No sugar coating. Maybe provide some constructive scenarios like "instead of touching people/getting up in their grill, focus on active listening to build rapport". Constructing it like Problem-->Solution-->WHY works for a lot of ND logic structures.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My partner 25M called me 26F "vanilla" mid-sex

When I met my partner 4 years ago he had mentioned that he was a hyper-sexual and hinted towards having wild sex through the years. Initially when we got into the relationship his drive was high but it quickly died within the first year for reasons I'm not sure of. This really effected my self esteem and my view of my sexual abilities. Internally I would always wonder about what other women did that brought out that side of him, were they hotter, wilder, a bit more psycho as the saying goes.

When I would ask about his limited sexual desire, the reasons always varied from tiredness to stress to I don't knows. Our sex life never got back to being full force but luckily my desire for constant intimacy died down a bit too, which helped the arguments we had around sex.

A couple days ago, after were done having sex, I expressed a desire to go again. While we were re-engaging, I jokingly mentioned "I think I'm the hyper-sexual in this relationship", to which he responded "you haven't seen that side of me", so I asked "why" and he said "cause you're vanilla".

In the moment it didn't fully hit me what he had said and in an effort to not have an argument mid-intimacy I didn't press it any further. Afterwards as I thought about it more, I realized how deep it stung and how awful it felt hearing that .... It brought back all my insecurities. So I brought it up with him, but I was too emotional and so it felt like nothing he was saying could take the hurt away. He tried to say I'm sorry and apologize, or reassure me by saying that he does enjoy having sex with me and that it's fine. But I was spiralling at this point and I wasn't able to regulate my emotions. Even when I tried probing what he meant and what other people did that were not vanilla he said he didn't want to talk about it since I compare myself a lot.

I just feel so awful about myself now, it's been a few days but the comment still replays in my mind and stings. I can't stop wondering what other types of women he's been with that did bring out that hypersexual side in him. I can't stop wondering if he's just settling with me sexually. Everytime I see another women that I think is physically his type I just feel this punch in my stomach. And most of all, my self esteem is shot. 

How do I resolve this, either by just fixing it on my own internally or by bringing it up with him ? ( Although I don't want it to turn into another argument )

ANSWER: "Vanilla" means not into kink. It's not an insult, it's just fact. He's telling you that he's into kink of some sort, and he thinks you aren't. It has nothing to do with his physical type, or what you look like, etc. 

Also, you aren't "hypersexual" because you have a high sex drive. Hypersexual means that someone has what is now called compulsive sexual behavior disorder. You don't "bring out" someone's "hypersexual side", and oh dear god, if it exists, you don't want to bring it out. 

If you want to make him feel intense passion, talk to him about what he meant. See if he meant kink vs vanilla. Use your words.

================================================================================

QUESTION: my (22f) boyfriend (21m) only has one testicle and i have no idea why. how do i ask about this?

i know this is sort of a strange post, but i genuinely do not know how to go about this. my boyfriend and i have been dating for a bit over a year, and we’re definitely serious about a future together. 

since we first started having sex, i noticed that i could only feel one testicle, but i honestly thought i was mistaken or something since i really did not have much experience. 

there was one time a while ago (probably almost a year ago) that he mentioned to me that he “couldn’t find” his other testicle, and asked if i had noticed. i said yes and i asked him why he “couldn’t find” it. he said that he didn’t know, so i asked if he had ever in his life felt that it was there, he said he didn’t know. i then asked if the doctor had ever said anything about it, he again said that he didn’t know. 

this is something if just been really confused about. if he had told me he had it removed, or that it had never developed or something i genuinely would not care at all (as long as he was still able to father children) i have been looking up reasons as to why a person only has one testicle but i am at a loss because this should have been something that should have been noticed a long time ago. 

i feel like i should know why. how would i bring this up to him in a way that is nice and understanding? i know that this may be a sensitive topic for any man, but i just want to know if it has been discussed with a doctor and that it doesn’t affect fertility (even if it did, it is not a dealbreaker, and i would want to work through it with him.)

ANSWER: Hello.  Physician here.  Cryporchidism is a situation wherein one of a man's testicles never descend from the abdomen into the scrotum.  This condition leads to an approximately 4-8 times higher risk for testicular cancer over their lifetime than in the general population.

Please please please do not allow him to ignore this.  Get him to a reputable urologist.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Boyfriend (24M) cheated, now he’s pressuring me (25F) to get pregnant. Is he trying to trap me?

Hi everyone,
I (25F) need some outside perspective.

About two weeks ago, I caught my boyfriend (24M) cheating on me with his ex. Since then, we’ve been trying to talk things out. I moved out and have been taking space, but I’ve still been letting him come over so we can communicate. The last couple of days have actually been calm and we’ve been on better terms.

But the moment things started improving, he suddenly became fixated on getting me pregnant. He’s been initiating sex constantly, pushing for it even when I’m not in the mood, and repeatedly telling me we “need a baby” to get close again. He’s also been asking me to get off birth control and saying a child would “bring us together” after everything that happened.

This behavior only started after he cheated.

It’s making me really uncomfortable and I’ve been sitting with this feeling that something isn’t right. I can’t tell if this is panic, guilt, or something else, but it feels like he’s trying to tie me to him before anything is even resolved.

My question is simple: Does this sound like he’s trying to trap me?

ANSWER: Good lord.

If that isn't the definition of a baby trap, I don't know what is.

>I just cheated on you. You're upset with me. Get off BC. We need a baby to bring us together so you forget about it, need to lock you in for life. You love babies, right? Me wanting a baby with you shows how serious I am about you. You always wanted seriousness... Even though I cheated and that means I am not serious, a baby will prove it!

Sounds like a great way to run into this:

>Actually... Nah, it was fun while it lasted. But I don't want to be here anymore. You got the baby under control right? Good luck with that! See you later!

Single mom ditched. Never serious about it because cheaters are never serious about you in the first place. 

I understand being in the midst of chaos can be a whirlwind of confusion.

But I am worried about you when you're asking this:

>My question is simple: Does this sound like he’s trying to trap me?

If this doesn't sound like baby trapping to you... What is your definition of baby trapping?

This is the holy grail of a baby trap.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 26/F, 32/M: My partner can only orgasm whilst on his back with my ass in his face and handjob/blowjob and it makes me not want to be intimate with him anymore.

TLDR: my partner can only orgasm under very specific conditions and I feel like as a result I'm missing a fundamental part of my sex life. Together for 3.5 months and I'm wondering if the relationship is worth it at this point. 

I, 26/F recently got into a new relationship officially with 32/M in late September, but had been fooling around since early August due to me getting out of a previous relationship and not ready to go official yet. So together for 3.5 months, officially for 2 months.

To preface, mostly everything has been great. He communicates well, he's funny, he's very sweet, goes to therapy, he has a dog that he loves dearly, he has a stable job, a car. 

But, he's not as cuddly as he made himself out to be. I've realized since getting out of a 9 year online relationship that I'm an extremely cuddly person, I think it's one of my love languages along with gift giving, but I've noticed I'm far more cuddly than him, eventhough he was the one that brought up the fact that he was very cuddly first. Like in the car I always have my hand on his thigh, when we sit on the couch I play with his hair and give him back and arm scratches, I give him lots of neck kisses, foot rubs (when my hands feel strong enough to go as hard as I go) and I feel like I get a fraction of any of that. I grew up with "treat others how you want to be treated" and I told him that, but I don't think he either gets what I'm trying to say with that, or he just thinks that I'm good with the lack of reciprocation. Sometimes I'll get a nice hug, a few times a hand on my thigh while he drives, a cuddle where I lay my head on his shoulder. But it's rare I get a back rub, or if I get a foot rub, it has to be when he gets one too, and he barely ever plays with my hair unless it's when I have his dick in my mouth.

Don't even get myself started on our sex life 😒. I'm very open with fetishes, so is he, I have a few myself and does he. One of the things he said at the beginning was that it was hard for him to cum without being on his back because that was the majority of when his orgasms would happen, and so I took that as he'd still be able to cum in other ways, just that it would take longer. Nope. He can only ever cum on his back. This coincides with his fetish of having my ass smother his face. It's a huge fetish of his, which he said to me that he's never told another partner of his. Apparently I'm the only one he's ever told. But this has resulted in him pretty much never orgasming inside me. In the time we've been together since August, until now, he's only came inside me twice. And I'm sterilized which he was very excited about, so imagine my surprise that the only time he can orgasm now is when my ass is in his face and I'm either giving him a handjob or a blowjob. We do have penetrative sex, and I orgasm from it when I rub my clit at the same time, but the times he's orgasmsed inside of me is from when I'm riding him with my back towards him and he cums from that. Clearly he really likes ass. He told me from previous partners that he used to fake his orgasms, so I guess that he really does need to be on his back :/ 

It's a very primal thing for me to have my partner orgasm inside me and I'm feeling like I'm missing a fundamental portion of my sex life. It doesn't have to be all the time, but in the span of 3.5 months, only twice? 

I don't know whether it's just a plain incompatibility with sex/intimacy at this point, I'm wondering myself whether I should just suck it up because this relationship is better than my previous one and he is a great man overall. I'm half on the decision of just calling it quits.

I guess the question I want answered is: how the fuck do I bring this up to him in a way that doesn't attack him for something he can't seem to control? It feels like it's an incompatibility with sex so I feel like I shouldn't even bother. But what do I know this is my second serious relationship. This would be the first ever problem I've had in this relationship and so I've never seen him deal with a relationship issue. But I've seen how he deals with stress, and it's not good. Not terrible, but not good either. 

What I do know is that the more I've realized this and thought about it, the more my feelings for him sort of just slowly diminish. I'm still upset at the thought of ending the relationship though, but my responses to him over text are getting shorter, and the less I want to touch him, be touched by him, and the less I want to even spend time with him. We're supposed to hang out tomorrow and here I am trying to find ways to cancel.

ANSWER: Sexual incompatibility is a major reason for relationships ending, OP.  You two just don't mesh well in the bedroom.  Sucks, but so it is.

My (26M) asked me (25F) if I had seen his AirPods casually - we have been together 4 years.

Last I saw them was 2 days prior, he said weird I can’t find them and pulled up his “find my iPhone” one pinged with his case at home (we can’t find) but the other pinged in a house a town over. 

To my knowledge neither of us have ever been there. I said whose house is that? He zoomed out and looked at the app, he bushed it off said AirPods do that all the time they show up in weird locations they will show up. 

I walked away saying mine doesn’t (at least not in places they had never been before, maybe in a old location but not a new one) How does this happen, how does an AirPod just show up somewhere it’s never been?

ANSWER: He never thought to say, "huh, wonder if they've been stolen?" 

Can you figure out who lives there? Reverse address search or something?

================================================================================

QUESTION: How can I (35M) hold my GF (29F) accountable for her promise to stop financially supporting her trans best friend by the end of the year?

I love my girlfriend of 3 years more than you can imagine and am willing to do everything to help her. However we had a few serious fights over the last 9 months since my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1izf2be/my_35m_gf_29f_gives_away_all_her_money_to_her/) where she came to a realization that her using 1/3 of her wage to support her best and only friend for the last 4 years was probably not the best decision of her life. She fears otherwise her friend might die due to her inability to work (AKA being trans - in my country people are homophobic towards trans). During one of our fights my gf asked me to imagine if my best friend was relying on my cash and I cut the that cash and then my best friend dies, how can I go on with life - if someone else's death was on me.

After trying literally everything, I was only able to make her consider that she was enabling her friend by sharing some of the old post's reddit comments (I didn't show her the post). It seemed like she opened her eyes and even became suicidal for a few hours and couldn't sleep for a few days. She said "Fine, I'll cut the cash by the end of the year! Are you happy now?" and I responded "Yes, I am happy but I will help you by any means necessary, we can do this together".

However things slowly started to go back to where they were. Now she's paying 1/3 of her wage for her friend monthly plus about 1/5 of her wage to pay off the debt she took for her friend (hadn't told me about this prior). As you guessed since then she could only afford to go to a single weekend trip with me. I was not paying for her stuff - we split everything. I went to 2 other ski trips with my best friends to whom I will be a best man next year and she was invited but she is cutting corners and is not coming even though they begged her. During our last fight she had said "I don't hold you accountable for your money, why do you hold me accountable for mine???" which would make total sense unless you want family with that person and we both do.

Due to high inflation and her salary not increasing at all for the last 3-4 years, it's harder for my gf to keep up with living cost nowadays. We live together and I basically pay for everything at home - bills, groceries, etc. She is currently on the verge of being laid off (almost all of her colleagues got laid off and is expected that she will be laid off very soon) so I am trying to convince her to get another job before it gets too late. I also suggested to help her create a resume (I have lots of experience) but she refuses. I also sent her various job descriptions for positions of almost twice the salary (I would even tell her the interview questions because my friends work there) but she still said no.

A few weeks ago she decided to finish her university as she had dropped during her senior year because she heard that someone at some company only hired graduates (she has 8 YoE). A few months ago she also decided to study Korean which I am fluent in, which is really cute, and I really appreciate that and help her all the time... but she's piling up on the less significant stuff and ignoring the important stuff. Also she started to read some very long books until she goes to bed at around 4AM every morning, and wakes up around noon. For the last few weeks she complains she has no time or desire to work. But she always has the time to spend HOURS on the phone with her best friend every single day.

I tend to ask her about once a week how things are going with her best friend, whether they found her a job, and if they want my help, I'll gladly find something. But my gf always refused saying "I don't want to talk about this right now" or "now is not the time for that - you know how busy I am".

How do I hold her accountable for her promise?

ANSWER: Leave.   
  
You aren't her parent and she isn't a child; there's no 'holding her accountable'. She feels she needs to keep supporting her friend. You are simply incompatible.

QUESTION: I (25f) found my boyfriend (27m) saved nudes of a coworker and secret photos of a friend.

I (25f) been with my boyfriend (27m) for 5 years, and we’re planning to get married soon. He recently moved abroad for his PR process, and I was using his email a few days ago. I opened his Google Drive and found something I can’t unsee.

There were screenshots of a girl’s nudes from OnlyFans, and the worst part is that it’s a girl he personally knows and used to work with. He also had photos he secretly took of one of his female friends, zoomed in from the back while she was wearing a very tight dress. She clearly had no idea he took them. And all of this was saved in the same folder where he keeps pictures of me.

I’m shocked, heartbroken, and honestly disgusted. I never expected anything like this from him, especially now that we’re talking about marriage.

How do I confront him about this? What’s the right way to approach this conversation? I genuinely don’t know what to think or say right now.

ANSWER: this man's a fucking creep, he's disgusting and a sex pest.

leave, as soon as you possibly can.

================================================================================

QUESTION: After 15 years of marriage, just realized we’re the secret family to my husband’s marriage with his job. What can I do that isn’t divorce? (F35, M37)

I, F35, have been married to my husband, M37, for almost 15 years. We have 2 kids (13,9). Without trying to sound braggy, we are very blessed. We’re financially comfortable and provide a wonderful life for our kids and ourselves through our combined sacrifices and hard work. I’m a SAHM, and always have been. 

It wasn’t something I thought I wanted until I was pregnant with my first child. I realized my husband’s job didn’t allow for me to work and for us both to give the time/attention we wanted to for our kids. So I gladly stayed home. I’m still happy with my choice and don’t regret it at all. I love being with my kids and always being available for them. But the cost of my own independence and identity has been a very dear price for that and I have to manage my mental health very carefully because it’s easy for me to fall into depression and anxiety struggles. I live and love in my to do list. There are no sick days, no time off, no recognition. And your only reward is if your kid is healthy, happy, and decided to behave that day. I wouldn’t give it up for the world, because I love my kids more than anything, but it is incredibly thankless.

Throughout the years, my husband and I have struggled to maintain a strong relationship. For the most part, I do believe he is a good person to the people he cares about. He’s dependable and very self-driven. If all we needed in life were material things, we’d be incredibly happy. Unfortunately, he can be very immature, selfish, impulsive, and is not at all trustworthy. 

Our friends and family think we have it all. From the outside, he comes across as a very considerate and caring husband, and I’m sure he is in comparison to many other spouses. He travels 4-5 days a week for work, but when he’s home, he gets up with the kids to take them to school so I can sleep in. He also does their nighttime routine and handles whatever sports practices and games are occurring when he’s in town. He goes on dates with me when I ask him to go out and rubs my feet when they hurt. We go on a couples trip each year with just the two of us to exotic places internationally. He even took me on a designer shopping spree.

It all sounds and looks like a dream life. And for the most part it is. But last night I had an epiphany and it’s shaken me to my core. I need to open up to someone about it in case I’m going crazy. 

I think we’re the secret family in his marriage to his job and that we’ll never be his main priority. And I don’t know if I can live with that. 

I admittedly have a history with trust/intimacy issues based on abuse growing up from a bipolar and manic depressive parent, and a mom with co-dependency issues who never stood up for her kids or herself. As a middle child, I learned that no one would prioritize my well being except for me. I learned to stand up for myself and the people I cared about. And I’ve definitely brought that into my marriage and family life. I will always speak up when there’s a problem and advocate for what I think is best. I attribute the majority of the life we’ve been able to give our kids to that. 

In the past, my marriage has suffered from infidelity (online only, to the best of my knowledge), constant lying, and my husband prioritizing work over everything else. We’ve been to counseling multiple times to try and work through these issues, but the lying and prioritizing work only gets better temporarily and then he gets back to his workaholic ways. 

He’s in sales and is the typical salesman. Lying is a huge trigger for me. But he’s so good at his job because his gaslighting skills are incredible. 
He is able to easily take a negative and twist it to make you think it’s actually the best thing to ever happen to you. 

For example, we had a vacation planned for the week of Thanksgiving at our timeshare. We go one time a year to decompress and just spend time together as family making quality memories with our kids. He’s not supposed to work on these trips, but he always does. He excuses it by waking up before the rest of us are up to do meetings or emails, but he always has some “client emergency” he needs to handle as well at least a few times during the days. It’s the best we get though. 

This year, we planned our trip and not a week later he has a conference in the same place at a different resort at the same time as our trip. But he explains that it’s actually perfect, because we can just change our trip to after the conference and stay at the resort his conference is at in the beginning. That way our vacation is longer. Yay! Sounds by so great right? Until he adds that we can’t be bugging him during the day because it’s a very important work conference. We probably won’t see him much, because he’ll need to get up early to answer work emails, then the conference will have planned activities during the day and dinner receptions in the evenings. In the couple hours between that, he’ll need to be catching up on the work phone calls, meetings, and emails he missed during the conference. So we’re on our own. “But the amenities are so nice, so just go enjoy the resort. It will be great! But if we see him when we’re out and about, tell the kids to pretend not to know him, because that’s not professional. Yes, the other employees have their spouses here, so it’s not a huge deal, but his boss specifically doesn’t like it, so we need to pretend not to know him in case it gets back to her and looks unprofessional, blah, blah, blah.” 

Ok, whatever. I’m very used to him being over-the-top concerned about his professional image. I hang out with the kids and it’s fine until we all end up super sick with colds. Like no voice, can’t breathe. The kids get over it in a day. I stay sick. I’m STILL sick. I still take them on an entire day tour by myself for 12 hours because I don’t want them to miss a thing since this resort is in an area they haven’t been to. I take them to the pool, I take them to the beach. We conk out every night by 7 because we’re so exhausted and, in my case, sick. Then yesterday, I woke up too sick to get out of bed. No voice, sore throat, migraine and severe head congestion. I had to stay in the room with the kids on their tablets all day while they begged every 2 seconds to go to the beach, the pool, anything. But my body had just given up. Long flight, long days, single parenting. Doesn’t matter how nice the surroundings were, my body was done. It also coincided with the last day of the conference. I saw my husband for all of 30 mins. He told me I looked and sounded awful and he was so sorry. I asked if he’d drive me to the store to get medicine. He said he didn’t have time. I had to order it from DoorDash. It came and I felt well enough to get ready and take the boys to dinner at the hotel restaurant since they’d been cooped up all day. Sent husband a pic of son’s sushi, and he came and said hi for 2 mins, commented that I looked pretty and left. The kids and I finished up and went back to the room to crash. I woke up several hours later and noticed my husband wasn’t back. I checked the time on my phone and it was after 1 am! I called him and he answered saying he was just walking back to the room. He was “networking in the lobby bar with a client he’s trying to complete a deal with.” And “Why am I so upset? He’s here to WORK.” That’s when I lost it. He goes to these conferences, has the time of his freaking life eating fancy dinners and doing private fancy tours and ATV, goes to catered receptions at night, then closes down bars with his “clients” because he’s “networking.” Not one check in text with his sick wife who couldn’t even get out of bed until 7 pm when she got the medicine she had to DOORDASH, because answering work emails was more important to him. Regardless, he saw no issue with drinking until the lobby bar shut down at 1 am, and justified it as “work”. 

This isn’t the first, last, or hundredth time there’s been an incident like this either. This is just the time that it’s been so blatantly obvious that I can’t really ignore it anymore. He will always prioritize himself and his career over our family and I will always have to prioritize our family for the both of us. But my epiphany is that I don’t have to prioritize HIM anymore. 
Is that asshole-ish? 

I’m in a place at this point where, to me, it’s not enough for a divorce. My kids love their dad and he is a great dad when he’s actually around. He also superficially takes care of my needs better than I think a lot of other spouses do. But I’ve never been anyone’s “important person” or priority and it’s the thing I’ve always wanted most. I grew up having to be strong and stand up for myself, but I wish so bad that I could put that responsibility down and let someone else handle it for a change. And I feel like I keep giving him opportunities to do that and stupidly expecting him to do it because he’s my husband. But he doesn’t unless it’s convenient for him and works with his own priorities to himself and his job. 

Is it okay if I give up on that expectation and stop letting him in so I stop getting hurt? Like no more couples trips, no dates, no watching the same show at night. No more intimacy, physical or emotional. Nothing that could build back up our relationship and bond just for me to let him in and get hurt and disappointed again. He’s a salesman in everything, so when he does those things to build our bond it’s always to benefit himself. 

I know it will cause a lot of emotional distance and will damage our marriage even more, but we’ve been to marriage counseling three times and it’s been brought up every single time and he always acts apologetic and gets better for a month or two and then we’re back here again. 
I feel like a shrew all the time trying to force him to spend time with us, to let work go for a minute. Or even to just proudly show us off instead of hiding us, and him making it seem unprofessional or like people won’t take him seriously because he has a family and he outs them first. Shouldn’t that actually be more commendable?! I feel like Stuart from SNL, begging for attention like “Look at me! Look what I can do!” It’s so exhausting and I’m so tired. 

I’m sick of being what is essentially his secret family on the side to his marriage with himself and his company. Like a booty call when he has time. For my own mental health, I need to stop prioritizing him constantly at my own detriment. I need to become my own person. I plan to start taking steps to have my own career when we get back. I’ve looked at some options. I’m cancelling the activities we had planned as a couple for the remainder of the trip. I booked them anyways, because heaven forbid he make the effort for one on one time that isn’t physical. And I’m getting my very first tattoo. It’s going to be small script and say “When you rely on someone to feed you, you give them the ability to starve you.” I need the reminder on my body constantly. To stay strong. To only rely on myself. 

Is this unfair or too harsh? Is there a better way to handle this? 

I can’t divorce him while the kids are still living at home. As their mom, I KNOW it wouldn’t be the best thing for them in this situation and Reddit will have to trust me on that. It would also be a waste because after my childhood, this marriage, and everyone I know’s relationships, I’m pretty convinced I’m too emotionally needy for the kind of relationship I want. Book boyfriends are unrealistic. I will NEVER get married again or open myself up emotionally to someone. Enough is truly enough. I actually desperately want the freedom of only relying on myself for my own happiness. 

Is there even another path to this situation besides that honestly? I’m not open to being vulnerable anymore. I just simply can’t be. I would love some advice on how to handle this. I don’t need or want a moral judgment. I would love to know if this has been anyone else’s experience and what they’ve done or even if you’ve been on the other side? I am a huge proponent of trying your best to look at both sides when making decisions.

ANSWER: Baby steps: make yourself a priority, care for yourself physically and mentally, learn to set boundaries and standing by them(“i wont be joining this trip because i dont feel like traveling, feel free to do whatever you want”, or “i have decided i dont want to go on a date, i will instead meet with a friend for drinks”) and also “No.” Start learning how to accept how little control you have over what he does, and focus on what you can control: your health (eat healthy, make exercise your non negotiable), stay in the uncomfortable feeling of not caring about how others feel about your choices and accept it, make “i deserve better” or “i dont deserve this” a daily mantra. You need to do this constantly and consistently to create a new habbit, to exercise this new muscle. Little by little you will feel it, then you will show it, it will be in your eyes and ppl will notice. It’s a process and it needs to come from a place or peace not anger. Radical acceptance that you’re hurting, accept he is not your person, accept that You are your person and also accept that he failed as a partner but could work out as a friend. Look at him and say this is my friend we raising kids together and share a house. Baby steps. Claim your life.

QUESTION: My mom walked in on me (F18) and now I am not allowed to see my best friend (F19) . How do I explain?

Repost because it got removed before so i rephrased the sex parts.

Sooo this is quite awkward, but I would like some help/ideas on how to approach this.

My mom is really “conservative” and I grew up in a strict household.

This last weekend I thought I was home alone and put headphones on to watch adult content. I guess my mom came back home and I didn’t notice because she walked in on me and saw.

I think that was the most embarrassing situation I have ever been in. She didn’t just walk back out but angrily grabbed my laptop to see what I was watching and it was wlw videos. She yelled at me, asked me why i am watching this and blah blah blah blah. I think you can imagine.

What happened now is that my mom told me to stop seeing my best friend. My best friend and I hang out a lot. We see each other several times a week and also like to have sleepovers. My mom told me to stop all of that. She said my friend is only allowed to come over to my place if necessary while she is home and wants me to leave the door open.

It’s annoying. She thinks I’m into girls now, which I am not.

I don’t know how to deal with that situation. I don’t want to tell my friend “hey, funny story - my mom caught me watching lesbian porn and now she is scared of us sleeping with each other, so we can’t hang out”. It’s embarrassing.

I told my mom that I don’t like girls, but she doesn’t believe me. I still live with her and am not planning to move out anytime soon which makes all of it difficult to deal with.

ANSWER: You'll be on your own soon.  Do what most teens do. Hide your porn better and see your friend outside the home.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How to let go of a relationship isn't serving you?  My (31F) boyfriend (32M) won't get it together.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for five years. Currently, his TPS status got cancelled and now we're faced with the choice to get married or risk him being removed from the US. Getting married would be the best move however, we are not financially ready to join our lives together. I'm doing well money wise and has always worked throughout our relationship. He has refused to get a job that would require him to work under someone else. He has hustled and strived to be an entrepreneur (with no success) and is now taking interior painting gigs to keep him afloat. In the beginning of our relationship his painting gigs were more consistent, and I was ok with that because he was making a living for himself. Now the gigs are slow.  Per him working a regular job would make him miserable. Every time I would suggest for him to apply to jobs until his business takes off, he gets angry and accuse me of not believing in him. We are pressed for time, and I can't enter a marriage with money troubles. I'm also bothered at the fact that he may be taking this marriage possibility serious now that he might leave. I stayed in this relationship because I had hope that he would see the light and make the right moves for us.  I love this person very much. I know this is going to hurt immensely.  need advice on how to grieve the end of this relationship.

ANSWER: I can't marry you because it compromises my financial security. I care for you a lot, but what our joint financial future looks like scares me. I'm sorry but we need to break up.

After that, then you just see where shit goes. Don't relent. Don't leave them hope for reconciliation down the line. Get them their stuff back ASAP.

Sucks, but this is how all break-ups play out. If you feel it wouldn't be safe to do this with them alone, do it in a public place: park/coffee shop/etc.

Get your keys back and change your lock. Never know when someone will make a duplicate.

================================================================================

QUESTION: UPDATE: My (24F) sister-in-law exploded on me (24F) again over the wedding photos + long-term history of disrespect and trauma (very long) How do I move forward?

Hi everyone. This is an update to my original post about photographing my sister’s last-minute Vegas wedding. A lot has happened since then, and I realized there was much more backstory and context that I didn’t originally include.

First, I want to clarify that the person who has been causing all the major issues is not my sister, but my sister-in-law, my sister’s now-wife. She was the fiancée in my original post. My sister has her moments and plays a role, but the verbal abuse, conflict, and disrespect almost always come directly from her wife.

When I posted last, the wedding was still upcoming. I did end up going to Vegas, and I brought my boyfriend along. We honestly had a great time together, that part of the trip was actually wonderful. But the wedding itself was extremely thrown together. They gave me barely any notice, never communicated what photos they wanted, never gave me a timeline, and didn’t even tell me when or where anyone would be getting ready. There was absolutely no plan at all. It wasn’t a situation where I was supposed to know the timeline, there literally wasn’t one.

We also weren’t anywhere near each other while getting ready. Anyone familiar with the Venetian in Las Vegas knows how massive it is. I was staying on the Palazzo side, and my sister-in-law was staying in the Venetian tower on the opposite end of the property. She never texted me or asked me to come take “getting ready” photos. There was no communication. Now she’s furious that I didn’t somehow show up automatically. She’s acting like it was common sense for me to wander a giant hotel hoping I’d magically know to come in to her room at the right time.

After the wedding, I sent her a sneak peek of about 60 edited photos a week later, because she requested them right away. When I sent them, she made me screen-share the entire gallery for almost two hours while she nitpicked every photo and told me exactly which ones she wanted edited “immediately.” I did it just to keep the peace.

Today at around 9 a.m., out of nowhere, she called me and completely erupted. She told me I “need to give her all the photos right now,” accused me of “pretending to be a professional,” and called me a “cunt” repeatedly. She said talking to me is “like talking to a wall,” then hung up on me. There was no discussion, just straight verbal abuse.

For context, I charged her $300 for the wedding, even though my normal wedding rate is $1,500 or more. There was no contract, no timeline, no deadlines discussed. She knows I am overloaded with school, an internship, my photography business, and my living situation. And she also knows I am barely holding on academically, I am close to failing classes, and I absolutely need to graduate in the spring because I don’t have health insurance. My priorities right now genuinely need to be my schoolwork. Despite all of that, she expects her photos to come before everything else.

Unfortunately, this kind of explosion from her isn’t new. A few weeks after we got back from Vegas, we all went out for Halloween. Both of us were running behind because of separate family events earlier in the evening. On the way to her house, I accidentally got bronzer on my white tights while doing makeup in the car. When I got there, I asked if I could use a makeup wipe, and she told me to wait while she looked for micellar water. She then disappeared outside for nearly an hour to smoke weed. The makeup wipes were sitting on the bathroom counter, and she owns hundreds of them. so since we were getting ready to leave and she never came back, I used one single wipe to get the stain off.

Later, in casual conversation, I mentioned how well it worked. She immediately flew into a rage, demanding to know why I “touched her stuff without asking,” calling me a “bitch,” and accusing me of violating her boundaries over one makeup wipe. I apologized and offered to buy more wipes, but she wouldn’t stop. I made an offhand joke that I sounded like my younger sister for a second, and she snapped back, “No, you sound like your mother.”

And that one cut so deeply I still feel sick thinking about it. My mother abused me and my sisters, was addicted to drugs, and I haven’t spoken to her in almost eight years. She knows all of this. She knows the trauma. There is no world where that comment was anything but deliberately cruel. I immediately went silent and locked myself in the bathroom until I could calm down. She has never apologized.

This wasn’t the first time she’s used extremely personal, painful things as ammunition. And part of why everything she does hits so hard is because of something that happened earlier this year that I haven’t fully explained until now.

Back in March, I was about to move into an apartment I had signed a lease for, before I realized it was in a dangerous neighborhood. Broken windows, bad street activity, the works. The very next day, I found a house listed in my dream neighborhood. A small two-bedroom home for $900 a month, absolutely unheard of where I live. I viewed it, the landlord loved me, and he picked me out of other applicants.

But I panicked because I thought I couldn’t break my lease. I didn’t know that was an option. So I immediately and stupidly called my sister-in-law and offered the house to them instead. They weren’t even looking to move, they still had months left on their lease, and I had to convince them to even consider it. Within an hour of hanging up, I realized I had made a huge mistake. I was crying, panicking, realizing this was the one place I could afford and my only shot at living alone. I begged them for days. I was sobbing and pleading on the phone, explaining that I would have nowhere to go when my current place ended in two weeks.

They ignored all of that and took the house anyway.

They make over $100k a year combined. They could afford dozens of other options. I make a fraction of that. This was the only house I could afford in that neighborhood. I did eventually break my original lease, but it didn’t matter, the house was gone. They signed it and moved into it while I moved into a tiny bedroom at my grandma’s house with a toddler she fosters. Every time I go to their house, I’m reminded it should have been mine. And to make it sting worse, they use the second bedroom, the room that would have been my office, as a weed-smoking storage room. They never acknowledged how badly they hurt me. Not once.

All of that has been sitting in the background of every interaction I have with them. So when my sister-in-law calls me names, insults my work, mocks my trauma, or explodes over something trivial, it isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s happening on top of the most painful housing experience of my life, my financial struggles, my academic stress, and my general mental health issues. I have so little family as it is, my grandma, my dad, and my two sisters, so losing the relationship with my sister feels terrifying, but being treated like this is becoming unbearable.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like my sister-in-law has zero respect for me at all. I feel like everything I do is in service to their convenience, not out of genuine care. And now even the wedding photos, something I did out of love and for a fraction of my normal rate, have become another way for her to belittle and control me. I’m exhausted mentally, emotionally, and physically. I don’t know if I should finish the photos and go low-contact, confront her, talk to my sister privately, or just step away entirely.

I don’t want to blow up my family, but I also don’t want to keep being the punching bag for someone who seems committed to hurting me.

TL;DR:
– My sister-in-law has repeatedly verbally abused me, including calling me a bitch and cunt and comparing me to my abusive mother.
– She stole the only affordable house I ever found, even after I begged and sobbed for it for days because I had nowhere to go.
– She nitpicked my wedding photography, demanded immediate edits, and then exploded and cursed me out this morning.
– I charged $300 for a wedding I normally charge $1,500+ for, with no timeline and no contract.
– I’m overwhelmed with school, work, an internship, and my living situation, and I don’t know how to move forward with this relationship without losing my sanity.

ANSWER: you need to respect yourself and cut ties with these people. learn from your past mistakes being overly generous expecting any kind of kindness in return. Tell her you'll send the photos when she sends the 300 dollars over. then, send the pictures, unedited, and block her. she doesn't deserve anything more from you. nta

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (29F) want to break up but bf (30M) is threatening suicide and showed he might do it for real. Any advice?

Im a 29 F and my bf is a 30 M. We've been together for 7 years and in that time I've struggled a lot in our relationship. I never felt wanted. He never wanted pictures of us taken together, even if they weren't going on social media. He'd ask why I need the memories and cant just think back on them instead when I would try to plead my case. He kept our relationship status online hidden with privacy settings, even blocked me from his fb at one point. Wouldn't go on dates with me. Basically treated me like a roommate. Then 5 years in, I find out he had been cheating on me for 4 of those years with various girls and one was actually a friend at the time. When I confronted him, he said it wasnt true (even though I even watched a video on his phone of the girl doing her thing on top of him and checked the date and time stamps). And he basically gaslit me into feeling like I was crazy for being upset over it. Even his friends and his mom called me stupid for getting upset over it which fucked up my head even more. Then I got pregnant with his child and when he found out, he said "idc what you do with the kid once its born, but I wont be there". I sadly had a miscarriage, and afterwards he wanted to stay together. I was so depressed and unwell in the head that I actually allowed him too. Eventually i came to my senses, I got an apartment without him knowing so I had cushion when I broke up with him. But he started threatening to kill himself right off the bat, and told me he would if I even took one of my cats to the apartment. Theyre both microchipped to me btw, I raised them from 5 weeks old. And I didnt want to lose my cats or have him hurt himself, and he laid his head in my lap hugging my legs full blown sobbing and I didnt know what to do so I broke down and said we can work on things but I was keeping the apartment. After that year was up, things seemed a little better and I moved back in. Its been a year and I haven't felt happy honestly. Then a few months ago my brothers baby got taken by state and he was asking me about taking kinship/guardianship over his son until he gets things sorted out. I agreed. When I told my bf the situation, he told me he doesnt want kids in the house. That he doesn't want CYS showing up. He doesnt want to lose his peace and his freedom. When I asked if id need to get a place of my own, he agreed. So I did just that. Now my bf is flipping the script saying he wants kids in the house, he wants to start a family with me and get married (which hes turned me down regarding both for years saying he didnt want it). He tells me he misses me 20+ times a day, tells me im beautiful, is trying to take pictures together, plan dates, made the relationship status shown on fb, and all this stuff I basically begged for over the years. But in between all of that, hes been talking about how hes going to kill himself if he did lose me. How unfulfilled he is without me. How he cant enjoy anything without me. The day I took my cats to the new apartment, I went back to his house to talk like he requested and hes damn near passed out at the table from mixing percs and whiskey. He was coherent enough to beg me not to call anyone and then kept mumbling "what did I do" "why do you hurt me" over and over. I didnt know what  to do and got terrified hes actually going to kill himself. He even started saying (once sober) that he was going to rehome his animals and sell his stuff. I know im not responsible for him or his actions. But I have always loved him even if I dont want to be in the relationship. And if he did do something, the guilt would eat me alive. But I dont want to stay and stuff away my own potential happiness either. I dont know how to handle this. Im deeply empathetic and he knows that which I feel is why hes pulling the cards on me that he is. I feel like I have one foot out the door but the other is shackled so tight to him. Ive even started having my own suicidal thoughts and that scares the fuck out me because I dont want to die. I just want to feel like I can breathe again.


Edit:
I want to thank each of you who responded, all of you are so awesome. Thank you so much. With how ive been treated and gaslit, I get stuck thinking im the crazy one. Part of why ive dealt with so much crap I shouldn't have been around for. I don't have much of a support system to turn to when these things happen, really just my brother. And he made a good point when I brought this up to him. He said my bf wants physical intimacy elsewhere, but keeps me around because of the emotional intimacy I provide. That made more sense than anything. As for calling the cops, both times he threatened anything, I thought about it but was already dealing with so much in the moment, I wasn't sure if they'd take me seriously or make things worse in some way. But each one of you is right, I just need to do it. Call the cops and gtfo. I think I just needed to hear it from actual people and not just Google or ChatGPT. Thank you all so much, I really mean that!! ❤️

ANSWER: Call the police to do a wellness check- if he is serious, he’ll get the help he needs. However; if he gets angry at you for phoning them, that’s just proof he’s weaponising his mental health to manipulate you. 

Put yourself first- you deserve happiness.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (32M) girlfriend (35F) said she's unlucky to have me.

Hi guys! I just want to know your thoughts about this.

My girlfriend and I have been together for almost a decade. We met in law school but havent passed the bar yet. Most of our law school friends are already married and have families. We always say that we should achieve our goals first before getting married and starting a family. 

My girlfriend's family is rich and I'm from an average household. My girlfriend and I have a mobile bar business. The income is just enough for day to day expenses.

When we talk about our friends, she tells me stories about how some of her girl friends have a slow life (not working coz of rich husband), about them having their own house, or buying whatever luxury brand accessories they like. 

Last night she paid her tuition fee for the bar review center. She keeps telling me that I should've paid for it and that I must already have a provider mindset. I was shocked when she suddenly said that she was unlucky to have me. I told her that what she said hurt me. She said that it was just a joke and didnt mean to say it. Even as a joke, it still hurts hearing from the one you love say that she's unlucky to have you. I left and went to bed. 

I feel unappreciated and a loser. I keep thinking that I might not be able to provide a good life for her. She's a good person but this really hurt me bad. I keep wondering if she is feeling any regret that she chose to have a relationship with me. That maybe there's a little thought in her mind that she doesnt want me anymore. 


What would you guys feel if your partner suddenly said they're unlucky to have you? What will you do after?


EDIT: To clarify, we spent 5 years in law school then pandemic happened. We took the bar once and failed. Afterwards we both worked. Now we just own a business. We're also currently reviewing for the bar to try again.

ANSWER: It wasn't a joke. It was the truth she accidentally said out loud. People use it's a joke as an emergency exit when they say something cruel and see the hurt it caused. She meant it in that moment.

QUESTION: F/31 caught bf M/31 cheating doing group sex with his friends after 1 year. Mentally how to calm myself down?

So the caption pretty much described what happened.
Our Intimacy was actually very crazy and good.
I just cannot accept how he could do threesome with his childhood friends, like that is a boundary I would never cross with my friends.
And I was always a chill girlfriend, like I told him I have been cheated on before so this time if you start liking someone else you can confess and we will end the relationship.
But he still cheated not with one but with two.
If anyone has been in a similar situation, please tell me how to calm myself mentally.
I have a very high self respect and I am disgusted that a situation like this happened to me.

Edit: by after 1 year I mean the total relationship length
I caught him 3 days back and  I broke up instantly blocked on socials etc but he is so selfish that he didn’t even call me once after being confronted

Edit2: thanks a lot everyone I feel a lot better
I didn’t expect so much support with the way situationships, cheating etc are normalised in my country it feels good to know there are people who understood what I was feeling

ANSWER: He cheated. Full stop. Trust is gone, respect is gone, and the fact it was a threesome only makes it worse for you. He shared a rare intensely intimate moment with 2 other women and you weren't involved. I can't see you coming back from that.

================================================================================

QUESTION: UPDATE: I [30F] don't know if I have a bad marriage or not. Friends and family say they haven't liked my husband [33M] for a long time.

TL;DR from the first post:
Husband and I got married quickly, despite my unresolved feelings for a former situationship, and we agreed to an open marriage early on. The arrangement worked for a while, but my depression and his sneaky behavior caused issues. He supported me through my mental health struggles and now financially supports our lives, taking on the stress of a demanding career and manages our assets. After our child was born, his temper is more visible, and I encouraged his "me time" to unwind. Recently discovered he had been sexting and dating other women, which hurts deeply but feels hard to judge given our history. Now I'm feeling unappreciated and emotionally exhausted, even though he remains present and loving in his own way. I don't know how to communicate my needs to him. I also want to explain his needs to my family and friends so they don't hate him.

---------

Clearly, the answer was yes, it's a bad marriage.

It's been a bit, and the disappointing choice I made was to stay. I don't want to stay, but I don't know how to leave at this point. I know he's not been a good husband for a while, and only recently started to pick up as a father, but I'm so overwhelmingly terrified of leaving. It's been 10 years, and our lives are so tangled together that it feels impossible to separate, and I'm scared of what might break and tear in the process, like our son.

He made real improvements for a couple of months, and I was really hopeful we could get back to what we used to be. He spent more time with us, let me get out of the house, and it felt like he was generally calmer and trying to control his reactions more.That started to slow down, and the last few weeks have felt similar to before I found out about the cyber cheating.

I want to make it very clear I still don't believe he's a bad person. I think he is actually a very good and loyal friend to have. But I don't think he's a good partner to me. He's short with me when he's stressed, and he's stressed all the time. It's for the same reasons that won't go away any time soon. His job is super stressful (he's an attorney, so this is true), finances are tight (this is true, too, because everything is so expensive now), and he has a lot on his plate project wise for our home (he started building a new room for our son and needs to install a new water heater he got. It's for the future of our home cost). I get that these are all completely valid stressors, but it's also just what our life is. I don't have it in me excuse his treatment of me as an emotional punching bag and let him be way more mean to me than anyone else, saying "It's just him willing to be comfortable and uninhibited with me". Why does the uninhibited him have to be an ass??

I don't think I've been able to try as hard as I did when I thought he was being faithful. I don't go the extra mile to try and make things as good as possible at home. I really do so deeply appreciate everything he does. But, I already did that and he still cheated. I'm still grateful for all he handles, but I'm more passive and nod and do what I need to for us to stay on moderate terms. It really clicked recently when I was HOPING he was cheating again to give me an out. He's been building the room, we have travel plans set up for the holidays, and he's planning more things for the future, and I want to tell him to stop because that's going to trap me for that much longer, and I'm tired. It feels like my presence annoys him if I'm not doing something "productive", but it hasn't bothered me as much as it did.

I've been back to weekly therapy and have a steady medication plan for the first time in six years. Funny how that goes with the fact that for the first time in six years, I started to consider it probably isn't me that's the problem. I can see the picture that if it was any of my friends, I would agree it's a bad situation and tell them to separate. I'm self aware of my mental illnesses and the effect they have on how I think or react to situations, and it's unfortunate because I'm not doing much to change that reaction. It's like if it's raining outside, you can see it and know there's a blue sky beyond the clouds, but that's not going to do shit and it'll keep raining until it's not. I'm working on grabbing the metaphorical umbrella. If I can't stop the rain, I can at least keep myself from getting soaked by it. I'm still worried I'm some awful, manipulative person that twists scenarios to make myself look better, but usually narcissistic people don't worry about being a narcissist. Even with everything in this post, I feel so guilty for talking about him badly. That I should feel shitty for putting our drama onto the internet and painting him as this horrible villain that I know he isn't. But I still made the post.

I think I'm mostly writing all of this to try and work through it myself. Putting the abstract thoughts into words to understand them a bit, and maybe find some reassurance or a good kick in the ass in the process. When is there ever a "good" or "better" time to tell him that I don't want to be his wife anymore? How do I even begin to talk to him about all of this in a way that won't devolve into my being "wrong"? How do I navigate ending a 10 year relationship with a child and lots of debt in the mix?

ANSWER: Wait wait wait. He "lets you get out of the house"? Is he restricting your movement? If yes, that changes the entire context to severe abuse and you need to get out. Fast. 

It's probably not a coincidence that you're starting to see the patterns when you decided to go to therapy and have meds. I mean, that's literally part of the goal. ​You're improving. That includes starting to outgrow this marriage. 

Every time to tell your husband probably is a bad time. Do sort out a place to stay beforehand though. And you'll need to have an income of some sort. Figure that out. 

You will be called "wrong". Accept and embrace that. He can have his own perspective of things. That does not mean you need to share it. That also does not mean, you need to twist yourself to be perceived "right". It's okay to not please everybody. 

You keep things away from your kid as good as possible and talk to the bank (and probably a lawyer) about how to sort out finances.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (28F) boyfriend (34M) just told me after 6 years that he never wants kids.

The title says it all. After trying to figure out why intimacy has all but completely disappeared from our relationship, he finally said it. We’ve been together 6.5 years and moved in together in 2020. We’ve been talking about getting engaged, but I could feel he’s been progressively getting more and more distant and recently all but avoids the topic completely. 
In the beginning, we talked about kids and our future all the time. We daydreamed about where we’d raise our kids and what values we’d like to instill in them. What things we learned from our parents that we were /were not going to bring into our children’s future. I’m not really sure when that stopped. 
He was so upset that I (in his words) “am pressuring him to have this conversation” and maybe I did. Once he said it out loud it was like my heart and my brain were turned off. I was so stunned. 
I’m so heartbroken. Everyone keeps saying how lucky I am that kids are not involved,  but I can’t help but feel like my entire world is fallling through my fingers. I don’t have a lot of family and it would truly devastate me in so many different ways if this were the end. 
I don’t think there’s any compromise- is there? Any hope of resolving this without having to choose between him and my future kids?

ANSWER: You do have to choose between him and your future kids. You can't compromise on children. I don't think your boyfriend ever planned to have children with you. Seems like he told you what you wanted to hear until he realized there was no getting out of it. It's time to move on from this relationship and find someone else who wants to have kids with you once you've mourned this relationship.

QUESTION: Me [27F] Ran Into My Nail Tech’s [28F] Boyfriend [27M] And Realized We Matched on Hinge Two Weeks Ago

I’ve been going to my nail tech for about a year now, and today something happened that I genuinely was not prepared for.

When I arrived for my appointment, I ran into a guy outside her building. I literally bumped into him, apologized, and kept moving but he looked at me like he had seen a ghost. It stuck with me because it was such a strange reaction for a simple accidental bump.

I went upstairs, sat down, and the first thing my nail tech asked was, “Did my boyfriend let you in?” I told her I didn’t see anyone downstairs, and I also mentioned that I didn’t even know what her boyfriend looked like. She described him… and it was exactly the man I just bumped into.

Here’s where everything clicked in the most uncomfortable way:

Two weeks ago before I even knew what her boyfriend looked like he and I matched on Hinge. We had a short conversation where he told me he was looking for something “short-term,” which made me unmatch him immediately. We still follow each other on Instagram, though.

Out of curiosity, I checked his Instagram today. She follows both his business pages, but he doesn’t follow her back on any of them. And now I’m realizing her boyfriend of a year and a half was on Hinge two weeks ago telling strangers (me included) that he wanted something casual…and then practically panicked when he saw me today.

It was one of those moments where everything lines up a little too perfectly, and not in a good way.

I honestly didn’t expect to walk into a nail appointment and walk out with this on my mind.

ANSWER: Just tell her that somebody is using her boyfriend’s pictures on hinge. You get complete deniability if she reacts badly (“are you saying my boyfriend is..!” “Nope I am not”) and she is free to connect the dots, if that’s something she is emotionally open to. 

As a bonus, if she feels awkward about you afterwards, she has the perfect out for whatever explanation she wants to give.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I [f29] handle my bf [m26] ruining my birthday?

To;dr: the day before my birthday my bf thought I was cheating on him and didn’t buy me a gift. The day of my birthday we got in an argument and he guilted me in to dinner the following day. Then during the dinner we argued about my budget. And he still hasn’t gotten me a card (what I really wanted because I am sentimental af). 

Long version:

I hate my birthday just as a general rule. It always falls during a rough time because everyone is either going or coming back from fall break, and when in school if that wasn’t the case midterms were also a thing. So I just rarely celebrate it. 

Enter my boyfriend who in the first year made it his mission to change that. His family threw me a party and I never have felt more celebrated than when I was a little child. It was amazing and they set the bar high for what birthdays should be. 

The filling birthday, he straight up forgot about  it though. Like no card no gift, not even ordering take out and he just said happy birthday to me and that was it. I was heart broken. We had just moved cities and I was feeling more alone than I probably should have. He vowed to never do that again because he saw my hurt. 

This year we another horrid birthday in my opinion. In September he told me that he was ordering my gift and he wanted to make sure I had a great birthday. Because if this I allowed my expectations to be set and to have a little hope. Turns out that he didn’t order my gift because he was worried it wouldn’t come in in time. 

So the night before he runs out to the store. But he recently had surgery and tripped over a bench and came home in pain. I was t even thinking about my gift at that point. I just hoped he didn’t undo what was done during his surgery. That’s when he breaks down crying, saying that he thought I was cheating on him and that’s why he tripped. I was speechless and still am when I think about it. 

So I pushed it down and told him that we will spend my birthday relaxing instead so he can heal from tripping. He wants to do dinner but I couldn’t handle having him be in pain and having to hear about. Or even worse there’s been times that we try to go out but if the chair isn’t right (pr he doesn’t get the comfier spot) he will end the date early because he’s in so much pain. So that’s why I said no to the dinner on my birthday. 

But he guilted me in to going the following day. So we did. And he proceeded to talk about my budget and offer his un solicited opinions about it. I told him many time that I am happy with my budget, that is it getting me through the periods where I done have income coming in and still allowing ent o go for coffee or participate in my hobbies. He thinks I should just take the five years and do nothing and pay down my student debt. I keep telling him I have found a balance that allows me to pay it down faster than average but still lets me live a tiny bit. 

Regardless throughout all of this he didn’t get me a gift. Or a card which is really what I want. I think cards are the sweetest, especially when they write a little note! But nothing. And now I just feel like poop about it because he did take me to a nice restaurant but it still feels like it was a horrible birthday. Maybe I’m reading in to it too much though.

ANSWER: Answer: you move on from him. If your boyfriend can’t bring joy in your life, he shouldn’t be in it.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My 25F girlfriend is not sexually attracted to me 24M anymore and wants me to see other women

My gf told me last night that she met this weekend a guy and she felt attracted to him. She followed up with saying that nothing happened and she didn't want anything to happen because she loves me.

It's been 2 months we've struggled sexually, we might have had a rapport twice in 2 months. She admitted that she doesn't feel sexually attracted to me anymore.

We had a discussion about her needs, she doesn't think about sex pretty much ever. Except when she's worried/sad I will try to have sex with her. Her ex used to force her to have sex and she's glad I dont... Last weekend was the first in a while she felt something sexual.

Honestly this make sense with the rest of her personality. She always chase new things and get bored really quickly in jobs, tv shows or hobbies.

She looked very dissociated so I thought she wanted to end things. Told me she doesn't know what is loves and if that's what she feels. She had a rough upbringing with her father being a psychopatic weirdo and her mother dying while she was young.

I asked her if she settled too quick and wanted to see other people. She said maybe but she knows she won't be happy in the long-term and want to stay with me.

The she said I should see other girls for my sexual desires but with a bunch of rules like I never show them to her, I always tell her when I do see other girls and it's people I and her dont know. I asked her if she wants to do the same and she said she think she doesnt wants to look for other guys.

I don't know what to think, I agree that the current situation is not sustainable but we are so compatible in everything except the sex. I'm willing to try stuff for our relationship but I can't stop feeling like that's just gonna make our couple explode.

Has anyone had a similar situation ? And can it be fixed this way or is it doomed ?

ANSWER: You guys are young, and clearly not compatible. Don't drag it out any longer, just break up and you’ll find someone that doesn’t want to share you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I, 33F became disabled and my marriage to 35M has also became disabled… wyd?

So it’s exactly what the title says. I became disabled after having COVID and slowly but surely my husband has disconnected from me. We married young, and have a lot of ups and downs, but definitely more ups after a decade of marriage. All this to be said, I don’t think he can handle me being ill and is trying to help me by not placing expectations on me, but it ends up hurting me and making me feel like he’s treating me like I’m glass. I’ve lost a say in almost everything in my life, and he says he watches me to find out what kind of day I’m having, makes a snap decision, and after that there’s no dates, no sex, no assurance, no nothing. I also know men are visual and I’m unable to doll myself up much anymore either because I can’t physically do it. He says it’s all fine. Emotionally I’ve felt abandoned for months, as he turned to other people for a distraction (not cheating). I need another perspective because I’m drained and I miss him, a lot. He’s scared I know, but I haven’t died and am not planning on it but the stress alone is not helpful. Any advice?

ANSWER: It’s a tough one to give specific advice on. But in general:

It sounds like your disability is really significant and your husband is shellshocked. Scared of you dying, or scared of taking care of you forever? You would have to ask him, and you should do.

Have you tried to raise this with him? What was his response?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My girlfriend (24F) asked me (25M) to put my name on buying her parents’ apartment during their divorce, and I feel guilty about saying no

(Just to preface, we have been together 3 years going on 4) My girlfriend lives with her mom, and her parents are in the middle of a difficult divorce. The court ordered the apartment to be sold, which has been extremely stressful for my girlfriend. She isn’t working right now because she has a few weeks of college left. I’m working, but I’m not in a long-term career yet and I only make enough to support myself at home. I can’t afford to live alone right now.

After the court ruling, she became overwhelmed and asked if I could put my name on buying the apartment so she and her mom could stay. Their plan was that they would make the payments, and I would just be the person signing for it.

I told her no because it didn’t feel financially safe or realistic for me. Taking on a mortgage for a home I wouldn’t be living in, during an ongoing divorce that I’m not part of, felt like more than I could handle. I’m also known by both sides of this divorce, and I didn’t feel comfortable assuming I’d be completely protected or unaffected. Even when she told me her mom’s lawyer said it would be fine, I still didn’t feel like I had the information or security I needed to agree to something that serious.

She was hurt by my decision and felt like it meant she couldn’t trust me to support her now or in the future. I was understanding because I sensed the panic and fear from her end, but that was hard to hear. I’ve been saving for my own future and hopefully one day a future with her, but I’m not in a position to take on something this big. I don’t want to risk my own financial stability when I’m not prepared for that kind of responsibility.

Her mom relies on her a lot, and I’m worried that this situation might continue long-term. Her mom doesn’t earn enough to support herself alone, and I’m concerned that this could affect our ability to eventually build an independent life together.

I love my girlfriend and want to support her emotionally, but I’m stuck between wanting to help her and needing to protect my own future. I don’t want her to feel alone in this, but I also don’t want to take on something I’m not capable of handling.

My question is:
What are some healthy ways I can support my girlfriend through this situation while also keeping clear boundaries around financial responsibilities I’m not ready for? And how can I navigate my fear that her family situation might affect our ability to build our own independent future?

TL;DR: My girlfriend’s parents are divorcing and the court ordered their apartment to be sold. She asked me to put my name on buying it so she and her mom could stay and they’d make the payments. I said no because I can’t afford it and I’m unsure about the risks. She took it hard, and now I feel guilty and worried about our future.

ANSWER: What an absurd unreasonable ask. She's not in her right mind let alone "taking it hard". This is on her mother not YOU. This is for her parents to figure out. She also needs to not try to solve this for her mother. You can support her by suggesting she not be ghe parent in the situation. Her mother needs to figure out what shes going to do. Also, say you did buy the apartment...she apparently plans on living there forever or supporting her mother. Take no part in that.

QUESTION: I (29F) and (30M) booked a flight to go back home but he doesn’t want me to go am I insane?

I’m new to this, but I feel like I need another option on the situation. My boyfriend and I have been dating for 12 years, and we have two children together. We have lived together for almost 10 years. We have been together since we were teenagers. We have had so many ups and downs over the years, and the biggest one is that he doesn’t provide as a partner for 5 years. He has had bad emotional outbursts, which have hindered my mental health. I have been feeling overwhelmed with my mental health, so my mother booked a flight to go back home to see her and my older sisters. I originally had plans to leave in October, but because I didn’t say anything to my partner, I had to postpone due to him saying he felt uncomfortable with us flying. Come tomorrow, I’m supposed to fly out with our children. He ended up telling me I don’t need to go; I should focus on our financial goal to get a home and give the tickets back to my mom. It was a huge ongoing fight.

My mom and older sisters are utterly excited for me and the kids to go back home to visit . I should also say that they don’t like him; he’s mistreated me all these years, which they aren’t wrong. All these weeks, he’s been upping his game about household chores, getting the kiddos ready, and being more hands-on. Which isn’t his usual; I think he’s trying to manipulate me. Am I insane


Update : I got on the plane

ANSWER: It sounds to me like he's worried your family might convince you not to keep letting him mistreat you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 46M/49F in a 12-year marriage - a small incident feels massive. How do you recognise when a pattern has finally hit its limit?

I’m a 46 year old male, married for 12 years. My wife and I have always had a complicated dynamic in our relationship, and while we've functioned really well in many areas and genuinely care about each other, there’s been a long-standing emotional mismatch.

Here’s the overview.

I’m a fairly independent, calm, reflective, and open person when I feel emotionally safe. I’ve done therapy recently, by myself, for over a year (weekly) and have a reasonably good understanding of my patterns and triggers.

My wife is highly intelligent, very organised, anxious, structured, and tends to micromanage our environment when she’s stressed or overwhelmed. She needs reassurance and verbal affirmation, and she tries hard in her own way, but she struggles to stay open when something uncomfortable or emotional is directed at her. When I express something, she often becomes defensive and says, 'I can’t do anything right' or 'That's not fair.' That makes it difficult for me to share what’s actually going on and triggers me emotionally to shut down.

This cycle has been happening for years and has become very apparent in the last 2 years post my counselling, and I’m realizing how much it’s worn me down.

We've been to see a counsellor jointly on and off over the past 2-3 years also, but I feel like it's been surface level and not getting to the core of the patterns and triggers. My wife, up until a few days ago, has said she doesn't need to do any counselling by herself and would not go back to the previous joint one as I haven't followed through on what we learnt there.

Recently, something small happened and i feel like it's possibly the line in the sand for me. I went for a bike ride and got caught in terrible weather. I never looked at the forecast; it's completely my fault. I phoned her, and she came to pick me up, which I genuinely appreciated. But when I got in the car soaked and freezing, as I never took a jacket, she told me she had to stop at the supermarket for the weekly shop. I asked if we could go home but was met with 'She was tired', 'Didn't have the time', 'I was on her schedule' and a meaningless 'Sorry'. I wanted to get home, dried out, so I ended up riding home from the supermarket, as it was only 20 minutes as opposed to waiting in the car for 40 minutes.

If it was in reverse, I’d have taken her straight home to warm up, and if I didn't, I would have heard about it. That moment made me feel so unimportant.

I let it sit for a couple of days, and then I tried to talk to her calmly about how it made me feel. I didn’t accuse her, I just said I felt hurt and a very low priority. She became defensive almost immediately and defended herself.  
'That’s not what happened.'  
'You didn’t ask me to take you home.'  
'You had heated seats.'  
'I was tired.'  
Then it turned into 'You’re so angry' and 'You don’t even like me.'

I left the conversation as I didn’t want to escalate it and feel horrible.

Now I’m sitting here wondering why this tiny thing has hit me so hard when similar dynamics have been happening for years. Maybe because she defended herself again when I was simply expressing hurt. Maybe because I’m done trying to explain myself gently only to be shut down.

She says she wants more emotional closeness and words of affirmation from me, but when I open up, I get dismissed.

I feel incredibly hurt. What am I not seeing or missing here from her point of view?

ANSWER: I just want to say, because no one else has brought this up, that her behaviour in this incident wasn't a "small" thing, it was cruel. Ridiculously cruel. Imagine how you would feel if you read the same story, but it was a woman sheepishly commenting on the behaviour of her husband and minimizing its impact on her. You might be inclined to see the situation as callous, even abusive, in that light.

You would've done the right thing prioritizing her well-being. It seems like your wife was either knowingly negligent (she fought you on it in the moment!), or actively punishing you (even unconsciously) for the frustration of making her go out of her way for you - in a situation where a good partner would be happy to help. I would never think of blaming my partner for going out without checking the weather, spontaneity is allowed to exist! I think you sound like a patient and caring person who is sensitive and introspective. I don't think this person matches these qualities of yours. Look up "benign narcissism". Idk man, good luck.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 22F with 28M boyfriend, How do i get him to realize that if he doesn’t get a move on with his life, im leaving? and how do i leave, when i still care and love him in a way?

EDIT: i dont have the energy to respond to everyone lol but i broke up with him and blocked him on everything, im sad and i feel bad about it but its the right thing to do

Hi everyone. I need some outside perspective because I’m really torn about my relationship.

I’m 22F and my boyfriend is 28M. We’re long distance and have been together for a little over a year now. I do love him, which makes all of this harder, but the relationship has become so difficult that I don’t know how to continue.

I’m always the one who travels. I just got back yesterday from a trip to see him. I can’t break up with him now, we have spent the last 3 weeks together, but i need to start planning something where i can distance myself from him. I’ve visited about six times, each trip being a 12 hour drive each way, and I still end up paying for half or sometimes all of the travel. During my last visit, I stayed for three weeks and we basically didn’t go outside. We’ve never gone on a single date, even though he knows I’ve never been taken on one before. He also still lives with his parents, and doesn’t seem to have much motivation to move out/ get a job. 

One of the biggest problems, and one that feels embarrassing to admit, is the sexual dynamic. He rushes into sex and constantly wants oral from me, but he won’t reciprocate at all. Like when we are watching a show or playing a game together, we can’t just cuddle. And honestly, it has almost completely killed my attraction because he’s constantly putting himself in my face or pushing for sexual things even when I’m not in that mindset. It makes me feel objectified instead of wanted. I don’t feel desired or respected, especially when he doesn’t do many romantic gestures. It has gotten to the point where I feel turned off instead of close to him.

Communication is also really hard. When he goes through periods of being distant, he casually says things like “sorry I’ve been dry with everyone, don’t take it personal,” but I’m not “everyone,” I’m his girlfriend. And when I try to talk about our future in realistic ways, like both of us getting jobs or licenses so we can move forward in life, he gets defensive or shuts down.

There were times when I tried to break up with him, not because I stopped caring, but because he would get defensive about normal things. One time he got upset that I spent time with my family. (i play video games with him almost every day and phone him while we sleep 9/10 times) Meanwhile he disappears for long periods to watch TV with his dad or hang out with his cousin or play games, when we have plans, and I never make it a fight. Meanwhile I always warned him beforehand if something might interrupt our time, but he doesn’t do the same.

During arguments, I never insult him, but he’s made comments towards me that feel like little jabs. I’ve tried so hard to work through our issues because I didn’t want to repeat the unhealthy patterns I grew up around. I wanted to build something long term with him. But it feels like I’m the one doing all the emotional labor, all the travel, all the planning, all the effort.

The hardest part is that he isn’t a bad person. He has a good heart and he has treated me nicely in many ways. But we don’t seem mentally or emotionally compatible. we don’t think the same way or communicate the same way, and I don’t think he understands how relationships need to grow or change. He’s doing the same thing he’s been doing for a year. He says he’s practicing for his license, but he didn’t once while i was there for 3 weeks.

I’m also scared to break up with him. He doesn’t have many people who he is close to, so it feels like I’d be shunning him or taking away something important from his life. I care about him a lot and part of me feels like I need him around. But another part of me knows I can’t keep living in a relationship that leaves me drained. I haven’t been able to spend much time with my family due to trying to spend as much time as i can with him in our LDR.

I don’t know how to end something that feels emotionally safe in some ways but completely incompatible in others. I don’t know how to leave someone who cares about me and loves me.And I don’t know how to trust my own judgment anymore.

Any advice or perspective would really help. I’m open to questions if more context is needed.

ANSWER: Does he think you are dating? Because it sounds like he thinks this is a friends with benefits situation. He doesn't put forth relationship level effort. He is just accepting what you are graciously offering (travel, sex, hang out time). 


What happens if you don't reach out for 3-4 days? Does he call or message? If not, he just isn't in the same relationship you are. 


Lastly, I would not stay with a selfish sexual partner. Sex is fantastic when both people are enthusiastic about the other person's pleasure.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How can I (32M) tactfully tell my gf (28F) that she needs to freshen up down there before we get intimate

I’ll preface this by saying that my gf is wonderful in almost every aspect and I plan on marrying her one day. We’ve been together 18 months. She is overall a hygienic person aside from what I’ll describe below.

I’m someone who has a really sensitive sense of smell and have an especially strong aversion to bad smells even if they’re light in strength. While I shower every day, my gf often goes a day or two in between showering for what I assume to be a personal preference. The problem for me lies when we try to get intimate and I get a whiff of the natural body odour down there(the armpit smell) and it turns me off instantly. It’s something that hasn’t been a problem for me before (maybe my previous horniness has overridden it) but now it’s keeping me from enjoying the otherwise good sex we’ve had.

I will also add that I do hold myself to the standard that if I’m feeling swamp ass-ish I’ll won’t even consider intimacy until it’s taken care of.

How can I tactfully bring this up to her?

ANSWER: Yeah, I’d just be honest but gentle. Something like, Hey, can we both freshen up first? I get super sensitive to smells and it makes things more fun


Keeps it light without making her feel attacked

My wife and I have been together for 10 years. The last couple of years she’s had a foot out of the door as things got rough between us for a bit and she’s never been able to let it go. She most definitely suffers from avoidant attachment and I think I’m anxious attachment. I found out she was flirting with another guy on Facebook messenger but I caught it quick, like the second day, and I know she was ashamed and said it was because she was hurt… even though all I do is try to have a good relationship with her. But I decided at that point I was going to go stay with my brother and I told her I would not come back until she was all in on us and wanting to do the work. I’ve been trying to give her all the space in the world to think and process. I know this has been hard on her. She’s sad every time I see her to pick up my kids. I know she loves me but she keeps saying that she just remembers the way I made her feel in the past. It’s been 2 weeks now today that I’ve been gone. How long do I wait before I make my next move? I’m still paying for the house my wife and kids are in while I live with my brother and his wife. But I can’t do this forever and my wife does not make enough money to support herself and the kids. She also has toxic people in her corner that are egging her on through all of this and want her to leave. I don’t know what to do. I want the distance to show her what our relationship means to her but I have no idea where’s she at with things, and I don’t think she does either. I wish she just had the money to support herself and the kids so she didn’t possibly think that was the only reason to stay

EDIT: At some point in the past I began suffering from digestive health issues and it really messed me up. I was really emotional at times when things were unwell and I would just be radiating anxiety and toxicity. She said I would mentally abuse her. I have been in therapy for a year now. It is true I did not know how to process my emotions, especially when I felt as physically uncomfortable as I did. I would just be mad at her for not fixing my problems and it was immature. I have changed a lot over the last couple of years. I have grown healthy again, mentally and physically. And I show up for my wife and kids everyday. But she may not be able to forgive me

UPDATE: Also I want to go home ASAP. But she refuses to live with me. I could go home right now but she would freak tf out and it would be a very traumatic experience for everyone

ANSWER: At a minimum, you should be talking with a competent attorney to understand how a divorce would change your life.

QUESTION: Been 21 months since I 35/m found my wife's 35/f emotional affair.

I found out, she didn't come clean. Together since we were 19, so at that point it was 14 years together and 4 married.

 She had been managing a local boutique hotel in our town and was short on staff, so I would bartend for her at times when she needed it. She had picked up some food for us and our kids and was going to drop mine off. Mine had been messed up (thank you random highschool kid) so she asked me to drive back to get fixed while she sat at the hotel. 

Something had been off for a few months, I was working full time and helping her out, so our time together was a short amount of time before bed. Sex life was once every couple weeks to a month. I still don't know why I had the urge to look at her phone that she left in her car, but I did. I found out she had been messaging a man for awhile talking about our issues and a lot of flirting, exchanging pictures, and sexting. I found another 2 conversations with other guys dating even further back to 2017 on her socials. One of them, she had asked the guy to come to her job while she worked overnight.

I was broken. Came back to the hotel, sat the phone down with her messages out on display in front of her and told her I didn't want to talk right then, that I'd work what I told her I would already, but that was it. She left and we argued over text for the next 6 hours. First, it was being pissed that I went through her phone, then she must've realized what I was feeling, because the manipulation started. From saying she was worthless and a P.O.S. to saying she didn't deserve me or our kids. Ending her life had been thrown around quite a bit. When I got home that night it was any better. I hadn't thought of sending messages or taking screenshots before, so when I got home I asked to see everything. She had already deleted it all though. I'd like to say that I walked out then and there but I didn't. I'm ashamed to say that she had pushed and cried until I actually had sex with her that night. I still hate that I did that.

The next day we kinda talked it out. She was insistent on it being emotional and never physical, I some what believed her. I promised to try to work things out if she promised to give me time to work through it. Time was something we didn't have, although neither of us knew it at that point. 

We kind of settled into this rhythm of sorts that first week. I worked both jobs while she worked days and took care of our kids at night. When I got home, she was all over me. We had sex more in that week than most likely the entire previous year. She even seduced me in a few of the empty rooms of the hotel at different times that week. Things slowly tapered back to a more normal every day life we had been living, for 2 months.

2 months of me trying to forgive and forget. 2 months of questionioning my self worth and if I was the reason she did what she did. Then the worst day of my life happened. A massive tornado hit my small town. I lost my family in that storm, we lost our house, and I lost my company I had built with my own 2 hands. 40 seconds and poof, it's all gone. 

I'm not even going to lie, my wife was my rock through all of it. She let me cry night after night over the tragic loss of my family. Held me and told me we'd figure things out when I spiraled about losing my company. We spent the next 18 months pretty much side by side, figuring life out. Cleaned our damage, bought a new house, and spent 6 of those 18 months in an RV while we looked for houses. I can honestly say, I made it out of that time period with less scars than I should have because of her. 

That leads us to now. I started a new career this year and am thriving. Our kids are thriving in the new house. Every thing has fallen into place how it should, except me. 

I spent an entire year in survival mode. Constantly worried about what comes next, what's our next step. After things slowed down, the emotions and feelings started popping into my head. Everything I should've been worried about or considering for my marriage after the affair came to light just burst out. It's almost like it happened recently, it feels fresh and raw, but that's not fair to her, is it?

I guess I'm just trying to figure out how to go about things. I truly do love this woman, my entire adult life has been shaped around us being together. She stood next to me at my lowest and helped bring me back to life after. I want to spend my life with her and she has made a lot of changes to prove herself to me, but I can't help how I feel right now. How do I get is back to where I would like us to be when my own mind won't give it up?

ANSWER: Yes, it is fair to her. She never came clean and never gave you complete honesty and transparency. It is unfair to you that your spouse deleted all the communication and has repeatedly lied to you since. A lie by omission is still a lie.

You still do not know all that happened. You still have no clue exactly what you are supposed to be forgiving. How can anyone truly move forward while being stuck in the wonderland of no knowing the extent of betrayal.

Maybe you did not intend to rug-sweep the affairs since life intervened. You were in survival mode. Losing people is always  an awful thing to experience, no matter the circumstances.

Now that life is stabilizing it is only natural for one to focus on unhealed wound. Your spouse has done nothing to help you heal, help rebuild trust, or done anything at all to help you get past their affairs. This is on them, not on you. They have to start putting in a lot more effort and honesty or the marriage will only continue to spiral. Your resentment will only build. Children do not deserve to have an unhappy, questioning parent. Or to have parents in a relationship with no respect and no trust. 

You need to dig yourself out of this hole of infidelity. With or without your spouse. If they will not do what is needed to help, do it yourself. Put yourself first.

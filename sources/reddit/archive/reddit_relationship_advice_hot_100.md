================================================================================

QUESTION: Think of the comments as inverted Uber ratings. (click to find out what this means)

I last posted a variation of this a little over 5 years ago. We're a little overdue for a repost.

---

You know how every Uber rating is right on the verge of 5 stars unless something's particularly off? Everyone's all "A+++ would ride again." Same for eBay, Amazon, etc.

You can think of /r/relationship_advice comments in much the same way, only inverted. Just about every post here talking about a problem is going to be a magnet for "break up with them" and "get rid of them" comments. Two things to keep front of mind when you're submitting:

1. The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they've got a challenge they probably haven't been able to resolve on their own. 

2. In many cases, these challenges are either insurmountable or exceedingly difficult to manage. 

The majority of commenters aren't necessarily cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened—your account—with each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark, meaning that every post will get drenched in comments suggesting ending the dynamic. 

The number of serious comments suggesting _an alternative to ending things_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to, well, ending things. I'll carry that Uber analogy a bit further:

 Let's say you're asking about behavior that's so bad, the red flag's basically bleeding. Nearly every single comment will tell you to run, and you're having a hard time finding well-reasoned counter-arguments to it. Sounds like running is good advice. Zero stars on our inverted Uber scale; the relationship is cooked.

 Together but your s/o cheated on you once? Most comments will probably tell you to run because "once a cheater, always a cheater." Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. Great; One or Two Stars.

 Married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? Many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that a fair number of people might suggest staying. Awesome; Two, maybe even three stars.

 Good relationship with your S/O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of people suggesting you should just leave, but you can take these with a grain of salt. Three to four stars.

 Everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? There'll be a few trolls who tell you to break up for asking the subreddit for advice, but it sounds like the relationship is four to five stars.

You can apply this to any type of relationship question asked here. Platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic, this still works. You get the idea.

Basically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude because many, many people have had shitty experiences that dominate their memories, so the best way to consider most advice here is to see whether other advice shines through the cosmic negativity background. If everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you'd benefit by giving that 25% a chance.

---

##TL;DR: 

The vast majority of comments will tell you to end things. It's a side effect of the fact that many people reading either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. The more people tell you to consider something _other_ than running, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.

(inspired to repost this thanks to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1dc05p7/had_to_end_my_birthday_party_early_because_a_1/l7vtsis/?context=3) by u/NotAmericanDontCare. Comments open for a little bit because I know some of y'all want to vent about this, but try to be civil about it.)

ANSWER: Also there seems to be an overreliance on arbitrary "rules" like "age gap bad" (obviously some age gaps really are bad but five years in your 20s shouldn't be such a big deal IMO) or "high school sweethearts bad." It's true that sometimes certain things like that can cause problems, but if the post isn't asking about something that is very obviously related to one of these "rules," there shouldn't be so much focus on stuff like "you're dating your high school sweetheart, that's Bad, break up."

================================================================================

QUESTION: Help me (27F) calmly approach my husband (29M) about the mess he left our house in whilst I was watching my dad die

Hi all

I have been back at my parents house for a while being with my dad whilst he died and in the aftermath. 

I came home to the house being gross. I would attach a photo of the kitchen sink to give a glimpse as to what the rest of the house is like but it's not allowed on this sub - but think unclean bedding, days old dog food lodged in the plug hole, clothes everywhere.

How do I approach this calmly when he gets home from work? I'm not sure if it's grief rage but I am livid at him right now and want to scream. All I want to do is cry and manage my feelings and clean my work clothes before I have to go back to work next week, but I keep thinking how disgusting our home is. 

I'll caveat by saying he did visit me every single weekend I was away, although he doesnt work a 5 day week and was back at our home for his day off each week, so would've had time to clean outside of work.

ANSWER: Do you have somewhere else you can stay? I'd go there and call your husband - tell him you will come home when the house is as clean as you left it.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How can I (33F) release my frustration about my bf (35M) not fucking me?

He is going through so much right now and I get it. When your money isn’t right and things are super stressful about your future, you don’t feel sexy. But good god PLEASE I am fucking dying here. 

He told me to even get in the mood for it he has to do something called “priming” with porn. Then he can have sex with me. But lately all he’s doing is that and not me. I’m way too young, hot, and fun to be begging my bf for sex. 

I try masturbation but it’s not scratching that itch. It just pisses me off more that I’m not getting it. And I’d never try to do something against his will. But idk what to do with all of this anger and frustration. I tried a rage room. I tried getting a massage. I tried screaming into a pillow. Nothing will alleviate my discontent.

I’m not leaving him. Money problems are hard but not worth ending the relationship over. He’s a great boyfriend. He just won’t fuck me.

ANSWER: he’s porn brained. This is bad, possibly less attracted to you because of it. Yall should talk about it. He needs help and you are suffering because of it.

I think it’s ended. We’ve been together 10 years. 

He thought I wanted an old fashioned marriage in that man is breadwinner, woman is mum and home maker, but to him that also meant I’m not included in decision making. I should just shut up and listen

I said well a discussion is fair, but he explained he doesn’t want to have to discuss every little decision, it should just be accepted what he decides. 

Don’t know what to think.

Not here for advice. Don’t really know what I’m here for? It’s my fault. 

Oh, and I am lesser than him. In his words ‘I’ve had to accept not everyone is like me….’

ANSWER: Honestly he just sounds like an asshole who isn’t willing to step up when the other is struggling. Or will but hold it over you for as long axle he needs. That’s his fault. Not yours: you needed unconditional love and support. Not whatever he was doing. UPDATEME

================================================================================

QUESTION: “I (29F) found year-long flirty messages between my husband (38M) and another woman after giving birth. How do I move forward?”

 My husband 38m and I 29f got married in 2022. He told me this girl let’s call her Mikayla ( not sure of her age) was interested in him.  I didn’t pay much attention because he told me there was nothing to worry about and I trusted him. 
As the year went on, I started to notice that he was liking her pictures and when I asked him about it, he told me that they hardly talk. There was nothing going on that he was just giving her a “ like” it meant nothing. Again I believed him. Although I will say that him and I had of quite a few fight about her and I had asked him to block her and he refused, saying that it was nothing that I was being paranoid and then when he really asked me if I really wanted him to block her because I didn’t wanna seem jealous And perhaps I didn’t wanna seem like I was one. I told him it’s fine and I just dealt with my feelings. 

Starting in 2024 my husband and I decided that we were starting family and I gave birth end of August. 

Being 7 weeks postpartum, I decided to go through my husband‘s phone and I found I believe it’s probably a year conversation between him and Mikayla. The conversations were like some audio  call at night 4 am and some day conversation. Of them, flirting with each other, saying that they would make a good couple if they were to be together. After I confronted my husband, he says that it meant nothing. It was nothing. He keeps saying that it was his past, which I had to remind him that his pass was in 2024 when you and I were married still.  Even though it was a small flooding, or it was a big flirting he was still married to me, and I had told him that I didn’t want him talking to him. He had promised me that they were talking that they were no conversation only for me to find out the conversation he has apologized, but I feel so betrayed. I am so hurt and I am postpartum two over months now. And every time I bring it up, he tells me that it was his past and that he sorry that he hurt me, but he says that he’s not sorry the fact that he flirted with her because it meant nothing. The thing about my husband is that on the weekend he does like to drink, and when he does drink, sometimes he pushes his limits and he doesn’t remember who he calls or what he said or what conversation he has he told me most of the conversation was late at night when he called her when he was drunk he doesn’t remember what he called or why he called her for. But then I found conversation at 4 PM to me. It doesn’t look like it’s a conversation just leave at night. They were generally talking is what to me what it feels like. 

I am very hurt. I have been praying a lot, but I am very hurt. Please give me advice on. How do I move from this? How do I come to forgive him  or forget this? 

I almost wanted to leave him, but then when I think about just leaving him, I think that I have a little boy and and after all, it was just flirting text yet he says it meant nothing I want to believe him I really do has anyone ever go through this? How did you get over it ?

ANSWER: Girl I hate to say this but he does not care about you. On top of that he said he doesn’t regret it while married. I think what would benefit is couples therapy if you want to stay together

================================================================================

QUESTION: I ‘29M’ just caught my girlfriend ‘35F’ on phrendly last night and I’m not sure how to respond

For context she brought the site up before bed earlier this week and tried to present the purpose of the site in such a way as if guys are just getting on there to casually chat about their days and are paying money to do so with others so how would I feel about her doing this? In this cost of living crisis with which we live we are both always trying to figure out ways to make more money and cut costs but for me it sounded like a site where guys are likely looking to sext which I’m not comfortable with, when I asked her about that she was adamant she wouldn’t want to do that. I said “idk about that” and went to bed shortly thereafter.

The next day, she sends me a TikTok where someone gives a better explanation but towards the end of the video they explicitly say that 99 percent of the convos are essentially sexting. Right away I tell her I’m not comfortable with that and I point out where this person mentions the sexting to which she replies with “oh haha yeah I guess I was hoping I’d get more of the casual convos but ok.” One would assume her and I would be on the same page yes? 

Well last night I was having trouble sleeping and saw her phone get a couple notifications, curiosity got the better of me so I decided to check what they were. The notification was just our ring camera but given our recent convo i decided to check which apps she’d had open where I then notice she was on safari. I open this and immediately see she’s not only made an account despite what we discussed, but she’s actively having sexual conversations with numerous guys. 

One guy sent her a dick pic to which she replied with a drooling emoji, one guy has some sort of degradation kink to which she was engaging in that kind of talk, etc. 

Further context, we just celebrated our 3 year anniversary and we have a strictly monogamous relationship. We were both very clear early on in our relationship that we’re both far too jealous for any kind of openness to a relationship or anything so I’m a little shocked that she’s done this. I will admit things have been rocky lately due to certain stressors in our lives but I’ve been completely faithful. 

TLDR; girlfriend is sexting people for money behind my back. How would you respond?

ANSWER: I’d break up with them because they’re cheating on you. So scummy about it too, she tried to get your permission to cheat first labeling it as “casual convos” when she didn’t deny it going sexual in anyway. She knew she wanted to sext from the beginning and tried to get you to agree to it unknowingly. That’s gross behaviour, idk if id want my life partner being capable of that

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend (34M) wants to have kids but doesn’t want to get married ? (27F)

My boyfriend and I have been together for  a year. He’s a great guy and has been pretty accepting and understanding towards things. Recently, I had some issues with my health that may affect my ability to get pregnant. So we decided to have a talk not too long ago about having kids. My boyfriend wants to have kids and possibly start trying within the year while I want to wait a little longer. I told him that I would prefer to be married and then have kids and to be a little more established myself and being an adult. He makes quite a bit more than I do and has told me that if I wanted to be a stay at home mom I could. I have told him that I would sign a prenup if it was related to money. But he still continues to say that he doesn’t want to. I feel very hung up on the fact that I want be married and then have kids. While he is totally fine with us having a kid and not getting married, even with our latest conversations. I’m just not sure how to feel or if I can even get past it.


Edit
I have asked him what his reasons are. He has said that it’s just a piece of paper and if he was suppose to have been married it would’ve happened by now. Also, he has said that if I wanted to stay home I had the option but he said he would pay for daycare or a nanny- but he said it was up to me whether I wanted to stay home, work part time or full time or as needed.

ANSWER: Nope.  
Marriage protects your and kid's rights, don't go for it. It can be anbsolutely a dealbreaker here.

QUESTION: M26 concerned about my girlfriend’s F25 guy best friend

I (26M) have been dating my girlfriend ( 25F) for a little while now and I’m honestly more serious about her than anyone I’ve ever dated.

I’m very attracted to her, she’s super sweet, low drama, we both love anime, we have similar life goals. She’s also been VERY patient and understanding about my mental health - I deal with anxiety/OCD and can get in my head a lot.

The thing I’m stuck on is her guy best friend.

 They’ve been friends for 12 years.
 About 5 years ago during COVID, they got drunk and had sex once.
 According to her, it never turned into anything more and they stayed friends.
 Now they:
    Call about once a week
    Text around 3–4 days a week
 She also has female friends she texts/calls with this same frequency – this is just how she is socially.
 She’s pretty progressive/feminist, and she’s been clear that:
    She won’t cut him off just because she’s in a relationship.
    But she said she wouldn’t hang out 1-on-1 besides maybe a quick together every once in a while out of respect for me

I’m mostly worried about the future:  
Is this the kind of thing that will always be sitting in the back of my mind in 2, 5, 10 years?

ANSWER: It’s entirely up to you whether this will be bothering you years from now. I can’t see any reason that it should.

================================================================================

QUESTION: my (32M) girlfriend (32F) has an explanation I just don’t think I believe. Context below, asking for opinions.

So my girlfriend and I have been together over a year, known each other since we were like 4 or 5.. recently there was a girl I used to know (to whom I do not currently even speak to, and haven’t since long before we got together) and this girl went out of her way to ensure I was made aware of some guy that talks to my girlfriend. Initially, like okay whatever. Thanks. Right?

The few questions I asked, the less I was getting for answers. Which just essentially weirded me out. It was unusual.

So I sat down and said listen, Im not accusing anyone of anything but at this point I would just really appreciate some transparency/clarity. I wasnt loud, accusatory, confrontational.. just wanted to know whatever the hell is or was happening here.

She told me a doctor she works with has a son who was going through a divorce, so the guy’s mom gave him her cell number to talk about it. And they’ve never met. (I read texts that said verbatim ‘are you still as awesome as when we met?’ to which she replied ‘yes lol’) so I was looking at her funny.

Maybe my mom is just different, but there is no god damn way in hell she would give Any random ass girl or coworker my phone number and be like “hey text my son”

So Im asking if anybody actually thinks this is plausible? If so, would love to hear how the hell one can come to that conclusion. It just seems like the biggest load of bullshit to me but I could be crashing out over it, too.

I need some clarity, or grounding, or something. Obviously I don’t know or I wouldnt be on reddit about it. 🥲

ANSWER: One thing you do know for sure is that she's lying. She lied about them ever meeting so you know there's more that you don't know and more she doesn't want you to know. 
She is giving you the bare bones version in hopes you'll be ok with it. That means that if you knew the entire story, you wouldn't be ok with it.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (29/f) thinks my bf (34/m) is resentful of me

We have been together for 5 years and have been living together for 4. When we first met, he knew my love of mountain biking. On my hinge profile 99% of the pictures were of me mountain biking and I took him biking on our first date. When we started official dating he “got into mountain biking” and went on a southwest bike trip with me and some of my friends only to tell me 6 months late he doesn’t like it and that it made him broke to do the hobby with him. He got so angry about the money he spent on it, I paid him what he spent on for the trip a year later because he wouldn’t let it go.  I never asked him to do it with me and I was shocked that he felt that way. He stated to me that I never was supportive of him hobbies, which I stated at the time I didn’t realize. I then bought all the stuff for the hobby he wanted me to try and then he immediately stopped doing that hobby I just bought all the gear for. Fast forward a few years, I went on an all girls mountain bike trip and he freaked out and told me he doesn’t want to be with someone who is comfortable going off for a week each year. For my 30th birthday, I wanted to go on a mini trip down to Florida and I told him that I would pay for all our stays and we could split the rest like food and gas. He told me he doesn’t want to go etc. since that would be too expensive for him. I said okay but I got really sad since growing up I always spent all my holidays and stuff alone and then we got into a fight. When I went to apologize to him for being distant he then re started ranting about money and that he wants to save his money so him and his friends can go on vacations and he can also have a “separate life” just like how I did when I went on that one girls trip. He also told me that he hasn’t proposed to me because of the girls trip I went on even though over the 5 years I’ve told him many times I wanted to be engaged by 30. I’m at the end of my straw. I feel like he’s super resentful towards me for some reason. I told him that he should go on guys trips and stuff. I pay 90% of the things we do together. I only make 8k more than him. How do I go about this situation?

ANSWER: Are you sure this is someone that you want to marry? It sounds like he holds grudges, doesn't support your hobbies, and takes advantage of you financially.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (28F) need advice on how to be more comfortable with my boyfriend's (29M) female friend.

We have been together for 6 years, and his friendship with this female friend is relatively new. They text almost every single day, and it makes me uncomfortable. Admittingly, I have gone through his phone and found nothing. They first started talking about shared hobbies, but now its just about general stuff. All of their conversations are innocent and nothing inappropriate. He never hides his phone or gets weird about incoming texts or anything. So i do trust him. But the frequency they talk still makes me uncomfortable.

He told me he validates how I feel, but that if I trust him then I shouldn't worry about anything. Also side note, this female friend also has a boyfriend. 

Usually I will feel a lot better after him and I have a conversation about it. But then a day or 2 later I see him texting her again and then I get uncomfortable again. Rinse and repeat. What can I do to feel better about this? I struggle with anxiety and imagine this is also clouding my judgement about the entire situation.


Edit: Im shocked at how vastly different the responses are compared to the almost same thing I posted yesterday on AIO (which i have since deleted because people were getting so rude). People saying i hope he breaks up with you for snooping and that i am wildly insecure. 

Secondly, they arent texting constantly all day long. Some days there's is only maybe 3 texts. Some days they dont text at all (not usually the case lately though). All in all im still uncomfortable with it. 

Also, we have plans to meet soon and she's has even said she's excited to meet me. Im not sure how much that might help how im feeling about it.

ANSWER: Men and women can be friends, but I don't think that amount of texting is appropriate. I think the other commenter who said he is indulging a new crush is absolutely correct. My male partner has female friends, but he's not texting them regularly or even hanging out regularly. And certainly never 1 on 1 if they do hang out.

Personally I would not want to be that good of friends with a man who has a girlfriend to where we are texting all the time. It just feels odd. I think your gut is telling you something is wrong. You don't need to feel comfortable with this.

QUESTION: [32M]with [30F] partner, her coworker [28M] texts nonstop and it's affecting our relationship

We've been married for two years, and she was the one who really pushed for us to get married.
Recently, she's gotten close to a coworker. He isn't new at her workplace, but they hadn't talked much before. Now he texts her constantly. What started as normal work-related conversation has turned into all-day messaging that continues even when we're spending time together. He keeps trying to find shared interests with her and repeatedly invites her to work nights out that she says she can't attend. I've noticed she smiles at her phone, talks about him a lot, praises him, and interrupts what we're doing to reply to his messages. She isn't hiding anything from me, she sometimes tells me what they're discussing or even lets me read parts of their conversations because she finds them "funny."
We've been together for nearly ten years. During our first year | struggled with jealousy, but I took it seriously and worked hard to change. I'm very careful now not to be controlling. I haven't mentioned this coworker directly because I don't want it to seem like I'm sliding back into old behavior.
I'm looking for an outside perspective:
• How can I tell whether my concerns about this coworker are reasonable or if I'm reading too much into the situation? 
• How can I talk about reasonable boundaries without sounding controlling?

Thanks :)

ANSWER: This absolutely concerning. You need to tell how you feel. She should not be texting another man this much. He is clearly trying to get closer to her. She needs to put a stop to it.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (23 F) I’m considering breaking up with my BF (23 M) because he confessed to me he’s asexual

Hi everyone, I’m writing this post because as much as much I’ve racked my brain trying to understand this situation, I’m not been successful at it and I can’t share this with many people in my personal life, so I think an unbiased perspective will be useful. Thanks in advance for any advice or similar experiences you can share. 

For context: My BF and I live together, we’ve been together for 3 years living together for 2. He’s the only partner I’ve had, he’s had other sexual partners in the past. 

A few months ago I went solo traveling for a week, when I came back home I noticed my boyfriend wasn’t really “onboard” with having sex. It took me by surprise because we normally have an active sex life (1-2 times per week). 

At the beginning of our relationship he was very eager to have sex, that eagerness stared to diminish with time, he told me it was because I had very low libido (I was on BC) and that I never initiated and he didn’t felt wanted. So, I got of BC and started working to get my libido back (exercise, diet, etc). 

Well it worked, ever since May I’ve wanted as much sex as any 23 year old would, I presume. I’m talking 4-5 times per week. My bf and I were both working from home but he had a lot of reasons (I’m tired, I don’t have time, my back hurts) to deny wanting sex, so we kept having sex 1-2 per week. 

I thought it was odd because I had started to initiate, I had my libido back, but still he didn’t really seem to want it. 

I take really good care of my appearance, mainly because I’m a part time model, but I’m also a fitness enthusiast so I have a nice body, curves and toned look. According to most social norms, I’m hot. I’ve had guys stopped me in the street for my number, I’ve never had to buy my own drink, I even had trainers offer to train me for free in the gym. I say all of this so it can be understood that it’s not that I’ve “let myself go” or that I don’t try to have a nice appearance. 

We then had a conversation about the lack of intimacy and my bf said that the issue now was that he felt awful at work and didn’t wanted to do stuff because he felt depressed. Ok, I understood and backed off from initiating (it felt weird always being rejected). He then told me he wasn’t enjoying our sex because he had to a lot of physical activity, and that he was tired from the gym, I tried being a lot more active in bed but he still complained. 

Anyways, my point is ever since I got off BC to get my libido back, there’s always a reason of why we only do it 1-2 per week. And before that, I had low libido so the 1-2 per week was good for me, but not anymore. 

When I came back from my trip, we had sex once but I noticed he was just off. When I asked him what was happening, he finally opened up to me. 

He said that in the week I had been away he had the chance to really consider how he felt about sex, and that he found out that he considers it very boring, something he does but out of habit and something he could go all his life without it because he doesn’t have any desire. He talked with his therapist and the therapist explained him what asexually is and that’s how he landed on that. 

At first it was hard to understand, and I felt confused as to why he hadn’t told me anything or considering his feelings about sex before. I mean, we’re 3 years in into the relationship. 

He explained that he thought everyone felt the same way.

After a lot of talking, he confessed to me that the only thing he finds interesting about sex is that I enjoy it, and he told me that he has no sexual or physical desire for me, but that if I wanted to, he would like to keep having intimacy a few times per month because he enjoys giving me pleasure. 

My issue with that is that now I have no desire to have sex with him, knowing that he doesn’t desire me in a physical way and that he would only be having intimacy to keep me happy. I see no point in us having sex if it’s not something he really wants because I just feel he will do it out of compromise, and I think the point of intimacy is that both partners want it.

We love each other a lot and have built a strong relationship outside of this issue, we have what could be considered a great home life and outside of the intimacy issue, I think our relationship is amazing. 

Keeping that in mind, I am not sure what to do because for me sex is really important, and also being wanted is important and is one of the things I enjoy most about having intimacy. 

I’ve been having trouble sleeping and focusing during the day, and connecting with him, something just feels off but I am not sure if I want to fix what feels off, or just give up on the relationship. 

I would feel terrible to end such a good relationship over this, but I am not sure what other options there are. 

Would be a terrible idea to finish a strong and healthy relationship with a man I love over the lack of sex and desire? Is it something it can be overlooked or maybe just ignored?

Please advise, I would love to read other perspectives. 

TLDR: My bf found out and confessed he’s asexual, he has no desire for me nor for sex. Is this something worthy of breaking up a happy and healthy relationship?

ANSWER: For me, sex is an important part of how I connect with my partner (along with many other ways), so I couldn't be in a relationship without it. So the question is:  is sex an important part of the relationship for you? if so, can you have a long-term relationship without it? Because this isn't "not having sex for 2 weeks or months," It's not having sex for years, and if you can't do that, then that is a conversation you need to have with your partner sooner rather than later, and break up.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (F21) boyfriend (M28) says that he is tired of "holding my hand". What now?

(LDR)

My (F21) boyfriend (M28) has a habit of using my trauma against me and weaponized the things I say against me. I have been a victim of domestic abuse and sexual abuse in my previous relationship which I told him at the start of our relationship. He expressed that he will love me no matter what and be patient with me since I'm still working through my trauma.

Last night he happened to mention to me in conversation that he does not want to do all the work in our sexual relationship since he did that in his last relationship. I replied that I don't want to do all of the work either (so I obviously understand his perspective). It is usually difficult for me to be sexual with him due to my trauma (which is knows) so I considered that me engaging with him about sex was a good step. He told me he didn't understand what I meant which confused me since I just echoed what he said and I couldn't find another way of explaining. He then proceeded to tell me I'm mentally abusive and I don't care about him. He is now threatening to break up with me and I'm just lost and sad. He threatens me with this often and I don't what to do. Any and all advice welcome 💐

ANSWER: “My (F21) boyfriend (M28) has a habit of using my trauma against me and weaponized the things I say against me.”

Okay, so right off the bat, you’re in another domestic abuse relationship. Just because he doesn’t hit you doesn’t mean that this is a safe, healthy relationship. He is emotionally abusing you.

QUESTION: My (F24) boyfriend (M24) cheated on me, I’m mad post mortem?

Me (F24) and my boyfriend (M24) were together 2 years. I broke up with him and two weeks later he took his life. I find out now that the same night he had a pregnancy scare, which is clearly not me because we didn’t have sex for 5 weeks before we broke up and 7 weeks before the incident. Either way I have an IUD that he prided his way on when we had sex. Now I’m stuck being mad at a dead person for cheating on me. I’m just sad and need some help. I need advice on dealing with the anger and grief.

ANSWER: It's not wrong to be mad at someone that wronged you, I imagine you wouldn't have wanted anything to do with him after finding out he cheated on you. This way, you know with certainty you won't have to. Him taking his own life was completely out of your control and to an extent so is how you feel, just ride out the feelings and give yourself time and space to then allow it all to pass naturally and if you really struggle, therapy can be a massive help.

Hi guys. I've (30M) been dating someone (30F) for two months now and she told me the other day that in the past she has sexted with a guy knowing he was in a relationship. So she partook in an affair.

I said to her that wasn't great, and she told me that this guy is now married to this same partner. I said I personally would want to know if my partner had done this, whilst she said she doesn't want to upset their relationship.

I asked her if she wouldn't do something like this again in the future (to see if she has changed her ways) and she said she wouldn't want to but that she's human and flawed.

I don't know. This seems like a real red flag to me and has turned me off her a bit. Any thoughts?

ANSWER: Exactly!
She'll do it again and most probably go further.
She's a cheater and has no problem cheating.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (41F) boyfriend (46M) is exhausting me with need for emotional support, how to handle this- 3 years relationship

TL;DR: my boyfriend's need to emotional support is overwhelming me, don't know if it's normal, how to handle it.

My (41F) boyfriend (48M) exhausts me with his need for emotional support and frequent venting. I understand that couples have arguments, but I feel the content and frequency of our arguments is too much for me to manage. We have been living together about 2 and a half years, and about 5months ago I came off Zoloft. Since coming off Im finding I can't "be strong enough" to handle his baggage and insecurities. 
For example, we will have arguments about small things that I would normally let slide- like the other day I was busy in the kitchen and he was trying to show me something on the TV- admittedly I didn't drop what I was doing, but I did look over, not understand why he was so interested in Lilo and Stitch and say "oh okay"- not really understanding what he was on about. He took this as ultimate disrespect, and it turned into a big argument. I feel he is constantly questioning my love and commitment. He is convinced I'm using him for security, and will leave him the moment a better option comes along. I have zero desire to do this, but his past has led him to these insecurities. And no matter how much I explain and reassure him he still has this constant fear in his mind.
In addition to this he spends a lot of time venting about his ex and her family. In each instance it's not just a 5 minute vent, it like a 1-2 hour long session, sometimes coupled with a self pity spiral.
It's just exhausting me. 
If I complain he says I should he there to support him no matter what because that's what people who are in love do "through the good times and the bad". I've tried to explain how his venting etc really takes a lot of energy out of me and I find it hard. He does seem to understand, but it hasn't stopped the frequency and duration of the sessions, he also says he needs to get his feeling off his chest and shouldn't bottle them up. As it currently stands it's it's about 2-3 times per week where I'm needing to give him emotional support or we are having an argument. It's just so much, how can I better handle this?

ANSWER: Living with a vampire who says " but i need to drink your blood to survive" "dont you love me enough to give up a few pints of blood" - emotional version. Ask him to PAY a therapist for his vents. Tell him you can lend a shoulder, not your entire body.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Is my Girlfriend (25F) cheating on me with her guy best friend (24M)?

So, my girlfriend and I are hitting a rough patch right now. It started when I asked her why she seems happier spending time with her friends than with me. After that chat, I felt like something changed between us.

One day, she went to the bathroom, and I thought it would be funny to surprise her at the door as a joke. But while I was waiting, I overheard her talking to her guy best friend on the phone. They've been friends since grade school, and I never had a problem with him until then. While she was in the bathroom, her guy best friend called. My girlfriend told him she was busy on the toilet and would send the file later. In a joking way, her friend said he wanted to hear her pee. Laughing and funny voice, my girlfriend asked, "You really wanna hear me pee?" That made my heart sink, and I wondered if there was something more going on, but I quickly shrugged it off. I brought it up with her, and she insisted it was just a joke. We argued about it, but eventually, we managed to talk it out.

In the days that followed, I felt this weird urge to check her phone because of what happen, which I almost never do. Given everything, I decided to look for messages between her and her guy best friend. I found some normal chats, but when I checked the recently deleted messages on imessage, I found one with his number. The message said, "Check Telegram." I immediately checked her Telegram, but everything was wiped. She explained that their conversations were about me and her frustrations about the relationship, and she deleted them because she didn't want to hurt my feelings. My girlfriend is venting out to her guy best friend.

Now we're in a big disagreement and trying to work things out. How can I move forward and rebuild trust? Do you think there's anything suspicious in her actions?

ANSWER: Her guy best friend is the typical 'bestie' that wants to smash, waits patiently until things start to go wrong to attack.

She knows this, has him sitting in the bench, and is thinking about bringing him over to the field.

This is best case scenario.

Do what you will with this information.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Am I (F28) overreacting to my fiancé (M28) staying friends with women that have had crushes on him and aren’t nice to me?

My fiancé and I have been together for 5 years. When I met his friends from college in our first year of dating, 2 of the women acted strangely towards me. One of them swore up and down they were like siblings but asked me why I liked him. The other just straight up didn’t speak to me or look at me. 

My fiancé was shocked when I told him about getting the cold shoulder, but weeks later mentioned out of the blue that she had confessed her feelings to him while they were in school (he didn’t feel the same).

We recently saw the other one that swore they were like siblings and her energy was very strange towards me too - even he noticed she was off. She’s one of those people who gives off major silent aggression vibes and did little things here and there to really show me she wasn’t interested in welcoming me into their group. I told him I thought she might have had feelings for him too, which he denied, until he found out from a not so passive joke at her wedding that she had feelings for him. 

After all this, he’s STILL choosing to be friends with both of them. I’m not into controlling my partner and telling him who he can and can’t be friends with, but it does make me uncomfortable, and I’ve expressed that to him.

I’m not mad that they had feelings for him - you like who you like - but it’s how they’re choosing to act, even though they both have kids and partners. 

Am I tripping or out of line for expressing my discomfort?

ANSWER: It doesn't sound like you're overreacting, but I would need more info about what these friendships look like and what "staying friends" vs "not staying friends" would mean. Best advice would be to continue talking to him about it, try to avoid blaming him or making demands/ultimatums, but keep expressing yourself. 

Key thing to realize here is, even though you told him how you feel, hey may not fully understand. It might take a few different explanations with examples of the behavior you're seeing before he can really appreciate your perspective.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My girlfriend (f28) moved in with me (m34) in May. But she still acts like she’s a guest in her own home. How can I help her? Or do I just need to chill?

So my girlfriend moved in with me about seven months ago. We planned it, talked everything through, made sure the timing was right.... all the grown up stuff. It wasn’t rushed. And honestly? I was excited. I love her. I mean love her. And sharing a home just felt like the most natural next step.

But ever since she moved in my gf makes herself so very small.

Like in bed.  We have a WHOLE queen sized mattress and somehow she still curls into this tiny little ball in the corner. I wake up and she’s practically falling off the edge, and I keep pulling her back toward me because there is literally an entire half of the bed available.

And it’s not just the bed. She moves around the house like she’s afraid to be in the way. Always kind of on edge, like she’s waiting for something to go wrong. If I ask her if she wants to rearrange furniture or hang up her own art or literally change anything, she just says, “It’s fine,” with that polite little smile.

The other day she spent almost TWO  hours cleaning after work. I got home and our place was spotless yet there she was vacuuming. I took the vacuum from her and told her to leave some for me, trying to joke, trying to lift her spirits,and yet, she apologized. Apologized. For cleaning too much..… in her own home.

That’s when it hit me: she’s treating me like a landlord she doesn’t want to upset, not her boyfriend who wants her to feel safe and rooted and like she actually lives here.

I know she’s shy (very shy)  and she’s only lived alone before, so maybe it’s just an adjustment thing. Maybe she needs time. But part of me worries she’s waiting for permission to exist here, and I don’t know how to help her feel like she can take up space.

I’m trying to be patient. To reassure her without overwhelming her. I tell her openly that this is our home, that she belongs here, that she doesn’t have to earn her keep. But I’m still figuring out how to help without making her feel pressured.

Maybe it really is just a time thing. Maybe she just needs to see that no one’s going to pull the rug out from under her. Maybe I need to just shut up and stop hyper analysing every little thing because I'm scared. Idk. Yeah.

ANSWER: In my opinion it's has something to do with that she is shy. It's about lack of self-esteem, or very low self-esteem. She doesn't want you to lose so she is acting very careful around you. It's not like she doesn't trust you, but she is projecting her self-issues on you. After some time she can feel secured a little bit more but with her self-worth she should do something productive. You can't really help her with that, you can tell her million times it's her home, she can trust you, you can prove her with actions but it's her own problem what with she has to deal with. I don't say that she should be cocky, or she should push herself, she will never have issues with self-love, but right now it's very serious so she really should gain some.

I am 19 F. I’m a very friendly and respectful person. I am very empathetic. I am a people pleaser. I will put other people needs above mines all the time. 19 M was my boyfriend. After this morning I really want advice on how to move on with my life away from him. 

We been together for 11 months. 19 M has horrible anger issues and it has caused me to have really low self esteem about myself. Just yesterday me and 19 M were planning on seeing each other since we haven’t seen each other in over 2 weeks. 

I work 2 jobs. I’m busy and tired but I still make sure to make time for him. 19 M does a lot of drugs. 12am It’s time for me to go see 19 M. 19M asks me if I can ask a friend for a dead vape because all of his are empty. I’m talking to my friend and I ask. I get the vape just to come back to my phone and see 19 M blowing me up. 

Calling me all kinds of rude things. He calls me fat and ugly. He calls me a dyke because I tell him how people mistaken me as gay just because i’m a black woman with dreadlocks. He tells me to jump. He told me I ruin everything and how he fucking hates me. I need to gut myself. He called me a bitch and the hard er. 

I couldn’t even cry because i’m so used to this but it made me extremely upset because I went Christmas shopping for him. I even used my money to buy him snacks for when I go to see him. Things he was very aware of. 

After today I don’t want anything to do with him. As I’m writing this he’s blowing me up begging for me to still come over. I just wanna cut this person off. He’s not good for me. I just want advice and help. Please

ANSWER: You dump this motherfucker before he starts physically abusing (and possibly KILLING) you. You have my permission to get the fuck AWAY FROM HIM.

After 3 years of ups and downs, stress that I never imagined and just consistently being let down, I’m done. I’m tired of begging her to love me how I need love. Hell I’m tired of wanting more than she can give me. I love adventure and deep conversations about philosophical topics. I love to travel and try new things. She’s like a young turtle in her shell that is opposed to trying new things outside of her comfort zone. I’m not even mad anymore I just know that we are incompatible and I’m tired of trying to fit a square peg into a circle hole. I wish I knew what I know now but I guess I wouldn’t be who I am today without this experience. Why is it so hard to walk away when all the relationship does is drain you?

ANSWER: Best to realise how incompatible you are now than ten years down the line.
As difficult as it may be to separate it’s for the best.
Staying together will only build resentment as she can’t give you what you need in a partner and vice versa.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I [38M] navigate this situation with my GF [36F]

Edit- thank you everyone. Obviously I care for my gf deeply and as I previously stated Ive been inclined to tell her as I really don't want secrets between us and certainly am not trying to hide anything. I was just overthinking and nervous about it. I don't want to ruin a great thing but I agree not telling her would be far worse. Thank you all.


I [38M] and my GF [36F] recently started dating seriously and have started introducing each other to our friends and doing things with friends etc. We recently went to a sporting event with a couple that she is friends with and at that event we met another couple that's friends with her friends. 

The woman in the couple that are friends with my GFs friends seemed very familiar to me but I couldn't place her at the time but later i realized who she was.

I didn't really think it was worth mentioning once I figured it out as I thought running into this person was a one off situation and we didn't really have a lot of interaction with them but a couple weeks later it happened again that we hung out with this couple and then the other couple showed up. 

I do absolutely want to be open and honest with my GF so I'm inclined to tell her. She's the greatest thing to ever happen to me so I don't want there to ever be anything that hurts her but to that end I'm just wondering if this is worth bringing up just to put all cards on the table or if this is making a mountain out of a mole hill. I don't want to keep any secrets from her but nor do I want to give her info that will cause unnecessary stress or heartache or anything like that. 

Context with the other woman-

History: About 4 years ago her and I matched on tinder talked for weeks finally met and went to a movie then later hung out at my house and had sex. After that we continued to talk but never hung out again and things crumbled pretty quickly. Admittedly I did really like her and I tried to pursue a relationship but she was not up for it saying she had a lot of issues going on personally like losing friends, grief, changing up her mental health meds etc. Whether all that was legit or not idk but regardless after telling me she couldn't continue she "ghosted" if you want to call it that. But never heard from or seen her again until now. 

Current: I have absolutely zero feelings or desire for that woman or any other woman. I love my girlfriend totally and completely. So I'm not at all worried about that in any way, shape, or form. 

Can you guys tell me if you think telling her would be the best course of action?

ANSWER: It’s probably a good idea to say something just so it doesn’t look like you’re trying to hide anything. You can phrase it like,

“hey, I’m not trying to make a big deal out this but I realized I had actually briefly dated that one friend. It was a long time ago (you can say how long) and things never worked out. Obviously nothing is there but thought you should know in case anyone brings it up.”

QUESTION: I 21M embarassed my gf 21F unintentionally

For context this is my first serious relationship and i truly genuinely love her.We've been together for a year and a half now and i genuinely want her to be the one.Its all i want to do.
So,coming back to the story my gf had a volunteerting thing at the zoo earlier last week.It was only after that where i started to notice this pungent almost cheeselike smell in the car when i pick her up.Firstly i thought that it was just the surroundings but it lingered and it was getting to me man.I couldnt drive properly atp.However i realised that on other days when i picked up my gf she was wearing different shoes and sandals and it wasnt a problem so i thoight it was dealt with.
Here comes the day where i embarassed her.So we went out for supper to eat and she was wearing the crocs she went to the zoo and it came back to me.Straight up shot up my nose and i couldnt help but make a face and it got to her.Initially i brough it up that it was just her shoes and we could go get them cleaned up but i realised she was slightly distant and abit embarassed.So i tried to cheer her up by saying that it wasnt her fault and it was just from the zoo but evidently she was sad and almost started to cry.I tried to help but she wasnt bidging so i just waited for her to tell me.Apparently she has had this condition where her feet smells and it has been a MAJOR insecurity of her and me pointing out the smell to her was her biggest nightmare.Right now all she says to me is that she calls herself gross and won't let me get near her anymore.I have no idea what to doI genuinely thoight it was just the shoes.
I really love her and i wouldnt want to ever embarass her.Much more poke at a very deep insecurity of her.I feel bad.What could i do to help or say?

ANSWER: NTA. I mean I see why what you said hurt her feelings, but it’s not like you knew she had a foot issue.  Her continued reaction is excessive and immature

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (33F) Boyfriend (33m) got aggressive during argument.

Sorry for this long, messy post. My (33F) boyfriend (33M) and I got into a short fight Sunday evening. I had to leave for work at 6am that morning and he had things to take care of so he dropped our daughter (3) off at my mom’s down the street to babysit at 10:00am. When he was done with his errand, 1:00ish, he went home drank and fell asleep. By the time I got done with work at 4:00ish, I noticed he still hadn’t picked up our kid. I called him three times and no answer. Sent a text asking if he was picking her up. Finally, at 5:30 he got her then texted me back that he picked her up.

I was livid when I got home bc that’s when I found out he had been drinking and then fell asleep. I admit that I immediately came at him with words. I asked him why he drank when he knew he was to pick her up. I yelled at him that my mom didn’t agree to watch her ALL day so that he could drink. I was especially upset because this is not the first time he has done something like this. I’ve told him times before that he can’t drink when he is the only one around watching our daughter. It’s so irresponsible. He was good about it until that Sunday. I guess he figured my mom was watching her so it’s fine even though he was to get her still? This makes me so mad. If I knew he’d been drinking I would have picked her up. It’s only down the street but still. I yelled that I don’t want to leave her alone with him anymore if he can’t stop doing this. He got mad, yelled “then don’t!”, the yelling continued and then I remember him coming at me with an angry look I’ve never seen. He shoved me against the wall and pinned me there for a couple of seconds before I screamed “don’t fucking touch me” and cried, told him we’re leaving and I got our kid and our jackets and went back to my moms. It happened so fast. He used a lot of force but I think bc of adrenaline, I immediately got my kid and left that I didn’t realize how hard he pressed my arms. This morning I noticed very small bruises on each arm where he grabbed me. 

He was apologizing as I was getting into the car. My daughter and I spent the night at my parents. Yesterday after work, he hugged me and said he loves me and we both acted like everything was normal. But I don’t know if this is normal. He has never acted aggressive like this before. I was shocked when it all happened. I don’t know what to do, I feel like I’m under reacting but also, he didn’t hit me or anything. I had an ex who hit and strangled me one time and I left and never came back to him after that. I know that was abuse. But this isn’t that. He is actually a really great father, very involved and as a partner, he does his fair share of household things. He’s really responsible in every other aspect in life, more than me for sure. I guess, I’m confused on how to feel after this. I don’t know what the next steps are if there are any.

ANSWER: Throwing hands and bruises are never okay, and yes that is abuse. I would not return to this man, and if you even consider it, he needs treatment/therapy, probably for drinking and for anger management. I would not let him close to you or your daughter otherwise. Consider a protective order. Document the bruises now!

  
One woman or girl is killed every 10 minutes by their intimate partner or family member. Do not become a statistic. A man who lays hands is a predator, not a partner.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How can I help my [35M] wife [38F] process our grief and try our best?

My wife \[F38\] and I \[M35\] have been together for 3 years, living together for more than a year and just recently married.  
We are both introverts, didn't really go out before meeting each other.  
Now we constantly discover new places and try new things together. Escape room, shooting range, waffle house, pinball museum, it's a pretty wide range of things.  
We both did more activities in the last 3 years than we have in our entire lives.  
Sometimes it is a bit too much but I love every second with her, laughing together, teasing each other, just spending time with her on a sleepy Sunday cuddling and watching a movie.

She is like my little devil in a bunny disguise.  
She is afraid of everything mostly, but when the time comes she is the most enthusiastic.  
She was afraid of the wedding too, of getting her oaths wrong, of stepping on my legs during the dance, looking silly.  
She did all that, and then had a blast with her friends dancing and talking with everyone. I hate weddings generally, but ours was awesome.

Almost a year after we met we had an accident.  
At first she was really really scared of having a baby, but got used to it, talked with him / her, planned the future.  
I have a stable well paying job, my own apartment, everything was fine.  
I always thought the reason to my life is to change the world or have a child and give it every chance to do the same. I am way too lazy to change the world, so a child it is.  
Nature had other ideas. We knew it would be hard, she has type 2 diabetes, thyroid issues, worked in a hospital for a while, got X-rayed, got a hepatitis vaccine all while we didn't know about the pregnancy.  
All doctors told her different things, keep taking the medication, stop immediately, go to the specialist ... after like a 2-3 month appointment. Healthcare here is pretty crap.  
We lost the child right before our first Christmas together.  
It was a pretty harrowing experience watching her almost bleed to death while she kept pretending everything is fine and trying to stay strong.  
Even while being taken into the operating room all she asked me is whether I was too hot. I still had my coat and beanie on.

We cried together for two weeks daily, but we were there for each other.  
After new years we lit a candle for the baby, said our goodbyes, cried our hearts out one last time and I was able to finally let go.  
I though she was too.

Before she moved in with me and before we got engaged we always discussed our future.  
We sometimes left notes for each other for valentines or just for fun.  
These discussions and notes always referenced a future child, like how it would leave little peanut buttered fingerprints everywhere or other cute things.  
She always teases me with videos of cute babies, small clothes, or tells me not to look at children on the street while we are taking a walk because she knows I would get all puppy eyed.

We agreed we would try.  
We went and got checked out. Doctors said we are okay, her conditions are treated, we can safely go ahead.  
All doctors said not to wait, risks of illness and complications rise with age. We are not young anymore.

So we began our journey. But she is afraid. Terrified even.  
Of a potential pregnancy, of how good of a mother she would be, of losing herself.  
I am only afraid of things I can't really control. I am afraid of the pregnancy. It is mostly up to nature.  
I am not afraid of raising the child, I know we would be good parents. Especially her. She is the most caring and conscientious woman I know even though she pretends to be the opposite.  
Being this afraid and stressed however is causing issues in our love life.  
She tenses up after a few minutes, we stop to cuddle, I tell her everything is fine, give her lots of kisses, try to reassure her, and we go on with our day, both of us feeling a little dejected.  
Last night she asked if we could stop trying for a few months. She says she did not process our loss yet and that it is causing the issue.  
I agreed to stop for a while and give her time.  
And now I'm afraid that those few months will turn to a few years and the already higher risk of complications will be even higher.  
If we try our best and we don't succeed then it's fine. Maybe I will become an evil IT guy in my lair and try to change the world after all.  
All I care about is her though.

So my question is:  
How can I help her? How can I show her she is the most wonderful wife whatever the future holds and that she would be the most wonderful mother if the time comes?

TLDR:  
After a happy accident and an unfortunate miscarriage, my wife \[F38\] is afraid to try again even though she always teases me \[M35\] with a child.  
How can I help her with her grief and reassure her that she is a wonderful wife and that she would be an awesome mother?

ANSWER: Therapy. Lots of it. She needs to be seeing someone on her own and then with you. There are tons of support groups for pregnancy and infant loss- talking to other women or couples that have gone through this will also be monumentally helpful. They can be in person or online depending on where you live. Read blogs and stories of others and how they overcame the grief. You are being wonderful and supportive!

================================================================================

QUESTION: [Update] I (F/28) came across some images on my girlfriend’s (F/27) phone. How do I handle it?

I know I said I didn’t want this to become a habit, but I looked at my girlfriend’s phone again. A lot of people sent me DMs after my first post with ideas about what I should look for. Since the paranoia hasn’t stopped, I did exactly that, and I think I found something, but I might also be jumping to conclusions. Idk, I would like some opinions.

First post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/6RsC4vURSH

I checked the dates of the nudes again and then looked at my girlfriend’s online money account (i know that sounds stupid but I am trying to avoid trigger words because reddit thinks I am asking for money) for transactions around that time. I found transactions for both lingerie sets she was wearing. Each set was bought at a different time, just like the photos were taken at separate times. So she went to the lingerie store twice.
The timing of the transactions didn’t really give me any clues. Like, I have bo idea what she was supposed to be doing at those days at that time.
Then I looked at her other money app (the one starting with P), and around the same time as those transactions one of her coworkers had sent her money. Both times for around the amount she had spent at the lingerie store.
Again, I don’t want to jump to conclusions or accuse my girlfriend of cheating without actually knowing anything, but at this point I’m spiraling.
I don’t know the coworker who sent her the money personally, but my girlfriend has mentioned her before. My girlfriend got promoted a few months ago and has been working with her on a project together. Since then, she has been out a lot for work and is pretty busy but thats not suspicious to me because her work always has really busy phases.
Im still trying to avoid telling my girlfriend that I went through her phone or accusing her of anything. It would cause a huge fight. And if she is actually cheating and we break up, I would seriously be screwed right now because I currently don’t have a job, she is providing for both of us, and the apartment is hers too.
I can only make assumptions about her cheating since I don’t actually know anything for sure. I have no proof, and nothing has changed in our relationship recently. Everything is normal. We still go on dates, have sex, and habe a lot of fun together. There are no real indicators that she might be cheating on me. The only things that make me paranoid are the nudes and the transactions.
And again, I had no reason to touch her phone to begin with because our relationship has been good and I trust her.
Today, while she was at work, I tore the whole apartment apart looking for the two lingerie sets she is wearing in the pictures, because people told me to look everywhere and they are not here.
I want to believe all of this doesn’t mean anything, especially because our relationship still feels loving, but right now i am really scared that she is sleeping with her coworker behind my back. If that’s the case, I seriously don’t know what I would do. I can’t get the nudes out of my head or stop thinking about the possibility that she took them for her coworker.
I have no proof that she sent her the pictures. I went through their chat and there is nothing there. They only talk about work gossip, and not even that much. My girlfriend also has a work phone, and she probably texts her coworker there more, but I don’t have access to that. It’s not connected to anything personal, so if the nudes are on her private phone, they shouldn’t be on her work phone. I also don’t think she would risk using her work phone for something like that because she is very professional about wirk.
I would like to hear some advice or thoughts. I am quite confused and not thinking rationally at this time.

ANSWER: Lady how are you okay with your girlfriend paying for everything for you? You need to get a job quick smart and get some savings happening. Something is off with the missing lingerie but even if she is cheating your screwed. Because you have no funding of your own. Its never advisable to 100% rely on a partner to finance your living.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (25F) got physically abused by my partner (27M) 1st time in my 5 years long relationship. How to process this?

So, I (25F) have been in a 5 years long relationship with my boyfriend (27M). We both are working as corporate employees.

We both are from different castes. My family doesn't know anything about our relationship, nor does his family know about us.

My boyfriend has been facing major career setbacks for a year. He tried investing in a startup, backed by his older brother which was too risky to begin at an early stage. As expected, It didn't workout and now he has been facing major financial losses for a year although he still has a decent paying job.

He's also not on very-good terms with his family. They've always been emotionally unavailable, dysfunctional and My boyfriend has major childhood trauma due to growing up in an unhealthy and toxic environment. So, He has been going through a lot lately and I already empathize with him.

We both have been currently working in the same city for 3 years but I recently got a relocation offer from my company to work on a bigger project in a different city, much farther from the current place where we are. It is still in process, not finalized yet.

So, I didn't want to inform about this to my boyfriend yet cuz I didn't want to make him feel inferior to me.

(Bad decision, I know but I couldn't help it).

Also just a few weeks ago, I attended a family wedding in my hometown. My parents made me see a potential guy and his family in the function, which I didn't even know about prior to the meeting. It was nothing like a proper wedding proposal of course, but It was still a proposal.

I didn't even realize that it was meant to be a wedding proposal. The guy's mom and the guy just talked to me for a few minutes, that was it. It was later when I got to know by my mom asking me how the guy was, how he looked and all.

I took some time and eventually declined the proposal to my mom saying that I don't want to get married for a few years at least. My parents are pretty understanding so they got my point, although I am sure they suspect me for having a relationship.

Now, I didn't want to bother my boyfriend about this too cuz he had been going through family and financial stress a lot. I know I made a bad decision but I really didn't want to put him through worse at that point.

A few weeks went by, I was still waiting for the right time to tell my boyfriend about my relocation plans and this so called proposal as well.

Just 3 days ago, My boyfriend had come over to my apartment cuz we hadn't seen each other in a long while.

We watched a movie, had dinner and we got cozy with each other too.

I fell asleep after that. My boyfriend was still awake and he was playing games on my iPad.

(He did ask for my permission before using it but I was so sleepy that I didn't have a thought of him going through my mails or chats cuz we generally do have a dynamic of using each other's devices without a problem)

He probably also saw the relocation offer from my company in my e-mails while searching for an OTP for logging into Clash Royale.

I think he also went through my WhatsApp to find out more things. He saw the potential guy's photos in my mom's chats too. The chats were a few weeks old but he did see them.

He didn't sleep for the whole night and waited till the morning for me to wake up. I got up normally, doing the regular morning activities.

I made tea for both of us. While sipping the tea, He confronted me about the guy he saw in my mom's chats and also the e-mail he saw last night.

I could see the pain and the feeling of betrayal he had in his eyes. I felt horrible, absolutely horrible. He said that he felt like I cheated on him, broke his trust.

I tried explaining to him but he said that I probably wanted to consider the marriage proposal that's why I didn't tell him about moving cities.

He got up and started walking out of the house. I tried to plead him to give me atleast one chance to explain my reasons but he was so enraged that I could see it through his eyes.

I tried stopping him by holding his hand, gently not forcefully but this is where he had the final outburst and he grabbed my wrist me forcefully.

I repeatedly told him to give me a chance for an explanation but he was so enraged that he grabbed my hand even more strengthfully. He even went on to twist my arm around for a couple of seconds while saying how pathetic he felt.

I was crying, telling him that it was painful but it felt like he couldn't even see what he was doing to me.

He shoved me down and my shoulder indeed hit the wall very hard, resulting me getting a bluish bruise there on the following day.

I was so scared of his rage at that moment that I just broke down into tears and sat right there on the floor. He left my house thereafter.

He's the same man who had never even uttered a foul word to me in a span of 5 years. The man who handled me with utmost care and pampered me like a child, just harmed physically to an extent where I got bruises from his grip and push.

He called me the same day in the evening to check if I was okay. He was remorseful for being physically abusive towards me.

I told him that I knew I had done a mistake by hiding things from him but it didn't make sense for him to manhandle me, give me bruises and what not.

He was definitely regretful for his actions and very much acknowledged that he had no right to hurt me physically, no matter what mistakes I did.

He promised me that he would never repeat such horrific things in future and I also promised him not to hide anything from him again.

Now, It's been 3 days but We still haven't fully come to terms with each other. Things are still loosened up.

I know he had every reason to be angry at me for the things I hid from him but I am honestly scared of the fact that he could overpower me so easily in such a scary way.

This was probably the only and the most horrible thing he did to me over all these years.

I don't know if I should give him another chance by seeking for couple therapy or just breakup with him, fearing that he might even break my joints and bones someday in future if something worse happens.

\TLDR\- I hid about shifting to another city for better career opportunities and also getting a marriage proposal through my family from my boyfriend. He found it out by himself, manhandled and physically hurt me but also took the fullest efforts later to comfort me.

Should I let it go considering it his first and only mistake?

ANSWER: I know it's a mind fuck because you're thinking that this is the only time in five years. It feels like a fluke, not a pattern, but I still have to caution you: this is what he's capable of at his worst. And if you do ever marry him, "his worst" is probably something you'll see again.

So, even if he's sorry, the problem is that he's capable of losing his self-control to the point of violence against you. It would be too big a risk for me.

QUESTION: My boyfriend (M22) gave me a STI (F19)

Do I break up with him? We have been together for 9 months. I recently figured out new information about his past sex life that he never told me. I felt extremely lied to but he claims he did tell me but I know for a fact he did not. I had him go get an STD test. I have symptoms for gonorrhea. All the results are back besides gonorrhea and chlamydia. I think they are taking longer because they are testing for false positives on those. Obviously i’ll wait for further results but at this point we feel pretty sure cause he has symptoms as well. I really don’t want to loose him but it feels wrong to stay with someone who can be that selfish. If I would have known he had hooked up with people I would have asked him to get tested before sleeping with him but I really didn’t know. (I was a virgin before so it couldn’t have came from me) I just feel so defeated.

ANSWER: If its the same boyfriend thats also following his exs i say throw that man in the bin where he belongs lol. If its not… do the very same thing, in what world would you stay w someone that not only lies to you but puts your health in danger

================================================================================

QUESTION: 26F and 34M - input/curious of how others would respond

My GFs family and where she prefers to live is about 80mins away from where I live. I am currently established with my own home and job (my commute to work is <5mins).  She has no home and has been living at home with her parents. Her job is about equidistant between where I live and her parents (30mins). She is not demanding, but close to it that if we are to stay together I need to be willing to move for her to her home town. I make plenty of money, have said if we were to marry she would not have to work if we lived where my work is, but I feel sad and question level of commitment when I feel so much is being offered on my end.  What feeling might you/others have?

ANSWER: It’s completely understandable that you feel torn. You’ve already built a stable life where you are, and moving 80 minutes away isn’t a small ask ,it affects your work, your routine, and the home you’ve created. Wanting her to meet you halfway emotionally isn’t unreasonable.

It doesn’t sound like she’s manipulating you, but it does sound like the relationship is asking for a major sacrifice from your side while hers remains mostly the same. Anyone in your position would question whether the commitment is mutual.

You’re allowed to want a partner who is willing to compromise too ,not just expect you to uproot your life because she prefers a certain area. A healthy relationship means both people make adjustments, not one person doing all the heavy lifting.

Your feelings aren’t selfish ,they’re realistic.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (19M) girlfriend (19F) doesn't want to do anything sexual with me anymore because she thinks it's bad. No sex, no anything, not even making out.

We both live in the Philippines if that matters. We've been together for more than a year now. We used to hang out a lot (I would visit her) and usually she would be fine doing sexual stuff, she would even initiate sometimes, except sex which I understand. But recently she just stopped, completely. She doesn't want to do anything at all. No touches, no making out, not even dirty talking in texts. Her reason being that it's just "wrong" to be doing it unmarried.

What I don't understand however is why she'd suddenly want to stop doing it after we've already done it multiple times before. Why would she suddenly not be interested? She isn't even religious, she just thinks it's wrong to be doing it. She's fine with masturbating but not fine with doing anything with me. At this point I'm just convincing myself that this is just a phase but it's been like 5 months since we last did something. I've already talked to her about it and she simply refuses to do anything until we get married many years from now. I don't know what to do. Intimacy matters a lot to me, but I don't wanna break up just for that.

TLDR: GF no longer wants to do anything sexual with me just because she thinks it's bad.

ANSWER: "That's completely your choice, but it's not the kind of relationship I'm interested in at all, sorry. Goodbye."

QUESTION: I am (M26) dating a girl (F22) that wants to start seeing others again

Hello all. Me (M26) and her (F22). We have been seeing each other for around 6 months exclusively. She does not want to commit to me as she feels like she may have regrets and wants to explore her options, date other men. So basically going backwards. 

I do like this girl, and thought it was going somewhere so is certainly a shock to me. 

I am pretty stuck what do to in this situation. My mind is constantly going in circles on what I should do. If I should just cut contact and walk away completely or if I should just start dating other girls while keeping in contact with this girl. 

She tells me she does not want me to leave…

What would you do in this situation? 

Update: So I told her I’m not happy with this and I will be leaving. She tried to keep hold of me, saying she does not want me to go. Yet, she would still not commit to me, or take back the idea of seeing others. So nothing changed basically by saying that. I eventually had to block her. That was a very hard thing to do but I think it’s the best course of action here.

ANSWER: The truth is that she's going to do what she wants. You should either leave her or stay with her as a FWB. Bottom line is she's not wanting a serious relationship with you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Not sure how to interpret my (28M) girlfriend's (24F) kink

A couple months ago my girlfriend opened up to me about a kink she has, and we've been exploring it. Basically it revolves around her taking on a mean, degrading role and tormenting me in various ways. Im probably not allowed to be explicit here but that's the general idea 

Inherently, I don't mind the dynamic at all. I'm a big boy twice her size, so I can take pretty much everything she gives me, even the harsh stuff. And I like making her happy, so if that's her thing, I'm very happy providing it for her. 

But sometimes I'm concerned about what this “dark side” might mean, like why she enjoys acting that way and making me go through these seemingly hateful things. She says it's just her thing, but part of me wonders if it comes from some kind of repressed negativity toward me. She's what you could call a baddie, like fairly out of my league, so could it be the expression of a resentment because she feels like she settled and could have better?

Outside of this she's incredibly sweet and affectionate with me, so it feels like a stark contrast.  What do you think?

ANSWER: What is the aftercare like? On a typical night after indulging her kink, when the action is over, how do you interact with each other? If she's affectionate, positive, sweet, appreciative, etc then that probably means it's just a kink. If she's distant, indifferent, or negative then she may legitimately be acting out resentment toward you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Am I (23f) shallow for being unhappy with my boyfriend’s (27m) financial situation?

For context, my boyfriend and I both work at big corporations and earn more than the average wage in our country. We split everything 50/50, which I’m totally fine with since I don’t expect him to cover my expenses.

What bothers me is that I actually wanna do things together as a couple, go on dates, be romantic, and travel once in a while, but he can’t afford to pay his share of anything, so we barely go anywhere. The last time he gave me flowers was back in March too.

He has multiple loans for his car, phone, and a gaming PC, plus a few other “necessity” loans, which I can accept. What I’m unhappy with is that he still spends money on vapes, gaming, and gambling on top of that.

When I brought it up, he told me it’s “not a big deal” and everything will be better in 1–2 years when the loans are paid off. When I told him I don’t want to live like this until then, he said I’m overreacting and not being understanding.

This honestly makes me nervous about the future. If he’s already struggling now, how is he supposed to handle mortgages, kids, emergencies, etc. in the future? What’s gonna happen if I take maternity leave one day?

I really love him, but I’m starting to feel like our lifestyles and priorities just don’t align.

TLDR: My boyfriend and I earn the same and work good jobs, but he’s always broke due to loans and some other questionable habits. He can’t afford dates or trips, and tells me to “wait 1–2 years” until his loans are paid off. Am I allowed to be upset about it?

ANSWER: He doesn't have a healthy relationship with money. Yes, this would continually be an issue as you are not compatible. You can't change him, you either accept it without resentments or move on from him.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I created a fake number and pretending I was her ex M29 F 26 am I trippin?

Context: her and her ex dated for 4 years, he cheated on her with her roommate and 4-5 months after the breakup she got with me. After the first date (I went over to her place) we never leave each others side. I’ve never had an issue with her trust (at first cause she was out of a new relationship and the prettiest/coolest girl I’ve ever seen) but she gained it quickly after going out and seeing how she reacts around men. 

Fast forward 3 years we’ve liven together: we have 2 cats and a dog and an apartment, everything is good until I come into our bedroom from playin some games and she appears to be on the phone but quickly takes it off her ear and seems to be frantic. I was highly skeptic and asked her what she was doing and she says “nothing” and I asked to see her phone she hands it to me. I go to her recently deleted messages and see her ex and her were texting. 
I read the messages out loud her:” I’m going to bed goodnight and sleep well“
Him: “goodnight beautiful
Her: “Look I'm not mad, we're not together but the dumbass comments don't help your situation
Him: “I’ll try to bite my tongue more” (she hearts it) 
Her: “You should call me and tell me goodnight beautiful” 
Him: “I cant call you i think the dnd fucks with it”
and she said that when her and her ex were together a girl used to hit him up and say that. So I guess she was making a “joke” (given he didn’t understand the “joke”) 
She apologized to me and said she will block him. 
The previous text tells me there are deleted messages or phone calls that happened before because when I came in is when she got off the phone (thoughts?)

Fast forward a few months: the messages stilled bothered me, especially since i screenshotted it and sent it to my phone (idk why I did that) so out of terrible desperation to prove to myself that she’s trust worthy I decided to make a fake phone number with her ex’s same area code and texted her saying that he got a new phone. She replied saying “you got a new number huh?” I Asked her to dinner, just one on one (she knows that he knows she has a boyfriend) and she agreed to meet in L.A. I got a little hasty and started asking for more personal stuff ((nudes) to see if she’d send it) it was a terrible decision but thankfully she got mad and told me to never text her again, but later that night called me twice telling me she’s gonna go to bed and said goodnight so I said goodnight (trying to disguise my voice).
[Now]I texted her off the fake number and said “hey” and she said she’s feeling sick and will text back when she feels better” (she is actually sick, cold) 
[back to myself] this was eating me alive so I bring up how I’m self conscious about the text messages from a while back still (not rudely just telling her how I feel) and she almost aggravating tells me how much she already said sorry and she will work on it. And that she blocked him and hasn’t talk to him since that day (original text). Sucks hearing her lie to my face knowing what I know and idk why I dug this deep into this. Opened a big can of worms and now I’m drowning in it. Just any advice or some self help tips to get over this? I think I’m doing to much, I don’t think she’d actually physically cheat on me but I feel like I’m being cheating on. Help

ANSWER: You aren't digging your own grave man you're already buried your relationship is over if she did it once she'll do it again

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (F21) Told My Partner (M25) About An Off Comment His Friend Made And Now I Feel Bad About It? Were My Feelings Valid?

I went to a Halloween party this year with my partner. I was dressed as Velma and he was Shaggy. Everything was going great and I was genuinely having a great time.

At one point I went to the kitchen to grab some water. One of my partner’s friends came in after me. I barely know this guy and he was definitely drunk. He looked me up and down and made a comment about how “cute and slutty” I was and referenced my outfit in a way that made my stomach drop.

Then he followed it up with another comment implying my partner would be excited to “get me out of those clothes” later and that he "would too"  if he was my partner because I "looked like" I needed to be "cracked"... Whatever the hell that means. It just felt uncomfortable and gross.

I left without getting water and went straight back to my partner. I didn’t say anything at the time because I thought maybe I was overreacting. I’ve had friends joke with me before, but they’re my friends, and it never felt like this.

Fast forward to about a week ago...

My partner asked if I wanted to go to THAT friend’s Christmas party. I said no (way too quickly), and he immediately knew something was off. When he asked me to be honest, I ended up crying (I cry when stressed idk...)  and told him what happened.

He got really quiet. Like really very scarily quiet. Then he wiped my tears and asked hesitantly if his friend had touched me at all. When I said no, he looked so relieved then angry again before he stepped outside to make a call. I heard the front door open then slam.

When he came back, he looked resigned. He told me I didn’t have to worry about that friend or the party, and apologized that I felt like I couldn’t tell him sooner.

Now I feel guilty, like I caused unnecessary drama by bringing it up so late. I keep wondering if my reaction that night was valid, or if I made a big deal out of something I should’ve brushed off. I just can’t tell anymore.

ANSWER: You didn't do anything wrong. His hopefully ex friend is a disgusting predator. He's the one who caused this when he made sexual comments to you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: GF (25F) and I (27M) barely have sex anymore. She asked if I'd leave if she never wanted sex again. I don't know what to do.

My girlfriend (25F) and I (27M) have been together for 3 years.

Our first year was amazing, great connection, lots of intimacy, and a healthy sex life. The second year was still good, though things slowed down a bit, maybe because we both entered the part where we work a lot. But now, in year three, it’s dropped off a cliff. Sometimes we only have sex once a month, occasionally a bit more, but never consistently anymore. She always gives me the reason that she’s always stressed at work, or not in the mood, etc…
We recently had a conversation about it. I told her that I miss our intimacy and that sex is an important part of a relationship for me. She said she still loves me and that there are many other ways to show affection besides sex. I agree, but going from regular intimacy to almost none has really affected me emotionally.

Then she asked me a really heavy question:
“If I told you I’d never want to have sex again, would you dump me?”
I froze. I ended up saying, “I don’t know… probably yes,” because I don’t want to lie, and I don’t think I could be in a no-sex relationship long-term. But now I feel terrible and confused.
I don’t want to pressure her into sex. I don’t want her to feel obligated. But I also don’t want to ignore my own needs. I genuinely love her, but I don’t know what to do if our sexual compatibility is disappearing.
Has anyone been in a similar situation?
Is this something couples can work through?
Is it normal for libido to drop like this after a few years?

How do you handle it?
I feel really lost and don’t want to make a huge mistake.

Update :
Thanks for all your answers! Since I really love her, I talked with her and I will give it 3 months if the relationship doesn’t get better, then we will grow appart which gonna hurt me so much since it’s my first relationship… But I guess that how life goes

ANSWER: Sexual compatibility is important. You date to see if you are compatible long term. It seems you aren’t. I personally would end things.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (32F) found explicit screenshots on my (37M) fiancé of 15 years phone. How do I deal with this?

Tl;dr fiancé was sending explicit messages on a hookup site, proceeded to send explicit photos of himself and of me, and then tried to meet up, but got declined. He screenshotted the messages and I found them. Now I don’t know how to confront him about it. 

Sorry, this is a bit lengthy and I’ve tried to explain it the best way I can, so stay with me! 

For background, my fiance and I have been together for 15 years (since I was 16) and have 4 children together. Yesterday, I was going through his photos on his phone (with his permission) and happened to notice there was a new folder with a passcode attached. I couldn’t look at the time since he was there, and I know it was wrong, but later that night after he was asleep I went back and checked. Luckily the passcode is the same as his phone passcode, so it wasn’t any trouble getting in. 

What I ended up finding was just a little shattering to say the least, and i don’t know what to do about it. 

Firstly, they were screenshots from a website exclusively used for male hookups. The thing is, a few months ago I saw something on his phone about this website, googled it and then asked him about it when I saw what it was and he told me it must’ve been a link he’d clicked when looking at a different adult site. I believed him and moved on. 


Secondly, these messages were written as though this is definitely not his first time doing this. They started out saying he was a straight curious man of cross dressing type looking for a future meet up with someone who would like to top. They went back and forth a little and then he asked for contact details to get to know them better. Thankfully the other person said they don’t share details, otherwise who knows how far that would go! 

They then went on to share explicit photos with each other. This then progressed to them both sharing they had girlfriends, and the other person asked for photos. My fiancé sent explicit images of me to this stranger that were meant for him! The guy asked if I’d be interested in a threesome, and my fiancé said I didn’t seem interested whenever it was brought up, which is a shame as he’s quite into doing that (that’s the first I’ve heard!) the other person then sent photos of his girlfriend and my fiancé spoke about how gorgeous she is and how he’s a lucky guy. 


Now, these are screenshots he’s saved, so I have no idea how much further the conversation went, or how it ended. 


I will say this isn’t the first time we’ve had an issue around dating websites, however this is the first time I have had concrete proof, and he’s always explained it away before and I’ve ended up believing him. 


Obviously I’m feeling pretty devastated, and a little bit all over the place. I’m trying to pretend everything is fine, but this feels pretty big, and I feel like my whole life is about to change. I don’t know how to confront this situation, or where to start. I also don’t know if I can even believe anything he tells me as the trust is just gone. 


What bothers me most, is that I wouldn’t even be bothered if he had these curious feelings about men, it’s the fact that not only is he being deceiving, and this to me feels like cheating, he’s also shared images of me without my consent! I also have no idea how many time he’s done things like this over the years, or if he’s actually ever acted on it and physically cheated. 

How do I even begin to deal with this?

ANSWER: WOAH WOAH WOAH, why is everyone glossing over the fact that he also sent pictures of you?! This dude literally committed a sex crime against you!!! Report this sick mother fucker to the police!!!

================================================================================

QUESTION: My 21M bf wants me 20M to shave my legs but I can’t bother and he seems genuinely disgusted by it?

So like the title says, my bf 21m wants me to shave my legs, we have been in a relationship for around a year now and he suggested already in the beginning of relationship, but he didn’t seem to care that much then. Now on the other hand he keeps nagging me to and I just brush it off because I genuinely think it’s unnecessary for anyone to shave their legs, and I think I already as a dude shave allot more then other guys (face daily, armpits, etc).
He shaves absolutely everything though, even his legs what I think is just, eh not that attractive. But he seems really almost obsessed with it, and he genuinely dislikes hair on himself, and well me.

I also tbh don’t wanna shave my legs because well it’s weird for others that a guy shaves his legs, and I’m already the bi guy with a boyfriend.

ANSWER: He’s welcome to his preferences. He’s welcome to ask you to shave. You don’t want to, so don’t. You’ve said no and he needs to drop it. If he won’t drop it, move on. 

Really, it’s like anything else. The purpose of dating is to see if it’s a good fit. People aren’t projects. You can ask for what you want. They can say yes or no. If they say no, it’s a no not an invitation to be coerced or asked over and over.

Seems to me he doesn’t respect your no.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My girlfriend F23 and I m23 have sex once per month


As title suggests I just don’t get why , the sex usually seems great for us both , I make a point to ensure she finishes before I do so she doesn’t go unfulfilled I ask everytime as it’s the last thing I’d want for her … I give oral and try and do as much foreplay as possible were very intimate with kissing and touching in foreplay but on my end she doesn’t touch me ever or give me oral 

We have been together just under 3 years and it used to be more often but quickly went down , I always initiate have never been initiated and for a long period I would attempt to initiate or make innuendos to be shut down consistently so now I just don’t make any attempts I think being consistently shut down so many times made me feel bad I didn’t want to beg or have sex that is a chore I only want it if she wants it and just to clarify she’s never initiated oral or any other method of satisfaction , again I’m not going to ask or even suggest it, when we do eventually have sex she’ll even make comments about how it’s been so long we shouldn’t leave it so long it’s usually around once every 6 weeks has been like this for a year 

We’ve had conversations around this , she is low libido I knew that anyway I wouldn’t say I’m high (I’d be happy with 1/2 times per week ) we’re both busy people with work but it’s started to affect my confidence in myself and this relationship I’m insecure in her attraction to me is it that she doesn’t love me? Or isn’t interested ? 

We have a decent relationship outside of intimacy , we walk the dogs together regularly we communicate well, it is rare we have an argument even if we disagree we can talk it out well, we go out on dates consistently I buy her flowers and gifts she does the same for me I pay her lots of compliments 

Think I’ve explained poorly but I think my main issue isn’t the frequency or the sex itself it’s what the sex stems from or symbolised which is feelings of attraction and passion and of being wanted or loved , the feeling of rejection constantly has made me insecure and not wanting to initiate now I have spoken with her about intimacy issue but not this aspect of it .

What can I do to improve this for us both?

ANSWER: I dont get why people are saying this isnt a low libido, its an issue... i am so happy with sex once a month and i dont think anyone should speak on what is and isnt normal! Everyone is different and not everyone is super into sex. That being said it does sound like your sex drives are incompatible

================================================================================

QUESTION: BF 24M just found out he grew up fundamentalist Christian. How can I 23F support him?

Hey y’all,

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 1.5 years, a year after he moved to USA. He told me last year he’s Christian and plans on remaining so, which I have no issue with, but for the last six ish months we’re just discovering how deep his religious trauma runs. It’s not a “normal” Christian upbringing and so many of our relationship problems have stemmed from his childhood. I try to avoid calling it a cult but it seems to be and even though his parents have apologized for messing him and his three siblings up, it often results in the kids having to give the parents comfort and they haven’t acc changed much (they still attend the same church and the youngest is at a Christian private school now which the family acts like it’s a big change from homeschooling because they “get to be social”). He says he’s separated a lot from the church or believes he has, but he’s SDA and I am not and he still seems ultra strict to me, even though he claims to be a lot less than he was as a kid. He’s realized his home was toxic and other family members have said that his upbringing was far too extreme and child services nearly got involved, but I wanna make sure I’m not over analyzing. We wanna work tgt on it all and come thru strong but tbf it’s been rough most of the time unpacking this so I need an extra set of ears. If anyone could help me unpack what I’ve been noting, that be greatly appreciated. Personal experiences welcome if comfortable sharing!

Thx 🙏

- Sabbath meant not reading or watching anything except the bible and Christian movies (which didn’t differ much from the rest of the week anyways except for the occasional documentary)

ANSWER: I grew up in a similar cult. 

Honestly, he has to want to learn better. If you're hand holding him into realizing it was fucked up, then he's never going to be able to become a full partner. 

He needs to get therapy from a secular therapist with experience in religious trauma. I did. It's the only reason I'm a semi functional adult. Those types of cults tend to also mask massive child abuse. Most people I knew with a similar upbringing were CSA victims. 

In all of this, you should protect yourself. It's not your responsibility to rescue him. It's wonderful if you want to be supportive, but these types of religious groups tend to have nasty beliefs about women and how relationships work. You should make 1000% sure you're safe before you make any permanent commitments, because I have known many people in similar cults who advised people to "missionary date" and pretend to be deconstructing the bullshit in order to lure a partner into the cult. 

Gl and I hope your bf finds his way out safely.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 38F here… with my boyfriend, 38M, for two years. No sex for 6 months, and when I bring it up, he immediately gets defensive. Is it time to move on?

I have been with my boyfriend for two years and our sex life is complete nonexistent. When we first started dating, everything felt amazing, we talked endlessly, had a healthy sex life, he was very attentive and loving towards me. About 4 months in, he changed and was no longer as affectionate with me, arguments about stupid things started, and sex became maybe 1 time every 6 weeks. Now, at 2 years, we’ve gone 6 months without being intimate. We feel like roommates and it’s absolutely breaking my heart. The most confusing part is that he always talks about us getting married, our future together, how much he loves that his family loves me… but it’s like we are just friends. I have tried several ways to try and communicate with him, but he immediately shuts down and gets defensive. He’s given me every excuse in the book, too, so I truly have no idea what’s going on for him. He no longer tries to work out problems with me, and now instead of us against the problem, it’s me attacking him. We just won’t talk for days until I finally give in and try to smooth things out. I’m confused, I’m exhausted, and I feel so alone. Part of me doesn’t feel ready to throw in the towel yet, but another part of me is saying “what the hell are you doing? He is clearly not in love with you.” 

Financially, I cannot move out even if I wanted to. So there’s also that. Also, I should add, sex is about connection in my eyes, raw intimacy, not just the act. There is no other types of intimacy happening either (heartfelt talks, cuddling, etc.).

Thoughts? Feelings? Anyone relate??

Sincerely, 

Stuck, exhausted, lonely but in love.

ANSWER: "I love you, and I want this relationship to work. However, we haven't had sex in six months, and you shut down every time I try to talk about it. Either we talk about it here at home or with a therapist, or I'll have to leave. I don't want a sexless relationship."

================================================================================

QUESTION: My mom (54F) is dating a guy (22M) younger than her and I’m not sure what to do

My mom (54 F) is dating a guy (22 M) and it’s making us all uncomfortable. I am the oldest sibling (34 F) and my siblings (24F, 28M) have all complained to me about how this relationship makes them feel. Especially because we still have a sibling that lives with her (10 F).

She is a bartender on weekends and that’s where they met. She spends the night with him on Fridays and Saturdays after her shift while my little sister is at home with our grandmother who also lives there. (Clearly I hold a lot of resentment towards her not being more present for the little one).

I grew up as a second parent to my siblings. They still come to me for advice/comfort and I love being a part of their support system. It also might be why I never had children though. My mother still calls me sometimes to “talk sense” into the 10 y/o and get her to clean/shower/etc. She already doesn’t pay enough attention to her youngest daughter so my siblings and I try to spend lots of time with her so she’s not always stuck at home

The problem isn’t that she’s seeing someone that young (do what you need to do), but the reason I’m writing this post is because my mom recently invited her boyfriend to her GRANDDAUGHTERS birthday party. My younger brother has a daughter, and our mother let him have the party at her house. They didn’t show up until around 9pm, with gifts for my niece and beers. We were nice to them of course because what can you do. The vibe was weird after they came, and everyone slowly started leaving. My brother pulled me aside to tell me he was SO hurt and annoyed that she brought her boyfriend AND his two EVEN YOUNGER friends without asking first. 

When I confronted my mom about this, her only response was “it’s my house, I didn’t know I needed to ask permission.” I tried talking to her about maybe not bringing men to family gatherings (she brought a random guy to our Christmas last year, and a random guy to my graduation) and she said “he does more for me than my own children do”.  

I just don’t know what to do about this. She’s kind of emotionally manipulative and plays the victim any time I try to talk to her. Do I cut off my relationship with her for a while? Do I just let her be and support her through this? The holidays are coming and it’s tearing me apart. 

Clearly I’m a people pleaser, and it was tough enough just having to confront her about this.

ANSWER: Odds are that the relationship won't last. In the meantime, don't use her house for celebrations. Whether or not you opt to invite her to celebrations you have elsewhere is up to you and your siblings. To be fair, at 9 pm I would expect a 4 year old kid's birthday party to be long over and everyone having gone home. Was she still expecting everyone to still be there at 9 when she came home with her guests?

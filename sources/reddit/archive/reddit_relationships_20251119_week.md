================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend (27M) stays over almost every day but never helps with groceries or bills. How do I(25F) talk to him without sounding rude?



I(25F) need some advice because I feel stuck. My boyfriend(27M) and I have been together for a little over a year. He has his own place, but for the last few months he has been staying at my apartment almost every day. Sometimes he goes home only to pick up clothes or do some chores then he comes right back.

I love having him around. I really do. The problem is that my expenses have quietly doubled and I did not notice it at first. Groceries go way faster. The water and electricity bill are higher. I am the one cooking most nights because he is already here when I get home. He never does it on purpose, but he has slipped into the routine of treating my place like our place without the responsibilities that come with that.

Last week I realized I spent more on groceries than I usually do in an entire month. My rent and bills are manageable when it is just me, but not when I am basically hosting someone full time. I do not want to resent him, but I am already starting to feel irritated when I see the fridge emptying twice as fast.

The hard part is that he is not a bad person. If I asked directly, he would probably help. But I do not want to sound like I am charging him for staying with me. I also do not want him to think I am keeping score. I just want things to feel fair because right now it feels one sided.

How do I bring this up without making him feel attacked or unwelcome? Do I ask for a set amount each month? Do I tell him we should split groceries on the days he stays? I honestly do not know how to word it in a way that does not feel awkward.

I care about him a lot. I just want to find a healthy way to talk about this before it becomes a bigger problem. What is the best way to have this conversation?

TLDR: Boyfriend (27M) stays at my place almost every day and my expenses have increased a lot. He does not help with groceries or bills because we never talked about it. I (25F) want to ask him to contribute but I do not know how to bring it up without sounding rude or making him feel unwelcome.

ANSWER: If he is already there when you get home, why are YOU the one that has to cook? He could at least pull his weight by preparing meals for you if he is already there when you get home from work, like a decent partner would, even if you are paying for the food. I’d be pissed if I got home from work to find my partner had let themselves in, was using my water/power, eating me out of house and home, and still expected me to cook for them while not contributing anything financially or otherwise.

Do you want to live with him full-time? If so, it’s definitely time to have that conversation as he’s making himself very comfortable. Let him know that you care about him and enjoy his company, but if you are going to continue the relationship and build a future together, you need to have a conversation about splitting costs, division of labour and living arrangements. Show him copies of your bills before and after he started spending all his time at your place, and how much you are having to spend on food, and ask him to help you with the costs, because the increases are due to his presence. If you do want to live together, tell him that whatever you both will save in rent could be put towards the shared expenses.

If he is not willing to chip in, then you may want to reconsider this relationship, or at least start spending more time at his place so he can wear some costs. Why is he at your place so much? Do you live alone, and he has roommates or lives with family? Right now, he’s treating you like a free hotel with catering. What exactly is he contributing? He’s living his best life and probably saving himself a fortune by never being at his place or having to buy his own food. I’m guessing you also get stuck with cleaning up after him too?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (36M) bf has made 0 friends or maintained 0 friendships since high school. I'm (31F) his only "friend" and it's wearing me down. What should I do?

As the title suggests, my boyfriend doesn't have any friends and relies on me for all social contact. He can also be really moody which makes it hard for me to know how I can help or respond to this.

For example, yesterday morning I got up for work. He was still asleep and I didn't want to wake him. I went out into the kitchen to start boiling the kettle and when I came back into the room his eyes were open and he was looking away from me and frowning. I smiled and said "oh! good morning! How did you sleep?" And he said "fine yeah" and still wouldn't look at me. I could already sense something was wrong and asked "is something wrong?" He said "why didn't you say good morning to me when you got up?"

I explained that I had thought he was asleep, and of course I would have said good morning if I knew he was awake but didn't want to wake him. He was angry and wouldn't speak to me, saying he couldn't believe I had ignored him when I got up. This turned into an argument and eventually I left to go for a morning walk.



I understand this is a really micro-level interaction, but it happens a lot and I'm getting so tired of this. The moodiness really gets to me. He also won't see a therapist even though he's been saying for almost a year that he will at some point. I see a therapist monthly and try really hard to keep on top of myself and my own emotions etc.



He doesn't have any friends, I mean actually zero friends. He never has had any friends since high school and this puts enormous pressure on me to be everything in his life (I'm 31, he's 36). And I try hard to keep my own friendships going, but it's gotten so hard since I started dating him 3 years ago. Every time I say I'm going out to see friends, he gets moody and gives the same reaction as above - he goes quiet, won't look at me and then says nothing is wrong, but then later on will blow up and say he doesn't understand why I'm seeing xyz, why I feel the need to go out etc. But equally when I ask him to join me, he either says no or goes further and asks why I don't just stay home or do something with him. Then whenever I try to broach the subject with him, he becomes incredibly moody or angry/sad.

I feel like I'm you crazy and I can't take it anymore. I'm feeling so isolated and just...sad. I don't know what to do. I want to leave but every time I say so he gets angry, then cries, then I end up deciding to stay. Meanwhile every time I do, he doesn't change anything and just continues with the moody behaviour. I don't want to be someone else's entire social life, whilst also missing out on my own social opportunities. But I'm scared of losing all the really good things about our relationship, and there are lots of them. I just can't imagine staying with him and getting married or having a kid (he really wants kids whereas I'm more on the fence) - I'd just rather be alone even though I know it'd be hard. Am I crazy? Help?

  
TL;DR I'm feeling responsible for my partner's emotions and entire social life, given he has no social circle and hasn't made any friends or maintained any friendships for the past 17 years. I have my own friends and social circles but am feeling like he doesn't want me to have friends. I don't know whether to leave or if I should  keep trying to work on the relationship. Any advice on what I can do?

ANSWER: There's a reason why he doesn't have any friends and it looks like you're finally seeing it.


Just because you've had a few good moments with him doesn't mean you have to stay with him forever.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (29) boyfriend (30) is deeply enmeshed with his  parents (70 F, 72 M) and he’s an only child. It’s very difficult for me.

I (29F) am in a year relationship with someone (30M) who is very enmeshed with his narcissistic parents (70F, 72M). Our relationship is wonderful,  but it has been absolute hell with his parents, to the point I’ve had to hold boundaries and have gone no contact with his parents. He feels he can’t do this. He often says “they’re all I have” because he’s an only child. 

He’s an only child and I’m his first really serious relationship where we live together, are planning a future, and we’re serious about getting married one day. 

It’s like his parents have always hated me for this and have seen me as taking their son from them. 

His parents financially abuse, verbally abuse, and heavily manipulate my partner… he’s basically like their servant. 

They have made a series of poor financial decisions; overspending, luxury trips, clothes, spending over their means, expensive housing they can’t afford, etc…. They always tell us “we deserve to enjoy life”….. 

They’re in a really bad spot now financially in their 70s and it’s really hard for my partner. His parents are desperate and basically in survival mode now. They’re guilt tripping him and being straight nasty about it all… basically telling him it’s his fault and guilt tripping him constantly to do things for them, financially support them, etc. 

My partner already gave up the house he owns so they can live there for low cost, and I just feel they will always come first. We now pay $3200 in rent together, and while we can afford it, we keep having to make ourselves uncomfortable for his parents, or they throw a tantrum. We have a lot of financial goals we had to adjust now to accommodate for his parent’s poor life decisions. 

It’s directly impacting me now, sometimes I feel it’s time to leave. His parents will always have a hold on our relationship as long as they’re alive and it’s just going to get worse as they age. 

He’s starting to see how his parents are the more he interacts with my healthy family dynamic, and his parents resentment toward me has grown to the point I’ve had to cut them out of my life….. they try to put a wedge between us…..however, I know they’ll always impact our relationship as they are his parents even if I have no contact. Also….his programming runs deep of course over many years. 

Any advice please?

TL;DR: my boyfriend’s parents are very difficult and use him for everything, but do not treat him or me well to the point I’ve cut them off completely. I feel it will never get better.

ANSWER: >(29F) am in a year relationship  
It’s been absolute hell,  
are planning a future, and we’re serious about getting married one day.

I cannot understand why you are planning a future with someone with whom it has been hell with and you've been dating for only a year.

QUESTION: My girlfriend (19F) cancelled my Thanksgiving flight during an argument, and now I’m unsure how to move forward. I’m (21M).

My girlfriend’s mother bought plane tickets for both of us to visit her family in Virginia for Thanksgiving. This would’ve been my first time meeting them, and I was genuinely excited.

A few days after the tickets were booked, my girlfriend and I had a disagreement about something related to her sorority process. She left my apartment upset and we didn’t speak for several hours. We made up the next day, but the following morning she told me she had cancelled my flight during the argument.

She didn’t pay for the ticket herself, and her family already knew I was supposed to come. She still hasn’t talked to her mom or anyone about what happened, so I don’t know if I’m still expected to come or if her family plans to rebook anything. I don’t want to pressure anyone or make assumptions, but the situation left me confused and disappointed.

I’m trying to approach this maturely, but I’m not sure how to communicate my feelings to her or how to move forward when the plans changed so suddenly.

How should I handle this conversation with her, and should I still go if the family decides to rebook the ticket?

TL;DR: My girlfriend cancelled my Thanksgiving flight that her mom bought during an argument, hasn’t talked to her family about it yet, and now I’m unsure how to move forward or whether I should still go.

ANSWER: Maybe next year. They won't be able to rebook for the same cost now, and honestly I would not want to meet her entire family with this hanging over your head.

================================================================================

QUESTION: 43/F Married 13 years. 46/M Husband betrayed me in multiple ways. I’m trying to figure out if people like him actually change or if I should walk.

Tl;dr
My husband lies to avoid conflict. How do I trust him to keep going thru this betrayal torture?

I’m using a throwaway because the details are embarrassing and honestly I don’t want anyone in my life connecting this to me.

My husband and I have been together 15 years, married 13. We have a 9-year-old son. Until recently, I thought we were solid. Not perfect, but solid. Turns out the foundation was rotting under my feet.

Here are the facts, and I’m trying to be fair about my part too. I want real feedback from people who have gone through things like this.

1. The strip club incident.

About six weeks ago, we went to a strip club together after sexy talk at dinner for his birthday. I’d never done anything like that with a partner, but he’s been venting about not frequent enough sex for a couple years so I thought this might spice it up and give us content to fantasize to after. We had a blast the first night though my feelings were a little hurt when he got too into her. He apologized and swore he’d stay sober and keep me emotionally safe next time. The next week, he went way over the line. The stripper touched him, he got “too aggressive,” and he orgasmed during a lap dance. This shattered me. He had just promised me emotional safety the week before. I felt stupid for trusting him.

2. His past and what he downplayed.

He worked in the club scene before we met. Always claimed it was “I worked in the office, just had a few dozen dances, nothing crazy.” Now I find out he’d been sucking strippers’ breasts and doing a lot more than he ever admitted. He has since estimated 50-100 dances over his lifetime when pressed. I’m sure that’s downplaying it too. I didn’t marry a saint, but I did expect the truth vs a picture of an innocent kid. He hid the real story for years. Yes I now know how naive this was of me. But he reassured me of the things that go on at the club when I asked before we went and I felt I’d be safe and he’d just be watching. 

3. The money lies.

Twice he pulled money from a line of credit behind my back. The first time was 2022–2023 which almost led to us divorcing due to the risk, the amount, and the way he wouldn’t take ownership and said he was just “leaning into his business”. He promised he’d never do it again. Then he did it this year—$40k—for a sponsorship he couldn’t afford. Hid that too. Being in finance, I’m held to a high fiduciary standard, so it hits extra hard. 

4. The porn and social media.

Hours a day. While I was drowning in work and parenting. He wasn’t cheating physically, but he was checked out. He deleted a few text messages with a woman he worked with (non-romantic from what he says, but hiding anything at this point hits hard). He has given multiple excuses. 

5. The unnecessary lies.

This one killed me. Our son mentioned a conversation with us all together cuddling in bed about a conversation he had with his dad about my husband’s 4-5 ex-girlfriends. My husband instantly denied ever having the conversation gaslighting my son in the moment. Even when our kid said it happened last week. Was proud my kid held his ground and said “Dad you did say this.” It was such a low-stakes thing to lie about, and he still did it. I confronted him. He doubled down. When cornered, he backpedaled with “I didn’t think it was significant.”

6. Emotional stuff.

He often says he “doesn’t lie,” even when caught. His crying performative. Voice shakes, no tears. It’s hard to explain, but my gut screams he’s faking empathy instead of feeling it. He gets defensive instead of owning his choices. And when he does “own” something, it feels like he’s reading from a script.


Where I’m culpable:

I’m intense. I’m direct. I have a big career and a strong personality. I’m sure that has been intimidating for him. I’ve also been overwhelmed with work, parenting, and philanthropy. That said—none of this justifies lying or betraying someone.


Where I’m innocent:

I didn’t betray him. I didn’t lie. I didn’t do anything that required secrecy or cleanup. My “crime” is being successful and busy. His is breaking trust in every direction.


Therapy:

We’ve been in a therapy marathon for weeks. He journals now because his therapist told him to, not because he chose to. He says he wants to change, but his actions come in short spurts and fall apart fast. He has admitted he doesn’t know know how to show me empathy even after seeing all this pain. That was gutting.


My question:

Do people like this actually change?
Has anyone stayed and seen their partner do a full 180?
Or is this one of those “you already have your answer” situations?

I’ve read about people who are compulsive liars, people who can’t tolerate shame, people who crumble when confronted with their own behavior. I don’t want to raise my son in a home where his dad lies over small things and big things. But I also don’t want to blow up his world if there’s a real chance my husband can actually change.

If you’ve been the betrayed spouse or the betrayer who actually changed, I’d appreciate hearing your experience. What signs were real? What was fake progress? What should I be watching for?

I’m exhausted. I’m hurt. I don’t want to waste another year waiting for a miracle that won’t come.

Stay or go?
What do people like him actually do long-term?

ANSWER: Are you tired yet? I am just reading it. This dude lies at every single opportunity, how can you trust him about anything at all? And if you can't trust him, what's the point? Cut the weight and feel free and happier.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My husband (34M) has started talking down about my (27F) exercise habits, not sure how to approach the conversation

We've been together for 4 years and married almost a year. I was diagnosed with PCOS at 20 and spent my early 20s learning how to manage it. I take medication to manage insulin resistance and I do some form of exercise 5/6 days a week. Usually walking a mile, around 45mins/1 hour on my exercise bike, and I got really into squats this summer so they have been added in. I do the stairmaster when I'm able to physically go to the gym. 

When we got together I had dropped around 80 pounds and was below my original goal weight. He was always very complimentary of this, saying it was impressive that I was able to stick with it and get the results I wanted. I easily maintained my weight the entire time we were dating, it does take time out of my day but I almost always got it done while he was at work so we could hang out. We tried to walk the mile together but he almost never felt like it and I preferred to get it out of the way earlier into the day anyway. My husband isn't massively overweight but he is definitely insecure about his weight, I think he looks great and am happy to support him wherever he's at. 

Since we've married and moved in together he has slowly become less approving of my working out. It didn't happen at first but now it's like he views my very mild exercise as "excessive" and also done incorrectly apparently. He tells me I should do the bike for "15 minutes max, anything past that is not helping you", that my mile walk that takes me 20/30 minutes is "too long, you don't need that much", and finally to me proudly telling him how many squats I did was "You'll need to show me how you're doing it because I know you're definitely doing it wrong" (not even a "great job", also someone taught me years ago but he "doesn't believe it"). 

I've been getting annoyed about this new behavior but trying to push it aside for some reason. I finally got frustrated a few days ago because I was getting dressed to take my walk and he got very upset with me. Pouted and said "You don't need to do that, why don't you want to spend time with me?" We spend almost all of our free time together!!! Plus no one told him he couldn't walk with me, I just knew he was going to have an issue with it. 

I've literally been gaining weight and his criticism is making it hard for me to stay motivated. I've always been so proud of getting on top of my health and I've felt so much better, but lately it feels like punishment. I'm not sure how to approach him, I think he feels unhappy with his body and habits and is pushing these things to me. I want to be kind but I also want to defend myself. My quality of life was so much worse before and I feel hurt and annoyed that it seems he would prefer I go back to that so it doesn't challenge him at all. 

Tl;dr my husband suddenly dislikes my exercise habits and talks about how unnecessary or wrong I'm doing everything. I think it's unhappiness in himself and I want to be respectful to him, but he's not being very respectful to me so I'm not sure how to approach this chat.

ANSWER: My question is why are you pushing this to the side? This should be immediately addressed because he is getting the signal that this is okay. Your exercise habits predate him and are not for him to control. Have the discussion, he needs to stop.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Friend keeps messaging me  20–50 times a week and I don’t know how to handle it

TL;DR - Old friend messages me constantly despite my repeated attempts at boundaries. How do i stop this without being cruel? 

\_\_

Hi all,

  
I (29F) have an old friend who I’m not very close with anymore (39M). We worked together for about a year when I was 18. We don’t hang out, I don’t really think about him day-to-day, and I usually reply maybe once every few weeks. But he sends me constant messages - mostly Facebook reels - literally every day. Sometimes it’s 10 a day, and recently I opened Messenger and saw 54 unread messages from him.

I haven’t replied in about 3 weeks. He keeps messaging anyway, and today he sent things like:  
“I don’t think you like me anymore haha you talk to me like once a month.”

He’s also asked if he could visit me while he’s in the area (I didn’t respond), and he keeps pushing past hints that I’m busy or not very active on Messenger.

For context, he has bipolar disorder and can be very intense and emotional. A few years ago when I tried to set boundaries, he told me he cried in the shower because he thought he was “losing me,” which made me feel horrible. I don’t want to hurt him or be cruel, but the constant messaging makes me uncomfortable and I don’t feel close enough to him to manage his emotional reactions.

I don’t want a big confrontation or to send a harsh message - but I also don’t want to reinforce this by replying and starting the cycle again. I've sent a couple of messages over the past year or so just saying 'Hey man, im not on facebook much" or other things along those lines. He just doesnt take the hint to stop messaging. Its relentless. 

What’s the healthiest way to handle this?

  
Is it OK to just stop engaging at all? Should I send a short boundaries message? Mute him? Block him?

  
If you’ve dealt with something similar, what worked for you?

ANSWER: So dude has been overly attached to you since you were 18 and he was around 28. Without you encouraging it at any point by hanging out or entertaining himself outside of the workplace. And it's been 10 years and he's still going.

This is actually pretty damn creepy and scary. I agree with the longer comment advising you to get your ducks in order safety wise but I would also download or screenshot as much of your message history as you can in case you need to take the problem to law enforcement. Emphasize the very earliest interactions. The ones where you were 18 and he was nearly 30.

Be safe please!

================================================================================

QUESTION: My HUSBAND Always does STUPID experimental stuffs, how not to get ANGRY?

I am F(27) and my husband is M(28). Married for more than 2 years. My husband is a very clumsy person. He easily gets distracted. He says that he has ADHD, I also think that. But it is getting really stressful for me. He is not that careful with his spending. He tries to be careful, but the things he does ends up costing us more money. Recently, his mac was heating up when he worked on it, he saw from a yt video that suggested a small repair. So, to save money he ordered the kit for himself to fix it on his own. We are immigrants and every penny counts for us. I told him that even if it costs a little more he should go to a professional for these stuffs as he has no prior experience. He said yes i think you are right but ended up doing what he thought initially and damaged a more expensive sensitive part instead of fixing it. Now it might cost us 10-20 times more to repair that. This is just an example he keeps doing things like that and I am always stressed or anxious about him constantly about whatever he does. Even if I show anger because of that he did not listen to me he says that I am nagging and it is not right. If I can't say anything good in these typpa situation I might just stay quiet. His ADHD is increasing my anxiety and stress levels. What can I do to fix his these type of behaviours so that he takes more mature decisions and thinks maturely and logically before doing something. So that I no longer have panick attacks.

 TL;DR My husband is always doing immature things and making immature decisions, I am getting hyper anxious day by day, what should I do?

ANSWER: 1. You're not having panic attacks. That is very different from being frequently angry with a spouse and having anxiety over money.

2. You can't "fix" him.

3. Your husband \may\ have ADHD -- has he actually been diagnosed? -- but "disregarding my partner's concerns" is not a symptom of ADHD. That's just a spouse being a jerk.

So the first thing I'd do is encourage your husband to actually get checked out for a formal diagnosis. If he has a problem that prevents him from being functional in certain ways that are very important to you, medication and teamwork to change how you divvy up tasks (like who is responsible for repairing a broken laptop) are things you can get from counselors who deal with people with these problems. I don't think it's helpful for you (or him) to pathologize all your relationship issues as being caused by a mental health disorder your husband may not even have. If he does, then HE has to do the work here, and YOU have modify your expectations and behaviors so that you find a dynamic that works for you.

As for the rest of it, when you say you're constantly stressed or anxious about what he does, that's a really bad mental state to be in. You can't parent a grown man. What are some practical things you can do to protect yourself from the impact of his impulsive decisions? (e.g. take over managing the household money) How about some emotional things you can do? (e.g. don't clean up his messes, leave the area and go someplace quiet away from him, etc.) 

Does your husband CARE that you are having all these conflicts? And how did you resolve conflict before you got married? Surely this didn't just spring up out of nowhere.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Moved in with my boyfriend (23M) 3 months ago and I’m (22F) drained. Should I move out while he’s gone?

My boyfriend and I moved in together about three months ago, and ever since then I’ve felt completely overwhelmed. Before living together, things were great. But now I’m doing almost all the housework while working fully onsite, and he works hybrid and still barely handles his small chores unless I remind him multiple times. Whenever I bring up how stressed or frustrated I am, he says I’m “attacking” him or blowing things out of proportion. 

Today I rushed out the door late for work and accidentally tipped over my sock drawer, and instead of being understanding, he texted me during lunch pointing it out in a passive aggressive way, even though I silently clean up after his messes every day. It made me realize how imbalanced things have become and how little accountability he takes. We’re going to be apart for a month starting Sunday, and I’m thinking about staying in an Airbnb until he leaves, then going back home when he’s gone and possibly moving out while he’s away so I can think clearly. I still care about him and would give the relationship another chance, but living together has brought out issues that are really draining me. Am I overreacting, or is this a sign we’re incompatible living together?

TL;DR: Since moving in with my boyfriend, I’ve ended up doing almost all the chores while he gets defensive whenever I bring it up. Today was my breaking point, and I’m considering moving out while he’s away for a month. Not sure if it’s dramatic or the right move. What should I do?

ANSWER: Get out now while you still have your fire, because it gets a lot harder to leave once you’ve forgiven him two or three or twenty times. It does not get better, seriously. This is supposed to be the honeymoon period of living together. It’s the best it will ever be, right now.

I (28M) often find myself in this position where bonding with my dad (63M), I might say something conversational and it gets interpreted as me not having a good time.

For example, I come over so we can watch films together over dinner, and let's say we watch a movie and even though I liked the overall film, I might say, 'It was good. It kind of dragged at points but it was a great narrative.'

Somehow that gets translated into him profusely apologizing: "I'm so sorry I made you watch that. I liked it, I just thought you might, but I won't make you watch any more-"

As much as I try telling him that I did like it, he doesn't seem to hear me. It's like one wrong move, and suddenly, it's all over. My mom is pretty similar, but right now, I'm focusing more on my dad.

This has happened across several experiences throughout my life and unfortunately, we're not that close. I want to be closer, but I feel anxious about saying anything around him. Anyone experience anything similar?? How do you get around it??

TL;DR: I want to bond with my dad, but even small comments make him fret and over-apologize. I feel anxious speaking around him and don’t know how to communicate honestly without upsetting him.

ANSWER: How does he react if you just mention what you liked about it? 

One of my colleagues wrote a book that was . . . okay, but not that great. But it did have a really strong sense of place, and when I said that I'd read the book, I pointed that out. He then said he was really happy to hear that, because he'd worked really hard on that, and it turned out that I didn't have to say anything else at all.

It sounds like your dad has some insecurities. Have you seen this show up in other ways, with other people in his life?

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (32f) am being made to choose between my ex con (34m) brother in law or the rest of my in laws by my mother in law (51f)

I really need advice here. Please help! Names in the story have been changed for anonymity.

I'm a 32f and have been married to my husband, Lucas (32m), for almost 7 years. We dated long before that, basically since we were both 18. I was a co-worker with his mom Bella(51f) when my husband and I were still dating, and so we've always been pretty close. My mother in law tends to keep my son(7m) with her over the weekends because she loves him and loves spending time with him doing fun things he'll enjoy. I've been accepted into Lucas's extended family with open arms and feel very welcomed by everyone. They may not always understand me and I may not always understand them, but we try and are always there for each other. 

As a child, my brother in law, Tom (34m), hung out with the sorts of people that got involved with drugs and gang related activity. Lucas was then made to be the responsible one in the family in Tom's place and basically become a mini adult to help raise/care for his cousins and younger brother while his mom and the aunts worked on their careers. It was a turbulent household with an abusive man married to my mother in law, which had a big effect on the kids. Tom would basically do what and go wherever he wanted.

I've been told that Tom was doing drug deals, tried to pretend to be my husband when he'd gotten arrested one time, (thank God a family member was able to set that straight), broke into his mom's house when he wasn't supposed to be there, got shot in a drug deal gone wrong and has stolen someone's car. And those are just the things that I've been told about. There's most likely much more.

After the drug deal gone wrong, Tom was sent to prison for a few years. He got out, and within just a few months, he stole someone's car which broke his parole and was sent back to jail. So now he's been in jail for at least 5 years. (Sorry, I haven't been keeping track of exact dates.) Now he's out of jail again and has been since sometime in July of this year, I think. And that was when the initial issue started. Not with my brother-in-law but with my mother-in-law. 

I believe that Bella truly does love her children, but I also feel like she has a large amount of guilt for how her son's life turned out. I think that she's trying her best to make up for lost time as quickly as possible. However, she's doing it in a way that's making others uncomfortable and is pushing other family members' boundaries. 

Around when my brother-in-law got out of jail, my husband's entire extended family had been planning a trip to a water park together for an Aunt's birthday and everyone was looking forward to it for almost a year. However, Bella tried to insist that we invite Tom, too. Some of my husband's family are in law enforcement and have young children. They were not comfortable with that idea, especially with him so freshly out. My mother-in-law then tried to dig her heels in and say that if he couldn't come then she wouldn't come, and then the aunt that was putting on the entire trip for herself and the family almost canceled the whole thing over the drama! Luckily, my mother-in-law saw reason before we left, Tom didn't come and the trip stayed on. 

Which brings us to the problem that I'm having now: Bella is trying to plan her own Thanksgiving away from the rest of the extended family because Tom isn't invited. And that would be an okay choice for her to make. However, my husband and I are now being made to choose sides. Either we support my mother-in-law and Tom, or we support the boundaries of the rest of the family. I don't really know what to do. Honestly, I don't like Tom. From what I've heard about him, and how I hear him talk to Bella, Lucas and my son (7m), I just don't like him as a person. Even without the crimes he's committed, he's rude and selfish. If he was not related to my husband, I would never be around him. But my mother-in-law is making this extremely personal. She insists that Lucas, my son, me, my other brother in law Dax(22m), Tom, his daughter (14f) and his daughter's mom Angel (??f) all forfeit going to the annual extended family Thanksgiving. 

I don't believe that this is a fair choice, especially for my young son. Usually, at the big extended family Thanksgiving, all of the kids play together all night, watch holiday movies and then write out their Christmas lists to Santa. We all play family games like charades or trivia. All of the adults exchange white elephant slips to know who they're buying for that year. Then all of the adults plan on Black Friday shopping to try and knock out most of the lists. I don't see how making my son sit with a bunch of adults awkwardly all night it's supposed to help anything or show support. 

And did I mention that I have my own family's Thanksgiving to attend? Every year it's a struggle to balance two separate Thanksgivings on the same day but we somehow manage. Now I have all of this added stress to the decision making and need to essentially choose to do three Thanksgivings or upset someone by not attending one of theirs.

I tried to appeal to my mother-in-law to ask if maybe we could get together with Tom on a different day, and tried to explain that the family just needs time to see whether or not he's changed and to rebuild trust with him. That he made a series of poor life decisions and that these are the consequences. I'm not saying that he shouldn't have a Thanksgiving with the family members that want to support him right now, I think that that's very good of Bella to want to do. I just think that she is letting her emotions cloud her judgment and that this could be the start of a rift between the family and unnecessary tension. My son cried today when he heard that we wouldn't be going to his cousin's house this year and it broke my heart. I think I'm leaning toward choosing to go to the extended family's Thanksgiving, now, instead.

How will future holidays go? Christmas? Easter? Birthdays? Anniversaries? Etc etc.

Not to mention that my mother-in-law is lashing out and has essentially said that she doesn't care what me and my son do, but that she expects my husband to attend her Thanksgiving because she would hope that all of her sons would want to spend the holidays with her. So now she's trying to keep my husband with her. How is that fair to my son and I!? I don't know what to do! I have so many past traumas, current mental health issues and people pleasing tendancies that this is really putting a strain on me. My husband is very non confrontational and hates that he's being forced into choosing.

Lucas has already tried to discuss this with her but she still insists on doing it this way. When my husband first told me about her plans, I expressed how upset that I was and how unfair it was for our son and he agreed. But he still wants to support his mom, even if he doesn't have a good relationship with his brother and isn't super close with his mom. He doesn't know what to do, and neither do I. I don't know what Lucas will choose to do.

Please, I'm begging for advice or people's perspectives! I really need help!

Tl;Dr:

My mother in law wants us to choose between her awful son or the extended family Thanksgiving tradition this year since he just got out of jail. Help!

ANSWER: I would choose not to spend my thanksgiving with an asshole or the woman trying to force me to do so. Your husband needs to step up, this is his family to deal with.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Married within a year, and now I’m seeing red flags I ignored before — how do I handle this? (27F/33M)

Hi, this is a long read. Bear with me. Im a 27/F. My husband is 33M and we’ve been married for a year. I’m looking for some advice on how to handle this situation. I feel like I have no one to talk to, and I really need to vent while also getting someone’s perspective.

My husband and I got engaged and married all within a year. Everything happened pretty fast, but we both deeply desired marriage. Now that we’re married, some of the subtle red flags I noticed before are starting to repeat themselves.

My husband is very paranoid. He often assumes I’m cheating or doing something shady when I never have and never would. We attend church, and he gets upset when I put effort into my appearance. He assumes I’m dressing up to seek attention — even though I keep to myself at church and rarely engage in conversation unless I have to.

A few weeks ago, he went on a brief trip. While he was away, I booked a hair appointment. He became upset, saying I must be getting my hair done to entertain another man while he was gone, and created a whole argument about it. The truth is, that was the only available appointment time.

When he returned from his trip, he inspected the entire house, looking for signs that I had company while he was gone. In the past, he has often asked to look through my phone — and I’ve allowed it because I have nothing to hide.

If a man at church looks my way, or if he sees me glance at someone, he interrogates me and asks if I know them or if I’m trying to get attention. He frequently asks about my whereabouts, even though he has my location and I’m always transparent about where I am and what I’m doing.

One particular incident stands out — I was on my way to a church meeting (I serve at church), and I left early because I like to be punctual. He called me and told me to come back, accusing me of leaving early to mingle and potentially meet other men.

These are just a few examples of many similar incidents that have occurred. He says he wants to change and asks me to give him time. I believe he’s genuine in that desire, and he truly does have amazing qualities. Every time he realizes he’s wrong, he apologizes. I understand that change takes time, but when these episodes happen, he becomes a different person — angry and loud. And it honestly scares me. He’s not physically abusive but I’ve become so anxious around him. 

I don’t know if I should wait it out or leave. He plans to seek therapy, but hasn’t yet. He says he can fix the issue himself, he just has to be self aware. I want to give him a chance, but I also know this behavior could get worse once kids are involved. I’m torn and don’t know what to do.

TL;DR: My husband and I married quickly, and now his paranoia and constant accusations of cheating are becoming overwhelming. He says he’ll get therapy, but I’m torn between waiting it out or leaving.

ANSWER: Please leave if he doesn't treat his insecurities- he's being extremely controlling and  isolating you, the first steps towards more physical abuse.

================================================================================

QUESTION: After 4 years together still no proposal. How long do I continue to wait?

I’ve (39F) been with my BF (37M) for four years and we’ve been living together for over two. Before I gave up my apartment and moved into his house, I asked where he saw our relationship going and his timeline for commitment. He said if after a year of living together everything was going well, we’d get engaged. This matched with what I wanted, so I moved in.

A year passed and no proposal. I bring up the conversation we had before I moved in and he said he’s saving up for the ring. Then his friend asked us if we were going to get engaged, and my BF said yes, soon. So, I was reassured we were still on the same page.

Then we get to two years living together, and still no proposal. The type of rings I like are not expensive, and with his salary I know he would have saved up enough by then. Then his brother got engaged after only two years with his GF. I know all relationships have their own timelines, but the news made me reflect. So, I straight up asked my BF why he hadn’t proposed.

At first his excuse was that planning a wedding was such a hassle. This didn’t ring true, so I said I thought he wasn’t being honest. Then he confided some struggles with his mental health and fears that I would grow resentful of ways he couldn’t contribute to the relationship due to them. I was surprised because those things are not deal breakers for me, I’m not upset by them, and I don’t think I’ve ever expressed resentment.

He said he’d thought about returning to therapy to work on things and asked me to give him some time. I agreed, but he’s not forthcoming if/when his appointments are or what he’s working on – which I understand I have no right to know. He’s allowed to keep his therapy private if that’s what’s best for his therapeutic journey. But, I wish I had some insight to know my waiting will be worthwhile.

I don’t question his struggles, but I’m having a hard time believing he’s not just stalling. He’s expressed some reservations about me, mainly that I’m not social enough, especially with his family. I’m a super introvert, but I’ve really tried with his family. I once expressed a worry that his family mistook my shyness for disinterest, but he assured me they understood and liked me, so I don’t know what the problem is.

My other doubt is that he talks about doing things and often doesn’t follow through. Like, he’s been saying he was going to take me on a weekend trip since the first year together, but he’s never done it. During the same time he’s planned and gone on four trips with friends and family. I don’t doubt that he would enjoy a trip with me, he just doesn’t care enough to actually plan it.

Recently, we went to his friend’s wedding, and another of his friends asked if we’re getting engaged, and my BF again said soon. I just don’t believe it anymore. I don’t doubt his love for me. We do a lot of stuff together and he’s physically affectionate. But I can’t ignore this feeling he doesn’t want to marry me and never will. I don’t think he wants to break up, but he also doesn’t want to commit.

I get upset about this every other day and I’m just so tired. I’m nearing forty and just want to know he wants to be my life partner. I feel four years is plenty of time to know someone. I have been open and transparent about who I am and what I have to offer. I don’t know how much longer I can wait around for him to decide to commit.

Do I stick around and see if he ever proposes, or follow my gut and cut my losses?

TLDR: After four years BF has not proposed even after saying multiple times he was planning to. Explanations are weak and I'm questioning if he'll ever do it.

ANSWER: I think it's time you look for your own apartment and move out. He is just stringing you along. Just consider: there is no actual factual reason he can't propose to you - the only valid explanation is that he just doesn't want to. It's heartbreaking that he stole the four years from you that were vital if you wanted to have children - I really hope you don't, because that would make it so much sadder. 

Anyway, he's telling you loud and clear that he is not going to marry you - time to accept that and move on. You will be much happier once you're free from his push/pull mindgames.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Fiancé (31M) threw me (29F) under the bus to our friends


My fiancé and I are thinking about going to this music festival in a few months. We’re planning for it now since tickets go on sale tomorrow. We both really want to go, but money is the issue. Not only are we planning our wedding, but we are going to be renovating soon. As well as I have some debt I keep trying to pay off. I can’t pay it off since things like this keep coming up and we don’t wanna miss out. 

Anyways, today in our group chat with our 4 other best friends (who know about my money struggles and us needing to save) we were chatting about renting an RV vs tent camping and I mentioned that I wanted to do whatever was cheapest since we’re a little tight on cash right now. I also mentioned that if that wasn’t an issue, we would do the RV in a heartbeat and I wanted to compare costs. I will add; I’ve never been the friend to complain about costs. In fact, I’ve always been really down and that’s how I’ve found myself in some hot water with debt. I’m only being “stingy” because I haven’t been able to pay it off and we’re planning a wedding and such 

My fiancé and I were texting separately about all of this and he even agreed with me- even stating this wasn’t even worth it, he’d rather go on a vacation, he doesn’t mind tent camping and we could bring all our own stuff etc. We ended up saying that we would chat more about it later when he got home so we were on the same page. BTW the cost difference with tent camping vs RV would be 400-500$ total. 

Our group chat kept popping off about the RV and I sent a text saying “Fiancé and I are going to chat more about it tonight and get back to you guys”. My fiancé then messaged me separately saying “stop telling them about money problems, you’re making us sound poor”. I apologized and said I wouldn’t mention it again. He then proceeds to text in our group chat saying “oh yeah by the way we’re for sure doing the RV, that makes the most sense” and just completely threw me under the bus. 

I got super pissed at him because wtf we literally were just chatting about it and he acted like he would have my back. I totally felt like I was the bad guy/the only one not 100% about the RV. It especially sucked because everyone else is like “what why wouldn’t we do the RV?” And are all gung ho about it. He told me that he didn’t want our girl best friend thinking we didn’t want to do it and he sensed she was upset we were on the fence about the RV so he said that… I literally was like so you’re putting her potential feelings over my feelings? I am the one struggling to pay off my debt and trying to be smart. 

I’m so annoyed and frustrated with him. How do I approach this with him? 

Tl;dr my fiancé threw me under the bus with our friends

ANSWER: The way he talks to you is problematic. He can convey his thoughts and feelings without cussing at you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How can you really start to accept that people won't change? (Relationship with ADHD)

The relationship between me (28F) and my boyfriend (31M) is pretty decent overall. Our communication is good for the most part, we can be very honest with each other, we respect each other and act usually very supportive of the other. We've been together for 5 years now.

One thing I cannot get behind though is the fact that he has some traits and qualities I cannot change and which will, very likely, never change. Most of our arguments are about the same topics. Often times it's about his lacking degree of emotional regulation towards inconveniences or stress in general. He frequently uses me as an 'emotional dumpster' when he wants to vent about the world and whatever happened to him that upset him (note: not all of these things are really overblown and unreasonable as my wording might make it seem). Recently this happens a lot more frequently and it's exhausting.

He's already in therapy because of depression and ADHD (already medicated). I know that emotional regulation is especially hard for people with ADHD and this is what makes this so incredibly frustrating. I'm at a point where I don't wanna hear about all these same things anymore that bother him. He's just venting about it at me, not changing anything (e.g. talk to the person at work that actually upset him) or trying to work with his emotions to not always react this hard (which again, might not even be possible). To add some extra salt to the wound: He formed a new friendship with another person at work which is all fun and giggles all the time. So basically, he comes home, tells me how much fun he's had with this person and what cool stuff they've been doing this day, and then starts to vent. It feels like I'm being served all the negativity he's built up over the day, and this person is experiencing all the fluffy joy he has to offer instead (he's a very fun and goofy guy when he's not venting and marinating in his own misery). Yes, it's honestly the first time in perhaps 10+ years I felt some sort of jealousy.

I've voiced my wish for not being used as his private therapist all the time many, maaany times. He always apologizes and wants to better himself. Never does. We also get into other discussions about the same stuff over and over again, too. Also mostly related to his ADHD (cleaning, putting some effort into planning special days like anniversaries). In general, he's apologizing all the time and I believe him but at this point I can almost predict the words that come out of his mouth every time we're having this conversation.

A part of me feels like 'well, it's the ADHD, suck it up. If you like him, YOU have to find a way to deal with all this, not the other way round'. Another part, that has a lot of old childhood trauma mixed into this emotional response, screams at me that I cannot accept my boundaries not being heard. I don't want to go into details of my backstory, let's just summarize that I've had my fair share of therapy to work through this independently. I feel stable and pretty safe in that regard. But these two backgrounds—one person with ADHD, one with former PTSD—feel like a nightmare to mix.

Is anyone out there, perhaps with the same combination in their relationship, who can perhaps offer some advice? How can I not get triggered by making the experience of 'nothing will ever change, just swallow your anger and adjust your needs' over and over? It goes heavily against what I learned back then in therapy. All of this is really sucking the light out of our relationship. The fun times get less and less, all this 'drama' is leaving me so exhausted and depressed. One part of me is slowly giving up, since it all seems so hopeless to me. Please, offer some advice.

TL;DR: ADHD boyfriend (in therapy & medicated) constantly uses me as emotional dumpster + we have the same arguments over and over to no avail. Therefore getting depressed myself since I feel like I just cannot expect any change at all + this heavily triggers some of my former trauma memories of helplessness.

Edit: Adjusted TL;DR

ANSWER: By ending the relationship. I have severe ADHD and it's my job to manage/regulate my emotions and symptoms. I don't get a pass to shit on people who love me.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (26F) need a reality check before I move cross country with my ex (29F).

Five years ago, I was married to a man while discovering my queer identity. He was supportive simply because he was a horny man and loved to imagine it, and encouraged me to explore. That is when I met Zoe through a queer dating app.

During the pandemic, our connection developed quickly and deeply. We had virtual cooking nights, painted together, planned creative dates, and all from opposite coasts. By the end of the year, we each separated our partners as we each wanted to do for years, and she moved across the country to be with me. For a week, it was magic. Then reality hit.

Despite sharing important values and perspectives, we were wildly different: our personalities, family dynamics, and ways of handling conflict clashed hard. I was going through a divorce and struggling in a conservative town where neither of us felt safe. Fights turned volatile, once even physical as she hit my throat when she was triggered as she thought I called her stupid during an argument. After nine chaotic months, we moved apart but kept talking.

Over the next couple of years, we tried to heal. Therapy helped me and she turned to secretive spiritual communities and meditation programs. That secrecy, along with our fundamental differences, always left me feeling confused, awkward, and divided (granted, I often feel that way as a person anyway).

In recent months, she asked me to be her girlfriend again. Things were calm and steady, though not romantic. No hand holding, no cuddling, separate rooms, but an awkward “dance” through our individual routines near each other each day. We’ve become great friends and roommates, sharing our lives but without intimacy. Still, I hoped our peace meant progress — and I was content as we had a great balance at home, and we each lived as our holistic, sober, celibate selves comfortably around one another.

Then, when prompted as I was in desperate need for clarity, she told me the truth: she doesn’t want a romantic partnership with me. She cares deeply, but she feels fear and sadness for me: for my small support system, my sensitivity as autistic person, my autoimmune conditions, and how we’ve impacted each other over time. It hurt, but I finally had clarity.

Now we are supposed to move to her hometown this spring, as we’ve planned for over a year, to care for her family that needs consistent care. On paper, it makes sense. We coexist well as friends and co-parents to our cats. But part of me knows I’d end up feeling alone and resentful while she’s surrounded by family.

I could instead move back to my home coast to be closer to the few family members I’m close with. It would mean living alone for the first time in my adulthood, which terrifies and excites me in equal measure. It feels like a real beginning. It feels like I finally would be able to be in my own orbit rather than someone else’s.

I think I already know the answer, but I can’t help second-guessing myself:

Would it be foolish or selfish to choose independence and move on my own instead of following her to support her, and care for her family?

— 

TL;DR: My partner of five years and I planned to move to her hometown across the country to care for her family in the spring. She let me know that she is not interested in me romantically, but wants to remain as the good friends we are. Do I make the move I promised to make or move for myself for the first time in my adulthood?

ANSWER: > It feels like a real beginning. It feels like I finally would be able to be in my own orbit rather than someone else’s.


This sounds like an opportunity too good to pass up.

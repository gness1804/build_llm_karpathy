QUESTION: Update: My (32F) husband (36M) became a robot and I don’t know how to help him.


[original:](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hlgv6r/my_32f_husband_36m_became_a_robot_and_i_dont_know/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Hey everybody, here’s the update. I wrote this a couple days ago but couldn’t post it because it was too soon. 

My husband came home at around 6 o’clock, and after he had something to eat I took him to the bedroom to talk. 

I sat him down on the bed and told him I was worried about him. I didn’t know exactly how to phrase my worries so I just showed him my original post. 

When he finished reading the post he starting crying, like full on crying. In all the years that I have known this man, I had never seen a tear roll down his eye. I held him for a few minutes until he could recompose himself, and he told me everything. 

He told me that the world was in a “shitty place” right now, and that we’re bringing a child into a stressful time. 

He said when I became pregnant he felt he had to step up. He needed to take care of things because it was his responsibility. 

He said that the weight of carrying the family was so much harder than he anticipated so he thought if he “doubled down” he could get through it. But the more he tried the “darker the tunnel got” and eventually he couldn’t see an end. 

He said that he feels like he’s “constantly drowning, and the only breath of fresh air is on the car ride between home and work.”

He said that sometimes the stress is so much that he throws up, but doesn’t tell anyone and instead keeps going with his day. He then pulled out a pack of gum from his pocket and said “this was for when it happens.”

I asked him why he couldn’t tell me any of this, and he said he didn’t want to “burden me with the truth.”

He said that, he thought if he told me everything, that I would stop seeing him as a “protecter and provider”, and that I would inevitably stop loving him. 

Hearing him say that brought tears to my eyes because I didn’t know where he got the notion I would feel that way. 

I asked him if he wanted to quit his job but surprisingly he said the job doesn’t bother him. He said the work in of it self was fine. It’s just now he feels an added weight to provide because not only was he fortunate enough to keep his job in the pandemic, but we also had a kid on the way. 

He said that some days he feels like packing a suit case and running to some tropical island for a week and not telling anyone. But then he feels guilty and doubles down even more. 

I told him that maybe he should go on a trip. I said that he deserved a break, and maybe if he did exactly that he’d feel better. He tried to protest, but I insisted. In the end said that he’ll only go, if we go together. Like a romantic get away between spouses. 

Once things start to clear up and before the baby is due, he wants to take a week off from work, drop the kids off at Grandma’s house and have us go on a vacation. Just the two of us, like we used to when we first got married. 

He also said he wants to take the day off tomorrow and just sleep in, so that’s the plan. I’ll call his boss tomorrow and say that he’s sick and can’t come in, it’s not like they’ll make a sick man come in to work. There’s a pandemic going on :). 

Right now he’s playing with the kids and it doesn’t feel like he’s doing one of his chores. He actually seems to be enjoying himself.

For the first time in months I don’t see the robot, I see my husband.

Edit: Hey everyone, I want to thank you all for the support. I read all of your comments, and I appreciate all of you. 

I didn’t expect this to get so much traction, so I want to clarify some things. 

First things first, my husband says hi. 

1.  I wanted to clarify about the chores people are taking about. I want to say that I know as a SAHM the bulk of chores goes to me. I cook and clean and do laundry because I know it’s my responsibility. My husband’s only chores are doing dishes, vacuuming every three days, and a few other “house maintenance” stuff. 

2. I did in fact call in sick for my husband, but I made sure that I said he had a migraine. I saw on google that it wasn’t a symptom of COVID if it was an isolated symptom. His boss was okay with it and said he can come back whenever he feels better. 

3. The pregnancy wasn’t an accident. We both did want to have 3 kids because we were both raised in 3 kid families. We actively tried for the first 2, but for baby number 3 it was kind of a “if it happens it happens” kind of thing. We’re both happy with the amount of kids we have/ will have and are hopefully done. We are not considering abortion nor adoption. 

4. We realize that a one week vacation isn’t enough to get rid of his stress and are both trying to come up with a solution that alleviates his stress in a more sustainable way. Right now we’re thinking about setting up an hour or 2 a day that’s, “daddy’s time.” No kids, no me, no work. Just for him to relax. 

5. To those of you who think this fake; there isn’t any way I can change your minds about this situation so I’m not really too bothered. I just hope you this never happens to you guys. 

You all have been supportive and really a wonderful bunch of people. I really think we can get through this, and it wouldn’t have been possible without you guys. 

I’m not going to reply to comments because, like last time, it’s an overwhelming amount. But just know I’m reading these as they come in. 

Goodnight everyone, it’s been great.

ANSWER: As someone whos come out the other side of this i think you could not have handled this better than you have. I actually felt a bit emotional reading this so well done.

I think a break from work is a big one and its very hard to work out whether the stress coming from the job is simply he's working to much or that the specific company is burdening him.

A day off followed by a week away with no responsibility so he can recharge his batteries is well due but i think after that week knowing what feelings going back to work has will be the key to whether he should be looking for another company. If all he feels is dread then looking for a job whilst remaining at the company will give him a new take on life. Its a scary thought, especially if hes been there a while and/or gained ranks but even a lateral move should help his mental health.

In general i think youve now set tje tone that you two can discuss these things and work to positive outcomes and it sounds like you've got the material for a long happy marriage, i wish you well in everything in the future.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My girlfriend told me she was with a friend, but that friend was with me picking out an engagement ring. How do I confront my girlfriend about her lie?

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hi97h9/my_girlfriend_told_me_she_was_with_a_friend_but/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Hey guys! Oh my god, where to begin! My last post got WAY more attention than I could have ever imagined. Suffice to say, it was a tad bit overwhelming. Seriously, the amount of people begging for an update was a bit dehumanizing in a way. Like I wasn't a person going through something, but more so a "story". But I understand, haha.

I just want to say thank you so so so much for all of the support and wonderful comments. I got a lot of great advice that helped me tackle the issue head on. I also got a lot of really really kind comments and messages. It was awesome.

I also got a lot of comments that made me realize how toxic this sub can be. There were MANY comments that just said things like "she's cheating, it's over" and "don't even confront her, just leave". It's advice like that that can ruin relationships that just need a little work. 

And thank you to the people that told me to hit my girlfriend, told me I was an embarrassment to my gender, and best of all, told me I should encourage an affair because it would lead to great experiences for me later in life. You gave me a good chuckle.

ON TO THE UPDATE.

I decided to confront my girlfriend. I thought about using some of the lies people suggested, but they just wouldn't make sense. To say I ran into Justine somewhere: well, I told my girl I had to stay home and do stuff around the house, and that's why I couldn't go with her to see my SIL. To say Justine was helping me pick out jewelry: it doesn't make sense for her to come all the way to our house to help me pick out a piece of jewelry unless it was a serious piece of jewelry (like an engagement ring). If I just wanted to get her a piece of jewelry as a gift, I'd ask her friends for suggestions or ask them to send me pictures of jewelry she might like. It all happens over text. None of the excuses made sense. So, I decided to be honest. 

I basically just said that I knew we'd been thinking about marriage and she probably knew a proposal was coming soon so I invited Justine over to help me find her the perfect ring, and that so happened to be the day that she said she was going to see her, so... what's the deal?

She immediately started grinning like an idiot and prodding me about proposing and the ring, but then we got back onto the topic of where she was and she confessed what she was really doing. No, she wasn't cheating, and no, she wasn't picking out a ring for me (the amount of times that was commented was crazy). 

So, some people are dog people and some people are cat people. Well, me, I'm a snake person. I grew up with snakes my whole life. But I never felt I was able to get one because my girlfriend has always been uneasy about living with a snake which I completely respected. Also, the process of buying and raising a snake is very different than that of buying and raising a dog or cat. It's quite complicated. So you could imagine my surprise when my girlfriend showed me a picture of her holding the cutest Kenyan sand boa I have EVER SEEN! 

Needless to say, my girlfriend was going to surprise me with a snake! We're picking her up next week (let me know if you want a pet tax, she's so cute). I definitely did not expect this and I feel bad for ruining the surprise, but oh well. Life is good! Sorry if this isn't the ending you guys wanted or expected, just a snake haha. Thanks for reading!! 

TLDR: snake

Edit #2: did you guys really award me 130 snek awards... I love reddit

ANSWER: I'm glad to see honesty and communication triumphed.

Congrats on your future engagement, your new pet, and a happy resolution!!

EDIT: I'm also chuckling at the TLDR. 

Snake, but not the 'snake' that everyone was thinking. ;)

Depending on how you think it would go over, I'd be tempted to name the snake 'Justine.' :P

QUESTION: UPDATE: my son and his "friend" are a couple. How do I let them know it's okay?

I tried yo post this before but it got removed as I hadn't waited 48 hours. Hopefully this time it works!

Hello, lovely people. As promised I am back with an update for you on all what happened the other day. [Here it is, if you missed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fv7ec7/my_son_and_his_friend_are_a_couple_how_do_i_let/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Want to top this off with a big thank you to everyone who left such lovely, thoughtful comments. I honestly didn't expect so many people to see the post, I was thinking maybe an absolute maximum of 100 people and even that seemed like loads. It was lovely to hear back from so many of you, and I'm forever grateful for the fantastic advice most of you gave. Also overjoyed by my new adopted reddit children haha you're all doing amazing and I'm very proud of all of you. Also big thanks to all of the lovely people who sent me such sweet messages of support, and to those of you who reached out to me because you felt you needed someone to talk to. If anyone else feels that way and is in need of dadly advice, do feel free to give me a message and I will do my best to help out :) 

Okay you all want me to shut up and tell you what happened haha. My son was busy with some assignments both for his freelancing job and his uni work most of the day and I didn't want to disturb him so I waited until after dinner to chat. "Friend" went to have a bath while my son and I watched telly. I tod him face to face "Son, I love you very much. You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to, but I want you and [friend] to feel comfortable being yourselves in my house and you don't ever need to hide anything from me, alright?" 

Well, it turns out a hell of a lot of you were right. Son burst out laughing and said "oh thank God, I reckoned you'd clicked on but didn't say anything because I didn't want to make you feel weird". Basically we've each been pussyfooting around the topic because neither one of us wanted to make the other uncomfortable talking about it. We had a bit of a chat and he confirmed that I'm right in thinking they've been together since their first year of uni and that's why they moved in together in second year. However, apparently I'm not as brilliant and intuitive as I thought because apparently one of his friends in secondary school was his boyfriend for a year and I had absolutely no idea haha. He went and talked to the boyfriend after his bath, and then we all had a bit of a further chat. Sadly a lot of you were right that the reason boyfriend doesn't have a good relationship with his parents is because he came out to them a few years ago and they effectively disowned him, so I made sure he knows that he's a part of our family now. 

Sorry if that isn't all as exciting and groundbreaking as some of you had hoped haha! I'm glad this is something my boy no longer feels he has to keep from me and I'm very glad he's happy with his partner. Thank you all again for the help!

ANSWER: >Sorry if that isn't all as exciting and groundbreaking as some of you had hoped

No, this is pretty much exactly what I was hoping for.

================================================================================

QUESTION: [UPDATE]: My (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before I get married.

First of all thank you so much for all the replies, I didnt think this would get so big. I have read pretty much all of them (special shout out goes to the person who says this was fake solely on the fact that I write like a man, whatever that means XD)

Also thanks for all the gold and silver, it's appreciated although if you wanna spend money give it to charity or something.

&#x200B;

I went and talked to him this morning I told him that his father is not going to look at me and he needs to respect that. He was adamant that it needs to happen and accused me about lying about my virginity. I was trying to be calm and rational but he was not having it and just became more and more angry. I told him if he really loved me he would stand by me on this and tell his father no to which he slapped me and said he didnt need to prove anything.

so I ended it and left him. I am currently back at my friends house being miserable and eating pizza which is pretty fun. 

so yup. Thanks everyone :)

ANSWER: Wow, just as controlling as we expected. To accuse you of lying and SLAP you is real fucking bold on his part.

Good work getting rid of him. You'll be much better off. Glad you have a good friend on your side.

QUESTION: My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat. UPDATE

Original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hu9xlv/my_22m_vegan_girlfriend_21f_wants_me_to_get_rid/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

TL;DR My gf is a passionate vegan and wants me to get rid of my beloved cat because cats eat meat and kill mice.

First of all, let me say thank you for everyone who offered advice. There are over 7,000 comments on my original post and I have dozens of PMs. Frankly I'm still pretty overwhelmed with the magnitude of the response. I did my best to read most everyone's comments but obviously I couldn't get to everything!

I would also like to preempt this post by saying, as many users pointed out, that my GFs extreme views on domestic cats are not representative of the vegan/vegetarian community as a whole. I do think that, sometimes, new vegans can be a little overzealous. In reality, most of us are just doing the best that we can to not hurt animals! I did not expect to generate a big debate in the comments.

So, we broke up, obviously. I would never, ever give up my cat Mittens. Many users said that this situation was about control, not veganism, and looking back, I do see a pattern of control on my GFs part. I was blind to it I guess.

I called my GF and said I was not willing to give up Mittens under any circumstances, and given the recent issues we'd had, and our incompatible views, I thought it was best that we parted ways. I said she deserved a partner that shared her values. She then asked if we were breaking up, I said yes. There was some anger on her end but otherwise the situation actually went better than I expected. 

So, yeah. That's really it.

Oh, and several users did ask to see a picture of Mittens. I have uploaded one to imgur:

Thanks again to everyone who offered advice. It really helped.

================================================================================

QUESTION: yesterday I froze during sex and my girlfriend asked if we should stop, I said yes and she backed off. I've never been treated like this before.

I am 23(M) and I've been raped before. Twice. I've been sexually assaulted too and this has affected me and subsequent relationships a lot. 2 days ago my girlfriend (23) was in my lap and we were making out and suddenly the images of rape came into my mind and I froze. She obviously sensed it and asked if everything was okay but I couldn't answer and I'd begun to sweat. She got of my lap and asked if I wanted to talk but i still couldn't say anything. Then she asked if she should leave the room and I gave a small nod. She just grabbed her phone from the table and left. This has never happened with me. Nobody has listened to my no before. It feels weird, different ? I don't know. 

Next morning when I woke up she had made breakfast and left me a note saying if I wanted to talk I could call her anytime. She came over after work and I thanked her for listening to me, I was almost in tears. She welled up too and said no obviously means no, but hesitation means no too. And that she would never knowingly hurt me. I've never been treated like this before. My parents were shit, and almost every relationship I've had (3) were also similarly shit. 

But she's different, she's been my rock when I've fallen low, she cooks for me because she wants me to be healthy, she leaves notes of affirmation all over the house for me to find and is generally the most genuine amazing person I've ever met. I want to show my gratitude to her and want to tell her how much she means to me but I don't know how ? Also it's still weighing on me how my say matters to her. Never in my life have I ever been treated this way. 

So how do I tell how much she means to me ? And will I stop feeling this way ?


EDIT:- oh my god, y'all. I never expected this kind of response! I'm trying to read through them all but thank you so much! 

To clarify a few things, almost everyone who commented suggested therapy. Therapy is super expensive and I'm already working to pay for school but yes I've started therapy, it's been about 5 months now. Just taking baby steps here. 

Secondly y'all gave a ton of good ideas but I think I'm gonna write her a letter and maybe arrange for a small picnic for the two of us. I know she'll love it. 

For those saying I should propose, that's definitely the plan, just not now. 

And to those who shared their (similar) Experiences, thank you. It gave me an insight and I hope things look up for you. 

And for all those who said I'm a 'pussy' for getting raped or I'm lying, I'm sorry but I can't make y'all believe me. I hope y'all feel better after this.b


Again, thank you so much for your kind comments. Y'all are amazeballs.

ANSWER: You could read her this post. If you wanted to show her with your actions then you could plan a special day doing the things she enjoys.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Update: My [36M] wife [34F] keeps tying my boots after I've told her to keep her hands off of them. I tried to teach her a lesson and really hurt her feelings.

[Original](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gpa82s/my_36m_wife_34f_keeps_tying_my_boots_after_ive/)  

I've gotten a few requests for update but didn't want to post until I felt like I really had anything to say. A lot has happened in the past two weeks so I'm going to try to go over it as best I can.

My wife and I started talking again. We had a very serious conversation and I did apologize for what I did to her running shoes, and then I told her I had to speak some truth and I wanted her to promise me that she wasn't going to roll her eyes, interrupt me, scoff, or get sarcastic with me, which she did. I told her that I was not kidding about my boots, that while most of the time I caught geriatric transports, falls, and nausea, there were instances where response time was of the essence and I didn't have time to play around with my boots in the middle of the night. I told her that there have been times when my intervention has been critical in saving a life, when my training has helped me recognize an underlying emergency, or when a call I made ensured that a patient was prioritized upon arrival at the hospital. I explained that a lot of the shit I see, I don't tell her about because I don't want to give her nightmares or make her worry about me. She actually listened and didn't dismiss what I had to say. She responded that she was trying to help by keeping things neat.

I responded, "But you're not. Sweetie, I'm not trying to be mean, but you're not helping. You're hindering me. One day it may be the difference between life and death. I need you to not touch my gear. It's where I know where it is, it's where I can easily find it in a short amount of time, and if you move it, you are impeding an emergency response. I don't care if it looks neat. It serves a function, it doesn't look pretty. If you want to help me, please leave my gear where I put it."

A few nights later I had my friend Officer Rich come over. Officer Rich was one of the two cops that did CPR on the victim that night. The three of us sat on our deck and had a few social distancing beers. He talked about getting there, doing CPR, giving Narcan, waiting for the ambulance and getting her back shortly before we got there.

He then pulled out a few photos of car accidents that I had worked. He showed them to my wife and pointed out, "This car went into a tree. Your husband crawled into the wreck, put a collar on the driver, and stayed in there giving him oxygen until we could get him out." "Your husband pulled a three year old out of this wreck." "Your husband recognized that the driver had a stroke and took her to a stroke center, which likely saved her life."

After that, I told her I had something I wanted to show her and I asked her for the same promise I'd asked earlier. When she agreed, I showed her a video on YouTube of a police bodycam from an overdose. This video showed how critical time is in getting someone back, and the training someone goes through in order to give the drug, do CPR, and utilize an AED.

I told her, "I'm not trying to attack you, I don't want to have a fight, but I want you to understand what I go through. That I hope every call I go on is transporting a boo boo, because otherwise it means that if I don't do everything right someone could die. If I don't get out that door as quickly as possible, someone could suffer brain damage while they're waiting for me to give them oxygen. If I'm upset and shaking because I had to waste time opening my boots, I might miss something critical and someone might not make it."

She acknowledged that she understood and told me she hadn't really thought about the danger of what I do until the other night when she saw the photos of the wrecks. I told her that I think she has OCD and needs to see a therapist because it's hurting our marriage. I listed examples of her throwing important things out, moving things without permission, and messing with my gear. I offered to go together and said I'd be willing to work on things together.

After I pointed out the pattern, she agreed that it was time to speak to someone. She wants to think about whether she wants to go together or go by herself, but she has promised me that she's going to try to change her patterns. I brought up her saying she thought I was going to hit her, and she acknowledged she'd been with guys who flew off the handle with little provocation and scared her. That she'd never seen me get that angry and it triggered her because she didn't think I was capable of blowing up like that.

She's been very emotional lately and has been going through mood swings. She's been worried about me going out on calls. The other day she started crying and said, "I hope you know how much I appreciate what you do." Knock on wood, since we had the big talk, she hasn't touched my boots.

Is everything resolved? Not by a longshot. But she seems to have a new appreciation for what I do. Thank you for all of your responses. I wound up not showing her the thread, because a lot of it was pretty harsh towards her. I recognize I cherry picked incidents that didn't put her in the best light, and there's a lot more to her and our marriage than that. She is the person I chose for the rest of my life, and I want us to work.

tl;dr Let my wife into my world a little more, she let me into hers, and she hasn't touched my boots since.

ANSWER: I'm glad things have worked out well so far, and I hope they continue to do so and that your wife gets the help she needs to be able to live more comfortably with her (potential) OCD (or whatever it turns out to be that drives her need for neatness).

================================================================================

QUESTION: [update] my [32M] best friend [30 F] asked if I would be her sperm donor for her surrogate, I am in love with her but sje has no idea.

I appreciate all the feedback, most of you were nice. There was a few idiots telling me I needed to be Alpha and be more manly.. but whatever. 

Anyway the consensus with my RL friends was I needed to tell her. We do Brunch on Saturdays because she does Yoga Sundays so we met up this morning. 

I could barely eat and she could tell something was up. She got worried thinking I was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks. 

I sat her down and told her everything how I realized I was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. I told her that I never said anything because I did not want to jeopardize our friendship. Her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face. 

I honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and I honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      Then she started crying, sobbing really  and she lightly hit my chest. She half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to screw up what we have.

We hugged and I told her that there is no one on this earth I would want to have a child with but her. We talked for hours ,in fact I just got home. We have decided that we want to focus on us for now. I want us to be at that point that we can do it together. 

I know that this isn’t a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end. 

However I am pretty sure if there is such things as soulmates she is mine.

Thank you guys and gals for giving me the courage to tell her

ANSWER: Please, please, PLEASE live your BEST life and enjoy this woman while you have her! This post made me SOOO happy and i hope everything works out greatly! Good luck!

[last update ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ibccth/update_to_update_my_dads_43_girlfriend_is_trying/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)


Hi! Since my last post I spoke to my grandparents and told them everything. I asked if I could stay with them if I wanted to and they agreed. I then spoke to my dad again and tried to tell him how I felt and what I had heard. I didn't want to film or record because I knew that he would be mad at that and wouldn't listen. He didn't believe me again and thought that I was jealous of having to share him with someone else. I got upset and told him that I was leaving so he could live happily ever after without the burden of having me around. He looked shocked but didn't say anything. 

I had already packed my bags and had brought some things to my grandparents house already. My dad didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My grandfather picked me up and I've been there since. I haven't gone home and I haven't heard from my dad. My grandparents told me that they would handle my dad and that I shouldn't have to be the one doing it. 

I'm upset that my dad hasn't called or texted me once to see if I'm ok. At the same time I'm feeling so much better being with my grandparents. My grandmother is probably the sweetest person ever and my grandfather is a little rough around the edges but he's really a softie.

ANSWER: I'm so glad that your grandparents are such awesome people who will show you the love that your dad should have been showing you all along, and that they are willing to deal with your dad for you - it's too big of a burden for you to need to carry yourself. Maybe some day your dad will realize what he's done, but always remember that allowing him back in to your life should be your choice and done on your terms.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (M28) broke up with my ex-fiancée (F27) of 4 years 2 weeks ago after catching her in a huge lie and then finding out 3 days ago that she commited suicide because i wouldn't take her back. I am in need of some serious advice as i'm being blamed for everything.

Hey guys,

I need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?

A little background: 

Me and my ex-fiancée had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. I was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. She was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.

Back in April of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. Tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. I once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.

It all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in June because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. That was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. I didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted me and wanted to talk.

Imagine my surprise when she confessed to me that there was another guy involved and how all this time she was hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. I fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. It made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.

Heck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.

Everything was kinda OK until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message "Sorry bro" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. The picture was of my ex-fiancée at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. I fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. She was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.

When i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. Her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.

She cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. I was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.

I told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. She begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.

I did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fiancée had comitted suicide. Her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.

I am at a fucking lose, ex-fiancée friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. 

I am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.

ANSWER: NOT YOUR FAULT. She made the choice to cheat, she made the choice to take her own life.

Not your fault.

QUESTION: Mom had an affair 18 years ago, I [18M] am the product of it. My dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.

Update 3:

Hey guys, and update has already been posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ccpwcu/update_mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am/). Please don't message me so angrily any more.

Update 2:

Sorry for not updating, my grandpa passed away yesterday morning.

Nothing happened to me, but my situation is a secondary concern right now. Regardless, I think I will be alright, thanks to your amazing support and help.

My sister is aware of everything, and told me not to worry, she has my back and I have her support.

I promise to update when and if there are any significant changes, right now I need to support my grandma.

Thank you again to everyone.

Update:

Sorry to disappear, nothing bad happened to me.

Managed to talk with my mom yesterday, but I chickened out half way through what I had to say :(

The good news is that I am not being kicked out, or disowned, etc.

Thank you for all your support, everyone, I will follow through and call financial aid at my college in a few hours, and take it from there.

My grandpa had a stroke a week ago, and my dad is helping my grandma with setting up a live in nurse, so he wasn't around yesterday.

I will let you know how I manage.

Thank you again.

\-

Pretty much the title. I have no idea how to process all this, and I am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(

Both my older brother and sister went to the same college. My brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. Both had their college paid by our dad. Dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.

My brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.

My sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.

I got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. I always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.

Instead I was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how I am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.

Dad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. He said it was never is place to say anything since I am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.

Apparently my grandparents know I am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.

My siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as I am because there was never a hint of anything being off. I might be naive, but I always thought I had a great relationship with my dad. We go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when I had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. I never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. I mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. It's a story he tells from time to time. He likes to talk about stuff like that about me.

My mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have "the talk" with me, but she never did.

I feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. I am not even sure I will be able to go to college any more, I always assumed my parents will pay for it. I never had a job, and I am not sure what job I can even get to support me through college, I have no idea how to apply for loans.

All my mom has done is cry and apologize. But nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.

I don't even know if I am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, I feel shame leaving my room, and if I will be asked to move out I don't know where to go. I don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.

I am angry at my mom, I am confused about where I stand with my dad. There's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. I feel rejected and I have no idea what to do to fix this situation.

Anyone have any idea what to do here?

Do I apologize to my dad? What do I say to him?

Idk, I've been stuck in my room these past few days, reading and browsing reddit. I have no idea what to do.

Edit: Comments are coming in faster than I can reply, but I am making a list with all the advice about financial aid, health insurance, getting my own phone plan, etc, things I didn't even think about before. Thank you everyone.

I will try to answer as much as I can, but there's more comments than I can handle.

ANSWER: You need to have a calm conversation with your mom. See if you can still live at home or if they're kicking you out. You need to know this immediately to decide your next steps. If they're not kicking you out, that's basic decency. If they ARE kicking you out, talk to your siblings to see if you can crash at theirs, and live with one of them. If not, crash at a friend's until you can get on your feet. 


 If they seriously won't help you with college (and your mom won't help you either) start applying to jobs. The jobs you're going to apply for are going to suck, but if that's the only way you can pay for college and shit, then you gotta do what you gotta do. 

Start applying to grocery store jobs and fast food jobs. Customers WILL suck, as people are fucking awful about their food. Customers in general will suck. You can apply online. Retail jobs, especially ones with commission. This means clothing stores like Holister, Nordstroms, Macys, Dillards, whatever there is available. Also jobs like ones at a car dealership, but beware commission only jobs. If you don't sell cars at the dealership, you don't eat. Get a job that pays a base per hour PLUS commission if possible. If not, you're going to get paid minimum wage like at Gamestop. Which sucks. But it's something.

Apply to your local community college. You'll definitely get in. Classes are FAR cheaper than a regular college, and you can get your common core classes out of the way there for cheaper (aka your History 101, Political Science, Government, English, one science course, one math, etc). It WILL take longer but it's fine, the classes are easy. After you're done with those you can get your Associates and transfer to a Big College. I reccomend this before going to the college you actually got in to because it is cheaper. You will work at the same time. Get ready for lots of ramen and cheap food OP. 


As for loans, do you have any credit currently? The reason I ask is that the higher your credit score, the better loan you can get. That is the easiest way to earn credit. If you only have a debit card, start building your credit. Capital One or Discover have student credit cards that start you off pretty ok. You can apply for these online. Use the credit card that you apply for. Let's say max $100 per month. ~~Pay off about 50-75 dollars on it and leave a little bit that you owe for something called "revolving credit." This will help your credit score.~~ The first loan you're going to get is going to suck ass. Go to your local ~~bank where you have your debit card~~ credit union and ask them about student loans. 

Apply for scholarships at your local community college and google scholarships. There are so many out there and sometimes people don't even apply! It's free money at that point. You're going to have a busy summer OP. 

Ask your siblings if they can pull some money for your first semester at the community college. Then get one of the jobs I told you about before and start saving. If you do college slower, no one will judge you. You're paying your own way. 

I wish you the best of luck OP. I'm so sorry this happened to you and that's really shitty of your dad to do this. Most colleges have therapy or counseling for free or reduced price and your area should have a local psychologist or therapist with sliding scale. Head over there. 

Also, do you have medical insurance under your parents still? Or are they taking that away too? What about your cell phone bill? Car insurance? It's important you ask these questions so that you can proceed with your eyes open about if you actually need to pay for those things (I hope not OP. But please make sure). 

I'm sending all my love to you. My wife was kicked out of her parents' at 17 and she had to do a lot of this herself too, and I work and study too.

Edit: Thank you kind stranger for the silver! Holy shit, thank you kind stranger for the gold!

Edit 2: Many users have said this and I've learned not to have anything owed on your credit card. Thanks to everyone who educated me! You learn something new every day!

Edit 3: holy crap, a platinum! Another gold! Thanks kind friends!

Edit 4: It's been pointed out to me that it's better to go to a local credit union for a loan and I absolutely agree.

================================================================================

QUESTION: [UPDATE] You were right. I ignored every single one of your comments and eventually caught my wife with the other man

This is a tough pill to swallow, and I can't say I hadn't been warned. [This is my previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g8d98r/wife_had_been_flirting_with_her_coworker_she_said) Many folks asked me to follow up with an update so here it is, fresh from the oven.

After reading every single comment of the reddit post, my brain just couldn't overcome the catastrophe and the collapse of the world I had built for me in which my wife is my love, my best friend and partner, as well a the person I admire the most. She was entirely perfect, and made me happy for many years. I thought no couple in the world could have what we had. We were both very happy for a long time. We were both attractive, we were both inherently good, had big hearts and were individually wildly successful in our careers.

After the reddit post, I moved to an airbnb and eventually with family to think things through. It was a terrible time but a psychologist helped me recover from a terrible mental state. It coincided with the pandemic hitting very hard in my city (I caught the virus), which didn't help.

During this time, we kept talking and my wife was very sorry and continued saying they hadn't met. I knew it wasn't true but was willing to forgive the woman of my dreams, who continued being in the highest altar of my universe.

Fast forward last saturday morning, I went back to our place, ready to forgive her and talk things through in the most mature way possible. And well, there she was, but I was the one who received the biggest surprise, to say the least. The guy was in my house naked, and so was my wife. The guy from the messages, the guy from the pics. The one she said she didn't even like. I caught him hiding in my bathroom as my wife was putting her pajamas on. When I saw him hiding in my bathroom, he uttered "sorry dude". For a second I asked myself, is this were I kill him? But I instantly replied "I got nothing against you", because the guy was just nailing this hot woman. Even if he was doing so in a house full of pictures of me. Pictures of our wedding and our families. Pictures of my dead father who would be so sad to see how the marriage he never witnessed was going to end. He has always been the reason I try to make the world a better place. He passed away two months before our wedding.

I'm sorry. I still love her to death. But I understand enough is enough. Even if my world collapses, I hope I can build a new one without lies and in which I'm not just a blind believer under an altar of a fake god.

Godspeed.

ANSWER: God fucking speed man.

Your wife will never be sorry for what she did. But she’ll keep saying she’s sorry dozens probably hundreds of times to try and keep her word from crashing down.

But you will be manipulated no more. Do not leave your marital home under any circumstance. Find a good lawyer and start filing for divorce. 

You will come out of this a better man. There is light at the end of the tunnel!

QUESTION: HAPPY UPDATE: It has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34F) can’t have kids and she still has not “gotten over” it. I (35M) am seriously considering a divorce.

ORIGINAL POST: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b1982e/it\_has\_been\_7\_months\_since\_we\_learned\_that\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b1982e/it_has_been_7_months_since_we_learned_that_my/)

Hi all. First off, I want to apologize for not responding to every single post reply or PM. I am genuinely touched by the sheer amount of support I received and I spent quite a few hours crying my eyes out as I read your messages and well wishes.

The night after I wrote my original post, I wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/Witchy_Woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Dear \[Wife’s name\],

I love you more than you can imagine and the most I want in this world is for you to be happy. I understand that as a man I probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. I’m doing my best to help you but the fact that you won’t help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. I honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don’t make an effort to get better. However, I want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. I’m ready to talk whenever you are.

With all my love,

\[My name\]”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. The next morning (March 16th), I woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed OJ. When I walked into the bedroom with her food, I saw her reading my letter. When she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. Full on, Niagara Falls level crying. I hugged her tighter, told her “I love you so, so, much”, and started crying too. I honestly don’t know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. It could’ve been 10 minutes, it could’ve been an hour, I didn’t care. When she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. Reddit, you guys don’t know how thrilled and proud I was when I heard those words. She then asked me if we could go on a trip to Japan because in her words “I really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.”

I was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. She’s always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels I saw in her eyes the same spark that made me fall in love with her 8 years ago. We just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. We have a 5AM Uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return.

We’re not quite out of the tunnel yet, but we can see the light at the end.

EDIT: I'm going to bed. Thank you to everyone who followed my story and offered their well wishes.

ANSWER: This was so wholesome. I'm so happy for both of you, and you're being a wonderful husband to her. I hope you both enjoy Japan !

================================================================================

QUESTION: My son and his "friend" are a couple. How do I let them know it's okay?

Hello Reddit. Please bear with me regarding my formatting and things. I have read the rules and things, but I'm an old fart who is rather on the wrong side of 40 so I'm not overly well versed in the art of efficient internetting. 

My boy is 20 years old. He's absolutely my pride and joy, and there is nothing he could do that would ever make me love him less. For the first half of his life, I regrettably wasn't involved very much. His mother and I parted ways when he was just a few months old and at the time I was struggling with a heroin addiction and was absolutely not as present in his life as I should have been, nor was I suited to fatherhood at all. I saw him, at most, two to three times a year for the first 12 years of his life. I won't discuss details because that's his private story to tell, but when he was 12 he revealed to me that he was being badly mistreated at the hands of his mother and her boyfriend. Despite not being the best father at the time, I didn't want my boy suffering any more so I got myself cleaned up and sorted out in order to get full custody of him. I've effectively been a single (and sober!) father ever since and he has little to no contact with his mother. He's everything a man could want his son to be; he's uniquely kind and fiercely loyal, he's unflinchingly brave, he's incredibly generous and, despite the horrors he suffered as a child, he's unfailingly positive and sunny to the last. Somehow I of all people was bestowed with the honour of watching him grow from a sweet young boy to the greatest man I have ever known. I cannot stress enough my pride in him.

When he was 18, he got accepted into a top ranking university on the other side of the country. I was sad to see him go, but simultaneously overjoyed that he got into his first choice and was starting a new chapter in his life. He comes home once every other month, and on the month's he doesn't come home, I go to visit him. He's doing well in uni, has made lots of friends and seems incredibly happy there, which I'm obviously chuffed about. Since his second year, he's lived with his "friend" in a flat off-campus. I've strongly suspected since his early teens that my son is gay, and I now more or less have confirmation that this is true and that his "friend" is actually his boyfriend. 

So, for this COVID-19 faff, my son decided he'd rather come home and quarantine at mine than stay at his uni flat. His "friend", however, would be left alone if my son came back as he's a Candian and his family are back over there, and I gather he doesn't have the best relationship with them anyway. He asked if it would be okay if "friend" tagged along to my house and I said of course, no problem. 

They've been back at mine for about six weeks now. They think they're being subtle I know, but I've caught them doing coupley things on several occasions now. The "friend" has slipped up a couple of times and called my son 'babe' and 'sweetie' in front of me, which I pretended not to notice for the sake of saving embarrassment. There have been nights where we'll be watching a film with the lights off and, thinking I can't see, my son will have his arm around the "friend". One day I walked into the lounge and I'm positive they'd just been kissing and were trying to cover it, though I admit I have no confirmation on that one. The most solid evidence, however, came a few mornings ago. I get up very early to go for runs in the morning (hence why I'm making a reddit post at five in the morning haha). As far as I was told, my son was sleeping in his childhood room and his "friend" was in the guest room. I don't know what possessed me to do so, but on Tuesday morning I cracked my son's door open to check on him like I used to when he was a kid. Lo and behold, they're both asleep, snuggled up together, in my son's bed. That's more or less solidified for me that they're together. I didn't say anything, just shut the door and went for my run, and I haven't mentioned it to them yet. 

What I want advice on is this; how do I let my son and his boyfriend know that I'm okay with them being a couple and they don't have to feel like they have to sneak around in my house? I want them to be comfortable here and I want them to know I support them both no matter what. Or is that not a good idea? Am I better off leaving it alone and waiting until they tell me themselves, if they ever do? I obviously don't want to force either of them out of the closet, but at the same time I hate feeling as if they feel like they're being forced into the closet in my house. What's my best course of action here?? 

TL:DR - my son and his "friend" are staying with me for quarantine. It's abundantly clear they're a couple, and I want to let them know it's okay and they don't have to sneak around in my house. What's the best way to go about it?

ANSWER: My mom sent me a text that said, “You never have to admit anything to me that you’re not comfortable with. But if Jasmine was ever more than a friend, I’d want to make sure she knew she was loved here too”.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My grandparents don’t approve of my relationship with my black boyfriend, and don’t want me (F24) to marry him (26). I don’t know what to do, since I don’t want to lose either of these people (my boyfriend and my grandparents).

Hey guys, thanks for all your responses on my [previous post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0fmrl/my_grandparents_dont_approve_of_my_relationship/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

It was all really good advice, but the very best out of it all was the suggestion that I come clean to Sam. I did that, and he reacted in a surprisingly calm manner. I asked him how he’s taking it so well and he told me he’s experienced something similar before. 

His cousin had come out as gay a few years back, and he told me how his own grandparents reacted very poorly to his cousins revelation. He told me they absolutely refused to acknowledge the fact that he was gay and said some pretty hurtful stuff along the lines of how his homosexuality would embarrass them in front of all their family and friends etc. They wouldn’t allow the cousin to bring his boyfriend to family gatherings, and threatened to cut him out out of their inheritance unless he “got his head straight”. 

He then showed me pictures of his grandparents laughing along with his cousins husband, pictures of them at his cousins wedding etc. He told me they eventually grew out of it and as they go to know him they really bonded with the guy. 

Sam joked that he wouldn’t give my grandparents a choice and that within a month they’d be in love with him. 

Well I think it’s working. Sam and I have dinner at my grandparents house every night, and each night I notice them more and more at ease and more avidly taking part in our conversations. Sam and my grandpa are both WW2 enthusiasts, and my grandpa absolutely loves having discussions on the subject with Sam. 

I decided to update this post because last night something very special happened. I got there before Sam, and I could _see the disappointment on their faces when they thought I had come alone_. They asked where Sam was, when he was coming etc. Then they said we wouldn’t start eating until he arrived. 

I’m just so incredibly happy that I get to keep both relationships.

ANSWER: This is beautiful, well done Sam, and well done you, kill them with kindness, all the very best to you both.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My(m21) gf(f23) obsession with Pokemon is embarrassing me

Link to the previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i02wzl/mym21_gff23_obsession_with_pokemon_is_embarassing/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Tl;dr: Turns out you all were right, I was an asshole. My friends are no longer welcomed in our house and now I'm playing with my gf.

I've decided to post this update becauce you were all right. I didn't have a gf problem. I had friends problem.

So I had a talk with my gf like one of the users have suggested. I explained to her that I'm not ashamed of her hobby, I just didn't want her to know what our friends were saying behind her back. She said she doesn't care about their opinion, she's just doing what she's enjoying the most. I apologized to her. She has also agreed to move her pokemon plushies so they wouldn't take up so much space.

Fast forward to today, few hours ago our friends have visited us. It didn't take long for them to start making fun of my gf. This time I got mad - she organized her plushies so they were all in our bedroom, she has not even once mentioned pokemons nor did she opened pokemon go app. 

Long story short they were forced to leave. I've realized they don't have problem with my gf hobby - they have problem with my gf and I have enabled their behaviour by not reacting sooner. Told them they are the ones who needs to grow up & to visit us again once they will stop being boomers.

To show my gf how sorry I'm and to better understand her hobby I've downloaded the app myself. So now I'm trying to level up as much as I can because she has a mission when she needs to trade a pokemon with a friend, but to do so I need to be at least 10 lvl.

Thank you for all your comments, even the mean ones - they worked as a wake up call I guess.

ANSWER: Very well handled bro. Your decision to play Pokemon with your girlfriend is the best you could make and you're gonna have lots of fun together. I started playing Minecraft with my boyfriend when we started liking each other and it is even now after three years a god bonding activity and a common hobby

QUESTION: UPDATE:My girlfriends father discouraged me from proposing because their family isn’t thrilled about us having “Dark Babies”

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hx9boq/my29m_girlfriends27f_dad_discouraged_me_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Thanks for all y’all’s input it really helped and most of y’all were right on the target.

Yesterday afternoon I sat my gf, Naomi down and had a conversation with her about what her dad said to me. I tried to leave out any mention of proposal and told her I was in their neighborhood and decided to pop by (Terrible lie, I know but she bought it). I told her what her dad said about us having dark babies and asked if she had any similar feelings about our kids popping out half black. She looked at me like I was out of my mind. She told me she didn’t give a fuck about the color of her kids as long as I was the dad, which was reassuring. She was not so happy with her dad. She wanted us to take a drive over there and talk with her parents about it. 

That evening we dropped by unannounced and when her mom opened the door to see us she immediately asked Naomi to show her the ring. Naomi was confused and I about shit myself. I, like a dumbass, didn’t call ahead to her parents that I hadn’t proposed. I guess her mom thought we were going to surprise her with the engagement and assumed I had already proposed. I was speechless. They began speaking in Korean, but from context I assume her mom was asking if I was too cheap to buy her an engagement ring. And Naomi looked at me and started hugging and kissing me. My secret was out and I told her I had already asked her parent for their blessing. She was a few seconds from crying but sucked it up so we could speak to her dad. 

Like I said in my og post my future father in law isn’t great at English so he and Naomi spoke in Korean. According to Naomi, she asked him why he told me that, and he said that he was worried about their extended family not viewing our babies as Korean and being rude to them or me for being black. I guess this did not come across well in English, because he was just concerned for me and our kids. He didn’t care that our babies would have dark skin. This was a huge relief. Her father isn’t the racist their extended families are (but like, fuck them who cares what they think). I am just so glad that our future kids are going to have grandparents that are going to love them. Only downside is now Naomi is expecting my proposal so I really got to knock her socks off.

Thanks so much for all the help.🤟🏿

ANSWER: Good news is you’re pretty much guaranteed to get a yes! Let us know how the proposal goes! Do you have any idea how you’ll surprise her?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Update : Wife (38F) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. It's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks I am going to abandon her and "our twins"

It has not been that long but i need again advice from you guys about the same topic.

[^((Original Post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cyh5cv/wife_38f_is_convinced_that_she_is_pregnant_even/)^()^) 

I called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . He seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  He said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. I sat her down and we talked. All she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . I tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. I asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. She said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. Now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . So I did. She kept changing subjects or saying that " A mother just feels it. You wouldn't know how it is " then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her "gut feeling ". She got very agitated and was crying telling me that if I wanted to leave her i should simply leave but I shouldn't call her a liar.

&#x200B;

Somehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.

After she did i went on her computer. I do never snoop on her. But i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . Oh boy. She was in 2 facebook groups. One was a normal Mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. In the "normal" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her "belly" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the "grace of god that kissed her tummy" the "gift of life was given to her " and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. They were feeding in each others delusions. A woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. My wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. So many women were making her fear that i would leave. Saying things like men can not stick to a woman . Many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not "handle the pregnancy".

I was really fucking scared. I researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361851/). So to say the least i could not sleep. I was and am still very afraid of losing her. She woke up and I tried to act like nothing was wrong . We were going to the doctor. And it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. She was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. Things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. He was really tactful when talking to my wife. He tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. We tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. She got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . She began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . We could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . She could not breathe. The doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . She had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. Did an EKG to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.

At that point i really had no other option than to inquire about Involuntary commit. So I could not do it myself . I needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . After that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there "against her will". So far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . My wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. When i last her she was furious with me. She said i was taking away her freedom which I am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. She is so mad at me. I feel like I am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. I love her with all my heart. I am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . I feel like i failed to protect her. At this point I am just rambeling . Sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . I feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . Sorry for spelling mistakes

edit : I will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! When I gave my vows I meant trough illness and bad times. I am not only on the ride for the good times. If you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. Would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? I am here to stay. I will not divorce her. She is not a "fucking psycho" she is sick. I hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.

Sorry for the rant. But if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. I understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it Beginns to mess with their mental health  and I respect that but I won't do that.

Edit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. She was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks

I don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as I was so distraught. But I was not a sedative. I think it was something along the lines of Valium or Baldrian. Over the counter stuff mostly.

She has family. She is estranged from most of them. Her sister is now at our place to help.

Also refrain from such stupid comments like "I'll bet she will leave bro. She is cray how did you marry her" because they are not helpful at all. Specially the bets that are going on that my wife will leave me once she gets better. Just seems like you want me to divorce. Get a life.

ANSWER: I remember your first post so vividly. I am so so sorry that things blew up this way, but you did EXACTLY the right things here. She is going to be getting the help she needs. There is literally nothing you could have done to protect her from her own mind. You did what was right and it is so clear you love her. I hope things go well and she is given the help she needs.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My girlfriend [21F] of 18 months asked my [22M] preference about her pubic hair and now finds me "revolting"

So yesterday my girlfriend casually asked me how I prefer pubic hair to be groomed. She usually keeps hers short, but neat. I assumed she was just looking to change things up and wanted my opinion so I answered honestly and said that I find completely shaven attractive, but in the grand scheme of things I couldn't care less, it's not a turn off if there's hair, and that I like the way she has it now. 

Well it turns out she had had a lecture today at college (she studies psychology) and the topic was on peadophiles. Apparently one of the talking points was that pedophiles are attracted to the lack of body hair. 

When she told me this, I asked her "are you seriously calling me a pedophile because I find completely shaven attractive?! Can I just point out that you're 21 and not 12?" She basically skirted around my questions and then stormed out of my apartment when I kept pressing her on it. As she left she called me revolting and is now ignoring my calls and text messages. 

What. The. Fuck.

Honestly not even sure where to go from here. We've never had any issues and was planning on proposing in the next year. Where has this even come from?! 

TL;DR: Girlfriend pretty much called me a pedo because I told her I liked shaved pussy when she asked me my preference.

ANSWER: Just because pedophiles like no pubic hair doesn’t mean all people who prefer no pubic hair are pedophiles.

Just like all dogs have four legs doesn’t mean all things with four legs are dogs.

Update to: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqzpmb/my_boyfriend_isnt_okay_with_me_being_promiscuous/

Thank you for all the advice. I ended up bringing it up yesterday and it instantly turned into an argument again. He asked me why I’m defending ‘thots’ so much yet again. Asking me why I cared so much about what he thought about woman who sleep around. He then went on to say I should of known better than to sleep with so much guys and that I ‘knew what I was doing’. He said I was straight up a thot in my past but he loves me and is willing to look past it. Yeah no. I stood my ground and said I can’t be with anyone who sees woman like that and that I wasn’t going to let him talk to me like that. I broke things off and he called me stupid for thinking he would let me break up with him and that turned into a whole new argument about how I ain’t ‘loyal’ and I ain’t no ‘ride or die’ chick. I also blocked him on all my socials and he is still making accounts to contact me on. Definitely made the right decision to end things. 

Also to the people who messaged me saying he was right and that I deserved to be dumped. That nobody likes a used up chick, and many other unkind words, it was so unnecessary and I hope you step on a lego.

Edit: Typos and Thank you for the rewards. ❤️

ANSWER: >he called me stupid for thinking he would let me break up with him

eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

when he contacts you again consider making it clear to him that you'll report his harassment to the police if it continues. then do so if it does.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife (33f) is denying we're married and wants to be called my 'girlfriend'... I'm confused

My wife (33f) and I (29m) have been married four years now, coming on five. We have generally had a good relationship and a good marriage.

We had a reasonably expensive wedding, which we're still paying for now. I get the bill every month to prove it. My wife took charge of planning the wedding, so it was to her tastes. She seemed to enjoy it at the time and for the first few years of our marriage, she would look back at the wedding with me happily and without issues.

In recent months I've noticed my wife's attitude to a) our wedding and b) our marriage itself shift. It began by her (I thought jokingly) referring to herself as my 'girlfriend'. She told me to buy her a 'girlfriend' card for Valentine's Day rather than a 'wife' one, for example. 

I thought she was just playing around at first. But this behaviour has only escalated. Two months ago my wife stopped wearing her wedding ring. I was understandably upset and asked her if there was something wrong. She told me everything was fine and she just 'doesn't the sensation of jewellery on her hands'. My wife has never liked rings and jewellery so this could be the case.

But when we are with friends, my wife will get upset if I talk about her as 'my wife' rather than just a girlfriend. She will go as far to interrupt me if I'm talking/telling a story to 'correct' me on our relationship. Initially, this was something our friends laughed at, but now everybody just finds it understandably awkward.

One of our friends was talking about their own wedding, which is scheduled for early next year. They asked for advice from my wife about how she'd planned ours and my wife responded with 'what wedding?'. When our friend continued talking about the table decorations my wife had used, my wife visibly teared up in front of the whole group and had to step outside.

Later that evening, I asked her directly if she has a problem with our relationship or if I'm doing something wrong in our marriage. She assured me that everything is fine between us. From my perspective, outside of this issue, our relationship is as strong as ever. We are considering kids in the near future, our sex life is great, and my wife recently suggested we get matching tattoos as a renewal of our love.

Is there advice anyone can offer on why my wife might be acting like this and what I should do?

ANSWER: You need to sit down with her seriously and make sure she's okay. This does sound like she could be having a break down and needs some help.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife gave birth to a (black)baby that clearly isn't mine, and I'm divorcing her. But I'm worried about the relationship between my two kids and their new half-sister.

A month ago, my wife gave birth to a black baby girl. We're both white, so she was forced to admit that the child was a result of a one night stand last year. 

I've started divorce proceedings, although we're still living together for now. Between our two boys(aged 2 and 4, I've had paternity tests for them and they came back positive), her infant daughter and her having lost her job due to COVID, living together as amicably as possible until the divorce is settled is an unfortunate necessity.

Naturally I have no ill will towards the baby, and I've been disgusted by some of the comments I've heard from family members, friends, coworkers and others, all who seem to be fixated on the racial angle of this. As if the most salient part of this isn't that my wife cheated, but that she cheated with a BLACK man and that the baby is BLACK.

What really worries me is that my two sons might pick up on these narratives. They're too young to really understand what's happening now, but I'm worried that as they grow to understand the situation that they might grow to resent their half-sister for "breaking up their parents marriage". And worse that their resentment might express itself in a racist fashion, under the influence of the aforementioned racist narratives.

Any thoughts on how I should try to influence my son's away from that perspective? It probably doesn't help that we live in a suburb with very few black people and their half-sister is really the only black person my children know.

ANSWER: Hmmm I’m no parent, but I think telling the boys to love their sister no matter what, would do the situation some good. Or at least to keep that message consistent through their upbringing.

QUESTION: UPDATE :My (26M) girlfriend (25F) has grown distant after I got beat up defending a group of girls being harassed

First of all I want to thank every single one of you who commented on my last post. The love and support I received was immense and it actually made me feel a little better in the mess of it all. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. All of the following happened yesterday so excuse me if I ramble a bit , it's all fresh in
 my mind. 

ORIGINAL POST
--------------------------
Mandatory:  I have been with my gf Sarah for 3 years and been living together for 1.5. She is honestly everything I have ever wanted and I planning on proposing somewhere next year.

So 3 weeks ago I was out with Sarah at a local bar drinking and having a great time with her as it was just after quarantine had ended where I live. At around 3 am we decided to head home. As we headed to the parking lot where we had parked we noticed a group of 2 girls and a guy who was clearly drunk trying to hit on them and get them to go to his house. The girls were clearly very uncomfortable and trying to find a way out. Sarah told me that we had to do something and I told her go call the cops and get someone as well because the very leat I wanted was her to get hurt during this.

So I approached the group and try to pretend I was the boyfriend of the one of the two girls and long story short I got my ass kicked. The guy was at least 6ft4 and 220 lbs where as I'm 5ft11 167lbs . I'm fairly mascular myself but there was no way I could have taken someone that big, I knew it from the start. At least from all the noise we had made a lot of people rushed the scene and the girls got away safe. I was rushed to the ER because the motherfucker had broken my ribs which had punctured my right lung. Yay.

After that incident Sarah has grown a distant from me. Even though she visited and stayed with me at the hospital she hasn't been the same since. And I thought she just needed time to move past this. However 5 days ago she told me that she is not the same person after what happened and she doesn't know if she feels safe with me after I got beat up like that. Honestly hearing that hurt me more than when I got my ribs broke. She has  moved to her parents for the time being and she told me she needs time. Meanwhile I had no one here to help me so my brother left his 2 boys and wife to move in with me. I know I'm just venting at this point but I don't want this to be over like that. Reddit is there anything I can do to salvage the situation?

UPDATE:
_______________

Until yesterday it had been 14 days since my last contact with Sarah. My brother had left 4 days prior because I felt bad keeping him away from his family for so long, plus I could take care of myself to some extent. So around 2 pm while I was making lunch I hear the doorbell ring. I go to open the door and there she is. Sarah. With tears in her eyes, eye bags, frizzy hair,looking like a total mess. During the time we've been together I've seen her in her ups downs but I'd never seen her in such horrible  state before. So I let her in she sits on the couch , we haven't still said a word as we were both dumbfounded. I was so overwhelmed by emotions, I wanted to hug her, I wanted to full on blast on her, I didn't even know what I wanted to do. So I did nothing and waited for her to talk.

 After 5 or 10 minutes of silence she starts sobbing and saying she's sorry and, then full on crying. At this point I can barely hold myself together. So I hold her hand and  try to calm her down so I can figure out what is going on. After a while she finally somewhat calms down and starts talking. And that's where it got bad. 

Something that I didn't include in the original post, because it wouldn't make sense to anyway is that Sarah's mother has been divorced and remarried once. From what Sarah has told me, her biological father cheated on her mother while she was still a kid and that's why they broke up. And that's also why she doesn't have any kind of relationship with her father. It seemed odd when I first learned about it, but I didn't question it. That is not the whole story though. 

Sarah's biological father didn't only cheat on her mother. He was a drug addict pos, that also used to beat her up frequently. Without getting into a lot of graphic detail  in one instance when Sarah's brother tried to intervene and protect her mother he ended up getting beat up too. So when she saw me intervening and getting my ass kicked in the bar incident it triggered some kind of PTSD in her head that she could not control . That's why she had grown distant and eventually left. It all spiraled out of control and she could not handle it.

In those two weeks we'd been apart she'd barely eaten or slept and even made some really dark thoughts which I'd rather not go into. She told me is a horrible girlfriend for  leaving me alone in my condition and that she doesn't  expect us to be together again after that,which I told her  isn't the case.

So we have a very long road ahead of us. My number one  priority right is getting her to see a therapist, which I suggested we can do together if she's scared to do alone.


So yeah that's where we are at. Some of you were right, that there was some deeper issue behind what happened but I could not have possibly known.

I also wanted to take this opportunity to say something that I got messaged about a lot. I got a lot of comments and messages saying that I was a moron for what I did at that parking lot and that I should mind my own buisness next time and not play the hero, etc . First of all I did not initiate the fight with the dude. As I said when I got there  I tried to pretend I was the boyfriend of the one of the girls in case. When that didn't work I got between the girls and the dude trying to create some space between them and that's when he started to push me and eventually  started throwing punches.

Secondly no matter how hard I hit the gym I would never be able to take that guy one on one. As I said I'm pretty fit, and  I've been working out for several years but the fella was a lot bigger than me. Unless I had a gun or something, which isn't legal in my country I was doomed.

Finally  for the people telling me to mind my own business, well let me you that what exactly what I was doing. It is mine and everyone else's responsibility to look after the ones who can't protect themselves is this shitty world. No, I do not consider myself a hero, nor did I do it for the show. I did it because in some other instance one of those girls could have been my girlfriend, sister, mother needing help. And these girls  were somebody else's girlfriend, sister or mother .  If I was put in that situation a hundred more times I would  act the same.

Edit:I also talked to her about the proposal I wanted to make this year. I was planning on doing it as a surprise but in the way the things have turned out I figured it would be better if she knows it first. We both agreed it should be delayed for now.

ANSWER: As a girl, I want to thank you OP for standing up for the two girls. Not a lot of people would have done that, especially if they knew that they weren't as strong as the other person, and it takes a whole lot of courage. I'm glad they had someone to protect them and we really need more people like you

edit: thanks for all of the awards yall :)

QUESTION: UPDATE: I(24M) adopted my little sister(8F) after our parents passed away, GF(23F) isn't so excited about it

EDIT: Link to the original if anyone's looking: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/e1py86/i24m\_adopted\_my\_little\_sister8f\_after\_our\_parents/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e1py86/i24m_adopted_my_little_sister8f_after_our_parents/)

Hey people, it's been a while since my original post and I have some free time today and not much to do with it so I'm gonna write this, why not.

A lot happened since my first post, in the end, my GF, now ex I guess, couldn't deal with the fact that I had a new priority. I admit that I wasn't the best at managing time between them two and I would spend a lot more with my sister than my GF but I think that's understandable, maybe. In general, my GF was on and off with my sister, one day she would be the nicest person to her and the other would completely blow her off and be borderline mean. I had a few talks with her that it needs to stop, but it would only end up working for maybe the rest of the week and the next it would be back to square one. About three weeks ago it erupted into a big argument, she accused me of not loving her anymore, and that I play favorites. I told her they're not my children to be playing favorites and that obviously for some time my sister is gonna need a lot more attention, since you know she lost her parents. In the end, she went back to her ultimatum, sister or her. I was angry at this point, because she has been mean to my sister that day, and I told her she can pack her shit and find a place to sleep tonight. I haven't seen her since and quite frankly I don't really want to. We texted for a bit, basically both sides confirming its over and arranging when she can come for the rest of her stuff.

As for my sister, she's a lot better. She doesn't stay in her room all day anymore and she's slowly going back to her talkative old self. She still doesn't like being alone but it was the same before the accident, so since my gf moved out, we've been sharing a bed for comfort. She still wakes up at night crying sometimes so it's better when I'm there and frankly it's a lot more comfortable. One thing I really regret is my sister heard that whole fight and she started apologizing to me for breaking me and my GF up, I ensured her it's not her fault at all and if anything she helped me see for who my GF really was. She still goes to her therapist and it's really helped a ton, she doesn't need me to be there while she falls asleep and doesn't panic when I go to the shop for 15 minutes.

All in all, these past 3 months have been the hardest time in my life but eye opening to my ex's disregard for my family and kind of me too. Sorry for no happy ending, I guess this is how real life is.

EDIT2: I would love to thank everybody for kind words individually but with this amount it's crazy, so I wanna give everyone who gave me advice and kind words a HUGE THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY YOU'RE ALL AMAZING. These numbers are overwhelming and I can't even express in words how it feels that so many people care, it's really something else. Didn't expect that strangers on the internet could make me cry either, so once again a huge THANK YOU.

ANSWER: One of the most mature and sensible posts I have read in a long time.  How very lucky your sister is to have you in her life.  Keep guiding and supporting her in this exact manner and she'll be just fine!

================================================================================

QUESTION: My girlfriend told me she was with a friend, but that friend was with me picking out an engagement ring. How do I confront my girlfriend about her lie?

Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hjkgnj/update_my_girlfriend_told_me_she_was_with_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

God this is a doozy. I swear my life feels like a movie right now. Sorry for the weird formatting, I'm on mobile and this is my first time posting on a sub like this. 

I (28M) am planning on proposing to my girlfriend of 3 years (26F). Now, I suck at picking out jewelry. Im the type of guy that doesn't see a problem with heart shaped jewelry (seriously why is it considered so ugly?) so every time I want to buy something for my girl, I usually consult one of our mutual friends. My girl's best friends are all friends with me as well and we all get along well, so asking them for help picking out jewelry is something I'm used to. 

When it came time to pick out a ring, I consulted my girlfriends best friend Justine (fake name). Justine and I are quite close and she knows my girlfriend better than anyone, including me. So, when my girlfriend when out to visit her sister and baby nephew, I invited Justine over to the house to help pick out a ring.

Justine and I looked through a few catalogues, but decided it was a dead end and it would be better to go to professionals at a jewelry store. However, I didn't know when my girlfriend would be coming home, so Justine and I thought of a clever text to gauge how much time we had. I asked her when she'd be coming home, as I was ordering takeout and wanted to know when to tell them to have the food ready by. 

She responded by saying it would be a few hours, she met up with Justine to go shopping. Now, obviously this took me by surprise since Justine was standing inside my house. I showed Justine the text, and she looked as confused as I was. 

It isn't out of the ordinary for my girlfriend to meet up with people out of the blue like that for shopping, lunch, etc. She's a very spontaneous person and loves making plans on the fly. So ordinarily, I would have believed this text in a heartbeat. However, obviously this had to be a lie. 

When she came home she acted completely normal, and I played along but it's been really hard to act like everything's fine. We got takeout, ate together, and cuddled on the couch after. So far she's caught on a little that somethings upsetting me, but I just can't tell her what. Looking at her kills me. 

I don't know what to do. My girlfriend and I have zero trust issues and we tell each other everything, so this lie is killing me. I want to ask her about it so bad, but if I tell her I knew she was lying, I'd have to explain why, and I really don't want to do that. What do I do? I know she lied to me but I don't know how to confront her about it. Should I just forget it? This won't stop gnawing at me. Please help!

Edit: I'm sorry for the lack of responses, it's been a hectic day and there's a lot of comments. Thank you to everyone who has commented so far, I appreciate them all!!

Edit #2: sorry again for the lack of responses, guys. It's really been a crazy day. My parents are moving and I've been helping them. Also, I've never experienced this many comments on a post in my life!! I am going to talk to her tonight once we're both finally settled in after such a busy day, and I will update tomorrow.

ANSWER: I know you say you can’t tel her why you know, but I honestly think you should. You don’t want this to bug you forever and propose to a girl that could be potentially hiding something. Just say you were hanging out with Justine because you needed help with a gift, so you know she wasn’t with her. And see what she says. Trust and communication is important and it would suck to know you propose to a girl who could be doing you wrong, but also just as bad to sit there and let that lie eat you alive.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before I get married.

My fiance proposed to me about 8 months ago. We decided on having a relatively small wedding which is in two days. Everything was going great. He seems absolutely perfect and we are very much in love.

I am a virgin and so is he, he wanted to save it for marriage and I wasn't fussed so I agreed to saving it. He has told me earlier that in his family the father checks the virginity of the bride the night before the wedding. I laughed this off as it seriously sounds like a massive joke. No turns out he was dead serious. He wants me, the night before to open my legs up in a small ceremony type thing so his dad can check me while him, his brothers and uncle can watch so that they know I am still 'pure'.

I told him fat chance I am going to do that and he was begging to me to go through with it and how important it is for him. He said he knew it was slightly embarrassing for me but his mom did and it will prove how much I love him and that I have nothing to hide anyway as I am still a virgin. I left and he was crying, it was very dramatic tbh.

I want to call off the whole wedding because of this and never talk to him again. But at the same time its only one thing and other then that we are genuinely perfect for each other and I dont want to spend my life with anyone else and it is very important to him and his family.

What the frick frack do I do. I am currently at my friends house and I might stay here for the night. tomorrow would be our last day as an unmarried couple and I am straight up panicking.

ANSWER: This "tradition" is disgusting.

He's essentially asking you to expose yourself to every male in his family. It's nuts. Not to mention reeks of control and abuse.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My (26F) boyfriend (35m) choked me until I passed out during sex, waited until he "finished" to check on me.

[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gnq99t/my_26f_boyfriend_35m_choked_me_until_i_passed_out/)

Before I get into anything, I am safe, and I am okay and recovering.

Thank you to everyone that commented and reached out to me. Your advice and words of wisdom meant so much to me. Well, everyone but the guy that messaged me to tell me that "guys won't like me" if I tell them why I broke up with my now ex-boyfriend.

I can't go into a lot of details, but the clinic I went to sent me to the hospital, where I had a full work up done, and met with a DV advocate and police officers. The scale of injuries were severe enough that I was granted an immediate order of protection.

This was the [last text message](https://imgur.com/a/yaI8A7X) I got from him before I changed my number. I have a feeling that many posters were correct, that this was the test to see how far he could go.

All of my big things are in storage at my parent's house, and I've been rotating between a couple different friend's houses the past couple of nights. I have plans to move a couple cities over, so I will be as far away from him as possible. My advocate set up an appointment with a therapist, and I met with her this morning.

I'm not sleeping much still, but I am surrounded by good people that will help me get through this.

Thank you reddit. The clarity you all gave me probably saved my life.

ANSWER: “No one can manage your chaos like I can” what a bullshit, CRINGY, young adult vampire romance novel-esque, I-got-this-quote-from-tumblr, wannabe dom, literally embarrassing thing to say. Apart from the final message (which is straight up evil and shows how inflated his sense of self importance is), that message alone has just given me secondhand embarrassment that I may never recover from. I might need to seek compensation from him. 

But seriously I am super proud of you for fucking him off and recognising how messed up he is. Your life is going to be a million times better without him. You got this.

================================================================================

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My fiancé (26F) and I (27M) decided to break up but she couldn't move out due to the lockdown. After about four months isolating with her, I've realized I don't want to break up anymore.

Original post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hmuoa5/my_fianc%C3%A9_26f_and_i_27m_decided_to_break_up_but/)

Although I didn't get to reply to any of the comments except for one, I made sure to read all of them in my main account, so I would like to thank everyone for their great advices. Here I am now, excited to tell what happened in the course of 5 days.

So the day after posting that, nothing really happened. I spent that day reflecting on what kind of future I see and want with her. I also thought a lot about the past; how we messed it up, how we both got too lost in our jobs... etc. In my original post, I asked if what I'm feeling could be just an infatuation that would go as quickly as I came. But I realized that my feelings for her never really disappeared to begin with. It's like my heart just went in a deep sleep and I forgot how much feelings I carry for her.

I think some of you may know (and have pointed out) that I'm not really good at communicating my feelings. I tend to keep things to myself, and my fiancé is one of the few people who can be patient with that. Some suggested to write a letter instead, or a note, or marry her in sims... I ended up with drafts of sappy letters that I ended up scraping and a sad attempt to recreate us in the sims. But still, I wanted to make an effort to show her what I couldn't say through words. 

I've heard about her wanting a few DLCs in the sims in the past, so I had the idea to buy a few for her (sims' DLCs are pretty expensive especially in our currency..). Surprised her by stealing her laptop for a few hours and once I gave it back to her, she was elated and so happy. It was really nice seeing her get so excited over it. We played together that whole day and tried to solve the mystery in Strangerville (a game pack in the sims). It was so fun.

The next day, I found her in the kitchen trying to bake something. It was a blueberry cheesecake recipe she saw on youtube. I basically became her cooking assistant that day, helping her as much as I could and we ended up with a pretty decent outcome that I bet would've tasted better if I hadn't messed up so much. She still said she had so much fun and loved the cheesecake though.

The next day, which is just yesterday, something important happened. We were basically just snuggled up on the couch playing when our sims just autonomously "tried for baby" in the bed. It was hilarious and we initially laughed about it but then we got pretty silent. She then closed her laptop and hugged me tightly then, without saying anything. I think that was my realization that "oh, she feels the same as I do.." so I knew I had to speak up. I'm still impressed at myself for managing to talk yesterday without choking up, basically opening up the conversation like "are you planning to go to your parents soon?" and she said no, she doesn't feel like it yet. I asked her why, she told me she wanted to stay. I told her I wanted her to stay too. We went to sleep that night just huddled together. And even though we didn't really explicitly say it, I think we're now aware of each other's feelings and it feels like a really huge improvement to me.

Earlier we ate breakfast together. We weren't as chatty as we've been the last few months but the silence was comforting. We also watched "Knives Out" together. We haven't had \the\ conversation yet, but I'm going to bring it up to her tonight. I'm really glad this whole ordeal went much nicer than I expected it would and I'm relieved I didn't let my doubts get the best of me. Though I still have to get better with how I communicate things, I'm going to learn for her. 

Thank you to everyone who left nice comments in my original post. I apologize again if there are any mistakes in my post, I'm not a native english speaker nor am I from the USA. 

TL;DR: We both feel the same towards each other. We're yet to have the "talk" but I know now, without a doubt, that she still loves me, too.

Edit: last update in my comment https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqdh6u/comment/fxy0mgg Thanks everyone!

ANSWER: Okay hi. I posted this thinking the same people who saw my last post would respond, and seeing that a few users wanted an update back then, I thought what the hell, why not give them a little update right now and leave it at that. Now I have 5x more the audience I had the last time... 

Right now my fiancé is sleeping next to me. Yes we had the talk. As soon as I posted this, I logged out and gathered myself so I can tell her what's been in my mind for months. It's not really something so 'exciting'. We basically just sat down together and talked about what went wrong before. I told her the things I said in my last post, and she admitted to worrying about what happens after the lockdown gets fully lifted too. We both acknowledged that we worked too hard to become financially stable so that we can get married. Right now though, all we could do is promise and talk about how we're going to manage our time better, since we have no idea if our country is ever going to return to normal (the curve is not getting flattened at all and the quarantine is about to get extended again). And then we talked about our feelings. I got to tell her I love her again, for the first time in years probably, and she told me the same. After that it was back to a lighter conversation, we basically just bonded until she fell asleep.

I honestly thought only a handful of people would see my post. I made sure to use reddit because this isn't really a big platform in our country and I was sure she wouldn't see this post, but now that there are like 20k upvotes as I'm typing this, I think she might stumble upon this post sooner or later... Well then, I know she's going to be whining a lot about this but she'd be glad to know that a lot of people found our relationship "wholesome".

Thank you all for the kind comments. I know some people are thinking "why haven't you just talked to her in the first place" but getting some perspective from other people really did help give a push. I think if I left myself alone with the thoughts I was having, things would've gone a lot worse, so I'm really grateful. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the awards I received since this is just a throwaway account though, but it's still cool. I'll try to answer as many questions as I can and then log out.

Thank you again :)

================================================================================

QUESTION: [UPDATE] I accidentally found out my (28M) fiancee (27F) has been creating erotic fan art/fiction for years. I am not judging but when i mentioned it to her, she became furious (i have never seen her so upset). I am really confused.

Doing this on a new throwaway because i cannot remember the password to my original throwaway account. 

Original Post is Here: [OP](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g86svn/i_accidentally_found_out_my_28m_fiancee_27f_has/)

She came back after i sent a large apology message, apologizing for laughing at her fan fiction and it was not done out of malice and more out of awkwardness.

We had a long talk about it, i explained i wasn't that comfortable with her keeping such a large amount of her life secret/hidden from me. She also admitted that often times when she was saying she was working late in our home office what she actually meant was she was writing/drawing stuff and just wanted to be left alone.

I told her i had no problem with her hobbies, which made her happy. She also told me that she is so embarrassed because a bunch of it is self inserts of her, and some of it would make me unhappy reading it. 

I asked her to show me, and she eventually agreed. I read some of it and it didn't bother me at all, (imo to me fantasizing about fictional characters isn't a huge deal as it is simply a fantasy and not real).    I asked if some of the things she writes are things that turns her on, and i told her i am willing to try anything at least once. 

Yesterday night she actually sat down next to me, and started writing while i was next to her on the couch, and she didn't seem embarrassed at all anymore. So i guess this is good.

Thank you for your help.

TL;DR; Me and my Fiancee were able to work things out, and she isn't so embarassed anymore about it, and is willing to share with me. Thanks for the advice!

ANSWER: She was scared at how it would be recieved. I can admit that some of my past writing I'd be kind of embarrassed or ready to get made fun of for it. Some partners in the past have not been kind. You showed a maturity and a kindness to your fiancee that I'm sure speaks volumes in her mind. This is kind of communication and growth I wish more people had. Congrats.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (28f) dog attacked my stalker after he broke into my house. Now my SIL (32f) says my dog is "too dangerous" to be around my niece (4f). Feel like I'm going crazy.

This is kind of a complicated story but I’ll just get into it. I used to be in this controlling, kind of abusive relationship. When I finally broke it off a year ago, my ex started showing up places, trying to get me to take him back. Eventually, it developed into full-on stalking. He would show up at my work (and took to just waiting outside of it after he was banned), leave notes on my car when I was at the grocery store, leave all kinds of flowers outside my house and then stick angry notes on my door after he saw me throw them in the trash, wrote me all kinds of weird, obsessive emails and letters. I’ve had to change my phone number three times. The behavior escalated over time, and got scarier/more threatening. In one instance, he started a small fire in my driveway but the police couldn’t get enough evidence connecting him to it. It was after that instance that I put cameras in my yard (I previously only had them pointing at my doors).

I was horrified to learn that the police couldn’t do shit about any of this until my stalker actually was caught doing something illegal, like breaking into my house. At which point, I might already be dead. I decided I wasn’t spending the rest of my life waiting for the other shoe to drop, so I got a handgun and a concealed carry permit, took some self defense courses, and started doing strength training. I also looked into getting an attack dog, but after all the money I’d sunk into my other methods of protection, they were prohibitively expensive. So I went to my local animal shelter and got the scariest, meanest-looking dog I could find. This is where Thor comes in. He’s a 100 pound American Bulldog, looks like he’d rip your throat out on sight, but is basically a gigantic teddy bear. He loves every person he’s ever met, is incredibly sweet and gentle with my 4-year-old niece, enjoys other animals, and even loves the mailman. I just kind of accepted that he probably wouldn’t do anything to protect me from my stalker, but it didn’t matter that much because having such a huge dog made me so much more confident. I brought Thor everywhere I could, and was working on getting him trained enough to be an emotional support animal, so I could bring him inside places with me (I absolutely would not do this until he was trained well enough to not disrupt a regular service dog).

Last month, I woke up in the middle of the night to Thor whining. I was groggy and thought he had to go to the bathroom, so I got out of bed and opened the door. At that point, my house alarm went off and pretty soon after that, I was face-to-face with my stalker. I started screaming and went to run for my gun. Before I could do anything though, Thor ran across the room in full attack mode. The memory is really blurry for me, but there was blood all over my living room and I remember my stalker was eventually able to escape, at which point Thor chased him outside and then came back to me.

When the police showed up, they said Thor was a hero who’d probably saved my life. I don’t want to list what they found in my stalker’s car after they caught him (and I’m shaking a little as I type this) but I’m sure he was going to bring me somewhere and kill me. It looks like he’s going to prison for a long time though, so my nightmare is over. Pretty much everyone in my life thinks Thor is a hero, except my SIL. She and my brother have a 4 y/o (the one I mentioned above), and she says she doesn’t want Thor around her (the child) anymore. She says since Thor has “snapped” in the past, he could do it again, so he’s not safe to have around kids (We used to see each other a few times a week before she decided Thor was dangerous). The way she words this makes me really angry because Thor didn’t “snap”. He saw a stranger break into his home, heard his owner scream in terror, and reacted to defend me, himself, and his house. Nothing about that screams “dangerous around children” to me, unless my niece is also going to break into my house and threaten me.

This is also a very emotional issue for me because Thor isn’t just a dog to me. He’s my safe place, my hero, the one who protected me and kept me safe when no one else could. I’ve also gotten increasingly anxious since this happened, and I can’t go anywhere without Thor. I barely leave my house, pay to pick up my groceries from the store instead of going in because I know Thor isn’t allowed inside, and all my friends know that if Thor isn’t welcome in their house, I’m not coming either (although they’re perfectly welcome to come hang out at my house instead). I am really going through it, and am working with a therapist to overcome this (luckily my office is still fully remote but I need to be able to go back to work once we’re in person again). But I really really need my brother and SIL’s support. I think my SIL thinks I’m just pouting and that’s why I won’t just leave the dog home and come over without him. I don’t know how to explain to them that the fear hasn’t stopped just because my stalker is in jail. It’s actually a lot worse than it was before. I’ve already suggested they come over and I crate Thor, but that wasn’t good enough for her. What can I do to make her understand the situation better?

tl;dr My dog took down my stalker after he broke into my house. Now I have severe anxiety and am too afraid to be without him, but my SIL thinks he’s unsafe around my 4 y/o niece. I don’t know how to make them understand that I really am too afraid to go anywhere without him and not just trying to win an argument.

ANSWER: Because there have been plenty of helpful comments already regarding what to do with Thor (great name!) and your SIL, I just want to make sure you’re also taking care of yourself. What you’ve been through is horribly traumatic that few people in the world have experienced. I know you’ve gone to great lengths to protect yourself with classes and the like, but now that the imminent physical threat is taking care of, it’s time to take of the emotional scars your stalker has inflicted on you. 

Please seek out some trauma therapy. You deserve to be able to live without the constant cloud of fear hanging over you. Please seek professional therapy. You’ll thank yourself so much for being kind enough to take care of your mental health. 

Best of luck to you and lots of pets for your perfect doggie!

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (39/m) husband wants to kick our (17/m) son out as soon as he graduates.

And I'm not so sure I agree. Our son is a senior atm but, he's expected to be graduating this year. He'll be turning 18 in August and that's when my husband wants to kick him out. He's persistent in his beliefs and unwavering he wants him to spread his wings, to handle life on his own. That also means we won't be giving him any sort of financial aid, etc.  It's not as if our son is lazy. He's a very hard worker and spends most his time cracking the books or at after school football practice. But, he wanted to hold off on College just until he can get a good idea to what he wants.  Personally, I found it very mature of him to want too but, my husband disagrees and thinks it's a sign of him being lazy and immature. We've been arguing non-stop. 

My argument is so long as he is working and helping out what's the harm in him staying? Why should one be expected to abandon their kids the moment they've become adults? He's our only child; our baby. I want him to leave when he is ready. Why push him out so soon? I sort of feel that as a mother I've failed if I'm abandoning him so soon when he isn't ready.

ANSWER: I have a close friend whose parents did this to him after his 1st year of college. Completely shut off all financial aid or even communication with him, saying that "it was for his own good." 2 years later, someone who used to be the smartest and most hardworking person I knew is working as a pizza delivery driver and other odd jobs  just to make ends meet. He lives in a crappy apartment in the worst part of town. This is a guy who was the top of his class and voted most likely to become successful. If you want your son to have a good life, help him. That spreading his wings philosophy is bullshit, and in my opinion something that lazy parents use to get rid of their kids. Children are a lifelong commitment and investment, not something to be disregarded after 18 years.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.

Throwaway, because reasons.

TL;DR: Found my gym socks in the garbage covered in poop. Asked girlfriend about it. She started yelling at me and crying and left.

I don't even know where to start with this. I'm dumbfounded. She just stormed out the house and I'm sitting on the bed asking myself A LOT of questions.

I live a pretty normal life, and I thought so did my girlfriend. We've been together for a few months and after things got serious, we moved in together. We started sharing a lot of the household responsibilities, but the one thing she was adamant on doing was the laundry. She would come home and find me in the bedroom getting the laundry together and would quickly ask me to go do something else. I'd come back to finish the laundry and she would have already started it. I always thought it was sweet and never her job to do it alone, but hey, if it makes her happy to do it all the time, I wouldn't stop her.

This is where it takes a turn for the weird. I keep all my socks and underwear in the bottom drawer of my dresser. I also go to the gym frequently, so I always keep a good supply of clean gym socks ready to go. I never kept count, but I know by just a visual glance I several pairs. This morning when I went to grab a fresh pair to pack for the gym, I noticed there were several dress socks, but no gym socks. Again, not weird, they must have been in the laundry. I went to check the laundry basket and it was empty, so I checked the washing machine and dryer. Both were empty. I couldn't figure out where all of my gym socks had gone. So, I did the very natural thing of asking my girlfriend what had happened to them. After all, she is the one who does the laundry all the time. She went silent, turned red and ran out of the room. When I went after her to see if she was okay she wouldn't talk to me. I told her I wasn't mad, I was just looking for my socks. She kinda mumbled "I'll don't know." I still wasn't mad, of course, but I was super confused. Socks just don't disappear. So I asked her again, even laughed about it and she just looked at me and got mad and said "I'll buy you new ones!"

The first thought that went through my head was she had somehow managed to destroy my socks while washing them. I thought the sight of that was actually pretty funny, so I joked with her about ruining my socks. Wrong. Thing. To. Say. She started immediately crying. Like, full on sobbing. At this point I don't care about the socks anymore, I want to know what's wrong with my girlfriend. I sat down next to her on the bed and put my arm around her and asked her of she was okay. She just kept saying she was sorry and that she would buy me new socks. I tried assuring her again it was okay. Even went so far as to say I would buy new socks and she didn't have to. I sat with her for a few minutes trying to calm her down and eventually had to get ready for work. I told her loved her and got my things together to leave for the day.

On my way out I grabbed the garbage to take outside. When I got outside I lifted the lid off the garbage can and I noticed a small plastic bag sitting on top of the garbage already in there. I could see through the bag (kind of the semi see through ones) there were socks in the bag. Since I was sure she had somehow managed to ruin the socks washing them, I wanted to see for myself. I opened the bag and immediately regretted my choice. There, inside the bag, were several pairs of my gym socks covered in what looked like poop. As soon as the smell hit me I knew it WAS POOP.

1. We don't own any pets.
2. We don't have any kids.
3. WHOSE POOP WAS ON MY SOCKS?

Work could wait. I couldn't go the rest of the day wondering why my gym socks were covered in poop and inside a plastic bag in the garbage can. I grabbed the bag and walked back inside. As soon as my girlfriend saw the bag she flipped out and started yelling at me. She said I shouldn't be going through the garbage and that I was disgusting for bringing it back into the house. I asked her to calm down and that I just wanted an answer as to why there was poop on my socks. I wasn't blaming her of anything, but she started accusing me of blaming her. That's when it clicked. I don't know what it was that lead me to ask this, but everything leading up to this moment had just been so crazy. I asked her "Is this your poop?" She started sobbing again and ran out of the house. I didn't go after her this time.

So, now I am sitting on my bed with a bag a poopy socks on the floor and a lot of questions in my head. The only conclusion is that she used them after going to the bathroom. Which that alone has its own set of questions above everything else. I sent her text asking her to come back. She hasn't responded yet. I don't even know what I'm going to say when (IF) she gets back.

UPDATE:

I had to leave for work and am now at work. Yes, I threw away the bag of poopy socks. She texted me back and she's clearly embarrassed, but felt she owed me an explanation. She said she didn't want to talk about it in person and that we could discuss it over texting and to NOT bring it up in person. I'm condensing the conversation and filling in some gaps as best as I can. Her responses are super short, but I'm getting the idea.

I flat out asked her if it was a fetish. It is not a fetish. She confessed to using the socks after going to the bathroom. I found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own. I had no reason to question the amount of socks she ever has because who pays attention to that kind of thing? She thought I would notice and think it was weird since she doesn't own many socks. She admitted she has done this for a long time. Her reasoning, as best as I can understand, is that because she is a germaphobe (her word) and she is afraid toilet paper will tear and is afraid of getting her hands messy in ANY WAY. She uses socks because it covers her entire hand. After she's done with them, she throws them away. She used mine because she didn't have other socks.  

So, my girlfriend has a fear of getting poop on her hands so she wipes with socks, and has done so for a lone time. It could be worse, I guess. I hope we can laugh about this later. I'm trying to find the humor in it now, but I'm still weirded out.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My parents falsely accused my brother of being a creep and it's really affecting him.

My brother is 15, my sister is 17, and I'm 23f. This is really stupid and it shouldn't have happened but it did. Now I just want advice on how to make it better. Also this is the story my brother told me as I wasn't there.

He was in his room playing on his phone minding his own business. He got up to take out the trash. He came back to lay down im his bed. As he was laying down he noticed there dog walking out of his room. He ignored it.

Later on his sister 17 noticed clothes were missing. She went looking for it and found it in my brothers room. The problem was that is was wet and slimy. She immediately told our parents and they thought the worse. My dad, mom, and brother argued about it. 

Rude things were said. Apparently mom said I knew you were weird but not this weird. My dad said I raised a predator. In the end my parents asked me to pick him up and let him stay with me for a couple of days. When I picked him up he didn't say anything and just sat in silence.

He spent the entire time in the room he was staying in. He only came out for dinner. He skipped breakfast and lunch. His eye's were always red when he came out so I assume he was crying. I've never seen him cry. Most of the time when he's upset he just has a stone face so what they said must have got to him.

Finally at the end of the week he's parents called me and said they wanted to talk to him so they came over. Before they came over I tried to talk to him but he ignored me. When parents came they apologised to him. Over the week they noticed more of sister clothes in his room until one day my dad caught the dog with my sister clothes.

My brother just said okay and went home. I tried to ask my parents if he could stay longer but they said that wouldn't be necessary. Later on I got a call asking me what did he do over my house because he's just been in his room all day at there house. Is there anything I can do to help him feel better?

Advice would be greatly unappreciated.

Edit little update:Good news. He can stay with me until Sunday. I had to lie a little to parents to get him to come. I told them he should get out the house because he spends most of his day sitting in one spot with online school.

They didn't believe me a first but I said it would be a chance to get him out his room. They finally agreed. He was about to go to sleep so I came just in time. I think the plan right now is to just spent time with him this week. I'm broke so it's gonna be mostly home stuff.

I tried to talk to him on the car ride. I asked him if he's okay. He said he's fine and we had a little conversation about his school. So at least he's talking now. He's in the spare room so everything is okay right now.

ANSWER: Your parents need to apologize to your brother PROFUSELY. Beyond that, I sadly have no other advice to offer. I can understand why he's upset.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend (35m) drugged me (26f) with Benadryl because we got into an argument before our road trip and he wanted me to sleep the whole time.

Update: posted on throwramerr1 if anyone sees this, due to the 48 hour rule. Just wanted to go ahead and post and let y’all know I’m okay. 
 
Update 2: Here was the post that got removed

Holy shit, y’all. 
I haven’t been on reddit since I posted my original here and I did NOT expect this. I had to make an extra account with similar name to post because of the 48 hour thing, but I know a lot of people were genuinely worried about me so I wanted to go ahead and post an update (sorry if that’s not allowed). 

Thank you guys so much, I can’t even believe the support/response I got. I ended up calling my brother and telling him about it and asking him how I should handle it, and he got in his car to come get me before I even finished telling him what all had happened. Him freaking out more than anything else made me realize that I wasn’t overreacting. I didn’t tell my boyfriend I was leaving until my brother was parked on the street and I just walked out with a few things. So now I’m in a messy breakup situation where he’s already tried to come by my moms house even though I told him I didn’t want to see him and that I’d get my stuff eventually, both from his parents house where he’s currently at and his actual house. Things are gonna be weird to figure out but I just wanted to let you guys know that I’m totally okay, thank you. I can’t reply to everyone who reached out/messaged so I hope you guys see this and know I appreciate it.








Monday we decided to make the 8ish hour drive back to our home state and quarantine there instead for a few months. Right before leaving, we got into a big fight because I wanted to stay at my mothers house for a while, he doesn’t want me to, among other things I won’t get into. Well, before leaving we decided to eat dinner so we didn’t have to stop anywhere. 

Fast forward to our drive and not long after hitting the road I passed out. Don’t even really remember falling asleep. Woke up one time for a while, drank some Gatorade which he gave me, and then I fell asleep again. I thought this was extremely weird because I wasn’t tired hardly at all and we didn’t even leave super early. I kept commenting on how weird it was that I was tired the whole drive and slept 90% of it. 

Yesterday the tension eased a bit and he made the offhanded comment that he wishes he could drug me more when I “act out” and argue with him. I ask him what he’s talking about. Proceeds to tell me he put Benadryl in my drink and that’s why I slept, so he didn’t have to deal with me. He literally said this as though it wasn’t that big of a deal! I’m still reeling from the conversation and completely floored. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or not but something tells me I’m not, and it’s extremely fucked up to put medicine in drinks. I don’t know what to do

ANSWER: Leave him. That is a very big problem. Now he knows how to keep you at bay, he may exploit it for his gain.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Me [52M] just found out at least 4 of my 5 children [33F][30F][28M][24F][14F] are not mine. Wife [51F] wont say anything.

Note: Please do not use ancestry kits as a paternity test. If you genuinely want to check your child is your own - get a proper paternity test at  your local MedLab (medical lab). Ancestry tests are not accurate, and should not be used to test paternity. In my case, it simply raised the alarm to get a proper test.

--------------

I apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. I posted this on  r/relationships but it was locked, and the mod suggested I ask on r/parenting. But I also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so I want to ask for advice here, too.

--------------------

First of all, I'm sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, I am not really in the best state of mind. My world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. I just want to write as much context as possible so I can get the best advice needed. For obvious reasons, I am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.

---------------------

Background: I met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. We have 5 beautiful children together - really, I consider them a total blessing regardless of what I'm about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago I thought that we had the perfect marriage. We were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, I feel like I've done everything a loving husband should do. I am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant I work long hours and maybe haven't always been there when she needed me, but I want to stress that I've never felt our marriage was in any trouble. And never in a million years would I ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she's always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.

Now, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. And the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested I was not her father. She confided this to me privately, showing me the results and I could tell she was visibly upset by this. Of course, the first thing I did was reassure her that no matter what, she's my daughter and I'll always love her unconditionally. But secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. It comes back and I am indeed not her biological father.

This news really broke me. I'm ashamed to say I broke down in tears in front of my daughter. The combination of finding out about my wife's infidelity and how upset I was making my daughter by how I was reacting. I really wish I had kept it in for her sake, but I didn't.

Following this I asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. I wanted to know the extent of my wife's infidelity - if it was a one off, I could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. However I didn't want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really I didn't think it was appropriate to tell her yet.

We tell the other three what has happened, I reassure them that I love them unconditionally and that I'll always be there dad, but that I need to know how long this has been going on. God, I can't begin to explain how touching their reaction was. They didn't care I wasn't their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken I was. I feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.

So we have paternity tests for each of the three done. Not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. Which somehow made it worse. It's like, she wasn't just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? I can't explain how this make it worse, but it just does.

So I confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. She doesn't confess. She doesn't even take it seriously. She says the tests must be flawed. All four? How the hell am I supposed to take that seriously?

I keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. When I bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. "We've been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?" etc. But how am I supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?

Now that I have rambled and explained what has happened. I guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice

1. How can I reassure my children this doesn't change anything between us? I feel like the way I have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times I reassure them.

2. How do I handle my youngest daughter? I feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and I will need to tell my daughter something. I don't want her to know the truth until she's older, but I also don't want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.

3. Is there anyway, anyway at all, you think I could or should save my marriage? I've been with my wife my entire life it's almost impossible to see a life without her. I know that the answer should be a clear cut "leave her", but we have 5 kids together. If there's anything that can be done to save our marriage, I want to consider it seriously.

tl;dr: Found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. Wife refuses to confess her infidelity. Unsure of how to do what's best for my children and marriage.

--------------------------

Edit: Thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. I have not replied to as many comments as I should have, but I've read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. I'll continue reading any comments or messages you send me. Again, I can't begin to thank you for all your support. If this is resolved I might post an update, but if she continues to lie then I don't think I'll bother, as there's not much more I can add. From the advice in this and the r/parenting thread I've decided to:

1. Get second tests just in case some freak accident has occurred.

2. Confront my wife with all four of my older children present.

3. Tell my youngest of the situation. Ask her if she wants to have a paternity test. It will be entirely her decision.

4. I'm 100% going to get some form of therapy. My mental state has really been deteriorating over the last couple of weeks, and I owe it to my kids to hold it to together.

5. Depending on whether my wife tells the truth, and what her explanation is (if any), I have not ruled out some form of counselling. But at the moment I think divorce is inevitable unless she changes her attitude drastically.

6. Contact a lawyer and prepare for divorce, if it comes to that

Once again I'd like to thank all of you for the time you took to express your support and share advice.

--------------------

Edit2: I guess I should clarify some things that people have been asking

1. How did the ancestry results suggests I wasn't her father? My family is entirely Irish. No relatives outside of Ireland other than my immediate family, and I even have the stereotypical red hair. My daughter's ancestry results showed nothing from the British isles/western Europe/northern Europe. That's what set off alarm bells, but it's by no means conclusive, hence the paternity tests.

2. Which two children share the same father? My two eldest daughters share the same father.

3. How did your wife conceive your children? Our eldest daughter was not planned. All the others were planned. Each time we conceived several months after we started trying. Our first three planned children were both our ideas, while she pressured me into having our youngest. She was in her late thirties and wanted one last child before it was too late, and eventually I agreed. She was conceived several months after we started trying, too.

4. Are you infertile? I don't know. I've never had a fertility test done. But the fact that none of our planned children are mine makes me think that I might be. I will have a  fertility test as soon as possible.

ANSWER: Ok wow, im sorry 
She refuses to address the situation? Have your children all confront her at once ... Intervention style

# URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gtcz33/my_23f_boyfriend_24m_wants_to_move_in_with_me_i/
================================================================================

QUESTION: My (23f) boyfriend (24m) wants to move in with me. I want him to live alone first.

My boyfriend and I have been together 10 months. He lives with his parents (50s M+F) and younger brothers (10, 16, 18), no sisters. Before current events he was over my place basically every night. A couple nights ago he said that he wants to move in with me, if I'm up for it.

I've been to his place more than once, and I've seen how their dynamic works. His mother does everything for all 5 men in that house. Cooking, cleaning, the works. Basically all they have to do is put their laundry away after she washes/dries/irons/folds it. The reason the parents aren't forcing them to contribute is that this was the parent's agreement. He works, she's a stay at home, so she raises the kids/runs the household and he pays for everything, with one of the clauses being that as she's doing everything there's no need to involve the boys.

As a result, my boyfriend cannot do anything. I don't know how much of this is actual cluelessness and how much is him trying to get out of stuff, but he has told me, completely sincere (and I checked this with his mother), that he can't even fry an egg. Which is why, when my boyfriend suggested moving in together, I said I wanted him to live alone first.

His plan was basically to go straight from his mother's house to my flat. I told him my hesitation, which is that he can't do chores. He then offered to pay more rent (75%) in exchange for me doing all the chores. I said no. I don't want to be his mother, or his maid, I want to be his girlfriend.

Then I told him I wanted him to live alone. Go from his mothers house to his own place, figure out how to do all the things he's never done for himself, learn some basic life skills, and then revisit us living together.

This has caused a HUGE argument, biggest we've ever had. He's taken me saying he has no life skills as an insult, which it kind of was to be fair, and has basically said that clearly I don't want to live with him at all as I've pushed the moving in time back and have only said we'd "revisit" after a few months of him living alone, and I did say "revisit" because I wanted to make sure he actually knew what he was doing and wouldn't immediately switch back to offering more rent for no chores.

This was all a couple nights ago and he's just stopped talking to me. He's at his mum's, he's online, he's talking to mutual friends who have said he is responding, he just won't answer any of my calls/texts. He's told our friends what happened and they're all on his side, saying I was really mean/cruel. I love him, and I do want to live with him eventually, I just don't want to live with him if I'm doing everything, and the one thing I don't want is him paying extra for me to do all the housework.

Is there some sort of compromise, or some option I'm not seeing? What can I do to fix this?

TL;DR: Boyfriend is incapable of doing any household chores. He wants to move in together. I don't want to be his maid. We can't find a compromise and I would love any suggestions.

Update: he called me and agreed to talk. He then basically said that he was never going to be willing to learn to do anything, and even suggested dividing up the chores then I do my half and he hire a maid to do his half. Suffice to say this was something of a turn off and by the end of the conversation we broke up.

ANSWER: You don’t need to fix anything. Your boyfriend needs to learn to take care of himself, not just expect you to be Mommy With Benefits. If he’s insulted that you said he had no life skills, he should go get some. How is he not wildly embarrassed to be 24 and not do his own laundry, anyway?

================================================================================

QUESTION: [31M] Husband cheated on [27F] me with his fit and skinny gym friend

I came home from work early (I'm an OB nurse so my hours are pretty unpredictable) and found female sneakers in the garage that weren't mine. At that point, I sort of already knew what I'd be walking into. My husband has recently become very fit and has been consistently going to the gym, during which he made a female friend who he even brought home for dinner last week. She's beautiful and thin and everything I am not, which instantly made me feel horrible. So, I talked to him about it. He encouraged me to build my confidence and reassured me he loved me and would always be loyal to me.

I walked into the laundry room from the garage and sort of tiptoed around the house before going upstairs. They were having sex. In our bed. With a framed picture from our wedding above the nightstand next to it. I silently left the room and got back in my car with tears streaming down my face and drove to get food and just sat in my car crying since. Its now almost 1am (walked in on them at 7pm) and I've returned to the hospital. He called me asking why I wasn't home and I told him my shift is extended but in reality, I'm laying in one of the on call rooms bawling my eyes out as I type this.

I feel so worthless and ugly and stupid. I don't even know how to proceed. On one hand I want to divorce him and never see him again, but on the other hand, I'm an ugly woman....its not like I can do better. I just want to die. I feel so gross and the self-loathing is getting too much right now. Advice please.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for the kind comments and support. Please stop commenting, however. I think I've heard just about everything (including some horrible things about my weight). I don't care about "internet points" or whatever and the notifications are getting crazy. Reading through these comments has been a nice way to keep myself sane these past few hours. I still have no idea what I am going to do and I know everyone wants me to leave, but a marriage is more than can be illustrated with a couple of words on a website. He was a great husband and I can't help but feel at fault for neglecting myself weight-wise. I don't know if I will stay, but that's all I really know right now.

&#x200B;

Edit: I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did and while I'm incredibly grateful for all the nice and supportive comments...please please please stop messaging me about how I should stop eating or laugh at me for expecting a faithful husband while being overweight. It is incredibly upsetting and I am already going through a lot. I feel I need to clarify since everyone seems to care that I had food after I found out. I had been working a shift from 7am to 6:30pm during which I had been all over the place. I had lunch at 11am and nothing else until I left. I was starving and hurt and driving around with tears streaming down my face. Please stop harassing me about that.

ANSWER: When you see a woman that you don’t find particularly attractive or skinny walking down the street with her partner, do you think “she deserves to be cheated on?” I really don’t think so. You wouldn’t be this mean to anyone else, so why treat yourself this way?

QUESTION: UPDATE: My (40m) ex wife (40f) wants me to be with her in her last days

Link to my first post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ieage6/my_40m_ex_wife_40f_wants_me_to_be_with_her_in_her/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Quick recap: My ex wife, who Ive known since I was 10, cheated on me but is now dying and wants me to be around before she dies.

It's been almost 3 weeks since I've posted and a lot has happened since. I got some solid advice from a lot of you guys, especially some who messaged me their personal experiences. I'd like to thank you guys from the bottom of my heart. 

So here's what happened... 

As many of you guys suggested, I talked to my wife. We had a long discussion about the whole situation and I assured her that no matter what, she is and always will be my first priority. I also assured her that while I wanted to say my good-bye, I would never act like her husband. It would be more like me seeing a childhood friend or something like that. I also told her I would never spend the night nor would I be alone with her. 

She was more comfortable after our talk and was pretty ok with the idea of me seeing my ex again. As you guys guessed, she really felt like she was forced into being ok with it when my sister asked but this time, she really was ok. 

So I talked to my sister and after a long, long heated discussion about what my "role" would be in the visit, she agreed to the boundaries my wife and I set. 

A week later my sister and I came over to our old marital home. It was surreal cause while the emotions from years before came back to me, I didn't feel any sadness nor hatred or anything negative. I saw my ex, who was waiting for us in the living room and she cried when I walked in. Most of you suggested she was faking it but while she was still strong, you could tell almost immediately something was wrong with her. I indulged her with a hug and we talked for a few hours while my sister made lunch. I showed her pictures of my kids and told her stories about what they're like. Honestly, I didn't know how I would react after I saw her again but it just feels like seeing an old friend you haven't seen in a long time. There was no hate or anything like that. 

I walked around the house and it was pretty much the way it was when I left over a decade ago. Im not really sure how I feel about our wedding photos still framed and pictures of us still all over the house but it wasn't really my place to say anything. 

The three of us had lunch and played board games all afternoon. It honestly felt like we were back to when we were kids and the three of us would hang out together. It was nice. 

I left at around 6. She was sad but she understood. When I hugged her good-bye, she whispered "I love you" to me but then said how she's happy I was able to find the happiness she couldn't give me. That part got to me to be honest and I was fighting back tears. I told her I'd see her again soon and she asked if I could bring my kids next time. I told her I would and left to pick up dinner for my family. 

I told my wife everything that happened and she was quite happy about the outcome. I guess it helped that I brought home her favorite food but she also agreed to let me bring the kids next time. 

Overall, it was a great experience seeing her again. I feel like I needed that and would've regretted not doing so. 

Again, I'd like to thank everyone who gave me advice. Also, please don't roast my ex too much. She made a mistake and paid the price but it doesn't mean shes an evil person. 

This will be my last update. Thank you very much, reddit.

ANSWER: As you noted in the OP, you were over the marriage.  No reason not to be there for a friend.  I'm glad you went through with it.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My(26M) gf(24F) told me she is pregnant but I am sterile

I am from a SEA country and my first language is not english.

Backstory: I got into an accident after my college and will never be able to have kids. None of my family members know of this. They know about the accident but not about this. I have always wanted to be childfree so it did not affect me much mentally.

I have finished my Masters Degree last year and never dated before. I got a very high paying job directly through campus placements. My parents immediately wanted me to get married after getting a job but I wanted to work on myself and explore a bit. They said no and I said that it was my wish. All my life I did what they wanted and for the first time when I talked against them, they were not happy. This was last year and they gave up after covid started.

So I picked up some dating apps and went through them but no luck. Then my parents introduced me to a family friends daughter and we clicked kinda. Looking back, I was a fool. She said yes to anything I said and never complained about anything. I felt kinda weird about it. I wanted her to express her interests but she always said she was interested in whatever I do. Well, i did not think much about it.

I said that i wont have kids ever and she surprisingly said ok. I was like damn, she is probably the one as it is very hard to find a partner who is childfree in my country (or atleast i thought), but we were in the initial stages and I have not told about my accident. Long story short, we had sex a month ago, i used condoms because safety first. The next day on, she started ghosting me a bit. I thought it was due to my performance in bed and wanted to give her some space. Then she texted infrequently and only replied OKs and Ks and one line answers. I thought maybe she wanted to end the relation and was sad but left it at that.

Yesterday, all her family came to my house and she claims shes pregnant and the father is me. Needless to say, I freaked the fuck out and wanted to collapse on the ground. I did not say anything while they were talking about marriage and stuff that needs to happen because I got her pregnant.

Please advice me on what steps to take now reddit

UPDATE: Let me start off by saying im very very grateful for all the redditors who took their time to read and give me advice. I was overwhelmed by the amount of comments and how many of you said it might not even be my kid. Looking at it from a different perspective gave me much more insight on the whole situation. I called my boss and took today off.

I called up some clinics to get tested and was given a slot on Friday afternoon. Then I went to the store and bought some pregnancy tests and asked only her to come to my place tomorrow ( i.e today morning). I also called my parents and my before I said anything, my mom asked me if I had any good news, I was shocked by what she said and asked me what exactly she was talking about. She then played dumb and I knew that the situation was more fucked that I thought. I cut the call and cried all night till 3am, grown ass man crying for the first time since 8th class. 

She came today morning with her parents even after I told her to come alone. They were under the impression that I was gonna discuss engagement plans with them. I told them to wait outside and called her in and they threw a fit. I told they can all go back or let her alone come in, they said ok. 

I took out the pregnancy tests and gave it to her and told her to prove that she was actually pregnant and told her where the bathroom was. She started screaming at me(never done this before, I was shocked at this), then she went out the door and called her parents in. Now everyone is screaming at me in my own home because I asked her to prove the pregnancy not even a DNA test. I told them all to fuck off and one hour later my parents and they all came to my home and they spilled the beans. She was never actually pregnant(as many redditors said), my parents were afraid that I was getting old for marriage and wanted me to marry and give them grandchildren. They said that in arrange marriages, no need for the people to actually get to know the spouse because parents choose only the best for their kids. They planned this all and were only waiting for me to have sex with her to do this. I broke down and cried again. All my life, I did exactly what my parents wanted, always scored high and never asked for anything. I told them to get out and never talk to me again in between crying and they said parents know whats best for their kids and I should do what they say. Then I got extremely angry and told them to fuck themselves in my native language which was very bad. For once, I think they knew I was serious with them and they all left. I blocked them all before sending my parents a message to never again contact me in my life even if one of you is dying. 

Cried for some more time, went through some dog videos and went through all my messages on reddit and I feel like I owe you guys this update because it was you guys who helped me do this. That is all and I hope you have a wonderful day.

ANSWER: 1.  Get tested to see if you are sterile 
2. IF she is pregnant get the baby tested
3. Make plans accordingly if you are the father or not.
4. On a final note... you may need to step away from your family for your own health.

QUESTION: [UPDATE]My (33m) wife (32f) said her ex’s name while we were having sex

[Here’s the original post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i6li7j/my_33m_wife_32f_said_her_exs_name_while_we_were/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Thank you everyone for your help and advice. I did my investigating before talking to her. I went through his social media first but nothing explicitly saying anything was going on. There were a few mentions of “his love” in some comments but that could mean anything.  I did look at the phone bill and there looks to be calls with him pretty regularly. 

On to hers, I was able to get on her phone when she was asleep. (She must of forgot I knew the code) Nothing in texts and no weird calls. (So she deleted them) I did find some apps she tried to keep “hidden” like Snapchat and Kik. Sure enough, there’s their conversations. And pictures. (I took pictures of all of it on my phone to have as proof) She exploded when we had the conversation and left with our child to her mothers. 

I contacted a lawyer and am in the process of a divorce and figuring out custody. I’m heartbroken and am more angry than anything else. I’m angry at her but I’m also angry at myself for dismissing so many red flags.

ETA The conversations I found were confirming they were having an affair. The pictures were ones they were exchanging, including nudes

ANSWER: Don’t feel bad about missing red flags. You give the people you love the benefit of the doubt because you trust them. And she betrayed that trust. So don’t go blaming yourself because you didn’t do anything wrong, she did.

QUESTION: (Update) My [21M] girlfriend's [21F] grandfather is a Michelin Star chef and is visiting. I am supposed to cook for them but I cannot cook. What the fuck am I supposed to do?

[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hccy33/my_21m_girlfriends_21f_grandfather_is_a_michelin/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

Hey guys. Thank you all for your advice. My gf's grandfather came and we had our dinner yesterday, so this is an update to that post. I just want to say first, I am drunk, so please excuse any typos.

Anyway, I was really freaked out all summer about wanting to impress him. I was seriously considering  pulling the Skinner scam and buying takeout and disguising it, but I decided to just go for trying to make something myself. I spend pretty much all of July trying to make steak. I started with cheap stuff, and it was really, \really\ hard at first, but I learned from my mistakes.

I wanted to go all out, so I bought really nice steak to make when the day came. I made three. One for all of us, and it ended up being better than I hoped, though obviously not Michelin Star quality. I also brought some really expensive (at least for a college student) Cabernet to pair, although he actually brought rum, so we had both. It's around midnight on August 16th here in the Eastern United States; this happened on the evening of August 14th (he came early due to changes in our school schedule). He said that the steak was nice. He and I went out for burgers and hotdogs the next evening (today, but technically actually yesterday). It was just him and I. We also had a metric fuck-ton of beer. All in all, it was a really positive experience, and we got along very well. I'm glad I didn't risk trying to pass off steakhouse food as my own, though I still want to try to see if I can fool my professor's friend. Maybe after the pandemic has passed (grandfather, gf, and I all got tested before meeting for dinner).

I really love my girlfriend :)

ANSWER: So glad you didn't try to fake it. Holy shit that would have been bad, and you would have had to live with the deception. Congratulations, and good work!

================================================================================

QUESTION: Update: My sister (F22) ripped up my(F19) Stan Lee autograph and I haven't forgiven her even tough our mother (F46) is pressuring me to

Thanks for the great advice. So a lot has happened after mom and sister left and we took the money that was menat for my sister's car down payment for the restoration.

My grandma called me and asked what was happening. 

I explained to my grandma what happened and tried explaining who Stan Lee was. Surprisingly she understood just perfectly. I was relieved. For a moment I thought that my dad and I would get shit from everyone.
My sister started giving me shit about telling our grandma and being a "snitch". I told her that she asked me and I just told the truth.

But what took the cake was that my sister apparently ranted in her friend group chat about me and how she couldn't understand my behavior. She again ridiculed my hobby and so on. One of the dudes was really pissed and they had a big argument in the gc. The dude was so mad that he posted the screenshots in his insta story and they spread like wildfire. She is now being ostracized by our community with a few exceptions.

My mom and sister came back in the morning. They didn't talk much to us . My mom  came in my room and asked if we found somone that restored the picture. We had a short dry conversation till she asked me why I was making such a big deal about it. And I shut her up like you guys told me to. I started by explain who Stan Lee was, how long the painting took me, how much it meant to me, equated it to the monetary value and ended it with "it is not only about the autograph. It's about the disrespect you both showed me and how little you seemed to care about me. You said that it was not worth it to destroy family over materialistic things but your daughter destroyed my most valuable possention because I didn't lend her my jacket "

Ya'll my mom cried. She apologized profusely. She said she just didn't know how to deal with it and just wanted the tension to be over and as I was more cool headed than my sister she selfishly expected me to be the bigger person.

My mom and dad are now talking to my sister very seriously because she has yet to apologize for everything.

ANSWER: I'm glad your mom came to her senses. I hope they stop supporting your sister and make her act like an independent adult.

QUESTION: My husband is mad that I let my 16 year old son bathe our 2 year old daughter.

Last night I had a really bad migraine and my husband was at work. I asked my son(16m) if he could give his sister(2f) a bath since my head was killing me.

He was perfectly fine with this and when my husband got home he found me asleep. He woke me up asking if I had made dinner or given our daughter a bath yet. I told him that I had a migraine so our son gave her a bath. He screamed at me saying that this was not ok for him to do unsupervised.

He said that my migraine was no excuse to not take care of her. Then my son hears him yelling at me and tries to get him to stop. He hasn’t spoken to either of us since, what should I do

Edit my son is not related to my husband

ANSWER: I had a 2yo sister when I (M) was 16. I changed her diapers, gave her baths, etc. This should not be a big deal.

QUESTION: My little sister just told me that our parents said that they regret having her

I(20m) have a younger sister(6f) and she always hangs out with me whenever I’m home.

Yesterday I was playing video games and she walks into my room crying. I ask her what’s wrong and she said that our parents just told her that they regret having her. I confront my parents about it and they said that they find her extremely annoying and that if they knew that she would be like this they have aborted her.

The part that pisses me off the most is that the reason they think she is annoying is that she is mentally slow and often doesn’t understand certain things. We got into an argument and afterwards my sister wouldn’t leave my side. They want me moved out within 2 months but I don’t know how my sister will handle not having me around to comfort her.

I’ve been extremely worried about leaving her due to the way she gets treated, what should I do

ANSWER: Something's wrong with your parents to say that to a six year old. Do you have some close relatives to talk to?

If you move out can you reside nearby? Your parents may be willing to let your sister visit often or spend the weekend. 

Children can grow up fine even if there's just one person who cares about them and makes them feel loved.

================================================================================

QUESTION: [UPDATE] Mom had an affair 18 years ago, I [18M] am the product of it. My dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.

The reaction to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ca66sv/mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am_the/) put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on me to write this update.

I am not sure if it's what's you want to hear, but things are more or less back to a "normal" state, if you consider other events.

Unfortunately, my grandpa died at the beginning of this week, and I am still processing it.

I did manage to talk with both my mom and dad, and I know where I now stand in relation with them, as well as my siblings.

I am not sure I would have had the courage to say what I had to say if not for the amount of help and advice in the comments.

I think it is safe to say both my parents love me, and what happened two weeks ago was an overreaction to a fight between my parents. It makes me uncomfortable knowing I am not aware of my own environment, but a stranger in the comments can tell me what's happening in my life with only a few lines of text from my side. A lot of comments were spot on about what is happening in my life.

I have so far went through 40% (I estimate) of the comments, but I have given up, there are too many for me to keep up with.

The conclusion is that I am definitely going to college, it will be the college I have always wanted to go to, and I will have the same experience as my siblings. The money to pay for all this already exists, my family is not going bankrupt as suggested, my dad just had a mental breakup with all the issues around my grandpa and his fight with my mom.

Even if my dad would have went through with his decision, my grandma let me know my grandpa left me and my siblings a sum we will have to split between the three of us, but enough to put me through college.

What started the entire scandal was poor timing on my part, my parents just had a fight, and then I showed up "hey, pay for my college".

My parents were talking about us, their children, and mom said something to the lines of "to think you wanted to split up when I came back pregnant", or something like that, I was not there, this is what she told me. I guess dad was talking how proud he was of his children, and mom wanted to express her "gratitude" for dad raising me as his own, and dad took it as "the affair was the best decision I ever made" or something like that. And their fight escalated from there, and mom told dad something like "what makes you think any of them are yours".

Yeah, it went downhill from there fast. Shortly after that my dumb face showed up, and here I am.

Dad and mom have since made up, mom is still a mess, dad is not handling my grandpa's passing away too well either.

I did talk with my siblings, and my sister raised a storm and rode it here while blasting my parents on the phone, ha ha. My brother was calmer, but made his feelings known in no uncertain terms as well once he got back home.

My grandpa passing away sort of kept spirits calm, I guess, and shifted the focus to dealing with that.

Reading the comments was a mind opening experience. I felt unprepared for the world out there. Many have asked how I had no idea how to apply for loans or grants. Well, in my defense, when you go year after year after year knowing you have nothing to worry about, that your college as good as paid for already, you don't really have to worry about anything else. Of course I knew there are loans and other things students have to be aware of, but it didn't apply to me.

I went from "I am going to college, can't wait" to "you're not my son and I will not pay for your college" in less than 24 hours.

Others have been prepared for this, at the very least they knew they had to get a loan, or get a job, look for a place to live, and so on. For me it was a sudden change in reality.

Going through the comments I managed to put a list together with various "tips and tricks", what jobs are available for students, how to find a place to live, how to get a credit card, a bank account, a cell phone plan, and so on. Really good stuff that I think, even after the return to normal, will help me.

My parents have been called more names then they go by, and that was uncomfortable to read, and I haven't even read all comments. I can't even imagine what else lies in the comments, waiting.

Dad is very sorry, apologetic, about his reaction and behavior. I understand his reaction, but I still feel hurt by it. I understand he was not in the best place of mind, but I can't control my feelings either. We will be alright, and this hasn't irreparably damaged our relationship.

Mom hasn't handled everything that well. But she is coming around, and she answered some more questions for me.

When mom had an affair years ago, and got pregnant with me, my parents started divorce. Mom moved in with the man she had the affair with, but after a few months that guy decided he wants nothing to do with it. He kicked mom out, and she had nowhere to go. So my grandparents took her in, because she was still the mother of their ~~nephews~~ grand kids (I am getting a lot of heat for this "mistake", but know in my family's culture, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well). Mom and dad got back together, after a lot of work, dad took me as his own, and that's my life since then.

The man who is my natural father is not in the picture any more. Dad didn't really know who he is, and mom hasn't heard or seen him ever since. He was fully aware mom was pregnant with his child, I guess he had more important things to do. But it doesn't sound like he was about to cure world hunger, she met him in a bar, not at a fund raiser.

And I don't feel a need to know any more about who he is. I thought about the matter the last two weeks, since I've been aware of everything, and haven't really felt a desire to know who he is, where he is, if he is still alive, if I have other siblings out there.

I was suggested to go and buy a DNA kit from 23andme, maybe I can find him that way, but I think I will avoid doing this specifically so I don't find him or he finds me. As far as I care, I have a mom and dad and a brother and a sister, and that's my family.

Moving forward I do plan of getting a job, and becoming more independent, but not in an attempt to distance myself from my family, but to feel like I would not be lost in the world if my family suddenly disappears.

My mom admits I've been babied way more than my siblings, and that they should have prepared me more for what's coming next.

I did learn where I stand with my family, and it's safe to say that I am loved, and I have options. I thought I am isolated, but my world is wider than I thought. Grandparents, siblings, my aunt, my cousins, all have my back.

I think my parents are human, and they make mistakes, and even though this was not their greatest moment, I think I will look at everything as nothing more than a weak moment in an otherwise wonderful relationship.

Thank you.

Edit: in my family's cultural background, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well. Stop calling me names, it was not a mistake, please.

ANSWER: Sorry about your grandpa, but I'm relieved it ended on a good note.

It looks like you've already sorted out how you are gonna deal with this from here.

Thanks for the update and good luck!

================================================================================

QUESTION: UPDATE: My wife gave birth to a (biracial)baby that clearly isn't mine, and I'm divorcing her. But I'm worried about the relationship between my two kids and their new half-sister.

 Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/in7j0h/my\_wife\_gave\_birth\_to\_a\_blackbaby\_that\_clearly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/in7j0h/my_wife_gave_birth_to_a_blackbaby_that_clearly/)

&#x200B;

Unfortunately my last post was locked, but I received a lot of helpful PMs from people. I'm particularly thankful for those who've lived through a similar situation(or have family and friends who've done so) and sent me advice on how this affected them and how to navigate the situation. I'd also like to thank the hundreds of mouthbreathing bigots who spammed my inbox.

The big takeaway for me was that if I'd need to lead by example here, not excluding her in any way because of her paternity so that she and my sons would see her as a full member of the family. Also that I need to be more active in confronting the bigoted and ignorant nonsense I've been hearing, and teach my sons to do the same to protect their sister. I've spoken to some of those responsible since and made clear my feelings on this, and that she is to be treated as a member family, and that if I ever find out that they've said things like that to my sons or their sister that they won't be allowed around us anymore.

I've spoken to my wife about this, and we're more or less on the same page. She's been begging me to forgive her and not go through the divorce, but that's not going to happen. Even if I didn't consider the cheating unforgivable, I just dont feel any love for her any more, other then a platonic affection for her as the mother of my children. 

My sons are handling this as well as can be expected. The 4 year old doesn't fully understand, but is upset by the change in the household, thankfully he's easily distracted. The 2 year old is thankfully too young to comprehend what's going on, but has definitely picked up on how withdrawn his mother has become. They're both fascinated with their new little sister, so there's that silver lining.

My wife OTOH isn't in good shape at all. She was depressed even before the birth, and now with everything- our divorce, her infidelity being revealed and the backlash from family and friends, PPD, and the exhaustion from raising an infant- she's barely functional. She's seeing a therapist, and I've been pressuring some of our family and friends to be supportive of her because even if they think she deserves it her current state is making it harder for me and our children.

It's become very obvious to me that even after the divorce is finalized we're going to have to live together for a while longer. She's in no shape to be taking care of three kids without someone else around to support her, and I'm not willing to deprive her of her sons by seeking sole custody. It's also too difficult financially, since she's lost her job because of COVID. 

As for the baby girl, she's healthy and fairly easy by baby standards. Since I've been helping care for her, I've bonded with her and I've discussed the possibility of adopting her with my wife. She can't contact the father, as the only thing she knows about him is his first name. And given our coparenting situation it feels like adopting her as my daughter would be the best outcome for all involved-

HOWEVER, there's been a wrench thrown in that plan. It was brought to my attention that there may be a way of finding the baby's father, namely by having her DNA tested by AncestryDNA. If the father or one of his relatives has also taken the test, we may be able to find him through there DNA match database.

If I'm being completely honest I'm not happy about this. I've already started to think of the baby girl as my daughter, and having him in our lives would massively complicate the family dynamic. Plus we live in Seattle and she met him in Philadelphia, so god knows how they'd even make it work if he wanted to be the kid's father.

However, I recognize that this is a selfish reaction. If we have a chance of finding her biological father we owe it to her do so, if only so that she has access to her paternal medical history and so that she can have a relationship with him if and when she chooses to do so. I've read a few accounts by children raised by non-biological parents and a common thread is their desire to meet their lost biological parent, so thats that. We've ordered an AncestryDNA kit for her, and I guess we'll decide our next steps once we get the results back in a couple of months.

ANSWER: The way you’re dealing with this with a level head is commendable and that child is very lucky to have you. Many people wouldn’t respond how well you are and you deserve a ton of credit for that. Your life was thrown upside down and you’re still putting the baby’s best interest first. 

I hope everything works out well for you. You deserve that.

QUESTION: My (20F) boyfriend (20M) said that I was embarrassing him while I was giving birth to our baby

Update post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hv4wc1/update_my_boyfriend_said_that_i_was_embarrassing/fyt0y1e/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

We have been in a relationship for 1 year and we had a baby boy last week. I had a natural birth and my bf was there throughout the whole process. I screamed A LOT and each time I did he whispered something like "can you stop screaming, you're really embarrassing me". I also threw up a few times and I saw him cover his face in shame. When I held the midwife's hand for comfort he whispered "let go of her, stop being so embarrassing". He also said that my birthing position was embarrassing and called me a few vulgar names.

I'm really upset about his behaviour that day, especially when it was when I needed his support the most. When  I try to talk to him about it he denies ever saying it and that I'm being silly...

Edit: I know that there are a lot of comments but I am reading them all, and I just want to thank everybody for the advice and support so far. :) 
I spoke to my mum about this but she is the very traditional type and although she said his behaviour is wrong, I should try couple counselling first. I really don't think he is going to listen to me when I suggest getting help but I'll try. I am also going to talk to my public health nurse.

Edit 2: Thank you so much to everybody who commented and dmed me with words of support and those who have also been in similar situations. I have since tried to discuss the option of couple counselling to him but to no avail, which didn't surprise me. My mum has agreed to let me stay there until I can find a new place for myself and baby. I haven't said anything to him yet, I've been advised not to so I am still planning out how I am going to take the next step.

ANSWER: I'm surprised your midwife didn't tell him to leave the room when he was acting like that.  I'd hate to see how he copes with a crying baby.  Keep your eye on him, seriously.

QUESTION: (update) Boyfriend (18M) is upset that my (18F) brother (26M) didn’t let him spend the night with me when I was very drunk and passed out.

First post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i3il7r/boyfriend_18m_is_upset_that_my_18f_brother_26m/

Based on the advice of you guys, my parents and my brother, I broke up with my boyfriend.

So I asked my boyfriend what he expected to happen that night if he was allowed to spend the night with me. He repeatedly said nothing but let slip that maybe he hoped we’d have sex in the morning. So you guys were right, he wanted to have sex that night with me and he probably would have if he was allowed to spend the night with me. 

Even the thought of it gives me a lot of stress. I always knew rape is a danger a lot of women (and men) face, but never felt it so close to me. Maybe because I’ve always been with people I trust. I don’t know. I never thought it could happen so easily to me. It would have happened to me that night if my brother hadn’t protected me the way he did.

I’m going to be a lot more careful about my own safety from now on. I won’t be as trusting to strangers and I’m now learning my drinking limits so that I won’t overdo it especially where I might be vulnerable. My brother also told me to never accept a drink from the people I don’t 100% trust.

Thanks reddit!

ANSWER: Yeah he was. In the end he was angry that I was accusing him of something, I had to block him he was texting me non-stop.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I(23M) found a sextape on my girlfriend's(23F) phone. And it wasn't ours.

I've been dating this girl for over 5 years. She's very special to me. Even at this point, I can't help but hope she's not too worried about why I've been acting so oddly. I honestly was planning to marry her sometime in the future as soon as we settled into our adult lives.

One day we were chilling at her house when I asked her if she could send me the funny picture she took earlier that day of one of our puppies. She was busy on her pc so she told me to just grab her phone to send it to myself. When I went into her phone gallery I noticed a "hidden" folder which I hadn't seen before. out of curiousity I opened it. It was filled with her nudes. Most I've already seen. Some of which she's never sent to me before. I thought maybe she was stockpiling for whenever I asked for any. I clicked on a video. It was a sextape. It was from the POV of the guy but the thing is. I dont remember ever filming it. It 100% wasnt me. trust me, i know what my own schlong looks like. My girlfriend recorded having sex with another man. 

For the last 5 years. We've had a few share of fights, but nothing too serious. She'd always make me feel loved and I could tell she really cares about me. Or at least I thought she did. After I returned her phone to her, I quickly got up and went home. I couldn't stay there any longer. And now I'm here. I dont really know what to do. I'm planning on confronting her and breaking it off but right now I'm just so in shock. 5 years down the drain. and I feel like I just lost my best friend. I'm not really sure how to feel. I can't think straight. What would be the best way to handle this situation?

ANSWER: Did you see a date on the video?? 

If it was during the past 5 years then that could be a problem, but you should probably come clean to her (in person) so you can gauge her reactions/see if she's lying.

It could be a huge misunderstanding, but it could also be a huge breakup. I say just get to the bottom of it. 

If it does turn out to be a breakup, at least you found out before settling down with her.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My [36M] wife [34F] keeps tying my boots after I've told her to keep her hands off of them. I tried to teach her a lesson and really hurt her feelings.

Yes, I know the title is bizarre and I can't believe I'm actually writing this. My wife is a neat freak. Always has been. She throws notes on my desk out assuming they're garbage, my belongings get rearranged to the point where it takes me hours to find them, it's something I've come to accept. I'm not happy about it, but we have a pretty happy marriage on the whole.

I am a volunteer EMT, and I keep my boots unlaced up against the wall next to my clothes hamper so that I can throw them on along with my uniform if a call comes in during the middle of the night.  Well, my wife has taken to tying the boot laces when she sees them untied. Not only does she tie them, but she tightens them and double knots them to the point where I need to undo the knot, open up the boots, and let a little slack out to fit my feet into them.  I ignored it the first two times, but the third time she did it, I made it a point to bring up to her the next day.

I very calmly said, "Hun, I appreciate that you want everything neat, but please do not touch my boots in the future. Time is of the essence when I'm going on a call and at 2 in the morning I don't have the time to unlace them and open them up. It's not just a minor inconvenience, it's people's lives, so I would appreciate it if you left them alone."

She rolled her eyes, said I was being dramatic, and that she wouldn't help me out by keeping my things neat in the future.

Well she never stopped. No matter how many times I've asked her, told her, begged her; she just laughs and says, "Well you know how I am!"

The other night a page went out for a CPR in progress.  I went to throw my boots on and they were, once again, tightened beyond recognition.  So I'm sitting there on the edge of the bed, cursing, trying to get my boots open, and fumbling due to the stress of the situation.

My wife opened her eyes, groggily looked at me, and asked, "Don't you need to go on that call?"

I know I was in the wrong here, and I regret it. I slammed the boot into the ground and yelled, "Yes! I do! I would have been out the door five minutes ago, except SOME STUPID MOTHERFUCKER FUCKED WITH MY GODDAMN BOOTS AGAIN!"

My wife got up without another word, walked into the bathroom and slammed the door. I got my boots open and went on the call. By the time we arrived, the police had gotten her back, so I didn't have to do CPR, but I was sweating and shaking thinking my delay could have cost a life.

I got home and my wife wasn't talking to me. She ignored me the entire day until we finally sat down and talked. She said I had scared her with how angry I got, that she thought I was going to hit her, and she didn't know I was capable of getting so angry. Note: I have never raised a hand to her, nor have I ever yelled at her before; I am absolutely not a violent person in any way shape or form.

I apologized for yelling at her, and acknowledged that I hadn't meant to snap at her, I was frustrated with the situation as I needed to get to the person in need of CPR as soon as possible and it was a delay that didn't need to happen.  I, once again, pleaded with her not to touch my boots because lives were literally on the line.

She told me that if I was going to overreact and make her afraid then she would never touch my boots again because she didn't want to live like that.

Last night, before I got into bed, I had a sinking feeling, so I went over and checked my boots.  I was very disappointed to find them tightened up again.  So I decided to show her how it felt. I went over to her closet and pulled out her running shoes.  I unlaced the shoelaces on both of them, removed them from the shoes completely, curled them each into a little coil, put them inside the shoes, and put them back.  I then went to sleep.

At 6:15 I was woken up by my wife screaming, "How could you!? Why would you do this?" holding up both laceless shoes with tears in her eyes.  My wife likes to go for an early morning run and I knew she would want to get out the door as soon as possible.

I smiled and said, "You know how I am! I just like things neat!" She continued sobbing and walked out of the room.  So, by the time she was all laced up again, it was raining so she missed out on her run.  I actually feel pretty terrible about that because I really only wanted to delay her, not ruin her plans completely.

At this point, she's alternating between crying that I went out of my way to hurt her and ignoring my presence. I acknowledge that what I've done has been pretty childish and not at all constructive. I just don't know what to do.

She said, through tears, "You admitted you were totally in the wrong for yelling at me, and then you turned around and took it out on me in a different way! What is wrong with you?"

The problem is, to her, an apology means taking on 100% of the fault.  When I apologized for blowing up, she took that to mean she was 100% in the right and that my feelings were completely unjustified. So at this point, I haven't apologized for ruining her run, because she'll take that to mean that she wasn't wrong to touch my boots.

I've tried to have these discussions but it's in one ear and out the other.  We have such a good relationship otherwise, but I feel like this issue has reached a tipping point and it's going to continue to result in arguments until we resolve it.

How do I make things right with my wife while still letting her know that I won't tolerate her disrespecting my property anymore?

Edit: Wow! This blew up! I went through comments for six hours last night and I still have 1.8k to get through.  I promise you I am reading every one of your comments and appreciate the advice.  A couple things to address points that keep getting brought up.

1. My wife has never been diagnosed as having OCD. As an EMT, I'm very careful about labeling someone as having a disorder as I don't have the proper qualifications to make that diagnosis. I do agree that it's time for her to see somebody, get a proper diagnosis, and address these issues.
2. My boots lace up in the front and zipper on the side. They're not a full unzip but rather an unzip to open them up a bit. The way my wife is tying them makes them impossible to get on even with the zipper down. They're weather proof and great for standing on rough terrain or the highway after accidents. They're only about a year old and were actually a gift from my wife. I've not considered Velcro before, I'm a bit hesitant to do that as I don't know that they wouldn't catch on things or wear out quicker.  I've tucked the laces in but she still tied them up.
3. This is a bit of compulsive behavior on my part. I don't leave my boots in the garage because my mother was a smoker growing up and that's where she would smoke. So I would end up with ashes in my shoes and having them reek of tobacco after. So I developed a habit of wearing them into my home. Also, if I leave them there, they're likely to get moved someplace 'safe' where it will take me even longer to find them.  Putting the boots in the closet, she found them and tied them.  Putting them under the bed or out of sight they were found, tied, and moved to the closet.
4. I honestly believe that a footlocker or any other kind of box would get moved to where I would have to wake her up to find it. If it's locked, then my keys are likely to go missing. For some reason, sitting on my dresser is not appropriate but in the pocket of a jacket downstairs in the closet is.
5. I am likely going to start putting my boots in the car. Though I had to laugh at the people suggesting decoy boots. As much as it may seem like it, I'm not living in a Spy vs. Spy cartoon.
6. I am a volunteer EMT. We respond from home. We don't have sleeping quarters, and I work the overnight shift so I sleep during my shift, get out of bed when a call comes in, drive to the building, and take the ambulance to the scene. This is typical of volunteer organizations.  Paid EMS is more likely to have sleeping quarters or even require EMTs to be in the truck throughout their shift. Community based EMS is more likely to take 911 calls and respond to emergencies whether paid or volunteer.  Private EMS is more likely to take transport requests such as to/from dialysis or chemotherapy as well as hospital to nursing facility discharges.
7. To those who have told me that I don't have the right to use the word lifesaving, on my dress uniform I have pins for 3 defibrillator saves and 4 for CPR saves. I've crawled into a car wreck to open someone's airway and bag them until we could get them out. While transporting a patient I recognized signs of internal injury and ordered we divert to a trauma center, where he was put directly into emergency surgery that saved his life.  Did I do these things entirely by myself? No, of course not. I would never claim that I was the sole reason someone lived. However, I am, at my very basest level, as vital link in the chain or survival. So while I can't claim complete credit for any of the things I've done, I would certainly put a lot of blame on myself if someone didn't live because of something I failed to do.
8. I have a full-time job that I work 8-5 Monday - Friday outside of EMS.  That is why I volunteer on the night shift. My wife works as a payroll manager for a mid-sized office.  I earn about $10,000 a year more than her.  We've been married for two years. While I lived on my own before we were married, she didn't move into the apartment until we got engaged. So, I think to her, that was my place, not ours, and she didn't really touch my things.  I was with another EMS organization until we moved to a new town after our engagement.  When we bought the house, I joined the local volunteer squad as an EMT. My wife regards my job as part of my identity while she sees the EMS as something I volunteer to do. She would say, "This is my husband, he is \[job title\]," not "This is my husband, he is an EMT."
9. Thank you for all the awards on this post. You're all very kind. I appreciate so much that you took the time out of your day to acknowledge things and want to help me.

tl;dr Wife keeps tightening my boots when I'm not wearing them, delaying me on ambulance calls. I finally had enough, and she's calling my response abuse.

ANSWER: Your wife’s behavior sounds compulsive. She likely has a major anxiety disorder that manifests in this way. Which explains her “inability” to stop herself from the rearranging and the lacing and whatnot. She needs therapy and medication pronto. 

BUT that doesn’t explain her minimizing the importance and urgency of your job. EVEN IF you weren’t literally saving lives, I’d be pissed as fuck if my partner trivialized my work and dismissed my need to be organized and prepared for my job. 

I’m skeptical that your marriage is truly as great as you say it is, and I’m concerned that you’re just in the habit of subjugating your own needs to keep the peace due to your wife’s “quirks”.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [46M] promised my son [18M] that his mother and I would match whatever he saved for a car upon his high school graduation. He ended up with a lot more than we could have predicted, and now we don’t know what to do.

When he turned 16 and got his license, we allowed him to use an old car from a relative. At that time, my son had around $5k in savings. We made him a promise saying that we’d match whatever he ended up with at graduation. Reasonably, we thought he’d maybe double that to $10k through jobs and we’d match for a reasonable $20k car. 

He now has $35k to use for a car. He said he did have a little over $10k but that he bought smart stock options in April and now will have around $35k after tax (personally I don’t think he did anything besides get stupid lucky). 

He is insisting that we follow through with our promise and match that. Financially, it’s not a huge dent for us since he also surprised us with a nice merit scholarship (that he did earn). The problem arises in that we really don’t want to break the promise we made to him, but we also strongly believe that an 18 year old driving around in a SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR car is a very bad idea. He can’t even take it to school until his sophomore year, and the insurance on that will be a nightmare. 

What I am asking is, would the better course of action be to break the promise, and likely face resentment? Or keep it and cough up the money?

Thanks in advance for the advice.

Edit: Talked about it with my wife; we are considering a couple of avenues atm including trust or maybe fixed income until it can be used for med school. My son uses Reddit and considering that this is on r/all now, I’m just waiting for him to see it and burst into my home office room.

Edit2: He’s super duper close with his girlfriend. I told her, and she said she’d talk him out of it. Personally, I totally understand where my son is coming from. I wanted a car like that at that age too, and my parents did end up indulging just a little bit, but now I can see how it was a waste of money. I only used it for two years. I’ll make an update post in a few days about what happens.

ANSWER: Personally a $70k car is a lot for an 18 year old. 

I'd match the $10k and put the $15k towards a house deposit for him - you honour the money match but don't put so much to a car, which will depreciate and lose value. 

The tough bit would be the sell!

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife "baby-trapped" me

I put baby-trap in quotation marks because I'm not sure what she did is the actual definition of baby trap, she didn't have a kid to make me stay, just against my will.

So my wife (32F) and I (34M) have been together for eight years. We have a little girl (5F) and a baby boy (2M). I love both of them more than anything and I finally feel like I have everything. A beautiful wife, two healthy kids, a great career, and a big house. The token "American Dream", minus the dog, I'm allergic.   
When we talked about kids before, my wife always said she wanted two. I only wanted one, it would be easier and we'd have more money for vacations and stuff, but my wife maintained it's important for a child to have a sibling. I grew up with four and my wife with none, so I guess I understand where she's coming from. 

After our son and getting through the baby years and sleepless nights for the second time, I didn't want to ever go through that again. Both kids were very fussy and colicky. But when he was a year old, my wife began casually mentioning a third. I would laugh it off but finally she sat me down and said we have to have a third. I said no, we agreed on two, but she said she wanted four and three is the compromise. I refused and said I wanted one and we have two. She got angry and called me selfish for taking away her dream of wanting a big family.

A couple days later, she apologized and we had sex. I noticed her drive increased exponentially but so did mine and I was happy to engage her. She was on birth-control, I had a condom, it was all good. Thinking back on it, I probably should have figured something was up, but I was barely handling two little kids and work on top of housework and yardwork and everything. 

I came home from work one day, while the kids were at their grandparents. My wife had a huge smile on her face and she sat me down and showed me a positive pregnancy test, literally dancing in joy.

My first thought was, "oh shit." My wife noticed a less-than-happy expression on my face and started screaming at me. She berated me for not being supportive and this was a "miracle from God" and I should be grateful. I said I was sorry and hugged her and said I was super excited for the baby. My wife was delighted and later that night she was calling all family and friends to happily tell them the news. When she was talking about the nursery and how we'll convert my office into a room I started to get a little suspicious. Everything was so well thought-out and it seemed like she'd been planning this for a while. 

When she was asleep, I took the condoms out of the cupboard and ran them under water. Holes.   
I nabbed her phone and saw she'd set a password. That was odd. Nevertheless, my wife has a terrible memory so I tried her birthday and it opened. Further up were texts with her best friend of my wife complaining how I wouldn't come around. Her best friend suggested "arrange an accident" with a winky face. My wife agreed and said she was going to come off of birth control. It went on for a little while, ending with my wife saying that yes, we were going to have a 3rd. 

So I woke her up immediately and asked her if this had really been a "miracle"? She got that deer-in-headlights look and burst into tears. She wailed and then she got angry. Through tears she screamed I had no right to go through her phone and it's her choice whether or not she wants to take BC, the side-effects are bad and she was sick. She also brought up if I really didn't want a third kid, I should have had a vasectomy. She told me to go sleep on the couch, I laughed out loud and said no, I'm sleeping here, you're leaving. So while wailing she packed a bag and left to her parents. When she called the next day I told her I just need some time to myself. She said that's fine but I need to come around for our child. I told her I wasn't sure if it'd be "our child" and she cried more.

It's been two weeks since then. Governments recommended to stay at home and I knew staying home by myself while also working with two kids would not be ideal and she wanted to see our kids. So we're  in the same house, she constantly keeps on stopping me and trying to get me excited for our kid and planning the nursery and names and how happy our kids will be to get a younger sibling. I've been ignoring her entirely. 

What do I do? Staying home with her is bad enough and I don't know if I should leave her over this. I don't trust her anymore. She entirely betrayed it. I'm angry. But I have another child on the way.

================================================================================

QUESTION: UPDATE: Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.

Orginal: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c13s1w/wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids_last/

TL;DR: Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July. Wife got pregnant anyways. It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery. Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating. Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.

Update TL;DR at bottom

First I just want to thank everyone who reached out and offered their story about similar.  I can't believe how many people are told they're completely sterile and end up being able to have kids anyways.  

I took a lot of what you guys said to heart.  I had an ex of mine from years ago end up cheating on me, and it really left a scar for a while.  It wasn't until I got more involved with sports and getting in better shape that I was able to try and move on.  My wife and I actually met in a soccer league we were in together. We've had so much trust for so long that I thought those fears had gone away.  It wasn't until now that I really started to feel shaken like that again.

But I didn't want to let my past get in the way of what could be just a huge blessing.  A few people really articulated the right way to communicate my feelings in a way that wasn't accusatory and respectful of my wife, who's never really given me a reason to doubt her.

It's not uncommon for her to sometimes be home late, and she'll usually like to go straight to bed. I didn't want to dump this on her immediately and decided to give myself a night to sleep on it.  I got up pretty early just being restless, went for a run, and cleared my mind. I couldn't wait any longer.  I made our favorite omelets, and told her I needed to talk about something.

"You know I'm not Ashley, right?"

She knows me well.  Ashley's my ex who cheated.

So first I apologized.  I apologized because I let this build up in my head for so long without talking with her about it sooner.  What should be blessing has been nothing but insecurity and fear for me.

We talked for a while.  I told her how happy it made me to see her ecstatic and excited for the baby. I told her how much I loved the relationship that we've built together, and I felt like an asshole for questioning her loyalty.  She had never given me a reason not to trust her and that I still couldn't emotionally get over the thoughts of infidelity because of my ex.  She thanked me for telling her, and she knew how hard it was for me to get over that.  She volunteered to have us get a paternity right when he/she's born, which made me feel a lot better at first.

But something still felt off.  I honestly don't know why, something about how she was so eager to get a paternity test, and almost not mad at me at all for having kept this from her.  Normally she would have been upset that I didn't bring it up right away, but there was just a weird feeling I couldn't shake for the rest of the day.

It seemed like she was saying all the right things, but I couldn't get rid of this clawing feeling inside my head.  Maybe I'm just being paranoid.  Maybe there's a gut feeling that I need to listen to.  But I ended up going to the appointment alone, as we "decided" it would good to see if I still needed the surgery.

Turns out it's obstructive azoospermia.  I've read so many stories about people who were supposed to infertile end up getting pregnant. So I brought that up, and how my wife's pregnancy was affecting me. The urologist thought it would be pretty unlikely that I wouldn't need surgery to have a kid with how mine was presenting itself. He mainly tried to skirt around the topic, and mostly pushed me towards making sure she was actually pregnant.

Being there didn't really help.  I feel like I just got more uncertainty.  

She had another night being out to 8:30 last night.  We talked about scheduling an appointment to verify the pregnancy when she got home. She seemed a little confused, but then quickly agreed. She promised to do it in the morning.  I asked how work had gone, and she gave me a kind of non-commital answer about her boss pushing her too much and being stressed out.  

There's nothing huge there, but she just seemed off.  I really couldn't put my finger on it.  We were still acting all lovely-dovey, but something just felt wrong, and I couldn't talk about it without repeating the same conversation we had Sunday.

I've been trying to throw myself into work to distract myself, but I haven't been able to focus.  We have a joint checking account that we'll sometimes move money in and out of, but really only use it for groceries or household items unless we talk about it beforehand.  This morning she moved half of it to hers, about $1700. We don't do that, she's never needed to before.  And I checked our health care portal, and she made the appointment for the one time Thursday that I mentioned I was busy working on-site. We were supposed to go together.

I'm starting to go crazy. How do I bring this up that isn't me just having the same conversation again?  I'm looking into getting a second opinion for myself.  But I need a litmus test from objective outsiders to know if I'm really losing it or if this seems weird to someone else.

TL;DR Had good conversation about my ex-cheating before and those issues, something still felt off.  Urologist said I had obstructive azoospermia, implied I should "make sure my wife is pregnant" and didn't think I could be fertile.  Wife is taking money from joint account and booked her doctor appointment when I can't go.  Getting a second Urology opinion, also slightly going crazy.

UPDATE:  I've been trying to center myself.  We talked calmly for a bit on the phone.  She claimed she moved the money out in anticipation for the deductible payments she'll have with different visits.  I didn't bring up anything else, but she seemed a little impatient with me, probably rightly so, and implied we'd have a longer talk when she gets home.  I'm just trying to not overreact right now. I don't know what to think, this is either a misunderstanding on my side and Im a Father! Or...not.  Thankfully she's not working late today.  

Thank you those who are trying to keep me grounded.

UPDATE:  I went for a long run to clear my mind.  Gotta shower, and then my wife should be home.  I'm going to go into the conversation with no judgement, just objectively walk out the facts and why I've still been struggling personally with some of them.  Regardless of what happens I'm done with any confusion left between us.

ANSWER: You got any sick time? Call in sick on the day of the appointment and go anyway. She technically already kinda agreed to go together so make it so. She can’t argue with that.

QUESTION: UPDATE: yesterday I froze during sex, my girlfriend asked if we should stop and I said yes and she backed off. I've never been treated like this before.


some of y'all wanted the link to the original post, here it is
 https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j1ur51/yesterday_i_froze_during_sex_and_my_girlfriend/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I thought I'd update y'all since so many people commented on my previous post. 

As I said in earlier, I wrote her a letter and it was much more difficult than I thought it would be. But I wrote what was in my heart and how much I loved her and thanked her for supporting me. 

I made some of her favourite snacks and took her to a small park nearby. We ate and watched the sunset together and then I gave her the letter I wrote. She cried and hugged me and we sat there talking about future aspects. And then I showed the post to her. She welled up again and asked if she could come to a few therapy sessions with me so that she could understand better what I was going through. Also it might help her not burn out. I will talk to my therapist about it and we'll see how it turns out. 

But that's about it. We went home, watched a movie and went to bed. I seriously feel so lucky to have her in my life

 Here's to hoping for our best future together. 

Oh and, I seriously cannot thank you guys enough. Every single one of you who commented (even the rude ones) have made a difference. Seriously y'all are amazeballs. (I know many said to not say it ever again, but I like it so) 

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.

ANSWER: I cannot tell you how great it is to see a positive story on this sub.

Also, holy shit you actually communicated. Five gold stars to both of you!

================================================================================

QUESTION: My [23F] boyfriend [25M] used the dog's savings for a computer

I know the title is a little odd but it was the best way I could summarize what he's done. 

I have an 11-year old senior German Shepard. He was hit by a car in 2018 and we went through a very difficult recovery process. He had seizures, urine issues, constant fear of anything going fast near him like I couldn't throw a ball anymore. We had another puppy but our senior was so stressed we had to rehome her. You would have sworn he was displaying abused behavior but he was just scared. 

He's moved past all of that and I'm so proud of him. The vet prescribed zoniamide for his seizures and so far he's been recovering well. We were discussing ways to improve his "mobility". Its like a walking cane, but for dogs, and it has sensory objects on the end to prevent him from bumping into furniture. We tested it in the office and his mood improved instantly but at that time I couldn't afford more treatment for him so I opted to come back.

I met D earlier this year while walking him. He's known since day 1 that my dog requires special treatment and I would absolutely provide it. Everything went well and he wasn't controlling or abusive. Everything just "clicked" but its my fault because I was too comfortable. We were talking about finances and I told him about my debt and the money I was saving up for my dog. After paying off the debt from his previous treatments I didn't want to open another card so I started saving cash in a little fireproof chest. He stole it. Yesterday, I went to his place I noticed he has a new setup. I was asking him where he got the money from and we fought and he said "he's half dead anyway, you need to let go". 

He's not even close to dying. He's a little older but he's nowhere near dying age. We go to the veterinarian regularly and everything checks out as well as it can be given his circumstances. No one has ever mentioned death, we've only been looking at the future and improvements. 

I'm so upset, what do I do? We're both students I don't want to call the police and ruin his future but that was for my baby to get what he needed so he can walk around my home comfortably.

ANSWER: Uhh, what? He stole your money, you should be filing a police report.

You deserve that money, he needs to pay it back. Dump him and call the cops.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Yesterday, my(33m) wife's (34f) best friend (female) contacted me and told me that her husband and my wife were having an affair and my 3yo daughter is actually his daughter.

Wife and I have been together since high school. Married for 10 years. I'm really drunk, so pardon me for this gibberish. 

My wife's best friend Megan and I work for the same company( different departments ). So yesterday, she wanted to meet me after work and told me that she had to tell me something. So I met her and she immediately broke down and started crying. I tried to console her and asked if something was wrong and she told me that my wife and her husband were having an affair. 

According to her, this affair has been going on for years and she also told me that her husband was my daughter's biological father. She confronted her husband and he didn't deny anything. 

And when I confronted my wife, she tried to deny everything but when I told her that Megan told me about it, she broke down and started crying. 

I really don't know what to do. I mean, everything was a lie right? My little girl Taylor is not mine and my wife blatantly faked everything for years. What do I live for now? I just don't know what to do. Just here for some advice. I'm sorry if this felt like a rant.

ANSWER: Sober up, reach out to family and close friends for support, get a lawyer asap and follow their advice to the letter. Sorry you are going though all this. I can't imagine how messed up your world is right now.

================================================================================

QUESTION: UPDATE: My friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but I’m the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. Do I say anything?

Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

So I got lots of feedback on what to do here. A good majority of the commenters told me to say something. To clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but I was never planning on doing nothing. Of course you gotta tell your bro if they’re being cheated on. I just was not sure how to approach the situation. 

Some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. Some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which I ended up getting from Alison, the third party friend. Some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me I was a bad friend. Some were sure he wouldn’t believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. Well all of you were somewhat right. Here’s how it went down: 

I messaged Alison early on in the day, shortly after I made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. I said to Alison that I needed to tell Aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. This was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. 

Aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that Alison came over too. We all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about Mary. Alison showed him the text screenshots of Mary talking to her ex, and also told Aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. 

What was the most surprising was his reaction. He took it very well. He first got very quiet, and just nodded. Aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. He was not aware of the hookups, but he and Mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn’t allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. He told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. There were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. He knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn’t true. 

We started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. He cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would’ve given her anything. Then he got angry. At her, and even more so at the guy. Some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. 

Ultimately he told us that he’s going to be breaking it off at least for now. We told him a million times how much better he deserved. He’s definitely not going to marry her. 

Thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. We saved a good man from heartbreak!

Edit: Jesus Christ this exploded fast. Thanks for all the kind words people 😅

ANSWER: >she doesn’t allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time

Every. Single. Time. 

Extreme jealousy is a projection.

QUESTION: HAPPY UPDATE: Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.

https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c225le/update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids/

I'm sorry to drag ya'll through the worst of my insecurities.  I definitely channeled quite a bit of my negative shit into what I posted.  But hey, that's what anonymous people are good for sometimes I guess.

Anyways, we finally sat down after she got home last night.  I told her everything that was going on.  The Urologist, the money, the upcoming appointment.  I told her how, even with all her reassurances, too many suspect things kept happening.  

She agreed how everything looked, and immediately apologized.  She didn't realize how much my last exs cheating was still affecting me.  She knew I was off going into the weekend, but thought we addressed that. We talked about it Sunday, but I can get pretty internal with all these worries and not show them outwardly.  And so while she had thought we were communicating, I wasn't.  We decided to start from the beginning and go through everything together.

The money was the real problem for me. She agreed how inconsiderate it was with where my head was at to do that without mentioning it.  Apparently the prenatal visits are so structured that they want you to set up a payment plan with them right away, and she wanted to make sure it was squared away to keep the appointment.  She offered without me prompting to call them with me tomorrow to verify that, or if I really wanted we could move the money back.  She does get better rewards out of hers so it kind of made sense.

We read up on obstructive azoospermia, and it doesn't seem like they're often invincible forcefields.  It seems like only the actual absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) actually guarantees complete infertility, so it is possible for some to get through. We're going to go back to the original specialist I was working with last year and hopefully get a clearer picture.  It turns out the appointment she made was the only time they had available so soon, and figured it'd be best not to wait.  I told her I took off work to go with, and she was relieved I could join.

Once again, she said all the right things and seems genuine about getting us on the same page.  After going through each thing I was just wishing I believed her a little more before. She's stressed out with work and when she'll have to take off, but she really seemed to want to go out of her way to alleviate my concerns. She even offered an open phone policy if I needed.  We did look at the text I had seen, and it was just a girlfriend.  I declined though right now, since I don't want to be that husband.

This has really made me take a deeper look at what's in my past and how that still affects me today. Even thinking back to this weekend, it was so hard to see in the moment how much all the uncertainty was affecting me.  That level of anxiety literally makes you question what around you is real.  I think the trust but verify is the best way to put it. I was just trying to verify without any of the trust is all.  This has all put a strain on our marriage right now, but I'm feeling a bit more like we're a team again working towards easing that.

She thought that an NIPP ASAP was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.  I'm not big on therapy, but I can probably agree that it will most likely help.

I'm feeling a little better about everything.  Thanks again to everyone who reached out and shared their own story (Every other comment here I read was a story of a family member who was supposed to be barren and ended up popping out triplets), and most of all those who helped me try to communicate fairly through all of this.   It's time for me to hopefully be a father.

TL;DR  Use your words. - Wife and I objectively went through everything.  We both apologized, getting a NIPP soon and hopefully a therapist.

UPDATE: The paternity test came back intially positive for anyone that's going to see this : )

ANSWER: > She thought that an NIPP ASAP was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.

Glad to see this was her atitude.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My girlfriend said something to me yesterday that felt like a punch to the gut

Me (17m) and my girlfriend (also 17) have been going out 8 and a bit months. We didn't have sex together straight away and first did it only a few weeks ago. I was a virgin before that so I'm not experienced at all and so far I've not been able to make her cum.

Before dating me, my gf was dating my brother. It was awkward at first but we're all okay now. Anyway so last night I tried my best to make her cum but in the end she told me to "just stop" so I did. Then she said "your brother turned me on so much more than you do". I was so shocked by her saying that I didn't know what to say back. She got dressed and left the house and we haven't spoken yet.

I just feel so confused about how I feel. I know I'm not as attractive as my brother but I didn't think she would say that. Am I just being a baby and getting upset over nothing? I understand she's probably fed up and she might have just said it in the moment.

ANSWER: I guess you brother was the one that broke up with her. She's not with you for you man, she with you for your brother, if she liked you she would teach you. Leave her.



How old is your brother?

Eddit: thanks for the gold, kind stranger.

QUESTION: Update: My (25M) girlfriend's (25F) sex drive has completely disappeared

Warning: long update ahead. Here's the link to the previous post- https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iq1ebc/my_25m_girlfriends_25f_sex_drive_has_completely/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb

Thanks to everyone who replied to my previous post. There were some mixed responses, with some people suggesting I insist on addressing it with her because she's hiding something, with others recommending I give her time to open up on her own.

Ultimately I decided to sort of go for a combo of the two. Friday, when we were both done with work, we sat down and had a discussion.

I told her that I could give her the space and time she needed till she was ready to talk to me about it, but I couldn't leave it unaddressed. She needed to acknowledge that there atleast WAS something that she didn't feel ready to tell me, and that was fine, but she atleast needed to acknowledge its existence, if only so I stopped feeling like I was going crazy.

She started sobbing when I was done and then she started explaining everything.

Some background that I didn't mention in my previous post because it didn't really seem relevant is that my girlfriend has PCOD. One of the consequences of this is that she finds it very difficult to lose weight and has been insecure about her body for most of her life. About a year ago (completely of her own choice, I have always told her that she's beautiful to me no matter what her weight), she resolved to start losing weight, both for her health and to feel better about her body. She started going to the gym a couple times a week, and I was supportive and also cut out all my own junk food consumption in solidarity.

Since the lockdown started and gyms shut, apparently she started slowly gaining some weight back due to stress eating and lack of exercise. I am ashamed to say I did not even notice that she was torturing herself over her weight all this while. She admitted that she stopped having sex because she was terrified I would stop finding her attractive after seeing her naked. I reassured her that I think she's gorgeous and attractive no matter what and I tell her this everyday, but she was afraid that would have changed once I saw the weight she had put on.

The rest of the conversation consisted of me reassuring her that she's beautiful and her appreciating but not really believing me. After a bit, she asked me to change the topic, and I reluctantly agreed. We had a fairly quiet dinner, she was a little sad and relieved at the same time at having told me, I think. And I was busy scheming.

The next morning before work I told her she looked lovely again and she gave me a wan smile, like she appreciated it but didn't really believe me. But that was okay. I was gonna convince her. I asked her to pick up the groceries that evening because I was gonna have a meeting run late.

The moment she left home, I got to work. I dug out some fairy lights and a bunch of candles from storage and started setting them up in the living room. Made a couple of playlists and charged the speaker. Snuck down to the florist and bought a giant bouquet.

Some more background, I hate dancing because I suck massively at it, while my girlfriend loves it. She used to go dancing every month or two with her girlfriends before lockdown. I'd join in sometimes because it was worth how happy it made her, but she definitely missed it way more than me.

So when she got back, naturally I greeted her with what were probably the most ridiculous dance moves in the history of mankind.

I'm not gonna lie, folks. She laughed. She laughed a lot. She took a short video, and we both laughed while watching it later. My movement resembled a five year old practicing kung fu more than it resembled dancing, and I had stuck a rose in my ear for maximum ridiculousness. Totally worth it, though. I have no idea how she ever thought she's ugly, her smile is just so fucking radiant.

We danced like idiots for a while before I switched to the slow dance playlist. It was definitely the happiest I'd seen her in a long time. I'd been a bad boyfriend and somehow missed how much she missed everything else. I should have done it months ago.

I told her all this. Told her she's the most beautiful woman in my eyes and always will be. And yeah, we had sex. Last night was all about her. She needed to feel special and I had been missing that for too long.

I offered to make dance nights a weekly thing afterwards. Kind of as a substitute for the workouts she's been missing, if she wants. She tore up a little, she knows how much I hate dancing. She told me that wasn't necessary.

Apparently sex is just as much of a workout as dancing. And we have a lot of missed workouts to catch up on. I'm certainly not complaining.

In all seriousness though, I'm gonna dip into my savings a little and order a home treadmill. She can't afford one right now because of college bills, so I'll surprise her with it :)

Thank you to everyone who helped me out with their advice!

Edit: Oh wow, I am completely overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support here. Thanks for all the awards! I just logged back into this account but I promise I'm going to read each of the replies. One thing I saw pop up a couple of times that I just wanna reassure you guys about is that she's mentioned wanting a treadmill but not being able to afford one several times in the past, so I know she wants one.

However, I figured that it's dumb to take the chance, and one surprise was good enough, and if there's anything this whole experience has taught me, it's the importance of communication. So I'm going to bring it up at dinner tonight that I comfortably have enough saved up to purchase a home workout machine (since I saw cycles/ellipticals being mentioned, we'll figure out which one we want!), and that I'd love to buy one for our home for both of us to use. Thank you all so much once again for your advice!

Edit 2: RIP me, lol, the comments are coming faster than I can read them now. There's no way for me to reply to every one of them, unfortunately. There are a lot of fantastic suggestions for diets, exercise machines, dance classes and everything in between, so thank you so much for all of them! She has a great endocrinologist, who's advice she will ultimately be following, but there are some great points to bring up with him. It is really touching and overwhelming to see all this support. Thank you all so much!

Final Edit: She loved the idea of getting some equipment to do our workouts at home together, so we're going to sit down and do our research tonight before picking the one we like most. We've gotten some fantastic advice here and we'll be looking at ellipticals, bikes, rowing machines, Just Dance on the Switch and a bunch of other stuff that you guys suggested.

To all the people who commented to insist she's cheating on me because I'm a simp (lmao), thank you for setting the exemplary standard for being macho. Insulting strangers online is so delightfully masculine. The lovely folks who told me to dump her "because she's fat" get the "disappointing but not unexpected shitheads" shout-out as well.

For the overwhelming majority of people, though, I am just breathtaken by the kind and supportive comments we've gotten. Thank you for the treasure trove of advice and LPTs, and all the love! You folks are amazing!

ANSWER: Dude. Epic BF status achieved. Masterful approach and not just to get sex again but in a way that's like wholesome and meaningful to the partnership in a huge way. Dont beat yourself up on faltering every now and then on noticing things.

Communication on both sides, even in a long relationship can be tricky when its the most sensitive stuff, especially body image insecurity.

Grats on being a good human and an excellent BF. May your days be filled with rampant workouts as you both deserve as such.

QUESTION: FINAL UPDATE: My GF was raped and became pregnant. I broke up with her when she wouldn't abort the baby.

Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/

TLDR: My GF was raped. Wanted to abort. Talked to mother. Decided not to abort. I left her. 

Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/
  
TLDR: GF calls me, reveals Mum made her not get an abortion because GOD CARES. She wants me back and arranges for abortion she wanted all along. Some of Reddit think I'm a baby killer.

Update 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/boai5u/update2_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/

TLDR: Mother tries to get me arrested for kidnapping or domestic abuse or some loony stuff.


I just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. This will be my final update.

A few days ago, the abortion was carried out. During the weeks beforehand, my GF went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. She was also tested for any STIs (she's clear!).

She went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. A few days ago it was successfully carried out.

They went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. GF said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours.

When she came home, she cried and cried and cried. She says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life.

We took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). While in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before.

She's amazing, man. Seriously.


Update on the Mum! So my GF received a call from her Mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion.

My GF and I have an agreement that if Mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. In this instance, she answered, didn't know what to say, and gave it to me.

I told the Mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. I then said "How Jesus of you" at which point she hung up.

My GF didn't find it funny...

Anyway, that's it.


Good luck to everyone in their lives.

Also, if you're going to message and insult me via PM, just be warned: I've killed ^a ^baby before.

ANSWER: My only caution is maybe go easy on the baby killing jokes in front of your girlfriend.  
  
Why?  because even though this is what she wanted, and she feels relieved having gone through with it.  It's still kind of a big deal. It's still a sea of mixed emotion.   It's a bit like if you were to start making rape jokes infront of your girlfriend.  (maybe not that bad,  but still bad.)    Avoid the baby killing jokes at least until she's the one who starts making them comfortably.  

Also,  on the one hand,  stand up for yourself and your girl against the crazy mom.  But also,  don't do things to egg her on.    Stand your ground without widening the rift.  Your girl will respect you more.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (28/M) got beat up in front of my (29/F) g/f.

It was late and we were walking about the park. I went to the Restroom. I come back and some jackoff is sexually harassing with my g/f. Shes very uncomfortable (doing her best not to panic)and lets him know so and that her boyfriend is nearby. He's not listening. I approach him and kindly tell him to fuck off or I'll call the Police. Dude is very clearly drunk as I can smell the beer on him. As we turn to leave he grabs her ass and tells her to leave me and come to him. I turn around and hit him. My girlfriend has been a victim of sexual assault before and she's doing her best not to breakdown. I'll spare you the details other then I got my ass kicked. He left after that. My girlfriend had a panic attack in the car after that. 

I just feel letdown I couldn't help her.  I feel embarrassed, emasculated. Shes been a victim of sexual assault before so this harassment is traumatic. I wasn't able to hep her. I wasn't there for her. I feel worthless. I could have held it in, I could have just left earlier like she wanted. its been two days and she's still traumatized over it. She has an emergency therapy meeting today and hasn't been to work. Shes been crying and I've attempted to help her but, it's clear I can't.

ANSWER: What if you hadn’t been there? That guy is definitely a scumbag but I’m glad you were there (even if you got beat up) cause he most likely would’ve done a lot worse to her if she was all alone. The event definitely brought back horrible memories for her, and I’m so happy she’s in therapy. My advice is to just be there for her and emotionally support her as well. You saved her that night now be there for her now.

#That "Half Blurred Nude" everyone's talking about is Rick Astley. Please, go ahead and "depixelize" it or whatever. 

#The other pixelized nudes are from a link about copyrighting your nudes. Please read the post before commenting.

So a couple things have happened in the last few days, and I figured you guys would like to hear what the police finally settled on.

First, I'd like to clear up something first - the theft and distribution of this media was, in no way, shape, or form, the fault of my partner. He is just as much a victim of a crime as I am, if not more. This has been an emotionally tumultuous time for him. He is my partner and my foremost concern here is him. 

It's honestly absolutely terrible that so many people blamed him for this situation.

I spoke to a lawyer...and my Dad. The lawyer is my father's friend who is giving me advice for free. If this goes to court, he'll be representing us.

Anyways. Monday, I got a call from a very polite female officer, asking if both my boyfriend and myself could come in to the station to make a criminal report. The first officer to phone me was mistaken - while this does fall under revenge porn, it doesn't fit "sexploitation". She would have had to actually coerce him into sex acts for that.

In my state, this is only a misdemeanor crime. Fortunately, it's a charge for every imaged stolen/shared. It also matters that there are two victims.

The police spoke to the people whose names I provided, most of which confirmed that Sarah had shared the photos. They'll be taking her phone as evidence and they'll ensure that the media is one hundred percent destroyed.

That all made both me and John happy, but as a lot of people pointed out, this stuff could easily already be on the internet.

(All of this has been approved by my partner, before anyone asks)

So I turned around and submitted copyrights for all of it. I spent a shitton of money copyrighting over a hundred images and videos. Then I paid for a domain name and "made" a website - all it says is "UNDER CONSTRUCTION". Then I registered John and myself on several different pornographic media hosting sites and posted "CONTENT PENDING COPYRIGHTS".

THEN. I posted on Facebook.

"Recently, someone I consider a friend broke into John's phone and stole images. She then proceeded to share these images amongst some of my closest friends.

Not only am I disappointed, hurt, and betrayed, but this person placed John in a very disturbing position - one where he had to defend himself from sexual assault accusations. This person DID NOT come to me with these concerns, deciding that she would rather gossip with others under the guise of "concern".

Had I ACTUALLY been assaulted, this person would have been spreading horrible moments of my life to others, taking away my voice as a victim. How horrific, how absolutely monstrous does a person have to be to do something like that?

In actuality, this person stole intimate videos that were, in no way, intended for her. "Stolen" is the best word for this media because, well...

Most of you know me as an entrepreneur; I own a small business, I pick up freelance jobs, I dabble in several money making ventures. None of this is a consistent income, so John and I have been brainstorming on how I could possibly generate a passive income. 

So we started making pornographic media of a relatively popular kink. We had generated enough content to finally build an online following, and then our content was stolen and John's name was dragged through the dirt.

Shame on all of you who has participated in this shit flinging and pot stirring. 

Because of this person and ALL who participated, I have had to out John and myself as sex workers. I've had to speak to the police, a lawyer, my goddamn DAD. Shame on all of you.

From this point on, any person sharing these COPYRIGHTED images and videos will personally hear from my lawyer.

If anyone has legitimate concerns about my relationship, come to my goddamn face instead of spreading bullshit behind my back.

Thank you."

Since then, I've been receiving non-stop calls and messages from people apologizing, asking questions, and, unsurprisingly, people are arguing about my expectation of privacy on Facebook.

Sarah tried to call but I hit ignore and texted her, "You may contact my lawyer," and then gave her the number. She hasn't responded.

All in all, I'd say that things are looking up. Sarah is, rightfully, being charged with a crime or twelve. John's name is clear legally. Important people in my life know that I'm not being abused. 

People are reaching out to John to either apologize for misjudging the situation or to congratulate him on being a porn star.

So that's good, I guess.

I want to thank everyone who gave me good advice and urged me to go to the police and speak to a lawyer. 

Edit: To everyone that is saying this is fake based on "the timeline", it is possible to speak to both a lawyer and the police in a four day period.

I submitted the copyrights online from my bed.

Y'all are apparently just bad at adulting. I wasn't going to sit on my ass while my partner's name was sullied by horrible accusations.

I was, an still am, angry. So I got shit done.

Edit edit: I am not releasing the videos.

Another Edit: Since everybody is up in arms about me submitting copyright claims, [this is where I got my information](https://saltyworld.net/how-to-copyright-your-nudes-to-avoid-revenge-porn/)

#Final Edit:

This is getting out of hand so I'll be logging off. People asked for an update, so they got it.

Copied from a comment I posted:

Nobody seems to understand that this isn't about getting Sarah arrested.

My lawyer told me that, no, John could not get in trouble for what we're doing and, yes, I could go ahead and post on Facebook to try to control the narrative. 

He did not give me advice on the criminal case because my interest wasn't - and still isn't - the criminal case. As of now, I've achieved everything I wished to do. The police are going to ensure that the videos get deleted.

I don't give a fuck if she's charged.

ANSWER: Damn. Sarah messed with the wrong girl. You seem awesome. Props for taking control of the situation, and turning the tables on a terrible friend. I hope she pays dearly.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] I (28M) Is about to propose to my gf (28f) of 7 years, but then I discovered something. Need advice.

Hello guys. Im providing an update to my earlier post 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b0h9as/i_28m_is_about_to_propose_to_my_gf_28f_of_7_years/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

I dont think there is a need for me to see her again next week. So here’s what happened. 

-She texted me she got home and about to sleep at 11:44 PM (she’s closing deals in another city and has to rent a place)

-I tried to facetime her 11:51 PM just to say goodnight, she didn’t pick up. I tried messaging her but no response. 

Remember that spare phone that’s with me where her google account is logged in? I browsed on her activity history quickly to find out what shes up to, and was surprised there’s a “google assistant” command recorded at 11:48 PM.

I played and listened. There’s her voice and a voice of another guy. They were goofing around at the google home device. So yeah. 

I confronted her and barraged her with a lot of messages, she only replied at around 1 AM.  She kept on denying she’s cheating.

Then I laid all the evidences, all the screencaps and even the audio clip recording from the google assistant. 

She finally admitted. 

I am single.

ANSWER: When she comes back from her little single girl fantasy vacation she’s going to realize the enormity of what she’s done. You’re going to have be strong enough to weather that storm.

QUESTION: Can't wait until Thursday....My(48M) wife(44F) is going to be SHOCKED

[\\\UPDATE\\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/)

So, wife and I have been together 17 years.  We are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator.  About two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  So off we got to the GP, who gives us a consult to a Rheumatologist.  Come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  Fast forward to a month ago, when our North Texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  She woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were HUGE, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  And even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  So, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  So, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from Ireland and custom designed, and have words in Gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of "repair", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  She was absolutely GUTTED.  I assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but I could tell, to her, it was.

Begin Sherlock Holmes Mode.  I googled until I couldn't google anymore.  I was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  I searched some more.  I finally found his personal Facebook page, and I message him, and wait......and wait......

I finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her Da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  I express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  I go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  She tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.

Fast forward a couple of weeks.  I get a message on Facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  She explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and MOLDS in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  She sent pictures, and I confirmed that YES - THOSE ARE OUR RINGS!  She said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.

I open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  OF OUR RINGS.  She went ahead and had her BROTHER, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  I asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and I was allowed to keep my old one.  She told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  I asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.

Our "New" Wedding Bands will be here Thursday.

Trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has NO IDEA any of this took place.

\Edit - I rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her I was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed.  The absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to NOT tell her as we tell each other EVERYTHING.  So now I not only need to figure out HOW to do this, but NOT to spill the beans until then.  (Our friends nicknamed us Mickey and Mallory as well as Marshall and Lilly from "How I Met Your Mother", because we literally tell each other everything)

\Edit 2 - I thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where I actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (VA Nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so ALWAYS goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when I originally proposed, I waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and...."waited".....am thinking of a repeat.

\Edit 3 - And to those of you saying "I" am awesome, not in the slightest.  SHE is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends.  She is the reason I breathe, and supported all of us when I went back to school to achieve my two doctorates to advance my career.  She is my hero.  I wake up every day to earn her all over again.  This was one small thing I was able to do to bring her happiness, her joy is why I have a heartbeat.  And I don't give  a good flying f\ at a rolling donut if I seem sappy.  If a man isn't allowed to get sappy over his wife, he shouldn't have one.

TL;DR Wife had to have rings cut off due to swelling from arthritis, I went Hardy Boys and found original jeweler, who had passed away, daughter found original molds/order, and recreated rings without my knowledge and mailed them out.  Was seeking advice on how to give her the new wedding bands.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Should I [40F] report my niece [17F] to the police?

My parents are going away for Christmas, so before they did they hosted an early Christmas party at their home, which my whole family went to including me my husband and our 16 year old daughter Laura.

My sister and her daughter Rachel were there too. She's a year older than Laura and they don't get along. In fact we try to avoid them as much as we can due to amount of times that Rachel has upset and tormented Laura. Rachel is naturally very smart and is always top of her class, and is also very pretty. While I've always been happy for her and wished her the best, these things have constantly been used to excuse her. My sister even went as far as to accuse Laura of lying because she is jealous of Rachel's looks and talents.

Laura took up boxing last year and has progressed really well. She's going to compete at a higher level next year and her coach is extremely proud of her. My sister has insisted that the boxing is nothing more than ''a phase'' and has gone out of her way to downplay it in favour of her daughter's academic stuff.

At my parents place Laura went to sort out some presents under the tree, and Rachel followed her. She was wearing stiletto high heels, and when Laura had her hand on the floor Rachel stamped on it. She was in agony.

We went to the hospital, and after a follow up visit to the doctor today Laura needs extensive physio, and will not be able to box for an indefinite period. She's in floods of tears because of this.

I was raging at my sister, who is so deluded that she insists that it was an accident. I'm sorry, but after years of calling Laura ugly, stupid, fat and anything else she could think of do you really expect me to believe that this was an innocent mistake? Rachel for her part put on the crocodile tears for everyone, and only her parents believed it.

My husband wants to tell the police and I do too. I warned my sister about this, and she broke down crying too, saying that her daughter's teachers have encouraged her to apply to the top universities because they think she's got a good chance of getting in, and that if she ends up with a criminal record then that will be ruined.

No sympathy from me. Frankly Rachel took something that my daughter loves away from her and left her in huge amounts of pain. She shouldn't just have her chances ruined, she should get locked up.

I know it sounds awful of me but she did an awful thing and needs to face the consequences. Laura is utterly heartbroken and Rachels parents won't punish her.

ANSWER: You should have immediately reported it to the police, although in my experience, they won't do a thing about it.

Definitely file a police report. Even if nothing comes of it, it's on record and can be used against the sociopath when she does it again to someone else.

QUESTION: Update: My (21) little sister (12) was given 1-3 weeks to live. What can I do to make her enjoy her last days?

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5idc1/my_21_little_sister_12_was_just_given_13_weeks_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

Final Update:

I first want to say thank you to everyone who commented and said wonderful things. I got a lot more responses than I had thought I would, so I apologize for not responding to so many of you. 

My sister actually survived longer than the doctors anticipated, but she passed away on September 1st. It’s been a very hard couple of days and I’ve been grieving, as has my family. 

We were able to use a lot of your ideas and play board games, take pictures, laugh and share stories. I was able to hold her hand and kiss her as she went. She was given pain medicine and went peacefully. 

I wanted to say thank you to one redditor who actually sent us board games to play. She normally felt pretty lethargic, but she did get to play and enjoyed it. We will continue to play these games as a family, and think fondly of when she played with us. 

My family is now in the process of planning her funeral and laying her to rest. She will always be in our hearts and I know she’s in a better place and not in pain. 

Thank you again to everyone ❤️ it will always mean so much to me and my family for all the thoughts, prayers and advice I was given.

ANSWER: Do not stand at my grave and weep  
I am not there; I do not sleep.  
I am a thousand winds that blow,  
I am the diamond glints on snow,  
I am the sun on ripened grain,  
I am the gentle autumn rain.  
When you awaken in the morning's hush  
I am the swift uplifting rush  
Of quiet birds in circled flight.  
I am the soft stars that shine at night.  
Do not stand at my grave and cry,  
I am not there; I did not die.

EDIT: Thank you to all have posted and gifted.  Reading OP's post hit home fairly hard, as my father passed away in 2010 and his birthday is coming up soon.  So I wanted to share this as a reminder to myself and share some solace with OP.  OP, should you read this, take care of you and yours, okay?

QUESTION: My 8 year old cousin accused me of spying on her while she showered

My(17m) family is having a reunion at our house and my cousin(8f) often lies to get people in trouble.

Yesterday I had to use the bathroom and accidentally walked in on my cousin in the shower. I apologized and left but when she got out she told everyone that I was spying on her. Several of my family members believed her while others knew that she was lying. Since they were staying at our house for a week I have to spend the rest of the time in my room not leaving unless I had to use the bathroom.

It’s Aggravating to have almost half of my family think I’m a creep and get punished for it. What should I do

Edit:I didn’t hear the shower running because my hearing aids had died and I didn’t have anymore batteries

ANSWER: Never be alone in a room with her. Try and avoid her at all costs. That's a really slippery slope to fall down. Im sorry you have to go through that.

================================================================================

QUESTION: UPDATE - I think my SIL’s (23/F) best friend (23/F) is trying to get with my (25/F) husband (28/M) and she’s encouraging it. Am I delusional?

My original post got locked because I didn’t use a ThrowRA account, so I made another account to post the update, so it doesn’t happen again (I'll post a link on my old account for proof that this is my new account).

ORIGINAL post for anyone hasn’t read it (the update is below) –

Link –  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ift0zm/i\_think\_my\_sils\_23f\_best\_friend\_23f\_is\_trying\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ift0zm/i_think_my_sils_23f_best_friend_23f_is_trying_to/)

My SIL (23/F) is my husband’s (28/M) half-sister, she was the product of their mother’s infidelity. His father divorced their mother when he was 12 after he found out through a paternity test she wasn’t his. My FIL refused to have anything to do with my SIL but continued to have a relationship with my husband, because of this my SIL is very clingy to my husband. My husband is also very protective of his sister and generally doesn’t tolerate anything negative being said about her, which is why I’m posting this here before mentioning anything to him.

My husband and I bought a house last year which has its own indoor swimming pool. My SIL was super excited when she saw it and asked if she could use it sometimes with her friend. We said it was fine, as long as she gave us a notice before she turned up. Her and her friend (Chloe) have used it many times before but almost never when my husband is home (he is a lawyer and works long hours). With lockdown, my husband has started to work from home. My SIL asked me if she and Chloe could come over and use the pool, I told her I was uncomfortable with them coming over as I’m pregnant and don’t want to accidentally expose the baby to anything risky. My SIL then asked if she and Chloe quarantined for two weeks would they be able to come over, my husband said it was fine.

Two weeks later they turn up to my house. My husband was in his office, so they go straight to the pool after making small talk. My husband ends up coming out after an hour and we’re hanging out in the kitchen. My SIL walks in to get a drink and she starts talking to my husband. Before she goes back to the pool, she says “Chloe’s going to be so happy to see you”. It was weird because my husband and Chloe aren’t close. Chloe comes into the kitchen two minutes later and spends the rest of her time talking to my husband until he excuses himself to get back to work. She’s super giggly and smiley when she talks to him. He would say something sarcastic and she would laugh like it was the funniest joke she’s ever heard. It honestly felt like she was flirting with him. Before she went back to the pool, she gave me this weird smirk-y look. Before they leave, they ask my husband if he’s working from home everyday of the week, he confirms he is.

The next two weeks, they come over to the house to ‘swim’ every single day. Except, Chloe never gets in the water. Instead she hangs around the house in her bikini (she was previously wearing a one-piece if it makes a difference) every single day. Whenever my husband comes out to hang around me, she quickly interrupts him and keeps him talking until he has to go back to work. I made lunch for us all and when I excused myself to call my husband down, my SIL quickly stopped me and said Chloe could call him for me. They shared a look and Chloe looked really happy when she went to get him. Chloe has also started to get touchier with my husband. She’s put her hands on his chest and arms, stands or sits really close to him. To my husband’s credit he does usually create space between them whenever she does something like this.

The reason I believe my SIL is in on this is because she’s made a few pregnancy-related jabs at me recently. She told me a story about how one of her friend’s boyfriends was cheating on her and then said something along the lines of “did you know a lot of men start cheating when their wives are pregnant?”. She’s also made comments about how I look chubby now and it looks weird next to my husband because he’s ‘well-built’. If she spots my husband out of the office she quickly goes to inform Chloe.

I know pregnancy hormones can mess with a person’s brain so I’m wondering if I’m just looking for something that isn’t there. My SIL sent me a text yesterday asking if they could come over to swim next week and I really want to say no but I know she’ll whine to my husband if I do. I ideally want to have a conversation with him before then but I’m not sure if I should mention the flirting.

Am I being delusional?

TL;DR – SIL’s and her friend are constantly asking to come over to use our pool but her friend never swims. Instead, she waits around to start talking with my husband. She seems very flirtatious whenever she talks to him but I’m not sure if it’s just pregnancy hormones getting to me.

UPDATE –

Well, I read and reread all of the comments on the original post to try and figure out how I was going to bring up the issue. Turns out, I didn’t have to. We were watching a movie and my phone lit up with another text from my SIL telling me she was now going to be here at 1pm the next day to swim with Chloe. My husband saw it and told me to tell her not to come. This is really weird behaviour for my husband because he tends to do anything to accommodate my SIL and very rarely refuses her anything. I asked him if something had happened and he shrugged it off and we kept watching the movie.

A few minutes later he paused the movie and said he wanted to ask me a question. He asked if I’d noticed Chloe never swam when she came to our house. I wish I could say I was calm and collected like the comments were advising but… I ended up laughing hysterically. I was honestly just so relieved he’d brought it up instead of me having to be the one to do it. I think my husband thought I was losing my mind.

When I finally stopped laughing, he repeated the question and said he wanted a serious answer. I said, “of course I’ve noticed” and he awkwardly replied “so… you must’ve noticed the other thing too”. To summarise the conversation that followed: My husband hadn’t noticed Chloe was flirting with him the first few days because he was so busy with work, he wasn’t really paying attention to anything else. He said when she started getting handsy is when he suddenly had the ‘light bulb’ moment that she was into him. He says he didn’t want to unnecessarily stress me out, so he never mentioned anything, but he was worried I’d noticed too and thought he was interested because he hadn’t immediately shut it down. He realised we would eventually have to have this talk, but he wasn’t sure how to bring it up (oh the irony). He did privately speak to Chloe and told her he was happily married and wasn’t interested in starting anything with anyone else. Apparently, she never took him seriously because she kept doing it.

In the end, he called his sister on Sunday to tell her either she got her to stop or Chloe couldn’t come over anymore. His sister ended up having a tantrum and said a few nasty things about me/the baby/our relationship. She insisted I was somehow behind his request and made some comments about how I was controlling and insecure because I looked like a ‘beach whale’ and Chloe was younger and hotter. He was pretty pissed at this and said if she said something like that about me again, he would stop speaking to her. She claimed I had baby trapped him and when my husband pointed out we were already married so I didn’t need to ‘trap’ him and that he was the one who wanted to start a family she kept insisting I had manipulated him into feeling that way. She claimed he was unhappy in our relationship and he always looked ‘tired’ because I was forcing him to slave away to fund my fancy lifestyle, whilst I sat on my ass all day. He pointed out he chose to be a lawyer knowing he would have to work long hours and I had only recently left my job, so her accusations were baseless.

She said some other stuff along the same lines but the thing that made my husband finally snap was when she said ‘it’ (the baby) was already ruining everything and it was just going to get worse when it was born and he should’ve dragged me to the abortion clinic whilst he had the chance. He told her neither her nor Chloe were welcome in our home anymore until they apologised for how they’d been behaving and for the things my SIL said. He said he wasn’t sure he could ever forgive or forget what she’d said about our child even if she did apologise and he couldn’t believe she would even think something like that, let alone say it. Apparently, she started crying and said she was sorry, that she didn’t mean it and she was just scared to lose him and that she wasn’t thinking clearly. He hung up on her. He showed me his phone and she’s been calling him and texting him since begging him to reply.

He asked if she’d said anything to me. I was debating whether to say anything or not, but he kept insisting he knew she had said something, and he wanted to know what it was. I told him the things I mentioned in the original post and a few other things she had said. He asked me why I never mentioned anything when she first said it and I mentioned how he got really defensive whenever I said anything even slightly negative about his sister and he… got defensive. I pointed out he was doing it again and after some back and forth he admitted that “maybe he was a little bit defensive when it came to her” but he promised to stop and he wanted to make sure we could talk about anything, including his sister.

He ended up mentioning wanting to try couples counselling. He said it wasn’t because he thought there was something wrong with our relationship but apparently he has been speaking to his dad a lot recently and he mentioned one thing he regretted about his marriage with MIL is that they never went to therapy until the cracks in their relationship were too big. In his current marriage they go, and it’s helped him avoid the mistakes of his first marriage. I agreed, so we’re probably going to try that soon.

My husband thinks my SIL will eventually turn up even if we tell her not to, but he promised he’d deal with her if she does.

So, reddit I guess you were right. I really did just need to speak to him. Thanks for the advice and comments, I enjoyed reading them all.

TL;DR – We talked. Husband already confronted both the friend and SIL. SIL said some really shitty things so we won’t be contacting her for a while. Communication is key folks! ;)

ANSWER: I love a good update, your husbands a keeper!! Good on both of you!! So so so happy it all worked out.

Love you, and your baby, and your husband who is willing to stick up for you and himself and your baby 💕

Edit: my first awards! Thanks reddit friends! ❤️

This update was long overdue so I apologize to everyone who waited for this. I've had daily messages asking me about what happened and now that I'm in a better place to actually talk about it, I can tell everyone about what happened. 

First of all, thank you to the redditors who pointed out that I should tell my wife first before confronting my brother. You were right, she did appreciate the fact that I gave her control over the situation. 

I told my wife the next day after posting and needless to say, she did not take it well. She says she feels violated and unsafe in her own home. See, the thing is my wife and I have been together for almost 15 years so we literally saw this kid grow up. We took him out to the movies, to the beach, etc. We sometimes even joked to my parents that he was our practice baby. My wife has a tendency to distrust people in general, as a lot of people in her life have let her down in the past. Imagine how hurt and betrayed she was when she found out someone she trusted and loved dearly betrayed her like that. Honestly, if I wasn't consoling my wife then, I probably would've gone through with the initial idea and beat the ever living crap out of my brother. 

After she calmed down and went to sleep, I called my sister and talked about the situation. My sister and I are close, given that we're Irish Twins. I feel like she needed to know cause she has 2 teenage daughters herself and who knows what my brother would do to them if given the chance. We talked and she was clearly mad. She loves my wife like a sister and they're quite close themselves. She said she would support whatever decision we make and that our brother would also be unwelcome at her place for the foreseeable future. 

Then we confronted my brother. At first he denied it but when I showed him the evidence, he started ugly crying and begging us to forgive him. I gave him an ultimatum... Either he lets me in his phone laptop and delete everything, or I call the police. There was so much more shit on his computer than I initially thought. So many more stolen pictures of my wife that we're definitely taken without consent. The fucker even recorded the audio of us having sex. Who does that? So after hours of me looking for as much shit as possible, and pretty much clearing most of his hard drive, he eventually left without much of a fight. Oh and we definitely threw out my wife's defiled underwear and are most likely going to have the room he stayed in cleaned professionally. 

I checked and thankfully he didn't have any hidden cameras anywhere. Oh and if you're wondering how he got pictures of my wife in a towel... The shower for the masters doesn't have hot water yet so my wife uses the shared one in the same area. She would usually walk out of the bathroom with just a towel on and go change in our walk in closet. This shouldn't have been a problem cause the guest bedroom was in a different part of the house far from the main bedrooms and it had its own bathroom so my brother had no reason for being there. 

Needless to say, my wife is still shaken up about the whole thing, which is why I didn't think about writing an update until now. I'm sorry but my wife's well-being is my priority above anything else. 

My mom eventually called me asking what happened. She seemed very confused so I figured my brother didn't tell her anything at all. I told her what happened and needless to say, it did not end well. She kept asking me to forgive my brother and take him back in. She ranted about how difficult it would be to support him and how what I'm doing is breaking the family apart. I let her talk till I eventually said my brother would no longer be welcome in my home. I told her that she needed to get him therapy and that until then, there's no chance we would ever see him. My mom told me she'd talk to my sister about it and I said... Good luck, she's mad at him too. 

Not sure what's going to happen to our family now. The reason why we got the big house was cause we wanted everyone to come over during the holidays and stay with us but Im not sure if my parents will at this point and there's no chance my brother is ever coming back anytime soon. Thankfully my sister is 100% on my side and we're going to talk about what we're doing for Thanksgiving soon. 

My wife hasnt really been the same either but she's getting better now that my brother is gone. We're talking about therapy which is something she's very willing to try out. We took a drive to the beach earlier (chill guys, we didn't leave the car) and talked about the future. We both agreed that after this whole covid thing is over, we're going to finally start our family with kids. We want two. Being a mom is something she always wanted but we both wanted to be financially secure enough to give them a good life and for us to also be in a position where we didn't have to work so much and just spend time with them. The sparkle in her eyes when we talked about our life together with kids told me that while things arent good right now, we're going to be ok. 

I honestly can't wait to be a dad myself. 

So yeah, long story short brother is gone, wife is still sad, sister is on my side but mom isn't and I'm going to be a dad in a few years. 

Thanks to everyone who gave me their advice. It honestly helped me clear my head and make the right decision to tell my wife first. 

Oh and to answer questions that may come up... 

No, we did not go to the police. My brother deleted everything voluntarily and left without a trace. I'm sure the pictures are still out there somewhere but thankfully they aren't too explicit that it would severely damage my wife's reputation. 

And no, we aren't going to try and get pregnant or anything like that. We plan on adopting which is something we both talked about early on. 

So again, thanks to everyone who messaged and commented. I may not have read everything nor have I replied to everyone but rest assured you are all greatly appreciated.

ANSWER: How securely did you delete the files? Otherwise they may still be recoverable. 

Sorry to see this, friend. It sucks but it sounds like you and your wife (and your sister!) are together in this. That's a good support network to have.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My (20F) sister's (28F) behaviour towards my boyfriend (21M) is horrendous

Previous post:

(i'm on mobile. i apologize for any mistakes)

Hi. First of all, I'd like to thank each and every one of you for your help. I'm really grateful for the support I've received here and all those little messages some of you sent me really made me understand the situation I was in. The many MANY comments I read here gave me the strength I needed to talk to my sister. Thank you, guys.

I should probably tell you that this might not be the perfect badass ending you all were expecting, and I apologize for that. I've always had a hard time standing up against my sister. Like I said in my original post, my boyfriend doesn't like confrontations either and he's also a huge people pleaser which makes this situation harder for both of us.  

Nevertheless, I finally decided to talk to my sister yesterday. She was actually sitting in my living room in her underwear and bra, and I completely lost my shit. I told her multiple times to wear some clothes but she said it was too hot which it was not. She then made a small comment about me being insecure about my bf liking her or something like that, and that made me angry.

I sat her down and we talked. I told her she was making me uncomfortable. She was making my boyfriend uncomfortable, and we wanted her to leave. She looked very shocked by it because I don't think I have ever talked to her like that. She immediately apologized though. She said she didn't know or some bullshit which I wasn't going to fall for this time.

I gave her an ultimatum. She needed to pack her shit and get out in three hours. She looked very emotional and she apologized a lot, said "sorry" a lot and told me she loved me. She said she would never intentionally try to hurt me. If I "misunderstood" her actions, it wasn't her fault. She kept saying she didn't know. She said she was just trying to be "friendly" to my boyfriend which is not true at all. 

I asked her if sexually harrassing someone was "friendly" to her, and she started crying. By this time, my bf who was in our bedroom (avoiding my sister and her skimpy clothing) came to support me. She kind of directed her questions towards him. She asked him if she was making him uncomfortable (He said yes) and she cried and apologized. She then tried to gain his sympathy by saying that I was kicking her out when she had no place to go. She also lied that I was always mean to her. She completely ignored me and asked him if she could stay. She had nowhere else to go.

Of course he said no. What the fuck did she think. I will forever remember the look on her face.

So yeah, she actually refused to leave, cried a lot and said she was jobless and she didn't have money, no place to stay, no friends etc. I told her she had no friends because she was a bitch (the first time I said something like this to my sister) She then tried to guilt trip me to let her stay by repeating the words "I'm your sister" "family" "I love you" etc. Me and my boyfriend helped her pack all her stuff and put it next to her car. I told her that she can stay in her car, I didn't care. I wanted her to go.

It wasn't really "epic" like some of you wanted. I was actually crying a little while I was shouting at her because I was shaking so much. At one point my bf had to tell me to calm down. It was just so overwhelming. I'm just glad she's gone.

She did leave eventually. She was calling someone and I'm pretty sure she went back to her own flat. Thank god she's not going to my parents because I don't think she knows how to quarantine. I know she won't quarantine and this was the main reason I was hesitant to kick her out.

2-3 hours after she left, my mom called me and yelled at me for kicking her out. I shouldn't have been shocked when she accused my bf of bothering my sister. My mom also asked me what kind of man I was dating, I should leave him etc. I should've expected that, really. I tried to reason with her but my mom was just angry at me. She asked me things like "how can you do this to your own sister" and similar bullshit she should be asking my sister. At that point I was so fucking angry. I was in tears and shaking. I just told her to fuck off in anger and hung up.

It was just a weird day. I'm proud of myself for finally standing up to my sister, but I also don't really feel like getting up from my bed. My bf is back to his cheerful self and I'm happy about that, but I just feel like such an idiot. I should've realized my mom would never take my side a long time ago.

I just don't understand what I did to make my mom so angry at me. Why doesn't she love me? I have done everything she asked me to do, but she never takes my side in things. I just want her to fucking love me and support me for once. It just never happens and I feel like I'm a fucking idiot for even trying. I think she regrets I was even born. 

Anyway fuck that. I'm done trying to reason with them. My mom will never believe me. Pretty sure my sister lied to her so mom keeps calling and trying to speak to my bf.

I'm currently thinking of cutting off all of my family. All they do is make me feel like shit. I deserve better than that. My boyfriend deserves better than that

I apologize for venting. What's done is done. I don't regret it. I'm glad I have my boyfriend and he loves me unlike my family and we finally have some alone time. He's been so moody, but right now he's actually cooking and stuff and he hasn't done that ever since sister came here so yeah. I'm glad she's gone. My boyfriend is glad she's gone. I finally have some peace and quiet in my home.  

Thank you so much to everyone. I don't think I can thank you all enough. Some of you talked to me, sent me messages and it really opened my eyes. I'll take care of myself and my boyfriend now. Thank you :)

Edit: thank you everyone. I've been reading your comments. I'm still shocked by the support I've received here. Please know that I appreciate it so much, even though I may not be able to reply. Thank you.

ANSWER: You said not to expect a badass ending but you were a stone cold badass. I'm so proud of you for self-advocating and for protecting the man you love from a sexual predator. I know that must have been incredibly painful but the worst part is over. The infections gone. It'll still hurt, but keep yourself 'clean' and away from her and you'll make it. Well done!

QUESTION: Update: I heard my bf’s parents say racist things about me

[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/goaks4/i_heard_my_boyfriends_parents_say_something/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)


I decided to tell my boyfriend what happened. I told him last night, at 2AM. He was livid. I barely had time to finish the story before he started packing our bags. He kept on apologizing for the situation he put me in, and I could see how horrible he felt about all of this. He told me he wanted to talk to his parents about what they said and asked if I wanted to be a part of the conversation or if I’d rather wait in the car. Not being a person who likes confrontation at all, I hesitated but ultimately said I wanted to be there. I just didn’t want to actively participate in the conversation, I was too uncomfortable. 

He woke his parents up, sat them down and told them what I had heard. They were clearly extremely uncomfortable and kind of just stared at him, like they couldn’t believe he was doing this. He told them it was unacceptable and how ashamed he was of them. He also told them that when/if we would decide to speak to them again, they better be ready to sincerely apologize and do better, because he wouldn’t tolerate anything else. He also mentioned that their opinion would have no impact on who he would decide to marry. His mom looked like she wanted to say something but he didn’t let her, got up and we left. We were quite shaken up on the ride home, but he took the time to explain to me what he knew of why his parents behaved this way.

Basically, he remembers his parents making racist remarks here and there when he was little (not just about black people but POC in general). He didn’t really know it was wrong until he got out of his hometown and realized his parents were very wrong in their views. With time, he saw his parents less and less, because their views regarding race and other issues just didn’t align with his at all anymore and it would create animosity every time he visited them. When he met me, even before we became a couple and were just friends, he would often post pictures of us on Facebook and his parents would see them. They never mentioned anything. When they learned that we were a couple, they said they wanted to meet me, and he wasn’t sure of their sincerity. He said they talked about me when they would call him, and for a whole year, my bf basically tried to make sure that they were actually okay with our relationship. His parents kept saying not to worry, that they had learned from their past mistakes, asking him to trust them. After a year, he finally believed them and that’s when he decided to introduce us. He was so happy to see how nice and accepting they were towards me. He said it himself, he was too naive.

He was pretty much crying telling me this, but I could tell he tried not to because he felt responsible and didn’t want to make it about himself. Maybe it makes me dumb, but I don’t blame him. I know him, and he wouldn’t put me in a situation like that on purpose. I believe him when he says he truly thought they changed. He apologized numerous times and told me I never had to see them again, and that he wouldn’t either for a very long while. He was already not close with them, and this situation didn’t help at all. He made it a point to say that what his mother said about him wasn’t true (that he wouldn’t marry me because he knows they would disapprove). 

We talked about it a lot since last night. We barely slept. And I decided I do want to stay with him. A big majority of the comments under my last post told me that my best option was to leave him, a lot of it coming from POC. And I understand why. But, I do love him very much and I really do not want to leave him because his parents hate our relationship. I think I would regret it. I’m not saying it’ll be easy and maybe I am making a mistake, but I want to be with him. Maybe it’s disappointing to a lot of you, but it’s my decision.

btw I didn’t contact daily mail, they published my post without asking me

Thank you all very much for your advice. x

ANSWER: So glad your bf stood up for you properly! No wavering, nothing; you told him and he immediately took action showing you he was on your side. Good stuff.

QUESTION: Update: My(F24) boyfriend(28) if 10 years has become incredibly secretive of his phone, laptop, social media, and car

[og post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqz54g/myf24_boyfriend_28_of_10_years_has_become/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

So I found out he was cheating on me with an underaged girl.

Yesterday morning after confronted him and asked flat out if he cheated on me. He admitted that he had receive a blowjob from another woman. He said he blocked her on everything, but she kept creating instagram accounts to contact him. I asked why he hid this, and he said he was ashamed and was looking for the right time to say something. 

Something in my gut told me he still was lying, so I snuck into his room and stole his phone while he showered, he forgot to take my thumbprint out of his phone. I looked at his most recent texts, and a few hours before he had texted an unnamed number, “I told GF I was cheating on her, we might not be able to see each other for a while. If you need me message me on insta”. I have never been so hurt by anything in my life, I felt my heart drop as I read the text, I looked at past texts and saw pictures of his dick and her body and him saying she looked better than me. 

I moved on to his Instagram, and like a lot of people said, he had a second one he used to dm women. I found a conversation with the girl he had been talking to that started in August 2019, and suggested he had been fucking her since October 2019. For at least one year of our relationship he was unfaithful. I checked the girls profile to see if she was better looking than me, and saw in her bio the name of a high school near us and C/O 2023. My stomach turned and I had to stop myself from throwing up. He was fucking a 15 year old girl. At that point I had seen enough and decided to leave the apartment. I screenshoted everything and sent it to myself. I went to my friends place where showed her everything. 

I felt so disgusted and guilty. A bunch of the people that commented on my first post spoke about how he groomed me, and I just now am realizing how right they were. If I hadn’t let our relationship continue and told the other young girls what he did, it might’ve stopped him from doing it to other girls. I refuse to look back at his Instagram because I don’t want to know how many young girls I helped him either rape or abuse in some way. I feel so gross for defending him. I also feel disgusted by the fact that it’s very likely I performed oral sex on him hours after he had slipped his dick into a high schooler. That evening we began the process of reporting him and hopefully he will be thrown under the jail very soon. I’m going to try to do what I can to right the wrongs I did with this, and am planning to get an STI test and some therapy to get past this and raise my self esteem again.

Thanks for those of you that tried to help me.

ANSWER: Wow. I’m glad you left and reported him to police! He is a predator and needs to be locked up. Although it may not feel like it, I promise you will be ok!! 💕

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (38m) just found out that my brother (19m) has been perving on my wife (37f)

Throwaway cause I'm still the only one that knows 

Background: My brother has been staying with us since lockdown, after his University closed. He couldn't stay with our parents cause they just sold the house and moved to a 1 bedroom apartment and our sister lives in a different part of the country. He was the "oops" baby so I hope that explains the age gap. My wife and I have a 5 bedroom home but currently don't have children yet (we decided to adopt 2 kids in our 40s) so we let him stay here. 

My brother has always been... Different. He's a bit of a loner and doesn't have a lot of friends outside of his online group. He's a shy geeky kid but he's otherwise alright (or so I thought) when you get to know him.

So here's what happened

The wifi doesn't quite reach my brother's room so he usually does his school work and other stuff in the dining room. A few nights ago, I was walking to the fridge after waking up in the middle of the night (wife and I sleep early) and saw my brother working on something out and as I got closer, I saw a very compromising picture of my wife (cleavage shot as she was gardening). He noticed me and quickly closed the window like he was watching porn. I was too shell shocked to say anything at that time and he just smiled awkwardly and ran to his room with the laptop. 

When I realized that something was up, I knew I had to find out. The next day, I asked my brother to pick up some groceries and some lunch for us and while he was away, I went to his room (something I've never done since he moved) and, well, it wasn't pretty. I saw a couple of my wife's bras and some of her panties which I can only assume he used to pleasure himself. I took his laptop and fuck it, decided to snoop. I knew his password cause I borrowed his Crunchyroll account to watch this anime my friend recommended (I don't usually watch anime). 

There I saw some of the most sickening entries I've read. There were pictures of my wife in a towel, her working out, her in compromising positions, etc. All taken without her consent by the looks of it. The fucker even logs every time he touches himself to the image of my wife. The creepiest part? He sometimes listens in on us when we have sex. My wife can be a bit loud but we didn't think it would be a problem since his bedroom was in a different part of the house (guest bedroom). 

I left the room feeling like I needed a shower. It was absolutely disgusting. 

Now I don't know what to do. I find myself fighting the urge to pummel him into next week every time I see him. I haven't told my wife yet cause I'm 100% sure she will feel violated and disgusted so I want to find the best solution first before doing so. I so desperately want to kick him out but I he has nowhere else to go. Even if I do, what should I tell my parents? The truth? This will most likely break the family apart. I do plan on telling my wife soon but if I do, I can almost guarantee she would want nothing to do with him and would never want to visit the family if he's around. 

I'm so fucking lost right now. Any advice will help. Still fighting the urge to beat my brother to a bloody pulp.

Edit: if you're wondering, I did take pictures as proof.

Small update: I told my wife. The redditors who said I should tell her first before anything cause she was the victim were absolutely right. I'm giving her all the power to decide what to do about it. A lot has happened but there are still things that need to be settled. Too long to add here and too incomplete to make a new update post. Hopefully we'll have everything settled tomorrow or the day after. I'll write the update once everything is settled and I calmed down. 

No, I'm not going to beat up my brother but I have thought about it. 

And to the people asking for the pics... You're disgusting. Hope the women in your life are proud of you. That's my wife, please have some respect.

ANSWER: MAKE A COPY OF EVERYTHING!

Edit: Oops pressed enter too soon everything, but you need that evidence. Take pics of what you found in his room and where you found it. Take it away. Tell your parents to collect him, confront him then kick him out.

He absolutely DOES NOT nor CAN'T be trusted to be in your house or around your wife.

Also tell her ASAP. She'll feel betrayed if you kick him out without telling her. She deserves to know. If you're not telling her because you're afraid of how she'll react then that only proves that he needs to go AND you need to tell her. I'm sorry man.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [31m] told my girlfriend [30f] that she is not a trophy wife or status symbol and that we are similar in attractiveness, she views it as me calling her old and ugly

A bit of background my girlfriend and I are 30 and 31 respectively. We have been dating for about a year. I work as a high-level engineer at a good firm and my girlfriend works as a payroll specialist at a good firm too. I make significantly more than her (3x).

Things were good in our relationship until I showed her my retirement/savings. She now doesn't see the point of working and has started framing our relationship in that, she is the beautiful one and that I am the nerdy engineer that was lucky to have her. Before, when we met she was all about making it her own way, eventually starting her own company with her sister in sourcing and recruiting. But now she jokes about driving a Range Rover and wearing Lululemon and going to Yoga.

We were having a discussion again about this 'trophy wife' stuff she brought up that I was nerdy back in the day while she was very popular. I told her she is not a trophy wife, that yes she is attractive but its not a huge difference between us.

I told her had it been the case that I met her when she was 22 and I was my current age than sure, but she isn't 22 anymore. After I said that she just started crying like crazy.

She started saying that I think of her as ugly and used up that her best years are behind are. She just told me that if I am not happy to be with her, why am I even here? to stop wasting her time.

I tried to talk to her but she was in no state for a conversation. I don't know what to say, guys, for me, I just wanted to say that I think we are of similar attractiveness. Like I don't think anyone when they see us turns their head and is like oh she is with him the cause of money? Or damn he is so lucky to be with her. I think it's mutual. She was the one that if anything went after my attractiveness first.

&#x200B;

What should I do? I like the fact that we both work and I don't want to change that dynamic. And I don't want her to think too that she is above me that I am so lucky to have her. I want her to think of us as equals and in my attempt to do that I hurt her feelings. What's the next move?

&#x200B;

Tl;Dr- ever since my girlfriend found out about my savings she has more often entertained the idea of being a stay at home wife. She has tried to bring up the fact that she was more attractive than me as justification why I am so lucky to be with her and why I should accept this.

ANSWER: I think there are two perspectives for this:

1) she is insecure and she said that that you guys would be 'equal'

2) she never thought you guys were equal

Edit: OP, what happened?

================================================================================

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (20F) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend’s (27M) phone.

It’s been a long night. Thank you all for staying patient. Also this will be an immensely long post, so buckle in.

First off I just want to say thank you for the massive outpouring of support and love. I’m still trying to work through all of your PM’s because I’d like to respond personally to each of you who were kind enough to send me loving words of support. I have been pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people who have commented and through reading every last one of your thoughts. I never imagined this post would gain nearly this level of traction and visibility and it’s my hope that if I can provide some description of the course of legal action taken and what advice I used from Reddit users, other unfortunate partners who stumble upon CP and find this thread (at least in Canada) will have some idea of what recourse they can take.

I also want to state that for anybody who doubts the validity of my claims, I understand. This is an absolutely fucking insane sequence of events and as much as I wish I had the energy to make something like this up for some arbitrary Karma, I don’t. To provide proof I have sent photographs of identifications and the related arrest paperwork to mods and have worked with them to verify all of what I have written.

Yesterday I was picked up by my best friend Alex around 2:30. We drove around and talked for a while. I went to school, discovered it was closed (my scatterbrain completely forgot about spring break) and then we went back to his house to discuss all of the comments you had been leaving and come up with a course of action. We drank, talked and after a few hours took a short break from staring at my phone to play some apex. 

Alex dropped me back off at my house around 930. David was home, in my room, and immediately I noticed how he was exceptionally quiet and distant. He said he had to admit something to me. I prepared for him to admit to possessing CP but instead he told me about how he had taken some photos of me sleeping; he felt really embarrassed about it but he just didn’t know how to bring it up. I feigned surprise and asked him if he had anything else on his phone he wanted to admit to me. He  said no. I asked him to look me in the eyes and tell me that, and he did. I don’t know why I was hoping so badly that he would be honest with me about the CP but I really thought he’d admit to it then and there. Instead he admitted he had been feeling suicidal the last few months but didn’t think he would act on it. He asked me if that changed my perception of him and I said no. He grew quiet again and I left to go shower. When I came back he was getting changed and said he was going to walk for a bit and grab some food. It was about 1030 at this point. When he left, I finally lost it and broke down. I grabbed my cat and hugged him and cried and cried and cried. I was so tired and wanted to shut my brain off so badly. 

I grabbed my phone and dialed the non emergency RCMP line for my city. Shaking and crying I explained to the lady on the phone that I had discovered CP on my boyfriend’s phone. She put me through to the report line and I spoke to another Constable who told me I would be contacted by another officer who would provide more details. I waited for around 10 minutes. The officer advised me that he would need me to come in and provide a recorded audio/video statement. I asked if I could do it over the phone and he said no, it must be done in person so that if this goes to court, Crown Counsel has clear evidence that I was not coerced into stating what I witnessed. I don’t have my full licence yet and because of the late time I wasn’t able to make it down there on my own via transit so the cons table said he would come pick me up, asked me if David was there and if I could safely leave without arousing suspicion. Luckily David knows about my close family-like relationship with my best friend, so I made up a lie about how my best friend got in a fight with his dad and he wanted to talk to me about it. David didn’t seem to question it and I waited for the officer to arrive. 

He called me from a blocked number and I walked outside and down the block to his SUV. The constable and another officer greeted me,  I got into the front seat and we drove to the station. During the ride I asked him about whether seizing the phone on my own was a good idea. He explained that I had done everything correctly; laying low and getting my thoughts together to take it to police without notifying David. He said if I had taken David’s phone on my own that it would not have been admissible as evidence in court; they would have returned it back to him and he could have deleted all the evidence since suspicion had been roused. It was about 11:15 at this point. They placed me in an interview room and I sat and waiting for about twenty minutes. The officer came back in and explained the process of the interview, that it would take some time and to be as thorough as possible with my answers. He said we could take breaks and brought me some water.

 He started off by asking me details about my life, where I grew up, past employment etc. After that portion he asked me about David, what our relationship was like, whether he was nice and kind to me and anything else I knew about him. I told him he was sweet, that he had been nothing short of lovely in the time we’d been together but I did express that things had been moving very quickly. He agreed. He then got me to explain how I came upon the photos in question, so I did. Then came the worst part. He asked me to go through, one at a time, the photos I explicitly remembered details of seeing and to describe it in very, very graphic detail. ie positions of the children, their ethnicity, any identifying characteristics such as clothing, circumcision etc. It was intense but by some grace of God I was able to keep my composure and not burst into tears (mental/emotional exhaustion was fully setting in and I was almost thankful for not having energy to bawl) and provide a clear statement to the officer. He asked me if I would testify in court and I said I would. The officer left a few times during the interview to discuss with his supervisor more questions to ask during the interview and the legalities of the seizure they would attempt. The full interview took around three hours including all the sitting and waiting.

After I had been sitting for what felt like an eternity the officer came in and explained that they felt my interview provided enough reasonable cause to seize his phone and place him under arrest. They explained how the process would go and whether I wanted a no contact agreement.  I said yes initially but the officer asked me if it would be easier to not have one in regards to sorting out his belongings. That made sense to me so I chose not to move forward with the no contact agreement. 

We got in the constable’s car and drove down to my house with 2 other officers in 2 different vehicles, 3 in total. I told them I was more comfortable in a squad car than standing outside (I didn’t want to face him) so they moved me to the back of the cop car. I’ve never felt so anxious in my life. I asked them to be mindful of my cats and not let them get outside; they promised they would make sure of that. About 15 minutes later I saw them bringing David out in handcuffs. My heart which had been dissolving in my stomach’s acid all day felt completely gone. I curled up in the fetal position in the back of the squad car and waited to be told I could go back inside. After another eternity (my phone had died by this point but I know it was well past 330) they came back and explained he was under arrest but being released with promise to appear in court at a later date. I was told by the officer I could go back in, and that they would help him find his way back to the place he had been staying previously. The officer gave me a victim services card and a hug and instructed me to snuggle my cats tightly, that I did a brave thing and to be well. 

I went back into my house, put Planet Earth on for background noise and called my other best friend Paige who had been keeping up with me about this since I sent her my reddit post. We were talking for almost 45 minutes when my door burst open. It was David. He was frantic, his eyes were wild and he was hyperventilating. My jaw dropped; officers said they would be escorting him back to his prior residence and I was not at all mentally prepared to see him again. Paige asked me if everything was okay and I told her David had walked through the door, I would call her back. Immediately David came to the bed where I was sitting, dropped to his knees and sobbed violently. He said he didn’t know I would be here, he just came to grab a couple more of his belongings. He asked me what the cops had asked myself or told me. I lied and said that they said they had only told me they had suspicions of possession of child pornography. He sobbed more and loudly said “That isn’t me, that isn’t me, this isn’t who I am” and cried more and more. His body was wracked with sobs and he apologized over and over again. It was immensely difficult to witness and I wish I could have told him to get the fuck out but I just sat there immobilized, in shock. It was well close to 5 in the morning and I hadn’t slept or eaten much in nearly 48 hours at this point so my body and brain felt like they were essentially non-functioning. 

David began and said that this had been something he struggled with after developing an intense porn addiction in his early 20s. I asked him if he had ever been abused sexually and he said no. He said he knew how horrible it was to seek these images out, but had no inclination or desire to ever touch any children, he had never acted on these thoughts and never would. I asked him why he had never sought treatment before, and he admitted that he was terrified of what people would think, he had no idea what resources to access and he felt ashamed. He said his previous suicide attempts in years prior were directly linked to the fact that he considered himself a pedophile. I nodded. I asked him if they would find anything on his phone that would incriminate him and he said yes, they were going to. He admitted they were very explicit photos and I asked how he even found them; I don’t recall we ever got to that. He promised me he didn’t use my internet to access it but I don’t really believe that. He apologized to me more times than I could count and asked if I hated him. I told him I wasn’t sure that I felt hatred for him but I was sure of being beyond disappointed in his actions; I told him how terribly I felt betrayed and hurt and violated. I expressed my sadness in what he had done, the innocence of these exploited children, how he had so much potential to do so much good in the world and how disappointed this was the route he chose.  

Then I heard a loud knock on the door and lights outside my windows. Three officers were outside, two of whom I recognized from earlier and they asked me if David was here. I said he was, and they said they were coming to perform a wellness check because Paige had called in. I realized I had completely forgotten to text her back and let her know I was okay, bless her heart. The officers took David outside and they each asked him if they had any cause to worry about his actions tonight and he promised them they did not. I told them I was okay; that I would finish my discussion with him and if I had any issues I had them on speed dial. They nodded and left. 

David sobbed and sobbed for what felt like a millennium and I just sat and well, endured it. Tears just ran and ran and ran from him. He said he knew what he was saying was cliche; that he was sure I expected to hear this great big apology. He said if I thought he was being manipulative he could understand but assured me he was at his rock bottom and wanted me to know how horrible he felt about not only what he’d done, but what I had to go through. I just nodded. There was silence for a long time, I think by this point it was around 8 or 830 in the morning. I don’t know how long I stared at my TV screen that said “Are you still watching: Planet Earth?” but it could have been a lifetime. I had no concept of time or what to do or say or what was the right way to feel. I think David was either silent or had fallen asleep against my bed. I didn’t know or care, I was just numb. I would have probably sat like that until I died but two of my four cats descended on my bed and meowed for food. I got up, fed my little critters and cats and came back to my bed. My brain wasn’t capable of thought so I stared at my tv screen until I passed out sometime around 9. 

I didn’t sleep for long because when I woke up and checked my phone it said 11:30. David was awake and crying still. When he realized I was awake he sat up and looked at me immensely pained. I just stared at him. He started apologizing and apologizing more. He expressed his life was over, he had nobody and nothing and that I was his greatest light in life, how he never wanted to lose me. He expressed how much he cared about me and how he would do anything to win my affections back; to get me to give him a second chance. I shook my head and he sobbed, sobbed, sobbed,  apologizing non-stop. At this point I finally asked him to leave. I told him I needed space to sort out my emotions, and I needed to get some sleep.  I asked him if he would be okay. He nodded and grabbed his things. He said he would get out of my life and not contact me if that’s what I wanted him to do. I said nothing. He expressed how much he loved me and again how sorry he was, and that if there was every any chance of anything happening between us ever again that he would be there. He said I love you about ten million times and grabbed his bag and stepped out of my door.

I’ve been laying in bed since then and writing this. I just want this to be over. I just want to move on and figure out how to sort the mess that remains. Also I think I forgot to add that his court date is set for June. As far as sentencing, if he’s found guilty of possession of child pornography I believe he could be sentenced to 18 months max and a minimum sentence of 90 days.  I will post updates again if I feel  they are important; otherwise I will update again in June when he has been sentenced and let you know what charges are laid.

Thank you all again for your support, kindness, and love. I have never in my life experienced such an outpouring of generosity and compassion and I would have been so lost without some of your advice. I’ll continue working on replying to your PM’s, but in the meantime I think I’m going to try and finally get some god damned sleep.

TLDR: Filed a secondary report over the phone, provided a audio/video interview to police and they arrested David and seized his phone. He signed a promise to appear in court in June. He awaits sentencing.

ANSWER: Oh my god. You are so brave and I am so happy there are people like you in the world. You did the right thing. I’m so sorry for your heartbreak and for everything you are going through. Thank you for your strength and your courage.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My fiancé (25M) spent our entire savings (which we both were saving for our wedding and honeymoon) to buy a gaming pc. What's worse is that ever since he got the pc, he has totally ignored me (27F) he has absolutely forgotten that I even exist in his life.

My fiancé and I got engaged in December last year. In January this year, we both together decided to save money every month for our wedding and honeymoon. In 6 months, we saved around $8000. Last month, my fiancé's bestfriend bought a new gaming pc, so even my fiancé wanted to buy one, so he asked me, but I denied it because we both already had laptops. I told him that he can play games in the laptop that he already has. He repeatedly kept asking me if he could buy a pc and I finally agreed to it (now I regret it so badly).

 After a week, the pc finally came and with the pc, a new table and chair also was delivered. Apparently he had ordered a gaming chair and a table as well. That night, I asked him how much it all cost and he was a little hesitant to tell me. After a while he told me and I was distraught when I heard that he had spent our entire savings of $8000 to buy the pc. We had a very big argument that night and I scolded him for spending all our savings because that savings contained not only his money but my money as well. And we were saving it for our wedding. After everything I told him, his final reply was "I will earn it all back soon". I don't trust those words at all. 

 I thought anything worse than this couldn't happen at this moment, but it has. It has been about 2 weeks since he got the pc and since then, my finacé hasn't gotten up from his new chair. Ever since he got the pc, he hasn't even seen my face. The only time he talks to me is when he is hungry, he calls to me and tells me to get him something to eat/drink. I call him to watch TV and he denies it saying that he's busy. I call him to sleep together and he denies it and says that he'll sleep later. His sleep schedule has been fucked. He plays games the whole night and sleeps as 5am and wakes up at 2pm. He's asleep when I'm awake and he's awake when I'm asleep. From the past 2 weeks I've been so lonely that it feels like I'm alone at home and nobody to even talk to. He is ignoring me so much that I think he has absolutely forgotten that I even exist in his life. I honestly feel like his waitress now a days because from the past 2 weeks, the only interaction we both have is him asking for food and water and me giving it to him.

He has also 100% stopped doing all the house chores. From the past 2 weeks, I have been the one doing all the house chores and it's getting very hard for me to do it all alone. We used to share our responsibilities and do all the house chores together, but from the past 2 weeks, he isn't even taking care of himself. He is barely even brushing his teeth and taking a bath, let alone do the house chores. Also he is actually supposed to be working from home, but ever since the pc arrived, he hasn't even touched his laptop to work and he's isn't even seeing his phone to check if someone has called/text him anything regarding work. I'm now genuinely afraid that he might lose his job.

Everything that is happening right now is so bad, I called my parents and told them about it last night and they almost had nothing to say. I'm thinking of calling his parents tonight and telling it to them, and maybe they can knock some sense into him. I honestly don't know what else to do now. I want to burn that pc. It would be very nice if someone suggested me something about this. Thank you very much for reading this and thank you very much in advance for your comments and suggestions.

Tl;dr : My finacé spent all the money that we were saving for our wedding to buy a gaming pc and now all he does the whole day is play video games. He has totally ignored me and he has forgotten that I even exist in the house. He has also stopped doing all the house chores and has also totally ignored his work that he was supposed to do from home.

ANSWER: So. 

I game. My husband games. We are both avid gamers - him moreso than I - and he lives and breathes his computer. When I read this post out loud and he heard the amount that your (hopefully ex) fiancé blew on his computer, he asked “Does the computer suck his dick while he games? Does he shit into the chair and it power the computer for him? Even as a hardcore computer gaming enthusiast, I would have to make a considerable effort to spend even HALF of what he did. I don’t know how that’s physically possible even with top-of-the-line hardware. He either grossly overpaid, or he’s telling her that’s what was spent on the computer, but he’s lying and blew it elsewhere because of the amount of unnecessary shit that he had to buy in order to get to that number in the first place. That’s fucking insanity.”

It’s been 15 minutes and he’s still ranting about how unbelievable that amount is to spend on a computer.

If I were you, and my fiancé pulled that stunt, I would tell him to marry the computer since he’s so dedicated to it that it requires all his time and our joint wedding fund.

I’m just going to leave it at that.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I think I got reverse catfished last night

I matched with this girl on Tinder. She was significantly bigger than girls I normally date. But we have literally everything thing in common so I figured I’d give it a shot. So after talking for a few days we decided to meet up at this nerd bar last night.

I get there and pick a table. After waiting a few minutes this beautiful woman comes over and starts trying to flirt with me. That’s very strange so I assume she must be after something. Free drinks, drugs, my kidneys, I don’t know.

So I explain to her that I’m actually waiting for someone and I don’t want to give a bad first impression by chatting up some other woman when she walks in.

That’s when she springs it on me that she’s actually the one I’m waiting for. She told me how she’s lost about 130lbs over the past couple years and she wants to make sure guys are actually interested in her and not just her body.

And she was also testing me to see if I would ditch the fat girl if someone hotter showed up. So here’s the thing, I don’t know how I feel about being “tested”. I don’t want to live my life questioning every decision I make like she might jump out from around the corner at any minute.

But she’s also really attractive and very cool otherwise. I’m not sure how I should proceed.

Edit: I didn’t expect this to be downvoted so much. I guess people just prefer the standard “I just walked in on my fiancé and my father, brother, and best friend all had their penis’ inside her at the same time. Should I still go through with the wedding?”

ANSWER: When you’ve been that big for awhile people tend to only notice you for what’s on the inside. Suddenly losing weight and being valued for your outside can lead to some trust issues. Can you imagine maybe that friend she had for years suddenly trying to sleep with her because she is hot now? Or maybe being ignored at work as the fat girl and now suddenly everyone wants to hear what you have to say because it comes in a pretty package. Her outside package might have improved but she still is the same girl she was before the weight loss. She probably just wants to make sure she is valued for who she is not what she looks like.

QUESTION: Update-My(26M) brother(29M) is married to, and cheating on my best friend(26F) and I’m conflicted if I should say anything.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ivquss/my26m_brother29m_is_married_to_and_cheating_on_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)


Thanks for all the help I got in my last post. As much as it pained me to do so I decided to do the right thing. Pam should know that my brother is cheating on her. 

I decided to give Jim a chance. I called him and told him that, I can’t keep this secret. It was tearing me up inside to do so. I couldn’t think about anything else. I told him I loved him so much but I couldn’t let him do this to someone else I loved like family. He begged me to reconsider. He didn’t try to guilt me or anything. But he did say that he needs his younger brother to just be there for him. I told him I couldn’t. I asked him what he would want if it was me getting cheated on, or our little sister getting cheated. He said that he understood that it’s wrong but he was just exploring himself. I told him that thats no excuse. I told him, that he had until that evening to tell Pam, and if he didn’t I would have to. We then hung up and I just waited. 

At 11pm I called Pam and stuck up a normal conversation. I asked her how things were with my brother, she said it was all fine and that, they’re thinking about having kids. I really couldn’t believe my brother made me do this but I had to tell her. I told her that what I saw. She was livid she refused to believe me. Luckily I was able to show her the screenshot of my brother being in someone else’s bed. She then told me she needed to hang up. 

I haven’t heard anything from my brother. But as of today, Pam is leaving him. So I guess that’s good, she won’t have to be hurt by him like that, and I can be there for her. My brother hasn’t answered any of my calls or texts, so I don’t know when we’ll talk again.

At least I still have Pam and my sister I guess.

ANSWER: >At 11pm I called Pam and stuck up a normal conversation. I asked her how things were with my brother, she said it was all fine and that, they’re thinking about having kids.

Think about it this way. You not only saved Pam from an awful marriage but you potentially saved kids from being brought into a dysfunctional family, which can cause so many different problems for the child. You did the right thing.

QUESTION: My wife [27] is a flight attendant, I [27M] found lingerie and heels in her luggage

We've been married for almost 2 years now. My wife works as a flight attendant and is often doing long journeys to other countries. Her work has not slowed down during the covid quarantine as I thought it would so she is constantly working and has been tested negative several times now. 

Our anniversary was last week and she was not going to be home for it so I decided to give her a surprise card and one of a few gifts, but I was going to bury it in her luggage suitcase before she was about to leave. That is when I found new looking white lace lingerie that I have never seen before, as well as a pair of heels that I do know of because I got them for her. As soon as I saw it there was ringing in my ears and it felt like the world had come to a halt. I have been trying to come up with reasonable explanations as to why she would have it, but none of them are in character for her as far as I am aware. That's why now I am fearing the worst, infidelity. She doesn't know I saw it because I didn't leave the gift and card but she has been back home since then and gone again. I am going crazy with the thoughts of her with another man but I don't have concrete proof before accusing her. I don't know how I'd even get solid evidence. Reddit please help me on what to do now because I am in a very bad place emotionally right now

ANSWER: Part of me wants to tell you to wait until she’s back and tell her you’ll help unpack her luggage, just to see what she does or if it’s sill there/used/whatever. 

But I can only imagine the thoughts that would go through your head. Just not knowing an answer and having to live with it is too much to deal with. 

Confront her

================================================================================

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My girlfriend has been sleeping with my roommate.

Don’t know how to post a link to my original post. You can find it on my profile.

First of all, thanks to everyone. While there were some rather unpleasant responses (like the guy who called me a pussy for being upset or the woman who messaged me to say that if I couldn’t satisfy my girlfriend I should let better men do so because she deserved it) the overwhelming majority were kind and sympathetic. I couldn’t respond to most because there were so many but I assure you, you are appreciated.

I talked to my landlord who was sympathetic and offered me another apartment if I continued paying my lease. It’s an informal arrangement where I’m still legally residing and paying for my old apartment but staying in another. 

As expected, my now former friends took my old roommates side and I’ve cut them out of my life. 

I’m not doing the best I could be mentally. I’m all alone and dealing with personal insecurities, loneliness and heartbreak. Still, at least I’m out of my earlier situation. I’ve taken a week off work and arranged to see a therapist. 

All in all, my situation isn’t great but it’s unlikely to get worse and I’m working on improving it.

EDIT: I have been completely overwhelmed by the response to this. I have literally hundreds of messages of support and lots of comments urging me to stay strong. There is no possible way I can respond to all of them so I just wanted to say thank you to everyone. You’re all amazing!

ANSWER: I know you’re probably feeling a lot of sorrow and anger but don’t let it destroy you. Eventually you’ll look back on it and feel grateful that it happened. I went through a situation similar to that and couldn’t be better today. Just face your problems head on and move past them. Consider yourself liberated from somebody who doesn’t deserve you. Stay strong.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (28F) Stepsister (29F) slept with my ex-fiancé (37M) and married him. It’s been 5 years and my family think I should be over it already.

I changed some minor details for the sake of remaining anonymous. Also, sorry this is so long once I started writing I found it cathartic and couldn’t stop word vomiting all over the post. TL;DR at the bottom!

When I was 23 (now 28), I was engaged to Ryan (was 32, now 37). Our engagement ended when my stepsister Kelly (was 24, now 29) begged me to leave him because they loved each other but Ryan was too afraid to break up with because he didn’t want to hurt me/my family. When I confronted Ryan about it, he denied it, said she had been trying to come on to him for some time and he never mentioned it because he didn’t want to ruin our relationship. He begged me not to believe her and so we continued how we were. Kelly grew resentful and made nasty comments about how I was forcing a man who didn’t even love me to marry me because I had low self-esteem constantly. A month later, she sent me a video of them having sex in my bed and multiple screenshots of him telling her he loved her, how he wished she was the girl he was marrying, how he hated that I wouldn’t let them be together. I was devastated and angry, but my best friend convinced me not to go nuclear on them and instead to quietly move out when Ryan was at work the next week. So that’s what I did. I contacted my dad and my stepmom and asked them if I could move in temporarily. I removed the money I had contributed into our joint account for wedding expenses and transferred the rest to him before closing the account. Once I got settled in, I sent all of the screenshots she sent me to all of our relatives and his. 

Ryan tried to get back together with me multiple times, but I ended up blocking him when I found out he had proposed to her with the same ring he gave me (I left it behind). Now Kelly is my stepsister from my mom’s side. I have another stepsister (36) and stepbrother (38) from my mom’s second marriage and a half-sister (26). They all went to the wedding. Whenever I tried to express I was hurt by the fact they were just supporting Kelly/Ryan as though what they did to me meant nothing they would shrug it off and say they couldn’t cut them out completely because they were family. I haven’t spent a single holiday with my mom’s side since, neither has my older biological brother or sister. I only see my mom and half-sister when I invite them over to my place as Kelly/Ryan moved in with my mom and my stepdad a year after they got married. Our relationship is very rocky, but I’ve grown closer to my dad/stepmom and their children (an older stepbrother and two younger half-siblings), who have all been very supportive since this all happened, so it’s not all been bad.

On new years day my boyfriend (now husband) proposed to me. We had a small engagement party which I invited my mom and half-sister too. They never turned up because I was “excluding half of our family”. I never invited my stepdad or stepsiblings because they were pretty hurtful when it came out that Kelly/Ryan were sleeping together. They claimed it wasn’t their fault I got in the way of “true love” and made me out to be some sort of vindictive Disney villain for being angry with them. We were planning to have our wedding ceremony this summer, but in late February my husband suggested we postponed until next year because he was concerned COVID would get worse and we would have to cancel/reschedule anyway. I ended up finding out I was pregnant a month before our original wedding date, so we had a courthouse wedding on that date with the plan to hold the ceremony next year. Only my dad’s side of the family were aware of both the pregnancy and the wedding.

My stepmom likes to knit so she’s been making some stuff for the baby. Recently, she posted about the things she had made on facebook with a caption talking about how excited she was to have another grandchild soon. I was tagged in the post. I have zero issues with the post. I never told my family I wasn’t going to inform my mom’s side, it wasn’t that I intentionally hid it from her she just never seemed very interested in my life/relationship so I never brought it up.

My mom called me an hour later to demand to know if I was pregnant and how she couldn’t believe I hadn’t told her she was finally going to be a grandmother. She has since invited me and my husband over to her house multiple times, I’ve declined every single time for the obvious reason. My stepdad, who I’ve barely spoken to in 5 years has reached out to tell me how excited he is to meet the baby and my husband, same with my siblings. Even Kelly reached out to my husband to congratulate us. I was furious. 

The next time my mom and stepdad called me I finally laid into them. I told them I didn’t want them to keep inviting me over when they knew I would be forced to see Kelly/Ryan if I came, I told them how hurt and angry I still am over what they did to me and how my ‘family’ dismissed my feelings, I told them how they wouldn’t throw Kelly/Ryan away but they were so quick to leave me out to rot whilst I was going through the worst betrayal I’d ever experienced in my life, I told them I wasn’t even sure I wanted people like them in my child’s life. 

My mom was crying hysterically and kept saying I was being cruel, and I couldn’t deprive her of her first grandchild. The thing is, my baby ISN’T her first grandchild, my sister has two adopted daughters already who my mom doesn’t even try to bond with. She kept wailing about how I might be the only person in our family to even give her grandchildren (my stepsisters are both having a hard time getting/staying pregnant and my half-sister has proclaimed herself to be child free). 

My stepdad got angry and defensive. He claimed I was petty for holding onto something that happened 5 years ago. He pointed out how I had found someone else so I should understand how love works and sometimes two people just can’t help themselves. You love who you love, basically. He said Kelly/Ryan were happy together, so I should be happy for them the way they’re happy for me and my husband. The ironic thing is my sister told me Kelly/Ryan looked like they were on the verge of divorce and they argue constantly (my mom complains to her about them) and how my siblings all hate him but pretend they like him for Kelly’s sake. 

I ended up hanging up because I was so angry and when I get angry, I start crying, I didn’t want them to think they got to me. 

Since, I’ve been receiving texts and calls nonstop from my mom’s family. They’re all essentially telling me I should be over things already. It’s gotten to the point me and my husband have switched phones so he can screen my messages for me, and I don’t have to read them.

TL;DR – My stepsister slept with my ex- fiancé and married him. I’m now happily married to someone else and we’re expecting our first child together. My family thinks I should be over it already since I’ve moved on, but the anger is still there, and I have no interest in forming a relationship with my ex or my stepsister again. They’re now putting pressure on me to try and get me to forget it ever happened.  

How do I make my family understand just how unforgiveable what Kelly/Ryan have done to me is? I would prefer not to go completely no contact but is that my only option here?

ANSWER: > Just out of curiosity did you mum and stepdad have an affair? 

I'm pretty sure they did but my mom denies it whenever we've asked.

QUESTION: (Final Update) My [22f] boyfriend’s [24m] new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile

&#x200B;

Super long post incoming so apologies in advance.

I wasn't going to bother with this update but after all the support and love I received from people in this sub I feel like the least I can do in return is give some closure for anyone wanting it. Before I begin I just want to thank everyone who gave advice, I didn't respond to everyone but I read almost every response. I stopped reading my Pm's because a lot of the messages I was getting were graphic and negative but I appreciate the few of you who were positive and helpful in your messages and I'm sorry if I didn't respond to you. Now on to the update: 

It's been a crazy week and a lot has happened since our argument. My bf spent two nights at his sisters and during this time I decided to just send him a link to my reddit posts instead of writing him a letter. I felt like everything I needed to say was in those two threads and it would be good for him to read people's opinions. His sister read through them too and that started a massive argument between them that revealed some shocking information that led to my bf coming back home and completely breaking down. 

We spent the whole night talking where he revealed he's been using a lot of drugs recently and drinking a lot more to deal with his grief. He told me he feels responsible for his brothers death because while I was pushing for us to file for custody he was on the fence about the idea and now he feels his brother would still be alive if we had filed for custody over him when I first suggested it. He said because of this he's been developing a lot of feelings of resentment towards me (I don't really understand why and neither does he) which he recognises as being unjustified so he's been bottling them up along with everything else which essentially led to him flipping out when I brought up his tattoo. Obviously I knew he was having a hard time dealing with his brother's death but I must have been viewing the world through rose coloured glasses because I never would have realised how bad it was if he hadn't told me. 

I was really hoping it wouldn't be the case but unfortunately a few of you redditors were right on the mark. He regrets the tattoo and discovering I wasn't happy with it either sent him over the edge into panic mode and he tried to use it as an excuse because the very idea of regretting the tattoo or wanting to get rid of it makes him feel even guiltier. Truth is he hates the tattoo and he tries not to look at it at all. He apologised about a hundred times for reacting the way he did and for not considering he was making me look at the tattoo in general, as well as during sex. He completely understood where I was coming from when I brought it up, he just reacted the way he did because he essentially had a "mental breakdown" in his opinion. 

I apologised for my "jack off" comment. Initially he was quite shocked and did take the comment as an insult but after reading the reddit post he understood what I meant and was very forgiving. He apologised for accusing me of never caring for his brother. 

We then talked about the argument he had with his sister... 

Up until now I was under the impression that my bf went on his own to get the tattoo done, but it turns out his sister went with him to his first session and it was her who convinced him to get a portrait on his chest whereas my bf originally wanted to get a drawing of his brothers favorite stuffed animal. Not only this but during their argument it came out that his sister wanted him to get such a drastic tattoo because she was hoping it would cause a rift between us. Apparently she felt like I was tearing their family apart by trying to file for custody and she doesn't want me dating her brother anymore. 

If that sounds totally ridiculous to you, it's because it is. Not defending her actions, what she's done is absolutely deplorable, but a history of mental illness bipolar/schizophrenia does run in their family. We're certain his sister suffers from bipolar disorder as well, or possibly something else, but she refuses to be diagnosed. 

My bf didn't go around to all our friends, that was his sister lying. She was the only one he told and he's promised to set the story straight for any family members she mentions it to. We've both apologised for what we said and we're going to stay together and work through things together. 

In the short term we're going to be getting in contact with a grief counsellor and try out some of the suggestions for how to make things less awkward in the bedroom. In the long term we're going to consult a tattoo artist to see what can be done in terms of lasering it off/turning it in to something else. Bf doesn't feel comfortable lasering it off and currently his favorite idea is to get a heap more tattoos to try and make it less noticeable. I'm a fan of this idea as well. 

As for his sister, bf is currently debating whether to cut her out of his life or not. I don't think he should, I feel like he's lost enough family but I'll respect whatever decision he comes to. 

I think that just about wraps everything up. A huge thank you again to everyone for all your advice and help, it really helped me get through this horrible and awkward situation. 

I mean this in the nicest way possible when I say I hope I never have to post on this subreddit again. 

tl;dr - We both apologised for what we said in the heat of the moment. Boyfriend revealed he regrets getting the tattoo and it was his sister who convinced him to get it in the hopes it would break us up. We're seeking grief counselling and considering getting more tattoos to make the current one less noticeable.

ANSWER: I’m so glad for you guys that this worked out. Grief counselling sounds like a really positive step forward. 
Wishing you all the very best for your future, whatever your partner decides to do with his tattoo and his sister.

QUESTION: (UPDATE) My stepfather killed my mother and then killed himself. I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, I guess in some way I wanted to give you people an update on what has been going on with me. When I posted my first post, I was slightly drunk, it was the night the police showed up at my house and rang the doorbell and I was confused. All of your messages, messages from random strangers, helped me in some way. I’d like to thank whoever sent me that poem by Mary Elizabeth Frye - Do not stand at my grave and weep, we used that for the invitation to her party. And also Bianca who painted that beautiful painting of her which she sent me by email. Thank you. 

Also, fair warning, this might be quite a long post, this might trigger someone and I’ve been writing this post over several days as more information keeps trickling in and the picture of that night is becoming clearer and clearer. I think I'm also mainly writing this for myself.

What happened that night (the 22nd of July) is just still so surreal.

I'm sitting at my mothers desk right now, in her little office in our apartment that I grew up in, in Berlin. Her presence in some way is all around me. It has been 23 days since the police showed up in front of my door at 3 in the morning and asked if they could come in. Since my stepfather hung himself. Everything has been so confusing

It's all sort of a mixture between crying, screaming, yelling, throwing things, and just emptiness. I go through phases (someone linked that famous post about grief and god it's so accurate) and it's really hard to cope. Since that night I haven't ever actually been alone. This is somewhat exhausting to me in some ways but probably also very important. 

I’m going to go through the series of events and facts because I also want to set it right, since in the media (since some of you found the articles online and connected the dots) there is so much false information, it’s hard to believe. 

My Mother and my stepfather were together for 8 years and he has only been living in Berlin since then. He has children from his previous marriage, that is all I will say. I am my mothers only daughter. 

He did not call me and confess to what he did (as many report) but he called some vaguely mutual friend who he walks his dog with sometimes. This was some time after 11 PM. At this point he was already up at the summer house. It takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes to get up there. This means my mother had been dead for about 2 hours (it says so in the police report as well). 

The summer house did not belong to my stepdad, but to my mom. She poured all of the little money she had and renovated it by hand. It does not in any way belong to him. 

The police showed up at my moms and my apartment late at night, they didn’t know the address of where he might have gone and were also worried he might come and harm me since he had the keys to our apartment as well. I was watching a movie with a friend of mine. 

I posted on reddit a few hours later, the news articles started coming out the next day, connecting my stepfather to a celebrity. I posted because I needed help. 

This celebrity and my stepfather are by no means „friends“ they are acquaintances and there is no reason for him to be brought into any of this.

That was wednesday night/thursday morning. On friday I was at the LKA (criminal police) and gave a 3 hour statement about them and their relationship.

(This next part is about my feelings and mainly about my mom, feel free to skip it)

Since then my whole world has been turned upside down. My mother, the person I honestly loved most in the whole world was just torn from me. It feels like I have this big bleeding hole inside of me. I’m not crying all the time, sometimes I feel ok, but more like empty. 

My mother has been with me my whole life, the whole 21 years and I’m not just saying this because she is dead, she is honestly the best mother you could wish for. She is goofy and caring, her laugh is infectious, she has such integrity. She is the most animated person, when she tells a story she will get up from the table and gesture all around. Her eyes are so shining. I think I might show some pictures of her, because I want people to recognise her beauty. I want the whole world to know she is gone. Because this is an honest and devastating loss to the world, believe me. 

She is so talented. She got her bachelor in Art History in America, she has worked odd jobs all her life. She’s always been a hippie. When I was little she started working at this English-language summer camp in Thüringen in Germany and she used to take me there for many weeks with her, on a hill, on a farm in the middle of a giant forest. 

She’s a magician in the kitchen, she can open the fridge door and magically make something out of leftover ingredients that nobody would ever think tastes good (noodles and carrots anyone?). 

She likes to make everything herself. She would let milk go bad and make her own ricotta, I have a thousand jars of her homemade chutneys and jams. She baked her own bread years before the pandemic. She made her own vinegar, her own syrups and alcohol and her hot sauces are legendary. I used to come home and open the fridge door and I’d ask her which of the many bowls she had covered with little plates were edible, and which weren’t ready yet. 

Since she’s dead I have found so many started experiments of things I don’t even know what they are. I wish I could ask her. There are so many things I wish I had the time to ask her. Writing this is making me cry again. 

At the beginning of the pandemic, March I believe, I moved back in with her and she ordered 14 different bottles of white wine on Lidl and every night we’d drink one together while we cooked and I’d write notes on the color and the taste and we’d give it a 1-10 on the Lidl scale.

She’s one of the funniest people I know. And she is so forgiving. Even when I was younger we would get into huge blow up fights sometimes and we’d scream. But five minutes afterwards she’d come into my room and she’d apologise and tell me she loved me more than anything in the world. 

We told each other we loved one another all the time, sometimes just randomly and hug each other. I’m so so grateful for this.

I would say we had a rare mother-daughter bond. I love her with all my heart, she has always been my idol, my role-model. If I’m even half the person she is, as generous, hilarious, creative, emotional, forgiving and understanding, I will be lucky. I see her face in front of me all the time. I can hear her laugh. 

Fuck, I’d really give anything for her to be with me right now. Anything. It really tears me apart. 

If it weren’t for her, I would have probably been dead 1 1/2 years ago. She pulled me out of my dark holes, she loved me unconditionally. She isn’t just my mother, she is my best friend. And I will never ever forgive him for taking her from me. Especially since more and more facts are coming out. 

(End of emotional bit) 

It’s important to preface that I knew their relationship, or to be more exact, I was the closest to both of them together. And it’s important to understand that he wasn’t some creepy, abusive, scary bad guy. 

I loved him. He was like a best friend to me. When he came into my mothers and my life, I took him in with open arms. I’ve confided in him, I’ve told him secrets, we’ve had running jokes. We made bets with each other that I usually won and he had to pay up. He was my family. 

This makes me feel just as conned. I feel cheated. I feel like I’ve been blind. I’ve had bad fights with him as well and I knew about their fights but I didn’t see this coming, not even a little bit. 

I would never put my mother in harms way. I guess this is why she must have kept things hidden from me. 

The murder happened in his apartment (they had separate apartments) and afterwards he drove his car up to my mothers country house that they both spent every weekend at. Hunting mushrooms, planting and building things, going swimming in the lake thats right in front of the door. This was their refuge and I’m assuming this is the reason he went there. 

Since the day this has happened I’ve always assumed he blew up about something, lost control and he killed my mother while he wasn’t clear headed. This is what made sense to me. That he killed himself because he killed my mother. Because he didn’t know how to continue. 

But the more time goes by and the more facts we uncover (we being my mothers friends and I, not the police), the more it seems it was the opposite. 

That he killed my mother because he wanted to kill himself. And that he was covering something up. 

Since the night the police showed up, they’ve been asking me if I could know where their laptops are, they both had a laptop. And both are missing. They found the empty cases, but they’re gone. 

This sparked suspicion in us. His phone is gone as well, my mothers is not, the police gave it to me. Then there are the other facts. (TRIGGER WARNING) Despite what it said in the media, she didn’t have multiple stab wounds in her chest. There was only one very precise and very small wound that caused her death. He only let someone know what he did after he was up at the house. When he arrived at the cabin, he apparently parked normally, even greeted one of the neighbours.

The pieces are falling into place. That this was cold blooded.

I don’t really know why I’m writing all this down in a word document and why I’m going to post it on reddit, but I need to share. 

I feel so much hatred and so much anger. I feel it boiling underneath my skin and it keeps threatening to come out. I’ve smashed so much stuff, I’ve gotten so angry. Sometimes I snap and I scream at people and other times I just cry and beat my pillows. And sometimes I’m very calm. I can still feel joy. And my mother has this amazing circle of friends that I’ve known my whole life and who are supporting me. I saw her body in the coffin and I will never be able to get that image out of my head. She was so tiny, it breaks my heart. 

I’ve also slept two nights at the cabin and in the dark every shadow looked like my stepfather. I’ve become scared and started locking my doors at night. Murder used to seem something so far off, something that happened to other people, in a different world, separate from mine. But now it’s not. And I won’t let him spoil her place, her house. I won’t let him take that away from her and from me. I refuse. 

I just miss her. I miss everything about her. It hasn’t been that long yet and all I want is for her to hug me and say my name and say she loves me and that she thinks I’m an amazing young woman. I want her to cuddle with me in bed which she did for so many years until I felt myself too old. 

I want to sit at the kitchen table in the morning with her and have her ask me what I dreamt about last night and have both of us talk about our dreams. For her to talk with me about my story ideas and my poetry and to talk with her about the book that she was writing and will never finish. 

It just hurts so much, I don’t know how to ever get past this. She has always been the most amazing person I know and I can’t get over this. I don’t know how to get over this. I feel lost. I feel like I have to grow up very fast now and carry her with me. 

Theres so much more to tell. So much. But I should probably stop somewhere. I would appreciate all advice. 

Thank you for reading.

ANSWER: Hello again. I [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hw6zxn/i_dont_really_know_what_to_say_the_police_just/fyy4wjl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) on the original post because I went through something so similar. 

I want to thank you for the update; it couldn’t have been easy to write. But more than that, I’m glad to see you on Reddit just to know you’re still around. 

The part of this post that most struck me was you spending time in the cabin. I remember the days in my father’s house after his murders and suicide so vividly, and looking back on it, I wish I hadn’t gone there at all. Which leads me to this: you don’t have to do things the hard way. You don’t have to make things harder on yourself. When grief as raw and shocking as what you’ve experienced takes over, we sometimes want to swim in it because at least feeling something is better than remaining numb, feeling hollow. But I want to lovingly and gently encourage you to make sure you’re taking care of yourself. 

I also want to reiterate how useful a trauma-informed therapist can be. I was dead-set against therapy after my father’s crimes happened. I thought I could handle everything on my own. After all, I’d always been the “strong” one. I waited a year to find a counselor, and if I could change a single thing I did, it would be that—I’d have sought out help sooner. I didn’t really know how to ask for help at the time—it took me years to learn how—but it would’ve been immeasurably useful to have someone help me through all of that. 

Like you, I was in my 20s when my father killed his girlfriend, her daughter, then himself. That was sixteen years ago. There is a life on the other side of all of this trauma and heartbreak. I promise. And the book I just finished writing about it was finally handed in on the last day of July. Maybe someday it can help you (and others). 

I have thought of you many times since your first post. My offer to reach out at anytime stands. Any. Time.

Edited to add: quite a few people asked about the book in this thread and via DM. It’s with my agent now, so at earliest it would be out in a year (books take forever). The title is We Run To Crush The Grass. Thank you for the interest, but please focus on OP. She needs the love and kindness of strangers.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My best friend wants me to work with my rapist on her wedding

OG post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hxyq72/my_best_friend_wants_me_to_work_with_my_rapist_on/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share 


First of all, thank you so much for the support on my first post. I did not expect it to gain that much attention. I guess a lot happened since then? I don't know if it's even been a week yet. But this is going to change my life, perhaps for the better.

There were hundreds of comments, and I'd thought I'd address a few questions regarding the rape itself. I don't appreciate how some of these were asked, but I'll share anyway for the sake of clarifying things.

1. Was I under the influence? Yes, but I remember vividly saying no. I was drunk enough to have all my strength and mobility wonky but I didn't black out or anything. The force he used on me didn't seem that of someone who was drunk, he looked completely sober, but I could be wrong. I remember a couple of times when I was trying to lift myself off the bed and he would push me back down, I remember the expression on his face. Like you guys said, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.That's all I'm willing to share for now, the only person who knows all the details is Tina. Is it bad that I wish she knew nothing now? Maybe it would hurt less.

2. Why didn't I report it? Because I saw how that turned out for other girls I knew. I've had a few other friends (not Tina) who have had the same thing happen to them and nothing came out of reporting it, and it made them feel worse. Just the few comments calling me a liar stung, so I can't imagine how I would have felt back as my unstable teen self. Not only that, I was scared of what Rod would do if he found out I had reported him. There was just something about him that made me never want to cross him.

Reading all your comments, it seems pretty clear that how Tina was treating me was extremely inconsiderate and I should find a new friend. Although it was a huge slap in the face, I came to my senses and believed that I couldn't be around someone who would do that to me. Some of you said to expose them during vows, but that's just not the kind of person I am, and it might not turn out well. A few of you gave me example texts I could send which I am extremely thankful for, but I decided to send this.

"I've had time to think about it, and I just can't be your maid of honor anymore. It's so hurtful that you are telling me to pack up my trauma for who knows how long until your wedding day.I just can't do it. I don't think I will come at all knowing that he's going to be there. I'm sorry."

It's pretty weak, but it's probably the "meanest" text I've ever sent. An hour later, I get a call from Josh. He asked me what was going on with me and Tina, and that she was extremely upset. A part of me snapped and I said "I don't know, what's going on with you making someone who raped me best man?" I don't usually blurt things out like that. He was confused and I repeated myself. He was silent for a few seconds and then asked if he could come over. I was a little wary of the idea but I said sure.(I know, we should be social distancing but this really needed to be discussed.)

He comes to my apartment 40 minutes later without Tina. I have never hung out with Josh one on one before, it was always with Tina. Josh always had a really cute and sweet personality, and I've always approved of him when it came to dating her. He was really only a friendly acquaintance to me though.

We sat down and spoke for over an hour.

Tina had told Josh that the reason I wasn't coming to the wedding was that I didn't want to work with Rod...BECAUSE I HAD A CRUSH ON HIM...and thought she was forcing the relationship too much. So basically, she said we had a petty girl fight. My jaw hit the floor and I was fuming. She had obviously never told Josh what Rod did to me. I shared that Rod had raped me back in high school, and that Tina knew about it. I asked if he knew too.

He said he didn't, but at one point Rod did mention that a few "crazy bitches" falsely accused him of rape senior year. This obviously didn't include me, since I only told Tina and a few family members.. Josh believed him at the time, but I guess after hearing ME say it it's starting to dawn on him that his friend was a liar.

Here's something that I didn't expect...Josh shared with me that he was raped when he was a kid by an older brother of a friend he had. He said that if he was forced to work with said brother on a wedding, he would absolutely refuse. He apologized heavily on behalf of Tina, but I won't forgive unless she says it herself. 

I know some of you may think Josh is lying, but I believe him. 

I could see it by Josh's face and body language that the realization really weighed down on him, and I felt bad. In a way, we were both going through a betrayal. I asked if he was ok to go home, and he said yes. He thanked me for telling him and left. I don't know if I'll stay in touch with him, but I was beyond furious with Tina at this point. 

I was expecting an angry text coming from her, and sure enough, I got it at like midnight. She went off saying that I'm gonna end up destroying their marriage, how could I do that to her, etc etc. I just pressed the block button and went to bed. Quickest decision ever made.

I'm feeling a little down in the dumps right now, yet slightly relieved. I'm going to try to connect with other friends and try to move on from this. If I'm feeling brave enough, I might try to find these "crazy bitches" and see if we can make a case against Rod. Knowing that there are other victims makes me feel so guilty I want to scream. Sorry it's not too happy of an ending, but I think it might have been more unhappy if I decided to go along with it. Thank you Reddit.

ANSWER: this is a somewhat wonderful update.

while disappointed to see your "friend" (tina) failing at being a friend, it brings me great pleasure to see josh is a great human being and you are no longer working with this scumbag named rod.

you just saved yourself a lot of headache and emotional pain and probably saved josh from a horrible person. win win really.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (14M) hit my (16F) cousin and now my family is upset and no one but my dad believe me.

I know based off the title in being judged extra hard. I don't condone hitting a womann and if i could go back I would. What's done is done and now my family is in turmoil.

So my aunty and uncle came to my house to talk to my parents. I though this was stupid because of Covid but they went ahead and came anyway. They brought my cousin who we will call Carly.

Me and Carly get along fine but yesterday we did not. We started to argue about about a game system. It was a stupid argument of who got the good controller and bad controller. Everything went down hill when I would not give her the good one (It's my system).

She tried to take the remote from me, but in the process slapped me across the face with her nails. I started bleeding so I got up and walked to the bathroom. I don't know if she had an adrenalin rush, but all I here is "MY NAILS!". She grabs me and punched me in the face. In the heat of the moment, I punched her in the stomach and she fell over screaming.

Her dad comes up the stairs and without asking any questions b-lines towards me. He grabs me, then my dad came and grabbed him before he could hit me. Him and my dad were yelling pretty bad. My mom and aunty are talking to my cousin.

My dad tells them to get out of his house. As of right now I have gotten text messages and phone calls from my family calling me a woman beater. My dad is the only person to believe me. My mom is saying she believes me, but is acting cold.

How do I fix this and stop my family from braking down even more? I blocked my cousin and her parents, but I don't know what to do know. I also feel like my uncle really wants to fight me.

Edit: I changed female to woman

ANSWER: I say this as a mom of daughters you absolutely have the right to defend yourself. Girls don't get a free pass to just punch you in the face and beat on you because you're a boy. Had you really beat her up it would be a different conversation maybe but you met her force with equal force. You didn't start the physical altercation but you should not just be expected to take it. A man should never hit a woman, but a woman should also never hit a man.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (18F) found out that my mom (42F) has been lying about why my dad (45M) "abandoned" me 15 years ago. I don't know how to move forward.

For most of my life I was just raised by my mother, since my father left us when I was 3, and we are very close. My mom has always been vague about the details of the divorce, just that it was very painful and sudden, and that he never had interest in getting custody of me. 

A couple months ago I was going through documents looking for my birth certificate, and I came across their divorce papers. Surprisingly, my mom was listed as the one who filed for divorce, contradicting her story that he left us. I figured there must have been a reason for this, like him being abusive, but I know that my mom is sensitive about the topic so I didn't want to bring it up. I asked my aunt, her sister, but I was just told to drop it. 

It's been bugging me, so I found him on Facebook. His profile was completely private, but his profile picture showed him with a little boy, who must be my brother. I found his business email online, and against my better judgement I emailed him asking if he would like to meet for coffee. He agreed. 

Last week we met, and he was completely not what I was expecting. He was THRILLED to see me, almost cried, and wanted to hear everything I had been up to for the past 15 years. I asked why he left, and that's when I got his side of the story:

Towards the end of their marriage, my father confessed to my mom that he is bisexual, and that during high school and college he had a serious boyfriend. He was ashamed of his sexuality, which was why he hid it from my more traditional mom. My mom was angry, but didn't divorce him because of it. After the divorce he began dating his boyfriend again, and my mom freaked out over me being "exposed" to this. My mom petitioned for full custody, and was granted it. Over the years my father has attempted to reach out to my mom about me, but she has never budged. 

I asked my mom about what really happened, no bullshit. I told her dad's side of the story, and she tearfully admitted that it was true. She insists it was not out of anger or bigotry, but because she genuinely believed that it was best for me to stay with her. 

I am just so shocked still. She lied to me for years, making me think my own father did not want me. My dad and I are reconnecting now, but I have missed so much. Next week I am going to meet his husband and my 7 year old brother. I live with my mom, but I can't speak to her right now. She is begging me to forgive her, but I'm so angry and I don't know how I'll ever not be angry with her.

ANSWER: I’ve never been in your situation, but one thing I’d suggest, given such a big event happening to you, is to give yourself time and allow yourself to not to have to make any decisions for a while

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (25M) girlfriend (24F) did not appreciate my reaction to seeing her naked.

There is currently this trend on the tiktok app of girls surprising their man by walking into the room naked, and filming their reaction. I've seen these videos before and normally the reaction is the man gets a smile on his face and they obviously get it on.  It's cheesy, romantic, funny, whatever.

My girlfriend is working from home during the pandemic and I work in the hospital. I got home from a 12 hour shift of potentially being exposed to covid-19, and just wanted some beers and to go to bed. I guess my girlfriend thought she would get the same reaction when i walked in the door and saw her naked. 

I barely had enough energy left to give any reaction let alone a good one. I basically just told her i appreciated the gesture but i was exhausted. She got moody at me basically comparing all these other tiktoks where the man gets excited to see their girl naked. I told her all these tiktoks have men working from home, not walking in the door after a 12 hour shift in a hospital during a pandemic. She then took this as an insult at the fact that she's currently working from home, when this wasn't my intention at all.

Since this happened a couple of days ago, she's acting like i don't find her sexy at all and giving my sarcastic answers. What do I even say to her?

ANSWER: I’m a pretty insecure person so I can understand why she feels upset because she’s feeling rejected. 

However, my boyfriend also works as a paramedic for 12 hr shifts too and I know better than to try to get affectionate or do silly things like this right when he gets home from work. Because same as you, he has to do his whole shower, decontamination process and is probably starving and exhausted. Even before covid, this was a thing. 

I think there’s a middle ground here where you let her know you certainly didn’t mean to make her feel rejected and that you think she’s beautiful, but she has to “read the room” and realize that when you get home from work you’re not going to have the ideal enthusiasm that she’s obviously looking for. She needs to learn to cut you a little slack and realize you’re not an object that needs to give her attention whenever she feels it’s the right time without any thought to how you feel. I think you guys can have a respectful conversation that provides some reassurance but also lets her know she needs to adjust her expectations a little bit because you’re only human.

Wishing you luck and thanking you for everything you’re doing, seriously. Take care of yourself.

Edit to add - I think it’s also okay to let her know it’s okay for her to feel rejected, but it’s what she does with those feelings that matter. The second you tell her you appreciate the gesture but you’re exhausted, she needs to learn to have a little bit of empathy and let that guide her reaction other than her knee jerk insecure habits. Sometimes if a person is feeling insecure they take every little innocuous action from their partner as a sign that the belief they have about themselves (that they’re not good enough) is true.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Boyfriend won’t stop telling me I have B.O.

I have been with my boyfriend for over a year and everything has been great except for one thing. 
Every single day, at least once, he will tell me that I stink and smell of b.o. 

When we met I showered every day, applied regular deodorant in the morning, brushed my teeth three times a day. Now I am so paranoid about smelling bad that I shower at least twice a day, I apply new industrial strength deodorant every few hours (I have a reminder on my phone), perfume,  and I brush my teeth anytime I eat or drink something that isn’t water. 

I feel like I’m going crazy. I didn’t think I smelled bad in the beginning and I don’t think I smell bad now but I obviously smell bad to him right? Im that weirdo that keeps “sneakily” smelling their own armpits. I have been to the doctor and he has said there is nothing medically wrong. It has honestly gotten to the point where I literally shove my arm pit in friends and families faces asking if I smell bad, they all say I don’t smell like b.o. at all, one friend even said I smelled too clean like a lush store. 

I am getting so paranoid. He won’t cuddle or anything when he says I smell. I really don’t know what more I can do?

Update  - so unexpected edit. I waited for him to make a comment this morning so I could talk to him. It was less than an hour after waking up that he said “god you stink” I had already showered and put on deodorant. 
I snapped and asked what exactly was he smelling because, at this point I’m one of the cleanest people on the planet and if I still smell bad to him then we should just break up. 

He got all  panicked and upset, I eventually got out of him that this is what he father always said to his mother. Apparently his father told him that is was a sure fire technique to have a woman never leave you because “she will feel too low to cheat, will love only you, and will always be clean”.

Needless to say, his father is wrong. He’s packing his things and moving out of my house today.

ANSWER: Holy shit, that update. His father basically groomed him to be an emotional abuser. So glad you ended that; hopefully he learns from this.

Edit: clarity

================================================================================

QUESTION: My(20f) boyfriend (22m) assumed I was into rough sex because of my race and now I feel unsure about us

My boyfriend and I was going to have sex with each other (it was supposed to be my first time but not his)
Things started off normal, kissing. Then he started pushing me on the bed and holding me down, no foreplay or anything. I was obviously shocked and scared because I didn't expect that. I was screaming stop and no and he stopped. He looked confused and asked what was wrong. I told him like wtf, I thought we were gonna go slow. He was still giving me a confused looks and at that point, I was annoyed. I reminded him I was a virgin so I would prefer to take things slow. He said he knows that but he thought I'd like it rough. He also told me he's never been with a black girl before and he thought black girls like rough sex. I was mad and I said no, I'm not ok with rough sex and I was mad he used a stereotype on me. I didn't want to have sex anymore and I asked if he could just leave me alone so he left. 

I'm just so confused like how is this even real. I've never even heard of that as a stereotype. Idk if it's a porn thing or not (I don't watch porn, just not into it) but even if that's a thing, I'm mad he just assumed things about me. He knows I'm a virgin but he still was rough with me. I'm unsure now bc idk what else stereotypes he has about me bc I'm black.

Edit: he's blowing up my phone asking me if we can talk about things and saying sorry. I feel bad for not responding but I keep thinking what else he thinks about me. I feel empty inside because he turned into another person when he got rough. He went from sweet to cold and scary. I think once I'm calm, I will talk to him.

Edit: all of these messages have been overwhelming. I'm going to call him now and hear what he has to say. I will update after. Thanks for the advice, this has been very helpful.

Okay last update cus I can't make a new post and this is getting really cluttered with replies.
 

So we talked for a while. I'm done with him. I read the comments and I decided to hear him out, I gave him the benefit of the doubt that he didn't mean to hurt me. He told me he thought black girls like it rough bc his friends girlfriend like that (she's black) and the porn he watches. I tried explaining how that's racist to think that and consent. He said he was sorry for rushing into it but he was raised in a racist community so 'give him a break'.

 I tried explaining that's not an excuse to act out his fetishes on me especially without asking. He got mad at me and I was too. We argued and then I broke up with him.  I am really upset rn, I thought he loved me but I guess not. All I wanted was to share a special moment with him and he ruined it. I told my friend and she said to give him another chance but I disagree. What he did was too weird and creepy for me to forgive him. Anyways thanks for all the advice, I should have just broke up with him immediately but oh well, too late now.

ANSWER: You have a ton of answers but also, I just want to say I'm proud of you. When I lost my virginity at 17, I wasn't as confident and assured as you are now. You knew how to communicate and you knew how to shut things down. That is a hard fucking skill and I am proud of you for exercising it.

QUESTION: [Update] I walked in on my son having sex with my brother's wife

Original post
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqhhan/i_walked_in_on_my_son_haveng_sex_with_my_brothers/?utm_source=reddit-android

On mobile 

I first want to thank everyone for all the advice I got from my original post, im sorry for not replying to any comments, (I think I only replied to one comment) my head was all over the place. I'll try to keep this update short.

As was suggested by many of the comments I decided to tell my husband first and proceed from there, my husband lost it(he first thaught it was a joke). We talked about the issue and we decided we should first talk to our son before telling my brother.

We confronted our son with what I saw, he already knew what was going on as he saw my reddit post and put 2 and 2 together, he didn't deny anything he confessed, he told us him and SIL have been having sex since February last year( he was 17 at the time). My son said it started on SIL's birthday  party he attended they got drunk and had sex in a bathroom and they have been meeting at hotels ever since and sneaking off at family gatherings.

After my son's confession my husband just lost it and told my son to leave the house and go and to our condo in town as he didn't want to see him in front of him at this moment. When my son was gone my husband stormed into my brother's room and told my brother everything( SIL was not in the house at that moment).

My brother lost it and packed his stuff took the kids and left, he asked where my son had gone he said he wanted to teach him lesson, we didn't tell him and he eventually left. SIL didn't return I think my brother might have called her or my son warned her and she is afraid to come back(her things are still in the house).

In all the screaming and shouting my daughter's heard everything and are devastated that their family might be ruined they miss their brother and are afraid my husband won't ever let him in the house again.( my husband hates all forms of infidelity to the core and has always drilled this in our 2 eldest children that they must never cheat on anyone or be in a relationship with someone in a relationship)

 I know I did nothing wrong in this but how will I ever look my brother in the eye again, he won't answer and calls or text my husband said i should give him time to heal. My son has left the condo because he is afraid of what my brother will do to him and is now hiding at a friend's and he won't tell us which friend. No word on SIL.

INFO: SIL was the one who initiated sex the first time my son and her slept together, she was the one booking hotel rooms, buying my son dinners and lunches, my son was even receiving an allowance from her.

ANSWER: The fact that your son won't tell you where he's at and nobody knows where your SIL is, has me thinking that they may be together.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Should I (48m) tell my wife (44f) that I received a sex tape of her in the mail?

Throwaway.

This is an odd thing. Wife and I have been married 20 years. I’ve never suspected her of cheating and our sex life has been outstanding.

First of the year, I receive a package in the mail. It’s a DVD addressed to me, and a typed note that says “your eyes only”. It’s my wife having sex , separately, with three guys. She was younger, much younger, based on body and appearance and hair style it was around the time we were going out—either before, during, or after we were engaged (she grew her hair longer for the wedding and kept it that way).

First I’ve no idea who sent it to me other than one of those three guys in the DVD - none of which I know. I’m assuming it’s one of my wife’s ex. Second I’ve know idea why they sent it. Are they trying to say she was screwing around on me? The tape isn’t time stamped so I don’t have a frame of reference. She kept her hair short for years until we were engaged so it could have been during a block of time, certainly before we dated. 

And also what are they trying to achieve if this was taken before we dated? I know my wife had other partners. Hell I had three times the partners she did before we married but that was 20 years ago I think we’re past that. But apparently this person or persons isn’t.

The whole thing is strange. I’m not sure what’s going on. I haven’t told my wife, I’m not sure how she would take it. She’s very sexual and adventurous but I don’t think she’d like the idea of her past catching up to her. But I don’t think I’ll get to the bottom of this unless I tell her.

EDIT - update. I’m overwhelmed by the responses. Thank you for your interest.

I did speak to my wife yesterday afternoon. Some mentioned letting her watch it in private and I gave her that option. She did and we talked at length. Some of it is a bit clearer now.

The two “amateur” looking videos are two roommates, taken on the same night. That’s why the camera doesn’t move and that’s why the room is the same.  I asked why the bed looks different and she replied the sheets were a bit messy so they changed them before they had another go. 

The other is a boyfriend she dated when her and I met, before we actually started dating. She knows this man is friends with one of the before mentioned roommates and thinks it’s him who got the three videos together and sent them to us. 

Why?

She admits that last summer he tried connecting with her on Facebook. When she did he tried to make it sexual again so she stopped. She thinks he sent the DVD to cause an issue with us.

For the first time I now have doubts. Her answers are logical but seem a bit off to me. And honestly I may be just upset that she did two guys in one night - I know it was 20 years ago but that’s still hard to take call me shallow if you want. Also she didn’t seem shaken by the DVD or the fact I had it, merely irritated that this person sent it. I had the idea she’d rather I didn’t have it but now that I did, oh well. 

It still leaves many questions unanswered, such as why the tapes are from 96-97 and the DVD was made in 2013 but I’m just getting it now? That many be minor but it may be everything. Plus how does this gentleman know where I live - Facebook doesn’t give you that information. Being in contact with someone does so now you see why I have doubts.

Thanks to you all for your concern and feedback. I love my wife and cherish her, and her past is her past, but for some reason it’s slapping us in the face right now. I will take some time between the two of us to figure out what is truly going on. 

EDIT II - I want to clarify something. I’ve been getting a lot of feedback, mostly negative, where everyone is irritated with me that I’m upset with my wife for being with two men in the same night. None of my business, it was 20 years ago I should man up, that sort of thing.

Look, i said it was hard to take. Most men understand their partner was with different people before them. But SEEING their spouse with two men on the same night is hard to handle. I didn’t say I was changing my view of her, or leaving, or any other angst you want to put on me. It’s just a difficult thing for a married man to see and realize. I’ll get past it , but it’s not an easy thing. And for everyone who says “it was 20 years ago lighten up” I challenge you to sit back, grab a beer and watch two young men have intercourse with your wife on the same night and see how you feel about it. Frustrated at best. You won’t love her less but you’ll not feel great afterwards trust me. So thanks for everyone calling me an asshole but until your in that position I’ll ignore you thank you very much .

FINAL EDIT - this will be my final edit. Thank you all for your support but all I will say is, it’s time for me to make some decisions. I hacked into my wife’s Facebook account - childish and immature I’ll admit but I did it nonetheless. And I found things disturbing enough that I need to think long and hard about what I do next. I’ve given her the benefit of the doubt through this entire thing , now a shadow had been cast and I’m questioning her more than ever before. Heartbroken is putting it mildly. It’s time for me to work on my life and my self. Thanks to everyone and their interest .

ANSWER: definitely tell her! if her past is coming to catch up with her, she should be aware of it. also, youll never know what really happened until you ask.

He hasn’t put up a fight regarding any of those and has agreed to it. 

It’s been really hard into swallow all of this and I’m looking for a lawyer now to help with the divorce. My mother has also suggested to keep the real reasoning of our divorce away from our children as long as possible, especially my eldest daughter (14).

================================================================================

QUESTION: UPDATE TO: I found out I have a daughter who thinks I was her mother's rapist. It wasn't rape. What next?

Ten days ago I requested advice and the post got removed after a day because I didn't use a ThrowRA.  I'm reposting it below, along with an update, since some people asked for one. I alerted the moderators I would be doing this, so hopefully it will allowed.

ORIGINAL

I received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a DNA match and she is my biological daughter. It was a long and emotionally charged letter. She said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish I had caused her and her mother and grandparents. The letter was gut wrenching.

I was shocked but also skeptical. I have been married 25 years and I have three great kids. I have never raped or abused a woman ever! I thought this had to be a prank or scam. I had done home DNA ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child I wasn't aware of. But when I logged into my account, there she was.

I did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, Terry (fake name), I had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  We broke it off mutually and remained friendly. The very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. It was a casual hookup and I remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. Also unprotected. Afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. We both went home the next morning for summer break. Terry didn't come back to college the next year, which I gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. 

One of the reasons Terry and I were incompatible was religion. She was Catholic and I'm Jewish. I was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. My supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a Jewish ex-boyfriend. But who knows, maybe she had other reasons. 

It kills me that I have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. I can't imagine growing up thinking I was a product of rape. That has to be so hard psychologically. I am in pain for a child I didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.

I have been debating what to do. I have not written back to my daughter. I badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). My wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. My best friend says I should hire a lawyer. I don't know what to do and it's eating me up. Advice, please!

UPDATE

I hired a lawyer. He recommended that I respond to my daughter's email to unequivocally deny the rape allegation. I wrote her a short message and described how and when Terry and I met. I was careful not to attack Terry and to offer sympathy. I explained that our sex was consensual. A week went by with no response.

Two days ago my daughter wrote me and said Terry now claims she was raped a month after she and I had sex, and that she was told by her doctors that the baby was born premature 8 months later. She's basically saying she was misled by her doctors. I find that very hard to believe, but if it's true it is awful and if it's not I guess it gives Terry a way out without exposing her big lie which is maybe best for everyone.

Yesterday I spoke to my daughter for the first time. She was crying and so was I, so it wasn't easy to say much. Before we hung up, I told her that I loved her because she's my flesh and blood, and I hoped we could get to know each other and meet my grandchild. She sobbed so much after that, and said she's been waiting her whole life to hear those words.

My wife and I told our kids about a week ago. They are teenagers and took it really well. All three are interested in meeting their new sister and niece. My wife....my beautiful, caring, bestest friend ever....she's been nothing but supportive. She has offered that we invite my daughter and granddaughter to visit over the Christmas holidays, even suggesting we pay the airfare and offer them our guest room. My daughter is going to call me again tonight and I'm going to propose she come, or offer to fly to her if she's more comfortable. We have a lifetime of catching up to do.

Meantime as for Terry, I feel like my daughter and I were robbed, but I really don't want to dwell on it. She hasn't reached out to me and I don't plan to either, though I'm prepared to be cordial if she does, and to listen to her story and be open minded.


EDIT:  I'm overwhelmed by all the love coming at me from Reddit. Thank you all for your support, compliments and helpful opinions. Really, really.
I promise I will post an update!
Silver and Gold! Feels like I'm Burl Ives. Thanks, kind strangers.

ANSWER: Well damn. All I can say is that I am so glad that you have a wife and four kids who are so open minded. This is a situation that seems like something straight out of a movie, and I cannot imagine the kind of stress and anxiety and sadness and everything you have been feeling as a result of it. I'm really pleased to hear that things are turning out well with those who matter the most: your spouse and your children, despite the awful lies of another person. I wish you all the best!

================================================================================

QUESTION: Terrified that my (25F) husband (28M) has been having sex with me while I'm asleep. Now I'm pregnant.

For some  context, I have a serious medical condition that requires some pretty heavy medication. It does a lot of things, including destroy my sex drive, and knock me out for long periods of time. My husband and I were married before I was diagnosed, and he's supported my through diagnosis and treatment. He's a wonderful man.

We used to have a very active sex life, and it has been a considerable strain on our marriage that I never feel in the mood. I feel like a terrible wife in this regard, and I miss being able to do what we both enjoy.

To be clear, when I take my medication, I am dead to the world. You could blast a fire alarm next to me, and I wouldn't wake up. You could pick me up and toss me around, and I might not wake up.

Lately I've felt worse than normal. Really sick, dizzy, uncomfortable ect. I went to my doctor, scared I might be sick with COVID, and it turns out I'm pregnant. 5 weeks.  But I haven't had sex with my husband in at least two months. Maybe more. I did not cheat on him. I was not assaulted by anyone, anywhere, that I know of. This was not immaculate conception.

I told my husband and he was surprised. It's probably a million in one chance I got pregnant, due to the medication I'm on, and my condition. He was shocked, then excited, and I was just so relieved he didn't accuse me of cheating that I didn't stop to consider why he didn't.

It's been a few days. I've been thinking about when I first started taking my medication. It was hard for him to adjust to me not wanting to have sex, and he used to joke that I could just lay there and watch tv while we do it. Or, and here's what makes me scared, he used to joke that he could just have sex with me while I'm sleeping, and that way I don't have to deal with it, and he can be satisfied. He's mentioned this a couple of times, but always lets it drop when I'm not okay with it.

I've started thinking about all the times I woke up in the morning and had uncomfortable pelvic pressure that usually only comes for me after I have sex--my husband likes to be rough and I don't really mind, we were always pretty wild in bed or adventurous. Or bruises I've had that I can't explain.

I confronted my husband about this. About me being scared he did this to me, and at the least why he wasn't surprised the dates don't match up. He was angry I would accuse him of something so horrible, and insists that I'm just misremembering the last time we had sex. The medication does play with my memory sometimes, but I remember the last time we had sex. I remember every time we have sex now because I don't enjoy it.

I don't want to panic. I don't want to talk myself into being convinced he's been having sex with me while I'm asleep, and I don't want to talk myself out of this possibility just to protect our marriage. But I'm terrified. This is the only possibility I can come up with. And if it's true, I don't know what to do. I've been heartbroken for a while over the idea that I wouldn't be able to have kids. Now I'm going to have a baby and I'm so, so happy. But what if this baby happened because of what my husband did?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I think my husband has been having sex with me while I'm asleep because of my low sex drive, and now we have a miracle baby that may be a byproduct of it.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I just wanna say the response to this has been insane. Thank you so much to everyone. I'm really lost and I don't know what to think or do. I'm going to take some time to think about this, get additional information and resources depending on however this is going to go, and figure it out.  Just to be clear, however, because there are too many responses to answer directly, NO, I have never given permission for my husband to have sex with me while I'm sleeping. YES, I have asked him if I have ever instigated something while asleep, sleep walked, sleep spoke, or did anything in my sleep related to sex, and he answered no we have NEVER had sex outside of a time when I was fully cognizant and aware of what's happening. And YES, I am keeping the baby regardless of what happened. If people are interested, I'll post an update when there is something to write. Again, thank you, thank you for all the support and opinions. They all matter.

ANSWER: Have you had a dating ultrasound yet? The first appointments generally use your last period date along with general ovulation dates to determine how far along you are, and then they will do an ultrasound to see what stage the fetal growth is at to confirm.

Because 5 weeks and 7-8 weeks (with your estimate of 2 months), I just wonder if perhaps you're a little further along? I don't want you to doubt yourself,  but a couple weeks is not a lot to be off by... 

I also would talk to your dr to figure out your memory lapses, because sex a week or two later and remembering it a little off could be possible.

But listen to your gut, you know you and you know your husband. Cover all of your bases until you feel safe.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] My [24M] girlfriend [21F] keeps threatening to kill herself if we break up.

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hitc7k/my_24m_girlfriend_21f_keeps_threatening_to_kill/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Some of you guys have been asking for an update in my messages so I figured I might as well make a post, although it's probably not the „happy“ ending most of you were hoping for.

It's been about a month since my original post and pretty much all of you told me to break up and not to worry about her doing that. I wanted to do it. And I tried.. but it was just the same thing all over again. She started to cry, she kept calling and leaving crying voice mails that she's gonna do it. I just didn't know what to do. So I told her that we can stay together... but I'm just so broken.

She was always being mean to me and she always bullied me, at least for the last 2 years or so. She calls me ugly, makes fun of me and always tries to humiliate me. I was used to do that and I just kind of took it as it were. That I can't do anything about it.

But lately she started hitting me. Now, I'm 6'3" and she's 4'11" so it's not that it's painful physically, but it just hurts emotionally so much. Whenever we get into an argument she punches me in the face. Or in the stomach. I'm just broken and lost. I've lost all my confidence, I lost all my friends because she didn't like any of them. And it just sucks.

I just accepted that this is how my life is and it's probably not gonna change. I'm so sorry for disappointing everyone who believed that I can do it.

I'm sorry.

Also, I'm not from the United States. The Police won't assist me in the break up, they don't have any 72hr psych and they told me that they can't do anything unless she actually tries to kill herself. 

EDIT: I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna drive to see her tomorrow, take my parents with me as support and I'm gonna end it. I just can't anymore. Thank you guys.

ANSWER: You need to leave without her knowing or set yourself a time limit and block her number, because you are actually in an abusive relationship.

I am 1 year free of mine now, he would always threaten to kill him self. It was unbearable thinking he might do it, one night I came home and there was a shotgun on the shoe rack.

One day I couldn’t take it any more, I jumped up without a word and just started packing and didn’t stop. The entire time he screamed, cried and hurled abuse at me, even threatened to kill ME then himself.

I just kept going, my heart was in my mouth and I was shaking the entire time but I didn’t say a WORD. I didn’t even look at him, just kept packing my overnight suitcase. 

I ran out of the house, called a taxi, jumped in and never looked back. I blocked his number when I reached my destination and had about 70 messages, all the same bullshit. Don’t get me wrong, he did try to contact me for about 6 months, but each time I just blocked and blocked again without even reading the messages. Now, I hear nothing from him. I know he’s not dead as I would have heard by now.

I’m not saying there isn’t a possibility that your girlfriend isn’t serious, but I AM saying that it is 100% not your problem and 100% not your responsibility.

When you get into a relationship with someone you sign a verbal and spiritual contract. You agree to be respectful, to be courteous and to care for that person. You are a team and you are equals, and you should never deliberately hurt that person. 
If you do deliberately hurt that person you’ve broken the contract and essentially forfeit the right to be in that persons life, yes they may forgive you but they are under no obligation to. There is no way to get back trust once it’s broken, no matter what people think.

Your girlfriend has broken the contract and continues to put herself before you, she does not value you, she does not love you, she does not respect you. She only values, loves and respects herself. She wishes to control you in any way she can, and she has found her way. She will NEVER release you from these bonds, you must release yourself. It won’t be easy, but it WILL be worth it, because believe me there is a life outside of this and outside of her. 

If you stay, you will regret it for the rest of your life, I swear to you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My(28M) wife(27F) left me for 3 months and recently begged me to take her back, I said no and no everyone seems to be against me, I need some advice strangers

Well let me give some background information as the situation will be hard to understand without it.

7 years ago I got married to the girl of my dreams Denise(Fake name), we had been dating for 2 years before that and it was like a dream come true, that changed after our marriage. After our marriage she constantly started feeling down and out of it and eventually I got her to go to a doctor who sent her to a therapist and from there we found out she had depression to do with things from her past that she was trying to forget. I decided to be as supportive as I could be, I took care of most of the house work, despite working 40 hours a week and told her to just get herself in order and if she needed to talk to me I would be there for her.

That was 6 and a half years ago, before she left she was still depressed, she basically only lays in bed and complains, she does nothing, we had no intimacy, no sex, no cuddles, no going out, my entire day was filled with work and house work. Day in and day out I worked my ass off, came home to a mess of a house and started cleaning up, starting dinner and so forth at the end of the day I was exhausted and all I could expect was for Denise to unload more of her trouble on me and complain about herself, me and everything around her. I could not even hang out with my buddies to get away from it all as she would relentlessly call me saying she was scared and everything so I also had no social life, not that I had time for it anyway...But despite it all I pushed through hoping that sooner or later she would break out of it and we could have a proper life together as I loved her and as they say for better and worse and this was quite clearly worse, possibly the worst it would ever be.

4 months ago she got a new therapist and 3 months ago that therapist suggested she needed time away from me as her depression started when we married so I may be the cause of it, the moment she told me I was crushed, I started doubting myself, blaming myself, worrying, but beneath it all this creeping sense of having done everything for her, having sacrificed years of my life as a cashcow and a servant for her to lay in bed and this is my thanks? It is my fault now? But I rejected that feeling, trying to talk through it, but she decided to leave and stay with her mother, saying she needed time away from me and that I may be the cause of her depression and so forth, honestly the entire argument is a blur in my head.

I spend the next month when she moved out calling her, her family, begging and humiliating myself just to get her back, apologizing for everything I may have done wrong, honestly I was close to ending it all as I was so hopeless at that point. But that month passed and as it passed I couldn't help but feel relieved, I came home and it was quiet, I could indulge in my hobbies which I had not done in years, the place was not a mess every time I came home, I could relax and two months in I even realized I could hang out with my buddies again, grabbing a beer, enjoying life and slowly I started to realize that I had been miserable this entire time. Slowly that turned in to more and more realizations before I realized I honestly did not love her anymore, I felt like my youth was wasting away, I could do much, much better than this, I felt like I was a caretaker of a handicapped old lady, hell I still looked good and as I went out I started once again gaining back my self confidence, women would flirt with me, I felt wanted even though I never did flirt back.

After all these realizations I suddenly got a call from my wife, saying she made a huge mistake, she was sobbing her eyes out and how she was an idiot taking the therapists words as fact and how much she loved me. For a moment I wanted to say yes, yes please come back...But I couldn't, I just blurted it out and said to her she had left me and I was done with this relationship, I told her I would get divorce papers and I told her I had wasted enough time as it was and this final action of hers was the nail in the coffin, after that I just dropped the phone, started crying for a bit before turning in and feeling liberated.

The issue now is, is that everyone in my family is telling me I am making a mistake, I should take her back, I owe it to her to try and make it work, marriage is not always fun etc. The thing is, I never had fun in this marriage, I can't remember the last time I had fun and wasn't miserable, we are both young and fit and we never even go out, hell the last time we had sex is over a year ago, all I am to her is a fucking servant as it seems and I rather live along then spend one more hour taking care of her. But on the other end, I doubt myself, am I really dumping someone that is depressed? I feel horrible about it, I feel like a failure...I just need advice.

EDIT: Wow, I stepped away from my phone for a while and return to a ton of comments, thank you all so much, I will try to read them all.

EDIT 2: While I have a hard time defending my wife right now, let me clarify something that is popping up in some comments. I know for a fact that she did not sleep around with anyone while we were separated.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (27F) boyfriend (27M) asked me to “act more kawaii” in the bedroom. I’m asian and he’s white. I don’t want to shame his kink but I don’t want to be fetishized.

TLDR: I don’t want to be fetishized by my boyfriend but don’t want to shame him for being more sexually open with me. 

We’ve been together for a little over a year now and it’s been going well! We met at college through a club and hit it off then reconnected a couple years later. He’s always been really kind to me and gives me compliments all the time and we generally have fun together. 

We’ve been quarantining together and have been having a lot of sex, which I love, but it’s been getting a little weirder, I guess? He sends me a lot of hentai and says he wants to try things out that are depicted in it which is fine. But he’s also been buying me outfits (which I do appreciate) and they’re very much like anime themed? Japanese schoolgirl, cat-girl costume, etc. etc. I know he’s being more open sexually with me but it all feels kind of... gross? Like he wants me to do all of these things because I’m Asian? Anyway the other night he asked me to “act cuter” in the bedroom and to speak Japanese to him in bed. I was really offended by this because while I’m Asian I’m not Japanese. I’m Taiwanese, but born and raised here in America. I firmly told him no and the night went on alright but he was a little quiet afterwards like I’d scolded him. 

I don’t think he means anything weird by it, but I want to tell him I’m not okay with the things he’s been doing but also I don’t want to shame him for being more open sexually with me. I just want to feel like he wants to be intimate with ME and not with Asian Girl #7, if that makes sense. I don’t know how to explain this to him though?

ANSWER: I was literally waiting for the part where you weren't Japanese.

Look. If he's pushing this on you and even using Japanese fucking words to describe how he wants you to act, it's too late. You're already the fetish and it's going to overrun most if not all things between you guys. I don't say this to be shitty and hyperbolic. I'm half chinese and one of my exes used to tell everyone I was Japanese because it was his thing. The caucasity. 

I can only suggest, and pray for you that he'll understand, that you have a talk with him about what it means to be racially fetishized and how dehumanizing it is and how horrible it is for you to have to act Japanese for him in those stupid anime costumes, and maybe explain some history of how the Japanese treated the rest of Asia and why it's actually fucking insulting that he does that given the atrocities that Japan committed and straight up how weird it is that he can't separate Taiwan from Japan. 

Like yeah you were born here but you're also 27. Don't let some weeaboo try to make you into someone you aren't. This isn't 'kink shaming', this is him being straight up racist.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (34m) conducted a paternity test behind my wife’s back on our 12 year old son.

Typing this out in Mobile. Apologies for grammar or formatting 

A little back story before I get to the meat. My wife and I met when I was 20. We had a drunk hookup the first night we met. We continued seeing each other after that night. A few weeks later she found out she was pregnant. We stayed together and I proposed a few months later. I had doubts about her pregnancy lining up with our timeline but I never brought it up or discussed it. Not to mention I was in the military and deployed a few months later. My proposal weighed a lot on her carrying my child. I grew up in a home without a dad and never wanted that. 


Fast forward 12 years we are still married. Though it has been extremely volatile and rocky I’ve stayed together honestly because I could never part from my son. I can’t let him grow up with an absent father. So I’ve made it work. Our marriage is dead outside of our child. 


I ran into an old friend who I knew around the time I met my wife. He asked if I was still with her and I said yes. He mentioned how “it was crazy I dated her and then you stole her from me!” I wasn’t sure what he meant and asked him to elaborate. He said “it’s no big deal but I was seeing her up until that weekend you met her.” I dropped it but inside my doubt and insecurities ran wild. I couldn’t get it out of head. I broke down and bought a home DNA test kit and used it on my son and I without telling my wife. 


The results came back today. He is not my son. 0% chance I am his biological son. I’m destroyed. My whole world is upside down. I’m just on autopilot at the moment. I don’t know how to act or feel. I’m just a zombie right now. 


One thing I know is no matter what he is my son. I’ve been by his side the moment he was born and will absolutely never abandon him. Absolutely nothing will change that. 

What I haven’t decided is how if at all I bring it up to my wife. I feel like my whole marriage was a lie. I can’t help but wonder if she knew. How do I confront her. Regardless that I’m not in love with her I still love her. This will crush her. This will absolutely devastate her. I don’t know what to do. I plan on seeing a counselor/therapist ASAP. So many emotions and thoughts flooding my mind. Just need some help to bring me back down.

EDIT: I appreciate all the support and words of advice. Both good, bad and the assholes. I’m going to sit on this until I get my head right.

ANSWER: First of all, I can’t even imagine how blindsided you must feel. I’m sorry this has happened. 

My parents (biological parents) got married because they found out they were pregnant with me. When I was about 1, they decided to end it. I’ve talked with my mom a lot about why this happened and what her thought process was and she always says something along the lines of: “I knew that I’d so much rather raise you in two happy households instead of one unhappy one.”

And that’s exactly what happened. I grew up with two separate, happy marriages as examples. I got to be loved by so many more people. I have good relationships with all my parents. I have no resentment. 

I just wanted to say that good outcomes of divorce exist. Sometimes it really is what is best for the family unit as a whole. Divorce doesn’t always end badly. Sometimes it’s the most calm & clear path for everyone involved. 

Good luck, I’m rooting for you.

QUESTION: My husband(m26) ignored our safe word while trying CNC (consensual non-consent) and I’m torn

My husband (m26) and I (f20) have been exploring more when it comes to sex. One of the things we’ve just recently come across is CNC. We both agreed to do and and came up with the safe word, as advised. 
While we were into it, he became extremely rough with me. I said our safe word because I wanted to stop but he ignored it, I said it again, he ignored it once more. I started trying to push he off and he just held me back down. He continued until he finished .

He’s been treating me like an asshole ever since. I told him what he did was wrong and he ignored our safe word. He told me that I’m overreacting and that he made it more fun and realistic. I told him he borderline raped me, and he said “ it’s not possible for a husband to rape his wife” He’s also treating as if I’ve done something wrong. I made dinner for us, he waited until I was finished and said that he’s eating out, after watching me spend 1 1/2 hour cooking dinner. I just don’t know what to do.

ANSWER: He did not borderline rape you. He raped you. He clearly has no respect for you and your boundaries

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (28m) accidentally punched a woman. She went around telling people that I intentionally hit her and also that I was abusive to my wife.

Last week, there was a small get together at my friend’s house; just us 9-10 of us close friends. Now he invited one of his friends, Susan (28f) and she brought along her brother (30m), who none of us knew. My wife (28f) was present there too. 

Her brother, Dave, was being weird with my wife from the get-go. Half the time he was there he was staring at my wife inappropriately and trying to touch her whenever he found her alone. She even asked me to hold her hand the entire time because he was making her uncomfortable. I told her we could leave if she wanted to, but she said she won’t let a creep sabotage her evening. This was a bad decision on our part; should’ve left earlier. 

I got a work call in the middle of the party, and my wife told me to take the call and assured me she would be fine with her friend, Lisa. When I came back after 5 minutes, I see Dave trying to talk to Lisa and my wife and both of them looked very uncomfortable. Apparently he’d been trying to convince them to get inside the pool naked. I confronted him, and well, things escalated. He said some colourful words to my wife and Lisa, implied that my wife was totally leading him on before I came back. 

I physically shoved him away from my wife and Lisa. He retaliated and not proud of this but we got into a fist fight. It was all adrenaline and fists and punches. I raise my hand to punch him, gained enough momentum that’d have knocked his teeth out and all of a sudden,his sister, Susan comes in front of him trying to shield him. And my fist hit her in the face. I apologised, I profusely apologised and even offered to take her to the hospital. I’ve never raised my hands on a woman and I never will. This was a fuck up and I was very ashamed of myself. 

Susan didn’t accept my offer and neither my apologies. Dave took her to the hospital. The next day, she put up a story on Instagram about how I hit her, with a photo of her injury and her face. The story they’re going with is that my wife and Lisa were totally hitting on Dave and when I found out, I hit Susan out of anger. Now I’ve been getting threatening messages on my social media accounts, someone even found my LinkedIn profile and messaged my company asking why they hired ‘woman abusers’. Lisa and my wife have tried to mitigate this disaster by posting the correct version of this story, but it looks like people have made up their minds that I’m an abusive asshole. Some have even messaged my wife asking her to divorce me or if I abuse her too or why is she supporting someone who hits women. 

I contacted Susan through my lawyer and said that we’re gonna sue for defamation and slander, that let’s settle this in court and that other people present at the party are ready to testify against her. Dave and her are now begging us to forgive them as they’re very poor (they are, both have been unemployed since two-three years) and they’re even ready to post on SM that they lied. 

My wife thinks that we should definitely sue them. Lisa thinks that a court case will really fuck them over and destroy their lives. I kinda agree with both of them. What should I do?

Edit : I replied to a comment saying this and since a lot of people think that I shouldn’t have gotten into a physical altercation with the guy,I’ll replay his exact words. ‘Your wife was begging for my cock before you rudely interrupted us.’ This was when I shoved him away and then he threw the first punch. It escalated from there. I know this isn’t a justification for the physical fight but well, it is what it is.

ANSWER: If you can, take screenshots of any communications you've had with them, especially if it's them admitting to the lie. Whether you go ahead with the court case or not people may still wonder afterwards if they only backed down because they were "bullied" into it because they couldn't afford a legal battle; any tangible proof from them could help to clear your name on SM and with your employer (current or future) better than good reviews from your friends will.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (23f) boyfriend (29m) hates that I wear boxers to bed

We've been together 3 months.

My sleepwear consists entirely of tank tops and underwear. I have underwear for during the day and for dates, which is primarily small and lacey, and then I've got women's briefs and men's boxers (usually a cotton blend) for sleeping. They're really comfy and really big. I don't think they're ugly, they're just not very cute.

My boyfriend slept over last night and I went to get dressed for bed and as I pull out the briefs he goes "do you have to wear those?" so I pull out the boxers. He says that's worse and asks if I can wear some of my "nice" underwear to bed. I tell him that wearing lace all day and then overnight and again the following day is how you get yeast infections and he asks me why I had to mention yeast infections.

I put them on and go to get into bed and he asks me to take them off, not for sex, but just so I'm not wearing boxers to bed. I ask him what the big deal is and he says "forgive me for wanting to find you attractive". I don't know what to say to that but he rolls over, straight to sleep, no cuddling.

This morning I wake him, we kiss, I'm thinking it'll lead to sex, but he touches my boxers, stops, gets dressed and leaves.

This is starting to affect my self esteem just a bit. I'm only wearing them because they're comfortable and I don't want to buy all new stuff, but this is apparently a real turn off for him and it's causing problems. What do I do to fix this issue without completely caving?

TL;DR: Boyfriend hates me wearing boxers to bed, wants me to wear my regular underwear to bed, and says boxers are a turn off. I like wearing them and don't want to buy new sleepwear. Is there a compromise that doesn't involve me sleeping with my arse out?

UPDATE: texted and asked. He thinks it's "gay". As a bisexual woman I cannot see an alternative to breaking up right now.

Edit: He is not gay. Or bi. Or otherwise experiencing internalized homophobia. 99% of homophobes are straight. He is within that 99%. This is not glee.

ANSWER: "forgive me for wanting to find you attractive" lol yeah excuse you for wanting comfort and relaxation. if it's only 3 months in and he's this way about sleepwear I can't imagine him being the type to help you when you're sick, gassy etc and not always "hot".

THANK YOU for gold and the likes. :)

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g2jdjz/i_23f_am_days_away_from_giving_birth_and_my_37m/

First things first: I had my healthy baby girl on Monday evening. We were discharged shortly after birth due to Covid so I have been just trying to adjust to everything. Her birth was a dream and I never want to do it again. Lol. 

Second: I talked to his wife for over an hour yesterday. I guess he decided to tell her. She wasn't mad at me, thank God. She'd had her suspicions but was trying to trust her husband which I understand. She was so nice honestly and even though she isn't angry at me I still feel bad because she's such a nice lady. She wanted to make sure I was doing okay and that I didn't need anything which made me cry because postpartum hormones are whack. She's getting a divorce from him (good for her tbh). We are planning to meet up and talk shit about him once the virus is over. 

I have a lawyer and will establish custody and child support legally asap. He hasn't bothered to contact me at all but I don't particularly care. 

I didn't want to leave anyone hanging even though it's not a huge update. Thank you to everyone who checked in. It means a lot.

ANSWER: The wife sounds like an amazing and understanding human being. Hopefully you have been gifted with an amazing friend after this, if anything.

QUESTION: My(50F) husband (53M) just messaged me on Tinder

I accidentally discovered he had Tinder on his phone.  I catfished him with a fake profile and he messaged me.  We've been together 20 years and married for 15 years.  I don't even know how to approach this with him without crying or screaming.  How do I tell my husband I know he's active on Tinder and I don't think I trust him anymore.

Edit: Thank you for the comments, everyone.

ANSWER: Arrange a meeting otherwise he will lie and say it was just for fun. Let him know when you show up at the hotel!

================================================================================

QUESTION: Update: my [33m] wife [25f] constantly makes a conscious effort to humiliate me during my lessons over Zoom

About a week and a half ago, I made a post here about my wife consciously trying to sabotage my lessons over Zoom. It seemed that everything she did was just to embarrass me in front of my students. If you want more information about the situation, you can find the original post here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/illtan/my_33m_wife_25f_constantly_makes_a_conscious/

My first lesson after making that post, my wife went straight back to her old antics. I was in the lesson room as students gradually joined, talking to a student who was interested in luxury cars. At some point during the conversation, I said “yeah I think I’d have to go with the Lamborghini there.” I heard from behind the door in the basement where I was teaching “LaMBorGhiNi” in the sarcastic exaggerated tone of voice that kids will use to mock you. I realized she was being childish again, but figured she’d eventually tire herself out.

A few minutes after the lesson started, I used the word “circumference” to describe a word problem. I then heard “ciRCuMFeREnCe” from behind the door at the top of the stairs, followed by giggling. Since the timing was right, as I was about to have the students take a shot at a problem, I set them to the task, muted my mic/disabled my camera, and quietly crept up the stairs. I suddenly opened the door to find my wife with a cup over her ear pushed against the door so she could hear me. 

I whisper-shouted at her for her behavior for about a minute. I asked if she was five years old and what the hell was wrong with her. She feigned fear and shock as if I had held her against the wall with my hands wrapped around her throat, which made me just sigh and go back downstairs to finish my lesson.

For the rest of the lesson she was quiet, but after it I went upstairs to bring up what she did. She started asking if I was going to yell at her again. I responded that I wouldn't, and I tried to get back on topic, but no matter what I said about her behavior, her response was the same. When I brought up her stomping in the room above before, “are you going to yell at me again?” When I brought up her sliding plastic files under the door during a lesson before, “oh, are you going to yell at me again?” When I brought up anything she has done during lessons, the answer was the same, over and over again.

There is absolutely no way to broach the topic with her now. I called her doctor and said that her behavior is erratic, and that she might have PPD. The doctor said that he could ask about it when she came in, but there is not much else he could do. The next day I tried to sit my wife down for a calm discussion about the possibility of her having PPD, to which she responded she had PTSD from my “abusive shouting.” Right. When I suggested therapy, together, she said “oh, to fix your anger management problems? Sounds good.”

I teach in my car in front of a Starbucks now. Outside of lesson time we haven't really had any issues, and now that I'm outside the house teaching, we are strained but stable. I know this is not a very satisfactory outcome, but I think she has deep underlying issues that are going to need professional intervention. When I said I would happily go to therapy with her to find a solution to our communication issues, she told me that I should go alone. I think that may actually be a good step because having a neutral party to listen to my worries and guide me towards better de-escalation tactics would be highly beneficial. I could also try to entice her to join gradually.

TL;DR: my wife has no desire to change. I’m going to start therapy alone and see if I can’t get her to join. Her doctor will bring up the possibility of PPD in her next appointment.

ANSWER: I saw the orginal post.  Yes, go to the therapy alone.  Your therapist might have some good strategies or be able to point your towards more resources all the while ensuring you don't go mad yourself dealing with this.  I'm sorry for you having to deal with this.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Overheard my [26M] fiancé [24F] tell her friend on the phone that she “settled for being with me,” and that marrying me was her “last resort.”



Update 2: Just did one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. Today after breakfast I told her we should “sit down and talk.” She was hesitant, but I said it was important. We went to the living room and she said to me “I already know what this is about.” My post apparently made it to the front page, so of course she saw it after scrolling down a bit under “popular.” Of course the water works started happening right away. I told her what she said had deeply hurt me, but obviously she already knew that since she read my post. Through her tears, she said “I was just joking, I wasn’t serious.” She then went on saying stuff like “I love you, I love you.” I told her I can’t be in a marriage where my S/O doesn’t love me the same way I love them. She tried to tell me that she loved me and that I meant something to her. But it was all bullshit. She said she “didn’t want to lose me.” I told her I don’t think this marriage was the right decision. And from there I basically told her it was over. I told her I knew how she really felt about me, and that it was fucked yo she basically played with my emotions. For all those wondering, we have no kids, and I pay fully for the apartment we live in, and I own almost everything we have other then her clothes. I even pay for her car. So after all of this she’ll have little to nothing left. Before our marriage, we agreed to sign a pre-nup, and at that moment, I’ve never been so happy with a decision I’ve made in my life. After that it was a few second of awkward silence, before she said to me “Fuck you.” She started screaming at me, telling me “you just can’t end things like that.” I told her I could do whatever I wanted, and that’s when she became very hostile. She screamed at me saying, “You’re the fucking worst relationship I’ve ever been in. You think I can’t find someone again?” “Do you think you’ll ever from someone as good as me? You’re a fucking idiot [my name].” She grabbed her bag and phone, and said “I’m leaving!” Before slamming the door behind her. At that moment I felt like I was on one of those dramatic sitcoms you’d find of TV. I sat down on the couch and cried, and I’m still crying as I type this up. It’s both happy and sad tears, and I knew it was only time before she cheated on me or left me. She never loved me, it was obvious. Our relationship only went one way, and I feel like a complete idiot for not seeing it earlier I live in California, and I’m gonna start the process to annul our marriage. Tomorrow, I’m gonna start throwing all of her belongings in to trash bags, cause that’s essentially where they belong. (I’m not throwing out her stuff. Just using the trash bags as a way to give her back the things she owns.) Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your kind words and your great advice. All of you gave me the courage to stand up for myself, and I know my life will certainly improve as a result.

Edit/Update: Thanks everyone for the kind words! Really has made me feel a lot better! Going to be talking to her soon. Also, I noticed a lot of people thinking this post is fake, I understand how it could be seen that way, but it isn’t. I’ve been engaged to her for over a year and a half, and just 3 months ago we got married. Not really used to calling her my “wife” yet. Also I used an old alt since she uses Reddit. Anyways thanks for the advice everyone, it amazes me how people on the Internet can care so much about a person they don’t even know. I’m going to talk to her today. I will be updating you all soon after.

Edit: Meant to put wife in the title but now I can’t change it.

Basically the title. I overheard my wife talking to one of her best friends on the phone while I was passing the bedroom. This friend is in a serious relationship. My wife then said to her, “Sweetie, remember it’s your choice. Don’t settle for just anyone. That’s the mistake I made. Who knows who else I could of had. [My name] was my very last resort, and now look where it made me end up.” Hearing that honestly broke my heart in two. Does she even love me? Why am I being treated as a second base? 

Am I being dramatic and overreacting? I haven’t said anything about it since. I honestly don’t know what to do, but hearing her say has really made me upset.

ANSWER: Fucking brutal. I am so sorry to hear that. You should really talk to her about it. You should never be somebody's "last resort" if that's how she really feels maybe that relationship isn't working

================================================================================

QUESTION: Do I (14m) call the police on my mum's hit and run?

Mum was driving me to school this week. She was taking a turn and obviously wasn't looking because she took the turn wide and hit a kid from school who was riding to the bike racks. He was in the other lane that goes the other way. Our car went over him and I heard him yell out. I don't like "know" him but he's in a different year than me.

After that happened mum just kept driving. I told her we need to call the police or ambulance or something. Mum just kept saying that he swerved and hit her and that we don't call the police if we did nothing wrong. She told me to keep quiet and knows i'll do the right thing.

I saw a photo on insta of him in the hospital and he's all bruised and looks rough as guts. I've just been feeling really bad and it's like I can't eat and feel like throwing up. It's like mum did something really wrong and it feels really bad to not say anything. I wasn't even allowed to tell dad about it (but him and mum are divorced and I'm not allowed to tell him lots of things...). If I tell someone, mum will probably get arrested and then it'll be my fault.

I don't know and want to stop feeling so bad, do I tell on my mum or not?

ANSWER: I’m on team “tell your dad”.

This is too big for a 14 year old to deal with, and you need support around this that your mom is incapable of providing.

Your dad needs to know all of this, including how you feel and your mom is wrong to tell you not to seek his help.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My unborn child absorbed it’s twin and now my wife resents it.

At our 10 week scan we were told we were having twins. Having tried for 7+ years and this being our first real pregnancy, my wife was ecstatic. Cue a few weeks later our doctor is checking for heartbeats and he only finds 1. We go for another ultrasound and one of our twins had died and been absorbed by the other, which is why my wife had no glaring miscarriage symptoms. 
At first she was fine. Then she started joking that our baby would grow up to be a serial killer as “he already has 1 checked off”. Soon it was becoming clear that the idea our unborn fetus somehow murdered its twin intentionally was no longer a joke in my wife’s mind. I tried explaining the fetus had passed on its own, it hadn’t been absorbed to death. This didn’t work so I asked our doctor, her gynaecologist, her mother, her sister and her dad to all try explaining it too but it was no use. She has fully convinced herself that our unborn child is a murderer. 

I really don’t know what to do. My mom tells me she’ll go “back to normal” when her pregnancy hormones drop but I am really concerned as I know the drop in hormones can actually make people even more unpredictable and I hate to say this about my wife, but dangerous. I don’t want to leave her. We’ve waited so long to be parents together and I know this isn’t my wife, she is just grieving. The multiple ultrasounds have put us badly in the negative after already being screwed over by covid so we can’t afford therapy for a little while. 

Any advice? thanks

ANSWER: Approach this as the death of a child. A child she had never known, but had already loved. 

My suspicion is that she is emotionally distancing herself from the remaining fetus in case this fetus dies unexpectedly too. 

She needs therapy.  Look into social programs which might provide her with additional resources.

QUESTION: UPDATE my friend drugged me at a party and assaulted me

I had to use a new account because my last one was locked for some reason.

I read all of your comments and snuck out of my house to go to the hospital to have the rape kit done. It turns out that he did have sex with me that night and they found drugs in my system although I don’t remember the name of it.

I reported my ex friend to the police and based off the drugs in my system matching some that he had hidden in his room and all of the dna they collected from me at the hospital they were able to arrest him. My parents found out but haven’t apologized for blaming me.

Thanks for all of the helpful advice I received.

ANSWER: You did the most important thing you could: you went to take care of yourself. The traces of drugs in your system will be invaluable for your doctors to take care of you, and for any prosecution in the future. Give yourself a huge hug for advocating for yourself.

The other post has excellent resources for what you can expect in the future, though I want to second reaching out to two very important organizations with lengthy experience. One, see if there's a sexual assault resource center in your area. Most major cities have them, and they provide local assistance and resources, including contacts to lawyers, counselors, therapy, nurses, medical assistance, and more. If you end up having to go to court, they can put you in touch with compassionate legal advocates fully prepared to support you the whole way. I can't speak enough to the good work these centers do.

Stay strong and contact Rainn.org as they have outstanding resources available for people who were assaulted. Their outreach is international and they have a multitude of invaluable resources that you can use, including their 24/7 live chat, and their phone number at 800.656.HOPE.

================================================================================

QUESTION: [UPDATE] I want to read my daughter’s diary to find out why she left us. My wife says absolutely not

First and foremost, thank you all so so much for your condolences and for sharing your thoughts and experiences dealing with losing a loved one. Secondly, I’m sorry if this post isn’t necessarily the neatest,  I am still at a loss for words.

Basically, I’m a pathetic excuse of a father for not realizing that my son goes on Reddit (I don’t keep track of the social media apps he uses), so he saw my original post where many of y’all were urging me to read my daughter’s diary. My son did so behind our backs and we only came to find out when he lashed out, calling his sister selfish and all the names under the sun for doing what she did. My wife on the other hand is beyond pissed at my son for reading our daughter’s diary. She said that our daughter is going to be mad at our family when she “gets back,” only to find out that one of us read it. I’m guessing she hasn’t accepted the fact that she’s gone and will never return. 

As for me and my wife, we haven’t read our daughter’s diary, only our son did. Based on my son’s reaction, I can assume that you guys were right, that her diary is filled with hatred, as if someone else wrote in it. I don’t know the contents of it but I know how and who my daughter was and her brother loved her who for who she was and now, he can’t stand it when his sister’s name is mentioned. That was exactly what I was afraid of that after reading her diary, our perspective of her would be completely different.

My son is temporarily speaking with a family member who’s a therapist and we’ll be switching him over to a different one hopefully by next week to avoid conflict of interests and as a family, we’re now in contact with a counselor. I want to talk to my wife about her getting into therapy too, as she still thinks our daughter is still here but she’s just away on a “trip,” my wife calls it. But beyond that, still nothing much has changed. My wife still cries every night and though my son very much upset with his sister, we still find him around his sister’s room. And for me? Nothing, still empty and probably always will be, which isn’t fair to my son and wife so I’ll probably seek a therapist for myself as well. Plus, I know many marriages don’t survive after the death of a child, so marriage counseling is something I want to bring up to my wife when I feel is appropriate.

What about the diary? It’s gone, hidden well within our home. Hell, I may even forget where it’s at years down the line but I do know I want to read it when I’m ready, whether that’s with my wife or not. I want to know her struggles, read her fun times (if she has any written), and what made her do it. I know reading it won’t give me closure, but it will give me an insight of what she was going through and let that be a lesson for me to be better for my son and to just always be there whether he’s feeling fine or not.

That’s about it. My heart still physically hurts from the loss of my daughter and for the rest of my family as they’re also in so much pain. Some of you guys might be expecting this update to be about the contents of the diary but I’m choosing not to read it for a long, long time. And if my wife wants to? I won’t stop her, but I do want to tell her that she may not recognize our own daughter as my son didn’t. Only time will heal our wounds and lots and lots of therapy and support. Thank you all so much for your thoughts and prayers. I can say for myself that it brought me a bit of comfort after such a massive loss.

Again, thank you all so much.

EDIT: Many apologies for the typos, my mind has been in shambles.

ANSWER: I keep a journal and I can tell you that if someone read it they would probably have a very incomplete picture of me. I typically only write out my most negative emotions because for me it’s a way to purge those thoughts and feelings. They are certainly not all that I am so if you ever do read it, try to remember you’re probably reading the very darkest thoughts she had and not the whole picture.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (24M) girlfriend (26F) fully believes that she is a cat in a human's body.

[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h8wzqq/update_my_24m_girlfriend_26f_fully_believes_that/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

Tl;dr: gf now thinks she is an otherkin, a cat in a human's body and refuses to see anything wrong with the situation. The echo chamber she is now has done nothing but enable her and I don't know what to do.

I know people are going to think I'm either trolling or baiting but please read before you comment + this post has nothing to do with gender or trans issues and I am in no way intending to be offensive or anything.

So Gf and I have been together for nearly 8 months, and she's always been a very quirky and nerdy person: does cosplays, very into anime and roleplaying, etc... Nothing too weird. We've been kinda distant lately with everything going on and me being an essential worker so haven't seen eachother and only talk for half an hour a day. Well, last tuesday we got to hang out at her place and she wore cat ears a and a belt with a tail the entire time. At first I thought it was either going to be a sex surprise or her testing  a new cosplay, but nope, she sat me down, asked me if I really do love her, then hit me with a very long monologue that essentially summed up to  "I'm a cat in a human body". Wish I was joking.

I thought I misunderstood and then believed that maybe it was a weird joke but she kept being serious about it, and doubling down. I left shortly after because I had a shift at work, and I still believed it was an oddly drawn out joke nothing more. She ended up texting me with resources to help me understand, which is when I realized that she really is serious. Apparently she believes she is an otherkin:  a person who holds the belief that they are not human. She says she was introduced to this by one of her friends months ago and has since joined discords and communities of others like her. Her friend believes he is a demon trapped in a human body, and she sent me a testimonial that was supposed to be touching but its basically just about a dude thinking he is naruto. I'm not joking. She explained her otherkin type as being a cat, and now she 100% thinks she is a cat. How did she know she was a cat you ask? According to her: sleeping a lot, liking the sun, hating water,  feeling more comfortable crawling on all fours, and claiming to understand what cats are saying and being able to talk to them through meowing. She has also apparently been distant with nearly everybody we know IRL as I got multiple messages asking me to let her know to be in touch with them.

My head has been spiraling this past week, I keep thinking its a joke but nope she is deathly serious about this and has handed in her two weeks resignation at her job because cats don't work. Again, I wish I was joking. I've been limiting my interactions with her ever since, because this is hurting my head a whole lot and I just can't cope. She has also surrounded herself with a large amount of yes men and women who support her 100% and are enabling this, some even encouraging her to make a patreon and make otherkin content that they would contribute to, which she brought up when I asked her about quitting her job. To make things worse, I can't discuss this with anyone in real life because I know how crazy it sounds and I know that leaving her is a valid option but I'm in love with this woman and now I don't recognize her and I know that there is something very very wrong and I can't reach out to her and she refuses to hear anything from me unless it is unconditional support. What the fuck do i do ?

EDIT: Just got off work and was very surprised with the amount of comments, I honestly just expected a bunch calling me crazy. I'm reading through them now and I want to say thank you to everybody who took the time out of their day to give me advice, I truly appreciate it. To address some things:

\- Her and I have been friends for 2+ years prior to dating, so that is why I am reluctant to just up and leave.

\- I've read a comment asking if she has a history of mental illness, and not to my knowledge? Aside from her being diagnosed with mild social anxiety in high school. I am going to try and reach out to her mom to get her to check up on her, and maybe even visit. They have a good relationship, so maybe that will help.

\- Yesterday was the first time I truly confronted what was going on, as I have been kind of shelving it and just praying and hoping it was some kind of drawn out joke. But now that I've had time to truly ponder it, I think it has been a long time coming. She's been buying a lot of cat memorabilia and a lot of her cosplays are cat related, and when I brought up the possibility of me getting a cat in the near future she made a joke about being too territorial for a cat, and now that I think about it...well, yeah.

\-I don't know who demon man really is, all I know is that he has been part of her virtual Dnd group since last year. Also so far no litterbox in the picture, sorry to disappoint/relieve some of you. When I asked her about her plans as a "cat" other than quitting her job, she had sent me her to do list which I didn't bother opening or reading until yesterday because I was too busy wishing all of this was a fever dream. The To do list includes purchasing a scratch post for her nails, switching to an carnivore diet, and dying her hair red because she is a ginger cat. Yup.

\-As much as it hurts, I have no intention to continue to be in a romantic relationship with her because she will absolutely not hear anything if it's not 100% support. I love her, but I love myself and I don't want to be dragged down to something like this especially when it feels like I'm talking to a brick wall. I will however try to remain in contact with her just to make sure she's not spiraling towards a mental break. I will visit her today to have a talk and officially break it off even though she's been refusing to see me unless I am completely on board, I will update if anything interesting happens. Then I will buy a couple of bottles of alcohol and down them in my flat, no judgement.

\-I've really enjoyed the cat puns, and apparently I need to google who Maureen is.

ANSWER: I'm really sorry for you.

I did some research on otherkin and I think that your GF has slipped into a culture that only exists on the internet. 

I would ask her how she thinks she will support herself as a cat?

She quit her job. Now what? Not much work available if you have chosen to go to far out there.

If I were in your shoes, I would slowly distance myself from her. Let her sleep in the sun and lick her paws but don't start paying her bills.

If she does not wake up soon, I would continue to remove myself from her delusion. Eventually, you are out of the  picture.  I know that you care for her, but you should never be responsible for her. She has chosen to do this. 

My own philosophy is that you should let people live their lives as they want ( as long as it's not harming anyone else) but in this case I don't think you need to be there and watch this.

Otherwise just tell her your a dog and don't get along with cats

QUESTION: [Update] My Fiance's ex sent me their sex tapes and I made the terrible mistake of watching it

Here is a link to the original: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i7f1k2/my_fiances_ex_sent_me_their_sex_tapes_and_i_made/?ref=share&ref_source=link

As for the update, after posting here and reading the advice and reflecting on my actions, I realized what I did was wrong and a violation of my fiance's privacy. I allowed my insecurities to dictate my actions. Even though my fiance is okay with me using his phone, my intent to snoop made what i did wrong.  So I decided to just come clean.

I sat him down the next day and told him that the ex sent me the videos as well, and also came clean about the snooping. He was pretty upset, but surprisingly he wasn't that upset with the snooping, he seemed more upset that his ex had somehow managed to cause drama once again in his life. He told me that he hadn't watched any of the videos because in a majority of them he was uncomfortable with recording them and only did it for her and was afraid if watching it made me look at him in a bad way. This made me feel even shittier for what i did and I apologized again and reassured him that they did not in anyway lessen my feelings or respect for him. I wanted him to have some time to process things and decide what to do about the ex and what I did, so I gave him some space.

That night, I decided to cook his favorite meal as a sort of apology dinner and discuss things. He seemed in a much better mood. He apologized to me for not telling me about the tapes right away and for being an idiot and not realizing that she would come after me when he had blocked her. He told me he appreciated me coming clean about the snooping and understood how I got carried away and that I could have just talked to him and he would have given me his phone and reassured me that he hadn't kept any of the videos.

I asked if he was going to press charges regarding revenge porn and he told me that he wanted nothing to do with her and that we should just move on and enjoy our engagement and forget the whole thing. I told him it was completely his choice and I support him and would delete the videos and block her right away.

Finally, I brought up the texts and he apologized to me for the rant. He told me that was the first time in a long time that he had actually thought about who was better and that he had never actively compared me with any of his exes before. He told me he should have just answered it with a simple "my fiancee is better", and tried to apologize again. I told him that he didn't have to sugarcoat anything and that it was his private conversation with a friend and I have no right to be mad when he wasn't really disrespectful about me or our sex life. I also told him that it was okay if she was better and I didn't have to be the best at everything.

He explained to me that after talking to Sarah he thought more about it and that he hadn't really expressed his thoughts well in the text but he would like to explain it better:

> You are the best I have had, I am not lying or sugarcoating anything. If someone asked me who is the most skilled or the most adventurous sexual partner that I have had, then yeah it would probably be her. 

>But that doesn't really matter because if someone asked me what was the best sex I have ever had, my first thought would be the time when we had sex right after you asked me to marry you, and then it would be the night when you first told me you loved me and third would be the time when we had sex in the kitchen the day I moved in. For all her skill and experience, she couldn't even make the top 3, and we have the rest of our lives to make sure that she doesn't even come near the top 100. So no, I am not lying when I say you are the best I have had.

I am not going to lie, despite what I said about not needing to be the best, just hearing what he said (maybe i butchered the quote, he was so much more charming and eloquent) made me really happy, so I kissed him and asked him if he wanted to try and break into the top 3 again. Then, we had sex :) . I didn't really specifically try to be more aggressive but I tried to focus more on what he was feeling to reassure myself that he was enjoying it as much as I did. That naturally allowed me to be the one in the lead and it was great. I could tell that he really enjoyed it as well.

I know I have to work on my insecurities and potentially see a therapist, but for now I will try my best to just forget what I saw on those videos and enjoy being engaged to the most amazing man I know.

TL;DR: I fessed up, my fiance was very graceful and even tried to take some of the blame. We made up and will continue to enjoy the post engagement bliss.

PS: I appreciate the harsh comments that told me I was wrong to snoop. But those of you that sent me hateful pms telling me that I was no better than his ex and that I should leave him? Seriously, fuck off. I maybe an insecure nut sometimes, but I have never ever taken it out on him and would never hurt him like she did. And me wanting to be the best sex he has had is not some narcissistic ego trip. It was because to me he is the best sex I have ever had (and hopefully ever will) and I wanted to be the same for him. I don't think there is anything wrong with that.

ANSWER: Funny thing is, his ex trying to sabotage your sex life will lead to you two having even better sex!

Congrats, OP, this is such a beatiful update, the two of you seem to be a great couple!

QUESTION: UPDATE: My GF was raped and became pregnant. I broke with her after she decided to keep the baby.

Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/?utm_source=reddit-android

I'll post the update first, since there has been some change since I last posted. Then I'll respond to some general points made from the last thread, and the ton of PMs I received.

Yesterday, I received a call from my GF. She was crying, and she begged me to listen to her. I told her that I still care for her, and that I'll obviously listen to what she has to say.

She told me that a few days after I told her we were done, she called up her Mother to talk about this. Apparently, what happened before was that she was pretty much decided on aborting, but then when she spoke to her Mother, her mother told her that under no accounts should she abort, and that I was actually manipulating her to do so. Her Mother went on to say that if she aborted the child, she would no longer consider my gf as her daughter. 

After I left her, my gf called her Mum up to talk about what went on. My GF said that she desperately wanted to abort the baby, and her Mother again said that if she does so, this is the last time they will ever speak again. My GF said she broke down on the phone, and her Mother kept asking her what she will do. The conversation then ended when my GF said she didn't know.

Then she started texting. After a few hours of thinking, my GF sent her mum a text saying she was going to abort. She was then blocked.

My GF then called me, and told me everything.

She will be having an abortion in 3 weeks.

I discussed this with my GF, and we both completely agreed that I had not manipulated her in any way, and that she appreciated that I put my foot down, because had I not, she would have had a baby who would remind her of the worst time of her life. (Her words, not mine)

She further went on to say that I am the best thing that has ever happened to her, and that she knew that even if she no longer had a Mum, if she had me, she could get through this. I broke down at this point.

I love her so much. In truth, I probably would have gone back to her and raised the baby with her, even though I knew I'd resent it. I made the original thread to get some backing rather than anything, to see if I had made the right decision.

I'm so relieved things had turned out the way they have. 

Also, screw any Mother who places religion over their own child. Friggin lunatics.


Now to respond to some of your points from the last thread:

1: No. My GF did not cheat on me. I am almost certain about this. Not only because she had the conscience of a fragile angel, but also because we both know each others' schedules really well, and we often talk to friends who can corroborate timings. Moreover, her roommate took photos of my GF after she came home assaulted. It's not "rough sex" as some of you dicks put it.

2: I don't give a rat's arse if you think abortion is a sin or the killing of a baby. Come and raise the baby or give us money to raise the baby or hire us a live in maid to tend to my GFs every need while she pregnant if you're so sanctimonious. Talk the talk, then walk the walk you wanking tit-baboons.

3: My GF was absolutely clear she wanted to raise the baby (probably influenced by the Mum).

4: Thanks for all the people telling me I did the right thing. It was really difficult. I'm very glad it turned out the way it has though.

5: To the people who PM'd me telling me I'm a monstrous baby killer - I fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.

Thanks Reddit.

ANSWER: Pleaseeeeee ensure your girlfriend sees a professional to help process the trauma. Not just the trauma of the rape but also the trauma of her mother's controlling behavior and just the whole situation in general. And please consider seeing one yourself. Good luck.

>5: To the people who PM'd me telling me I'm a monstrous baby killer - I fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.

LOL boy you savage. I like your style.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

I can't believe I'm about to type this but here we go.

I've been dating my GF for 7 months. She's amazing and we're super compatible in a lot of ways. She is an outspoken vegan, and she made it clear at the start of our relationship that it was important to her that any potential had similar cruelty-free values. Me, already being a pescatarian, had little difficulty transitioning to a fully plant based diet. My GF was proud of me for going cruelty free and everything seemed well. We became "the vegan couple" on our college campus.

Then there is my cat, Mittens... I've had her for three years and I adore her. She's such a sweet and cuddly cat. However, my GF was always a little apprehensive around her, and she blamed it on not growing up around cats. After a while we sort of made a tacit agreement to mostly hang out at her apartment instead of mine, so Mittens never really came up again in conversation.

Fast forward through all the quarantine stuff... My gf and I have spent a lot of time together during this pandemic and we've started talking about taking our relationship to the next level. We began seriously looking at either buying a new apartment together or having one of us move in with the other.

However, after a lot of talking and planning, my GF sat me down and dropped a bomb shell on me. She said that with this next phase of the relationship, she did not see a future with me unless I was willing to give away Mittens. She said that she believed owning a cat is unconscionable for vegans, because they hunt mice and eat meat, and because the very act of owning a pet is a violation of vegan principles.

I was stunned. I told her that I was absolutely not willing to give up Mittens, and she had no choice but to eat meat so I was reducing harm as much as possible by buying reputable brands of cat food. Plenty of vegans own cats and think along those same lines. My gf got mad and said "how much flesh does your cat eat? How many animals died to make all that food? Would you be okay with that being human flesh?"

I got mad and told my GF that I would have really appreciated her telling me about her cat opinions before we got serious. She went on and on about cats killing animals. I ended the conversation there. I was so angry that I left my gfs apartment. And I snuggled with Mittens when I got home! Although the mood soured a bit when my GF sent me a link to a Reddit thread advocating for the extinction of domestic cats. Sigh

I think it goes without saying that I am not going to get rid of my cat. However, it pains me to think that an otherwise wonderful relationship could be ending because of a difference in ideology. I don't even really understand where my GF is coming from because like I said, a lot of vegans own cats. Now granted, cat ownership can be a controversial topic in vegan circles and I probably would not have gotten a cat if I had been vegan at the time, but I have Mittens now, and she deserves to eat. (Yes, I've researched vegan cat food, but Mittens has some digestive issues and my vet strongly cautions against it.)

I've talked to some of my vegan and vegetarian friends and they all think my gf has lost her mind. Some have suggested that it's not about Mittens and my gf just wants an excuse to end it. They probably don't understand why I haven't broken up yet, but I care about my GF so much. I'd hate for this bizarre curve ball to be the end of a beautiful thing. I want to try and work something out.

Where do I even go from here? I will not compromise on Mittens and I don't think my GF will compromise either.

Edit: wow, this completely blew up while I was asleep. I am trying to read every comment but there are a lot. Also, please allow me to take this moment to reiterate that my GFs views are not representative of those held by the wider vegan community!!

================================================================================

QUESTION: My [33M] fiancée [27F] chose to save my deceased father's stuff over her deceased mother's in a fire. How can I ever repay her?

Two nights ago, my fiancée accidentally set fire to our kitchen and the fire extinguisher in our apartment was defective. The fire spread quickly and burned through most of the building before they were able to contain it. I wasn't home, so I wasn't there to help my girlfriend gather anything up. If I was, I would have forced her outside and told her to leave it all. It's just stuff. 

She chose differently. First, she took out two dogs outside and handed them off to a neighbor on leashes. Then she went back in. At this point the kitchen was engulfed in flames and she couldn't make it into the living room, but she could get into the bedroom. She knew she wouldn't be able to make two trips and she had to act fast. 

Both of us have lost parents. I lost my dad 3 years ago. He was a friend of her father's so she knew him (though not very well), but he died before I actually met her. I have most of my dad's stuff in a storage unit, but in our bedroom I have his ashes, two guns, and a couple of other very personal things from my time with him. She lost her mom as a teenager, and because her father is an asshole, she only has a few small things of hers, and her wedding dress. 

Instead of choosing to save the few things that she has of her mom's, she gathered up my father's things, wrapped them in a sheet, and ran out of the room. 

I don't even know how to begin to say thank you. I'm so completely devastated by her losing her mom's things like that, and I can't imagine what she was thinking or how much she must really love me to make that decision. I don't know how to repay her. Or where to begin. Can anybody think of a nice gesture I can make it up to her? She must be devastated. I can't imagine losing the last bit of my dad. 

Tl;dr: my fiancée had an opportunity to save stuff from her dead mom when the apartment was burning, but chose to save mine instead. How do I repay her?

ANSWER: Clearly, in that moment, she chose to save what she loves most of all - your heart & happiness. 
I think she thought to herself to save what she had left (you), she has all her mom's memories wrapped up inside her. She didn't know what losing your dad's stuff would do to you, so she decided not to risk it and protect you.


God damn, that's powerful. 

You better marry that girl. Just spend the rest of your life treating her right. 

My side note: would be to get something engraved with her mother's name. My best friend's husband got her a ring with her mom's name engraved on the inside and their birthstones side by side in the band.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My(39m) wife(40f) slapped our daughter (16f) after she came out as gay. I need help dealing with my wife and my daughter.

I'm actually an immigrant from Mexico, so my English is average at best. 

I must admit that I was really homophobic and racist growing up. That was how I was raised. But when I moved to America, I met my wife and she helped me a lot. She helped me adjust to this new country and changed my racist and homophobic opinions. I owe that to my wife.

Yesterday, my daughter told me that she wanted to talk to me. So we sat down to talk, and she told me that she wanted to bring her girlfriend over for her birthday. It took some time to sink in, but I understood. When I asked her if she was coming out to me, she told me that she was. She asked me if I was fine with it and I told her that I had no problem with her choice and she will always be the same daughter to me. I must admit that I felt proud because my daughter actually trusted me.

After that, I asked her if she wanted to go out for dinner. She told me that she wanted to eat lasagna. I'm a chef and my daughter loves my lasagna. So I started to get ready to prepare it. 

At this point, my wife returned from her sister's house. Idk what went down but after a while, my wife started screaming at my daughter. And when I came to look, she slapped my daughter twice. My daughter was crying and I was really shocked. I asked what happened and my wife told me that my daughter came out and she did not agree with her. She told her that she can't be gay and started crying and yelling at her. 

I asked my wife to leave, because I was really angry. After my wife left I told my daughter that what my wife did was incredibly wrong and I'll stand by her. My daughter did not talk much, she just went to her room.

Now, my wife refuses to talk to me. She told me that she will be back only if I agree to help my daughter become straight. Idk what to make out of this. I'm really notnthat educated along these lines and all this is very new to me. I love both of them very much and I'd like to help diffuse this situation. Can I get some advice here?

ANSWER: You did the right thing. Your wife did not. Support your daughter and make her comfortable with who she is. Your wife needs an attitude adjustment. Remind her of how she helped you see things differently from what you were raised to believe. It's your turn now to do the same for her.

QUESTION: Update: My (21M) girlfriend (21F) went on an anti Semitic rant after getting into an argument with someone. I’m Jewish...

OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bc0gp4/my_21m_girlfriend_21f_went_on_an_anti_semitic/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app


I figured there was an interest in an update so here it goes. This all happened a few days ago. 

The day I made the post she actually came up to me and said that we should do something romantic for our anniversary soon. Well, that didn’t turn out well. 

Before I told her about my background, I asked her why she holds these beliefs/attitudes towards Jews. She pretty much sounded like Hans Landa the whole time. At one point she even admitted that she got suspended from school as a kid for “teaming up” with a white supremacist and pulling a horrible “prank” on a Jewish student. 

Afterwards I bluntly told her that I’m Jewish. She didn’t believe me at all and thought I was joking. I told her that I was dead serious and she just laughed and told me to shut up. This went on for a while and she even asked for proof. 

When it finally hit her she looked like she died inside. Things went 0-100 very fast. She got physically aggressive and screamed at me, calling me a liar and a psychopath. She said that our relationship was never real because it was based on a lie and that she feels disgusted with herself. When she insulted me I reminded her that she really liked me despite my “dirtiness” which just pushed her over the edge. She cried hysterically and I left. 

The next morning she knocked on my door and insisted that SHE dumped me and not the other way around.  She warned me not tell people that I dumped her since that would make her look bad. I didn’t say anything and closed the door. I heard her screaming and knocking violently, basically asking me how dare I close the door in her face and that “you people are all the same”. After a while she left and started writing me on Snapchat. I blocked her, then she called me from a friends phone and verbally attacked me. I’ve never seen her act so crazy. 

Long story short, I blocked/deleted her on everywhere and she eventually stopped. I knew things wouldn’t go smooth, especially after our initial conversation, but I didn’t know it would be this bad. Some of her stuff is still at my place. Oh well 


TL;DR Told her, broke up with her.

ANSWER: Watch your back dude. Crazy doesn’t just disappear quietly into the shadows. You need to keep yourself safe. She’s sick in the head.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife lied about having a miscarriage and instead had an abortion, I don’t know what to do know?


My wife and I have been married for 3 years and for the past year we have been trying for a child. 

We both wanted to have children and after we got married we decided to first buy a house and get things in order financially before having children.
Last year we both mutually agreed that we were in the right place to try for a child, in fact it was my wife who put the idea forward.

A little over 8 months ago my wife found out she was 6 weeks pregnant with our first child. I was elated, I had always wanted to be a father and it seemed like something I never thought was possible was coming true. 
My wife and I began buying parenting books, planning a nursery, just doing all the stuff first-time parents do. I had never been happier at this moment.

Several weeks later, I had to fly out of the country for a work conference. I was gone for about 8 days. Whilst I was abroad, my wife called, she was crying and told me she had a miscarriage. She was 18 weeks pregnant at this point.
I flew back home immediately and told work that I had a family emergency. 
I was devastated with the news, but I never properly mourned as I felt I had to be emotionally strong for my wife who was a wreck.

This was a tough period for both of us, but I thought we had come out stronger as a couple. I knew I had to give my wife some time and space before we could approach the subject again, especially with this being, what I thought, her first miscarriage.

However, a week ago, a friend of my wifes called and told me she had something important to tell me. Apparently my wife had scheduled an abortion, whilst I was away at a conference. My wife’s reasoning being that she wasnt ready to be a parent.  My wife also said  didn’t want me to know about the abortion because I was so excited to be a parent and she didn’t want to hurt me.

At first I didn’t believe this to be true but after confronting my wife she told me that yes she had in fact aborted our child. 

I’m in shock right now. I’m hurt, angry and upset. I just don’t understand why she didn’t just speak to me about it. Maybe we could have talked this through, but right now I’m so mad that she went behind my back and led me to believe she lost our child. I understand that my wife is the one carrying the child, and at the end has the right to make any decision she wants, but why lie about the whole situation.   

I don’t know whether to carry on with the relationship or not. I love my wife but this is a huge betrayal to me, and I can’t even look at her right now. She’s currently crying and begging me to forgive her, I’ve just gone down to the spare bedroom and locked myself inside. Please someone just tell me what to do.


Edit: I did not expect this post to blow up like this. 
My emotions are all over the place and I’m a mess right now but once everything is sorted i will try and update you on the situation.
Thank you for you support

Edit 2: [update post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hk6smm/update_my_wife_lied_about_having_a_miscarriage/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

ANSWER: While I agree with others saying her body, her choice (which at the end of the day it totally is), the fact that she lied about having a miscarriage is horrible. She led you to believe your future child had passed instead of talking to you about how she was feeling.

A marriage is supposed to be a partnership and if she can't come to you about something that will affect you both, i'd say you have a lot to think about. The fact that she lied and acted as if she lost the baby when she had no intension of carring on with the pregnancy doesn't sit right with me. To think your wife could lie so well about something so major, for presumably an extended period of time would have me questioning what else she could or has lied about.

At the end of the day if she wasn't ready to have a baby it was the right thing to do, as devastating as it may be for you. But she shouldn't have kept you in the dark and lied to you. If I was in your shoes I'd sit her down and have a frank discussion about how this has made you feel, but also listen to her and find out how she feels. There may be more to this than just "not being ready to be a parent". 

Therapy is an absolute must here. Both as a couple and individually. If you love her and want to work through this that is the first step, but it may be a long road.

I wish you luck, and I am so sorry for your loss.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife (32F) has been having an affair, and I’m broken.

My wife (32F) and I (30M) got married in September 2018 after being together for 3 years. Right before our honeymoon, we bought a house together in VA, and after we got back, pooled our remaining money and time to completely redo her old starter home in MD and sold that in early 2019. 

We both work full time jobs in Virginia. I make pretty good money, she makes even better money. My wife, let’s call her Katie, decided to pursue an MBA and started last fall. She had an educational trust that her parents started for her, and therefore didn’t ask me for any financial assistance. However, because I saw how time consuming the MBA was on top of her already large professional workload, I took it upon myself to take care of everything related to our still relatively new home - including dealing with contractors, managing all our bills, maintaining the house, taking care of our dog, purchasing/assembling furniture, yard work, cooking, cleaning, laundry, and hosting/entertaining her family that insisted on coming over at least 2 weekends every month. 

Lately, Katie had been unhappy with our relationship, complaining that I wasn’t spending enough quality time with her and not making her feel wanted. I tried to argue several times that between her work and studies, and my work and home responsibilities, that there simply wasn’t very much time to spend together in general (we would frequently not even get to eat dinner until 9:00 or 10:00 at night, and I would either need to bring her a meal to her home office, or we would quickly eat together, and she would return to schoolwork to study or percolate in group projects/session). She would argue back that the things I was doing around the house were simply my responsibility as a husband, and that while she “appreciated it,” it didn’t count towards me trying to maintain or build our relationship. We’d also been arguing a lot about other things, and combined with the lack of free time, would be intimate maybe once a month. 

But after one particularly emotional (and drunken) conversation - about 3 or 4 weeks ago now - I vowed that despite what I already thought was prioritizing her needs, that I would go even further. I began to take off work (I, unlike her, still had to go in during Covid), or go in late/leave early, stopped seeing friends, skipped workouts, and would even wait until she was occupied with something else to even take a shower, all so I could spend as much available time as possible with her between her obligations. As a result, things seemed to be slightly improving between us. 

And now we arrive at last Wednesday. As per usual, I was making dinner for us. We have a tablet in the kitchen that I primarily use for recipes. As I was finishing up, the tablet began pinging nonstop, and I checked out what was happening. As it turns out, the tablet is linked to her google credentials, and I first saw an ongoing hangouts conversation between Katie and a friend, discussing what to do about “someone’s wife” who had come to our house that day while I was at work. Scrolling through the conversation history, I found more about Katie’s lack of feelings for me, and the longing and dreaming to instead be with some guy, who we’ll call Luke. 

Physically shaking at this point, I decided to venture away from Hangouts and open her Gmail, where I found several emails, going as far back as March, between her and Luke, calling each other “babe,” “sweetheart,” and “my love.”

Unsure about what to do next, I first took screenshots of everything I could find, then stepped outside to call the only person with law experience that I knew, an executive at my company who I’d become friends with. He advised that I immediately confront her, but first call someone to come over to the house to act as a witness, in case things became physical, or if she might later try to claim they did. So I had a friend over in about 20 minutes, I confronted Katie, and she confessed to the relationship and admitted that they had been intimate several times over the past 4 months, both at hotels and in our home. 

Now completely distraught, I tried to maintain my composure, and asked her to leave. She stayed at a hotel for two nights, then despite my protest, came home on Friday, stating this was her house too. She insisted on talking when she returned, and not having a witness this time, I decided to record the entire conversation on my phone. She tried to reiterate that she had been unhappy, but despite that, had been reaching out to her friends and mother about suggestions and resources she could use to help our relationship (even though I had suggested counseling in the past, but she refused). She tried to tell me that she made a mistake, that she had already broken it off with Luke a week ago, that I was the only person she wanted to spend her life with, and the only reason she hadn’t told me about it was because her friends had advised her not to. She also said that if we truly love each other, that divorce was a mistake, and that we should be able to get through anything. I replied that love is worthless without trust, and then said that if she insists on staying here, to please stay in the guest room. Obviously free usage of her home office and the guest bathroom, but to please stay out of our bedroom/bathroom unless telling me first. 

So now I’m here. Sitting in my house alone with just my dog. Her and her aunt/uncle/cousins are currently at our neighbors house for a bbq (they don’t know about what she did). I can’t bear to go over there because I don’t want to talk to or even look at Katie, much less pretend in front of a bunch of people that nothing happened. 90% of me wants to get a divorce, but despite her feelings, I was very happy with the life we were building. We had even been talking about being pregnant by this time next year. But no matter what I decide to do, I know I don’t want to make that decision without getting more information about what I can do, what might end up happening if we proceed, and I definitely want to talk to a few VA lawyers to protect myself. We only have one joint account with less than $20k in it, and the only asset we share is our house. 

So that’s it. I’m sorry for writing so much. If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading. And I would really appreciate any and all insight, suggestions, or advice. I just feel completely destroyed, empty, and alone. Please help me.

Edit: I am absolutely stunned and overwhelmed by the level of support you all have shown me. I truly can’t believe that all of would take the time to offer your advice, kindness, and wisdom to an absolute stranger. I am doing my best to read every one of your replies, and from the bottom of my somewhat shattered heart, thank you. This has been an unbelievable light in the darkest time of my life.

ANSWER: Divorce, no kids. 10k avg with lawyers if either of you fight. 500 bucks disillusion. Both with 1/2 assets.   During my divorce to an actual Katie, who was banging a dude at her work my therapist said "someday she'll just be someone you used to know." 6 years later I can't even picture anything about her.  No kids makes it so much easier.

QUESTION: (UPDATE) I want to ask my (M34) business partner (F31) to be with me romantically. How do I go about changing the context of our relationship?

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjn6u0/i_want_to_ask_my_m34_business_partner_f31_to_be/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) 

Short update because I’m supposed to be working. And I don’t expect this to get attention because my original post didn’t but I don’t know who else to tell. 

The day after I posted originally, I told her I’m in love with her, and asked her on a “real date”. It went well. Really well, so easily and just good. And she slept next to me again that night.. I got to kiss her in public! She said it felt like our little family was right, and it really does, it feels like everything just sort of snapped into focus.

I am going to take everyone’s advice and not just spring a marriage proposal on her out of nowhere, but I want to marry this girl and have more babies with her. Because everything just makes sense now. 

And yes, she said she loves me too!!!!!!

EDIT- because people keep asking, we’ve done paternity testing and this is absolutely my baby.

ANSWER: Congrats dude. Keep it up. It's only the beginning. I hope it gets better and better for the both of you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Caught my girlfriend cheating and I CANNOT cope please help

So long story short I found texts on my(18M) gf(19) phone tonight texting her friend things like “he pounded my shit” “I got some of the best dick last night” and “omg it was so good, I couldn’t walk last night”

I’m disgusted.  It was her ex, whom I’ve always felt inferior too like she just hadn’t gotten over him even after over a year.

I’m distraught.  I don’t even have anyone else in my life rn.  My two best friends cut me off over something stupid a few weeks ago, i just moved into Uni and i have only really “clicked” with one guy friend.  My family and I don’t even get along nor communicate much.  I lost my confidant, my support system, and my best friend all in one night.

She’s REALLY sorry.  I saw her crying when she didn’t know I could see her and she was hitting the steering wheel over and over again.  I feel bad but like the lying and deception isn’t new.  I had to do it.  I told her we’re over, but she’s welcome to try to win me back or whatever idc.

But FUCK this sucks.  I have mental health issues and so my coping skills are practically nil and I just don’t know how to cope with this.  I can’t eat.  I can’t sleep and I have class in the morning.  I keep picturing the texts and visualizing him “pounding” her and I’m just disgusted.  I’m just obsessing over it and it’s 4 am in the fucking morning.

Part of me just wants to let it slide if she does show effort at getting me back.  I know in a while I’ll be ok but I just don’t know how to get from part a to part b.

Please help




EDIT:  Wow.  I don’t even know what to say.  Guys thank you so much for the overwhelming support.  I get a new notification telling me to be strong literally every three seconds.

I finally fell asleep at 7 am and there were like 40 comments on this.  I woke up and there are over 800 beautiful people telling me to be strong.  Thank you so much.  Reddit is such a beautiful place.  In the strangest way, I feel really capable of surmounting this today as opposed to yesterday.  You guys definitely played a part in that.

This is the kind of stuff that makes me remember not everyone sucks lmao.  Keep up being great in life guys :)

Thank you from the bottom of my heart!


EDIT2:  Jesus guys!  You’re all a blessing!  I just finished class and I’ve been getting notifications every three seconds!  Going to do my best to get back to everyone.

I am doing much, much better.  I’m feeling freed rather than sorry for myself now.  Thank you all.

By far the most frequent advice was to hit the gym.  I’m going to dinner rn but I’m hitting the iron directly after!

On top of this awesome wave of support from all of you, I’ve had a few good things happen today that are just making this so much better:

-  my job app for a 20$ an hour job teaching SAT Prep was praised for “outstanding qualifications”

-  I got invited to participate in drug research here at my school

- and my fucking package arrived that I’ve been waiting on for a week!

-also one of my friends who cut me off reached out to me

I’m doing well, thank you all, you’re all a gift, much love from my corner of the internet, you’re all worth a platinum in my eyes!

Cheers!


EDIT3:  I can’t believe I forgot to say, my EXGF!

I did it guys :)

Thanks for pushing me to stay strong on my boundary, y’all are the best

ANSWER: She‘s not sorry she cheated, she‘s sorry she got caught.

If she were sorry she cheated the messages to her friend would be „I fucked up and don‘t know what to do. I am so so sorry. I don‘t know what happened“ and not „I got fucked by my ex and it was great“

She showed no remorse until she got caught. 

Please don‘t let her walk all over you just because you are afraid of being alone! You are young you will find someone. 

Please use the mental health services available to you and I know it‘s old advice but go find some sort of group activity or sport you enjoy at your college. You will meet people with similar interests and new friendships will develop naturally.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Step brother [16M] came to my [16F] room at night and cut my hair with scissors. I moved out and parents want me back with him still there.

Step brother of 6 months. My mom married his dad.

So a few weeks ago in a morning I noticed my stuff in my room had moved. I told my brother (big bio brother, 23) and he didn’t take me seriously but taught me how to record my room at nights with my phone. I’ve been recording myself every night and nothing happened, so I was ready to believe that nothing had happened that night.

This weekend however, step brother came into my room at about 3:15am. He came to me with scissors, cut a small piece of my hair and left my room. It was so weird and shocking. It was a very small amount, something I likely wouldn’t have noticed. I sent the video to my siblings (brother and bio sister, 19). They told me to pack a bag immediately and picked me up and took me with them. They sent the video to parents.

Parents questioned step brother and he says he doesn’t remember doing it at all and said he was likely sleep walking and asked to see a doctor. I don’t believe him and neither do my siblings. 

Parents want to solve this problem by taking both of us to family therapy. They want me to come home and discuss this (all four of us). They say I’m not in any real danger, as he didn’t hurt me or do anything inappropriate or sexual. My siblings strongly disagree and say what he did was very inappropriate and they’re not going to let me go back there as long as step brother still lives there. Parents say they will install a lock on my door so that I can lock myself in at nights. 

Step father is upset at my siblings and claims they’ve turned this into a much larger issue than it is, he says they could have just parented the problem away by punishing and it’s not a big deal.

Honestly I keep hearing everyone with strong opinions about this and I don’t know who’s right or wrong. What should I do? Do I go back? Do I just never go back? My best friend says I should just go to the police and press charges against step brother.

tldr: Step brother snuck into my room at night and cut a small piece of my hair with scissors. I’m now staying with siblings and parents want me back, siblings want me to stay and I don’t know what to do.

ANSWER: Listen. To. Your. Siblings.

Your Mom wants you to just grin and bare it so she can have a happy little home with her new husband, both of them are in denial over how serious this situation is. Your step brother for sure needs therapy, but you do NOT need to be in the house when that happens. Stay away.

Big no. HUGE no.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Wife (38F) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. It's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks I am going to abandon her and "our twins"

This is all over the place. I really need help.

My wife and I (M42) have been married for 2 years together for 15.

All this time we had either not decided to have kids or had problems getting pregnant. After some medical testing we found out that it was near impossible to get pregnant due to some medical issues with her.

We were thinking of adopting when one day she came home and told me she was expecting. Ofcourse I was super happy . 

A week later we had an appointment at the gyno and she had some blood drawn. The test came back negative and ofcourse I was devastated but she wasn't. She claimed that she was pregnant and that the doctor was wrong. We took some more store-bought ones and they all came back negative. My wife is in complete denial. Now she claims we are having twins. She is buying them clothes and decorations and is pressuring me to start with the nursery.

I am at a loss and don't know what to do. My inaction is making her believe that I want to leave them and that I am going to doom my wife into the life of a single mom.

What the f is even happening. I love her but I don't know what to do.

Edit : forgott to add. I have tried talking her into therapy but she accuses me of gaslighting her

little update/edit: thank you guys you really helped me out. Yesterday was a bad day and you helped me get clarity. I've had a chat with our doctor who will now be handling this with us. I would like to thank most of you with useful advice and hopefully I will be able to update good news someday. But a fuck you to those that said I should divorce her because she is "crazy" and an extra fuck you to the guy that used this post to push his anti abortion agenda.

ANSWER: Oh dude. She's going through something very, very serious.

You need to contact a therapist. Like turn off Reddit right now and contact one. She's having delusional thoughts. Her preoccupation with pregnancy and her sadness have overcome her. This is way beyond Reddit's pay grade.

Good luck.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My bfs mom found my HIV medication and now his whole family knows my status.

Editing for TW: rape, abuse

Edit: the mom was told that I’m undetectable and what that means, but she’s too overwhelmed with fear to really listen and comprehend. 

For the last two months, my(28f) boyfriend (28m) have been staying with his mom during quarantine. I have my own home with roommates and so does he but she insisted we stay with her temporarily to more easily adhere to social distancing.

I am HIV positive, and my boyfriend is aware. My boyfriend is HIV negative. I’m undetectable, which means there is so little amount of virus in my body that I cannot transmit the virus to anyone else. I cannot infect another person, even through unprotected sex. If you aren’t aware of how this happens, people with HIV can take antiretrovirals to basically fight the virus and protect your white blood cells from being attacked so the virus is unable to replicate. A lot has changed over the decades.

A little background: I have been HIV positive since I was 15 years old. I have a lot of trauma associated with my status. The person who gave it to me was an adult who was extremely abusive. This person beat and raped me regularly and held my HIV status over my head as a way to control me and keep me in the relationship. For years, I felt unlovable and dirty. It took A LOT of work and therapy to overcome my own personal shame towards my status. I don’t tell anybody about my status unless they have to know – like they’re medical professionals or if I’m sleeping with someone. My family knows, but none of my friends do. Not even my closest ones. I was so afraid of the stigma of my status that it changed the trajectory of my entire life. I was suicidal for years and stayed in lots of bad relationships because I was worried nobody better would love me. I’m doing better now. I’m in a healthy, happy relationship with my boyfriend. I’m back in school, working on my career. I’m stable and independent. I’m turning my life around I’m doing a good job at it.

Well, my boyfriend’s mom found my medication. I had a pill bottle in my purse in the closet. She claims she found a pill on the floor and saw a bag sticking out of my purse and thought she would put it there. The medication was in the bag and that’s how she found it.

If I’m honest, I don’t buy her story. My medication is extremely expensive and I’ve always had dogs so I’ve always paid close attention to making sure I don’t drop any pills or leave them around. After a decade of taking medication every day, I know to pay close attention to how I get the pills out of my bottle. I never just pour them out into my hand. Even if I did actually drop a pill, I would think the normal reaction would be to set it aside on a counter or bring it directly to one of us, not go into my purse. Either way, she went through my purse and it feels like a huge invasion of privacy. I’m not sure what she was even doing in the closet to begin with. I really think she was just snooping.

Anyways, instead of coming to me or my boyfriend, she told his sister. And then his sister told her husband and their other sister. Now the whole family knows my HIV status. The mom apparently reacted with things like, “How could she do this to herself?” and “Was she not raised properly?” She’s always been judgmental towards me, but this is victim blaming at its finest. She was worried that I gave it to her son but he took a test in front of them and he is negative. His sisters are apparently not judging me for it, but his mom definitely thinks lesser of me. 

I’m so angry that I’m being judged for something that I didn’t do to myself, especially since I’ve handled it responsibly. I’m angry that she went through my stuff. I’m angry that they spread my private medical information through the whole family. There is so much trauma associated with my status and I feel like I like the control of this information has been taken from me.

His mom is divorced and I understand that she was scared for her son and didn’t have someone to talk to about it and that’s why she spoke with the sister, but she should have gone to my boyfriend directly. His mom was a nurse so she should know better than to spread people’s private medical information around. His sister also had no reason to tell the other sister. This my private medical information. My medical history and our sex life is none of their business.

As soon as I learned what she did, I packed my things and left without saying a word to her. I love my boyfriend and according to him, he stood up for me when talking to his mom and sister, but I don’t know what to do from here. His family is EXTREMELY close. They all talk every day and spend a lot of time together.  I don’t want to see them, but I’m going to have to at some point. And I don’t want to feel like I’m the “girlfriend with HIV” forever. 

I feel sick to my stomach and I’ve been crying every day. What do I do? What should I expect from my bf?


Side note: I have a virtual therapy appointment next week, so if you’re going to suggest therapy, I’m way ahead of you.

UPDATE: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/guqonf/update_my_bfs_mom_found_my_hiv_medication_and_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

ANSWER: I’m glad you have therapy lined up! 

If you are comfortable disclosing the nature of how you became HIV positive, this is the way I’d probably do it.

I would have a sit down with BF and his mother. And I would say:

“You found my medication, figured out what it was used for, and shared my status without my consent. I became HIV positive at 15 after being repeatedly raped and abused by an adult. Because of the medication you found - whether in my purse, or on the ground - I am not able to infect anyone. My HIV status was not yours to discover, but after you did, it was not yours to share, and I am hurt that you shared it with others instead of returning the medication to me and talking to me about it. This was a massive breach of trust.”

And go from there.

Your boyfriend should be supporting you 100%, no questions asked. His mother did nothing right.

Edit 1: I wrote this hastily before a call at work - I did not expect this response! I will say: this kind of conversation may very likely not go well. But it gives your bf’s mother one chance to do the right thing. If she doesn’t immediately back down and apologize and make moves to rectify, a new game plan will need to be arranged between OP and OP’s boyfriend. Bf specifically needs to be OP’s support and protector here. His family has really, really hurt OP, and his next moves set a precedent for how his family should treat her.

Edit 2: emphasis on if you are comfortable discussing.... I’m not implying OP has to discuss her trauma if she isn’t comfortable doing so.

QUESTION: Today my (19f) boyfriend (20m) said he was in the mood to kill me.....wtf???!?


EDIT TO UPDATE: I just wanted you all to know that last night while he was sleeping, I took my dog Daisy and left my boyfriend in the middle of the night. I am at a safe location, staying with Family, and have been in contact with the police trying to get an intervention order so I can me and my dog safe from him. Thank you all so very much for your support and concern. You have all saved my life!! I tried to make an update post but it kept getting removed! Thank you again 


I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about a year now and for the most part he’s been absolutely wonderful and I love him so much. 

We have a pretty intense sex life and I’m usually really chill with that!!  
However recently he’s been taking it a lil too far, like I love choking and spanking in the bedroom, but he’s started doing it in public. Like today we took our dog to the park and I said or did something he didn’t like and he spanked me!! I was shocked!

Later on in the day we were doing the deed and he started to choke me, again which I usually like. It got to a point where I properly couldn’t breath so I used our signal to stop and he just looked down at me said I’m not gonna stop because I’m in the mood to kill you. He must have seen the fear in my eyes or something and he immediately let go and like cradled me and said sorry. I thought it was just him being in the moment so I let it go. 

But it happened a second time, he was just like staring at me and was whispering sweet things to me and then it took a turn to, you’re mine forever, never gonna let you go, I’ll kill you if you leave. I recoiled cause it made me uncomfortable and he like ticked me and told me it was just a joke. 

Like I love this man but like wtf.... how do I bring this up with him?? Tbh I’m tempted to leave.... 
We both don’t have dark senses of humour so I don’t know where this came from. 

How do I address this?? What should I say?

ANSWER: Man.... you cannot play around with shit like that. Wouldn’t you rather get away and be able to see your grandkids one day? Or risk the chance this guy will not stop choking you? Unless you think you are stronger than him.... please, OP, look out for yourself. This is scary and not normal.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (36f) husband (40m) suddenly changed for the better two years ago, but no one shares my concerns that about how odd it is that he dramatically became a different person overnight because all his changes were positive

When I married my husband, I knew that he was an overweight, lazy video game nerd, and I loved him anyway for his warm heart and kind personality.

He detested exercise, stayed a low rank at his career because he put in minimum effort, and we bonded more over activities like watching movies together at home rather than going out.

He went on this camping trip with his friends two years ago, and did shrooms (he had never done drugs before, and had he consulted me I would've told him that was a terrible idea), and when he came home, it was like something had lit a fire under his butt. He completely changed interests - he never played video games again and took up running, reading books even though I'd never seen him read before except for school, and several other completely random hobbies. He became a vegetarian even though, before, he'd been a meat and potatoes guy. He worked harder at his job, then did an accelerated grad school program and ended up making tons more money.

I barely recognize him. We still have a good marriage, and I still love him, and he has motivated me to be better in the last two years, but....I can't help but wonder if those drugs knocked a screw loose. Could this be dangerous? I'm deeply concerned. I know that people change, but about all that's left of him is his warm heart. No one shares my concerns because all his changes have been positive, but I feel like he's so different maybe we need marriage counseling so I can adapt, at least...

&#x200B;

Edit:

Wow, this blew up. Thank you all, I'm still trying to read all your responses - I will read them all. I think some additional context is required: this personality change has required more than adapting to my husband becoming a new person. Our lives are very different, now. Before, we saw our friends once a week and mostly hung out around the house. Now, we are extremely social, and to put our exercise habits in perspective, we got a high energy border collie and she gets the amount of daily exercise the vet recommended. I've been caught up in a whirlwind of change I didn't expect, and it's just a lot to process, but don't get me wrong - I am proud of my husband.

I posted here to get outside perspective, and have been given lots of advice to research psychedelics. I am in the process of finding sources of information that I consider unbiased, and am looking into it. I stand by that anyone would be concerned if their husband came home from a camping trip with a different personality and completely changed their lifestyle, but I'm calming down about it.

I think I might have enough perspective from posting here to address this with my husband, now. We've talked about it, before, but I've been reluctant to voice my concerns because he's doing so well and I felt it would come off as criticism. It's possible I stewed on this for so long it became a bigger issue to me than it actually was. I think I'm going to suggest that I pursue individual therapy for a while, since hundreds of people have pointed out that the problem is with me and not him or our relationship.

ANSWER: I was an overweight, nerdy guy who detested exercise. I married and had three kids. One day I realized I had it all, a great marriage, great kids and I wanted to be around as long as possible to enjoy it. I started to exercise, eat better, which changed my attitudes about things. I still enjoy the occasional video game, but also as much or more a hiking with the family. Being in better shape allows you to do more.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (32F) husband (36M) became a robot and I don’t know how to help him.

The title sounds insane but here I go. 

We’ve been married for 6 years and have 2 kids I’m pregnant with a third. 

My husband works from 9-5, comes home, does his chores, plays with our 2 kids, talks to me for a little bit, and then goes to sleep. But he doesn’t seem to enjoy doing any of it. Like this whole thing is one big chore. 

He used to be this goofy guy who smiled and told jokes all the time, but I haven’t seen the man smile in months. 

It’s not like he’s neglecting his duties as a husband and father, but he acts like it’s just that, duties. Like hanging with the kids and me is a second job. 

I’m grateful for all he’s doing, and he makes all of our lives sooo much easier, but it’s like he’s constantly on the clock and I think he might be depressed. 

I tried asking him if he was doing ok and he tells me he’s doing “fantastic”, but I know he’s not. That’s the line he uses at work when customers try to make small talk and ask how he’s doing. 

He doesn’t take anytime for himself. He doesn’t take any breaks, he stopped playing games and stopped watching tv. He just does what I feel he thinks needs to be done and I don’t know how to help him out. 

Our sex life has become one sided. We do it frequently but only because I initiate frequently. Even if he doesn’t seem in the mood he’ll do it. Like it’s his responsibility to “make me happy.” It feels like he isn’t there in the moment, like his mind is wandering the whole time we’re intimate and that, to me, feels worse than getting rejected. 

I don’t know what’s going on, and I don’t know how to help because he won’t let me in. To anybody else he seems fine, but I know something is wrong and I don’t know how to fix this. 

I miss my husband, the guy who complained, and told jokes. Not this robotic shell that looks like him. 

Edit: Alright, wow! I didn’t expect this to blow up. I want to thank you all for your advice; I really appreciate it. It’s clear to me now that my husband is overworked and “burnt out.” 

He comes home from work in a couple hours and I’m going to sit him down and talk to him.  I’m going to tell him how I feel, and I hope that together we can find a solution that turns him back into the man he once was. 

I’m sorry if wasn’t able to respond to everyone, but I want you all to know I read every comment and response. 

I’ll post an update soon about how it goes. 

Byee!!

Edit: [update ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hmzvgt/update_my_32f_husband_36m_became_a_robot_and_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

ANSWER: Your husband sounds burnt out. He sounds completely exhausted with nothing but more exhaustion to look forward to. He's probably tired of the redundancy and depressed. He probably needs a long vacation from responsibilities and a new career.

Edit: I forgot to mention that your husband is probably telling you that everything is fine because he doesn't want you to feel guilty or leave you with the responsibilities of everything on your own.

Also, thank-you for the awards, kind strangers.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My [29f] boyfriend [25m] admitted that he forced himself on a woman several years ago.

Hello again everybody. It has now almost been two weeks since my boyfriend admitted he committed one of the most despicable acts possible against another human being. TW: rape, sexual assault, and sexual violence. If these topics hurt you in any way, please stop reading now.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ikhr8n/my_29f_boyfriend_25m_admitted_that_he_forced/

The whole situation still feels surreal. I have gone from being angry at him to being angry at myself. I have written long texts to him and then deleted them completely. I have gone through stages of denial where I thought that Jason, being such a good guy, may not have actually done anything wrong? Maybe a woman gaslighted him into feeling that he had committed a crime when she consented at the time?

Then I realized that everyone who commented on my last post hit the nail squarely on the head. He didn't go to the police to turn himself in for what he did. If he truly felt remorse, that is what he would have done. His charm and natural "understanding" of women's problems were complete ruses; many people with sociopathic tendencies are great with people. Most of all, he gets to cry and move on with his life. He gets to love another woman again. His victim? I can't even fathom what she's going through.

I finally called him two nights ago. He wanted to talk about how we could mend our relationship, but after two weeks of not hearing his voice and being scared of how I may run back to him, it hit me like a truck: I don't love him anymore. I told him that I wanted him to vacate his apartment for three hours while I gathered my belongings. He said he would do so. I ended the call by telling him that if he felt any remorse, he would go to the police and accept all charges for what he did, not contest them in court, and take his punishment. He started talking about how that wouldn't bring justice to his victim. Then he said that he loved me. Twisted fuck.

I showed up the next morning at the decided time with my sister, he was nowhere to be seen. I'm confident he won't contact me again.

Thank you all so much for helping me through this. I'm going to find a therapist as soon as possible.

TL;DR: my rapist boyfriend won't turn himself in, and I broke up with him. I safely gathered my belongings and now I'm living with my sister.

Edit: I apologize for editing the post, but after receiving a couple of private messages asking me to drop his personal information, I must make one thing clear: I will not, under any circumstances, post any identifying information about him. It is not only against sitewide rules, but if I were reckless enough to do that, he could sue me. Again, I repeat: nobody is getting his information. He is a monster. He probably deserves worse. But it will not be coming from me.

ANSWER: Thank you, but I don't want to act like this was a hard decision to make. My mind was made up and other than short periods of self-denial I knew it was over. He's a monster through and through.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My mother (43) wants me (18f) to donate eggs so she can have kids with her fiance.

Small Update: I let my sister know some of the things that are going on and we have started collecting evidence. There's a lot of small things that CPS might care to know about, like mood swings and extreme punishments. 

There's a lot to this and good God it's a mess. I go off to college in August. I turned 18 at the end of May. 

When I was about 14, my mother asked me if I would be willing to help her have a baby one day. I said yes without understanding what it all entailed. She is still holding me to this even though I have since changed my mind. 

My mom has been threatening to kick me out over my refusal. She is pressuring me to sign a contract that would bind me to one cycle sometime before I turn 30 and she has even discussed me carrying a baby for her once I'm done with school. I feel very nervous about this and I'm trying to stall/hold out until I am no longer under her roof. I can't afford to move out (Eta: until August). I'm not sure if I could eventually get out of this contract if I were to sign it, but I don't want to risk it. Her fiance is totally cool with this. I don't know what to do.

I'm trying to make plans to maybe stay with a friend, but I'm hoping to find a way out of this with my personal items. I know my mom will hold things hostage so to speak. 

Sorry if this isn't the right sub.

Edit: I am very relieved to know that the contract would be under duress and so wouldn't be upheld. :)

ANSWER: If you are leaving and your mom holds your property or valuables, or government issued IDs hostage, you can call the police.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [29M] Do Almost Nothing Around the House and My Wife [25F] is Upset?

I’m the sole earner for our household, my wife stays home. We don’t have children. Due primarily to a string of horrible jobs that led to some pretty bad anxiety issues for her, we agreed last year that she could stop working and pursue whatever hobbies, activities etc. that she wanted while I provided for us financially. 

As part of this, she agreed to take care of basically everything related to the home - cooking, cleaning, laundry, shopping and so on. I still handle a couple items, really just the garbage and the lawn. Beyond that it’s all her, and she does a great job. Coming home to a clean house and a fresh meal from a wife who’s happier than I’ve seen her in years is wonderful. She’s also able to keep herself looking even hotter than usual which is definitely fun for us both lol

Anyway that’s the arrangement we have currently, and I think it’s more than fair (as does she) - our house isn’t big at all so we’re talking maybe 2-3 hours a day max to stay on top of everything. Might be temporary as she recharges and develops new skills/interests, or it could be permanent. I’m fine with either one, it’s up to her.

She had some friends over the other evening, I was playing games in my office. I came out to grab a drink and overheard her friends commenting on our situation. They were saying it wasn’t fair that my wife had to do everything, I should be pitching in more, what is this the 1950s, shit like that. 

Ok whatever, I disagree but they can talk. Doesn’t affect me. I come out again later to get something and these “guests” actually start straight up scolding me. Same nonsense as before, I’m lazy, I need to do this and that blah blah. My wife clearly didn’t agree or intend for this to happen but was too embarrassed to say anything.

They end their rant with one of them saying “You both make messes, why should she be the only one cleaning them up?”

I probably should have just said it was none of their business and been done with it, but I was pissed and wanted to show how dumb that question was. So I responded:

“We both need money, why should I be the only one making it?”

They didn’t say much after that so I went back into my office, they left a short time later. I finish up in there and find my wife still in the living room, crying. I go to comfort her, thinking it was just out of embarrassment from what happened. But she said that what I said hurt her a lot. It sounded like I didn’t think she did enough and wanted her to go back to work.

I tried to explain that it was just a rhetorical question to make a point but she’s still upset. How can I reassure her that I’m happy with our arrangement and appreciate everything she does?

ANSWER: There are two issues here, and you are combining them.  Your wife is not upset because you don't do anything around the house as your title says, she is upset because your comment wasn't directed at the "friends" attacking you but instead it focused on her. You said yourself she isn't working because of "pretty bad anxiety issues", even if she is happier now and doesn't want to work that doesn't mean she doesn't feel bad for not contributing financially.  You should have chosen your words better and you need to apologize for that, period. It doesn't matter if it was a rhetorical question, it would be like if I knew you had something you were embarrassed about in your life and I ask a group of people a rhetorical question specifically about that thing while you are right there. 

People are saying she should have stood up for you, but I understand not wanting to being confrontation on oneself when it seems like the mob is in agreement.  You could have said something more along the lines of "This is what we have agreed on as husband and wife, if there needs to be a discussion about it then it will take place between us alone." They are assholes for the way they treated you, but you are in the wrong for the choice of wording given the situation that led to your wife being a stay at home spouse in the first place.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My (28F) boyfriend (28m) of 8 years cheated on me with his best friend's fiance and is now begging me for a second chance. I still love him but I dont know what to do.

Link to the original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/hqdk5w/my\_28f\_boyfriend\_28m\_of\_8\_years\_cheated\_on\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqdk5w/my_28f_boyfriend_28m_of_8_years_cheated_on_me/)

First of all, I'd like to say thank you for those who gave me really solid advice in my last post. A lot has happened in the last few days. Sorry I havent been replying to any of you, I just didnt think I was in the right headspace to actually hold a meaningful conversation. Rest assured I did read all of your replies. Even the really mean ones.

So where do I begin? We'll I think some of you would be delighted to know that he left me for not being supportive. Sucks to be me I guess. I guess you guys were right, I am a sucky girlfriend. He's now off to be with his brand new supportive GF.

Nah, just kidding but some of you wouldve wanted that to happen, right?

So heres what really happened...

After reading some of your comments, I started to see things from a different perspective. I never really thought of it as anything other than cheating, and it didnt help that when he came home to me that morning he claimed to have cheated on me and I guess my mind just started going to a dark place where logic goes out of the window. Its definitely not an excuse but I really wasnt in the right mindset after he said he cheated. I guess it was after the realization that this man would never willingly hurt me is when all the anger and pain of being cheated on was washed away.

I couldnt really bring myself to talk to him at first. He was on the couch blankly staring at whatever was on tv. He looked... empty. I sat beside him and told him I had no intentions of breaking up. Well, he came to life almost instantly and before I knew it, his arms were wrapped around me. He was shaking and I could tell he was crying. I was too. Remember when I said I felt my world was crumbling around me? Well for the first time in what seemed like forever, I could feel it starting to fall back into place. I didnt realize how much a simple embrace can be so calming. Everything was starting to feel right again.

Then we talked. He apologized again for cheating and when I told him I didnt think he cheated, he had a puzzled look on his face. I asked him if he gave consent and he said no. I tried to explain I guess he still doesnt realize that he was actually taken advantage of. He said the first thing that came to mind after what happened was that he cheated and was so afraid of losing me.

This man, after being raped, first thought of how much he betrayed me instead of how he was betrayed himself. I was floored. He said his first response had to be to win me back, which is why he's been going the extra mile the last few days taking care of me from a distance.

When it was my turn to speak, I told him how sorry I was for not being supportive. I jumped to conclusions without actually thinking about it clearly, which was pretty out of character for me.

A few more exchanges after that and the conversation shifted to Max and HM. I told him that I never wanted him anywhere near Max or her again and he agreed. I've always thought he was a bad influence but I never thought he'd take it this far so I never stopped him from seeing his (ex) best friend. He showed me his phone which didnt have a lock anymore. He said he blocked both of them on everything but wanted to keep the open phone policy. He said its so I can be sure he isnt back in touch with Max.

I urged him to file a police report but he was against it. He said that even if he was raped, he couldnt bring himself to do it. I didnt really know about it at first but his family and Max's family had a very long history of friendship. Their moms were college best friends and their dads work together. Not only were the two of them close, even their families were close. I thought they were just neighbors but it was more than that. I didnt know cause every time I visit his family, the topic was never brought up and I havent really met any of Max's family except for his little sister who came by to play with BF's little brother. He said he didnt want to ruin decades of friendship and would be content with just going NC with Max.

He's getting tested later today and I hope that bitch didnt give my man anything. I'm also pretty confident my BF didnt get HM pregnant cause Max absolutely hates children so Id imagine HM would be on BC given how many dudes she sleeps with.

BF and I came to the conclusion that Max most likely set the whole thing up to break us apart so he can have his best friend back. They used to be partners in crime after all, when it came to parties and picking up women. I would like to point out that I did not force him to change. He himself chose to do so but I know he did it for me, which just makes me fall in love with him even more. When we first met he was still the playboy party animal he was but he told me after hanging out with me for a few weeks that he didnt really feel like sleeping around anymore. I didnt really believe him at first, obviously. I've also noticed that a few people were bashing me for making him wait 1 year for sex. I'm sorry, I just have different views. I believe that sex is for people who love each other, so I wasnt willing to sleep with anyone I wasnt deeply in love with and didnt love me back. I dont judge people who sleep around. My BF has a high body count but I dont really hold it against him but back then, I just wanted to be sure I wasnt just a girl he bangs or a "conquest" but someone who he actually loves and sees a future with. Considering his past, I was very skeptical for a while and I had my walls up the entire time but he slowly tore them apart and I'm glad he did. That reluctant yes when he first asked me out was and still is one of the best decisions Ive ever made.

Max's plan had the opposite effect. Its rough now but I can see this experience making our relationship even stronger. I love him more than ever believe it or not and Im sure he feels the same way. The last few days have taught us both how shitty our lives would be without the other. I guess it made us value each other more? Not that either of us took the other for granted.

And yes, we are both getting therapy. Both individually and as a couple. To be honest, Im still shaken over the whole thing. Even when we cuddle, I can still imagine HM having her way with him and I cant help but cry about it. If Im still shaken up by the whole thing, I can only imagine how much worse it is for him but I'll be there for him every step of the way.

I know he didnt cheat.

I know he wont break my heart.

I know that he loves me.

I know that I love him.

Its hard right now but knowing those facts makes me confident we can see this through. One redditor pointed out that we were soulmates and I like to think that we are. I cant see myself being with anyone but him.

Thanks again for all your advice and for making me see things differently. I'll try to reply and answer questions when necessary and when I can.

ANSWER: I'm glad it worked out this way, thank you for supporting him in the end. I'm a male survivor myself, this gives me hope that we can truly start to be taken seriously soon.

Edit: You guys have been crazy kind, thank you so much. It means a lot :)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/g24fza/the\_hiring\_manager\_30sf\_where\_i\_30sf\_am/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g24fza/the_hiring_manager_30sf_where_i_30sf_am/)

I got a lot of good feedback and you guys are right; I did let my temper get the best of me in front of her on multiple occasions and that makes me a bad boss.

I went to her office unsure of what to expect. The door was locked when I got there, so I stood outside waiting. She came up behind me and said my name. She asked me if I was ready to interview and I just said yes.

We sat down in her office and she pulled out her phone and started recording. She asked me if I minded being taped and I said no.

She asked me basic interview questions, and then she asked me if there was anything that I knew I had to work on. I told her that my temper was an issue in the past, but that I have had a sudden wake-up call about my temper and that I was actively working on it. I apologized for leaving her hanging with training and that I was glad to see she was in a better position.

She told me that one of the things she had learned was forgiveness. She had left the company she was at and rehired to because they had wronged her during the merger. When she was offered the position back, it was with an apology, a raise, and now she is in a better position than when she left. She said sometimes an apology can start you down the path towards something better.

She told me that she is willing to hire me for a good wage because she knew I was good at a lot of things at my previous job. She said if I lost my temper during the trial period, it would be the end, but she was hopeful that it wouldn't happen. She asked me if I could start Friday.

She started training me today, and I definitely realized I was the problem and why she didn't succeed where I was. She is absolutely wonderful at the job with great client interactions. She should've been able to easily pick up the work I was throwing at her if she had been properly trained. I'm glad that she gave the company a second chance because she deserves everything they have given her. I hope to learn a lot from her and show her that she didn't waste her time on me.

I've also signed up for therapy to manage my anger online.

TL;DR: I ate my humble pie and went to the interview. She is giving me a second chance and I hope to be a good employee. I'm starting anger management soon.

ANSWER: Now this is wholesome. I hope you do actually go to anger management classes OP. Best of luck to you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (31/m) am in a submissive relationship with my girlfriend (28/f) and I just realized she doesn't actually love me

My girlfriend (of 1 1/2 years) and I follow an "FLR" which means female led relationship. It's basically a lifestyle fetish thing. Without being too specific I basically have dedicated my life to making her happy in a seemingly selfless way (it's not really selfless I guess because I enjoy it myself, but that's all I get from it). She controls all the finances, we only do stuff if she wants to do it, we never do what I want, sex is only for her, I do all the chores, etc. The whole relationship is basically about double standards that benefit her and that don't benefit me, to put it simply. But that's just how our relationship is. I've struggled with it at times but I enjoy it overall.

I have a sciatica issue with my back. It's normally not a big deal but over the weekend I seriously screwed it up. It was totally agonizing and I had to go to the hospital. My girlfriend was completely unsupportive and didn't care about me at all. She told me to power through the pain but I was like rolling around in pain almost. It was clearly impossible. I called her by her first name by accident and she yelled at me for being disrespectful. I had to drive myself to the hospital because she wouldn't let me use the phone. She was just completely annoyed about the whole thing. I think she told me that she hopes I catch the virus but I wasn't sure. I was out of it as I was leaving the house. They gave me some muscle relaxers in the hospital and I'm doing better now, but I'm trying not to exert myself too much until the disk completely goes back into place.

Also, while she does sometimes treat me badly as part of the "role", she didn't seem to be doing that here. I mean she knew it was serious, and I think she just revealed exactly how she felt. I always thought that even though we had this relationship, that she did actually care about me. But because of the way our relationship was, it didn't come out much. She loved me in her own way, I thought. But these last days, I realized that she actually just views me as a literal servant. She doesn't care about me as a person, only as submissive partner. Even calling it a partnership doesn't make sense.

Maybe this is the wrong place to post this but I wanted to get a vanilla perspective with people that have normal, healthy relationships. Am I overthinking this? Do you think I might be able to make the relationship work long-term? And if you have dabbled in d/s stuff I'd be curious to hear if any of you have had similar experiences. Thanks.

ANSWER: Regardless of your type of relationship, your partner should always care and love you.  
This is the baseline. It doesn't matter how you manifest or arrange it, if there is no love and caring, then it's abuse even in vanilla relationships.

You need to leave and find someone who cares for you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My antivax mom started crying after I said I didn't want to associate with anti-vax protesters and threatened not to help me pay for college if I got a flu shot.

So, to preface, I (17F) am an incoming freshman in college. I'm going to a UC (won't say which for obvious reasons), but I got into the school's semi-competitive engineering program and it was one of my top choices for college. I absolutely love the school. Unfortunately, the UC system just instituted a new rule that all students need to get a flu shot before they can attend. My mom (50F) has been incredibly upset about this for the past two days.

She called me up about an hour ago to talk about how I wanted to "deal" with the problem of having to get a flu shot.

She was asking me to reconsider going to another college halfway across the country because they don't require flu shots. The school is not nearly as good in terms of engineering, it's a long way away and it's expensive as hell for out of state students. I have zero desire to go there. I told her this wasn't the hill I wanted to die on, I don't think getting a flu shot is really that big of a deal and I certainly don't want it to be the reason I end up not going my top choice college.

She got kinda angry with me and basically implied that she wouldn't pay for me to attend college if I got the shot, I would be completely on my own.

Then she said, "Why don't you march your protester self (I organized a BLM march in our city back in June, so she's referencing that) down to city hall. I'm sure you can find people who will protest with you."

And I responded, "I'm not sure I want to associate with those people," which I know was super mean and sounds awful to me in hindsight. She started crying and hung up on me after I said that.

My mom and I seem to be at odds about everything right now. She was upset with me for organizing the BLM march, she doesn't like most of my political views, and she's even threatened to burn a book I was reading by Richard Dawkins about evolution because "he advocated for cannibalism" (???) and she seems to vaguely think evolution is a lie, despite not be religious so far as I can tell.  I also had to get a series of vaccinations in ninth grade to attend my high school, which my dad took me to get and which my mom is still extremely upset about almost four years later. I feel like this whole disaster is going to be the final straw though.

I just really need some advice on how to deal with this before she comes home from work and gets super mad and starts yelling at me.

Edit: Okay, I just want to add because people keep suggesting this, I can't exactly go behind her back here and get the shot on my own. Like, physically yes I can walk to Walgreens and get it. But being allowed to go to college = got the flu shot. She will know, and therein lies the problem. Also, I know my mom sounds kinda bad on paper (or "on Reddit") but she really is a loving and caring person who is attempting to look out for me in her own way, so please stop with the name-calling. I came here asking for help, not asking you to shit on my mom. It's just not helpful or productive. Thanks.

Edit 2: Just want to let everyone know that I am reading every single one of your comments. I want to answer everyone's questions, but that might take a while as I'm still working out how to deal with this situation with my dad. Thanks to the people who have been helpful, supportive, and encouraging with their advice. I'll update soon.

ANSWER: It will be a rude awakening for her once she realizes most colleges REQUIRE you to have a meningitis shot!

================================================================================

QUESTION: Boyfriend keeps trying to “upgrade” or “improve” me by calling me chubby

I’ve F(23) been dating my boyfriend M(27) for a year. I am 5”4’ and 125lbs. He pursued me. Slowly he keeps making more and more negative comments about my appearance. 

He made me a workout and eating plan and constantly asks if I follow it. He basically wants me to go vegan. Honestly I’m not into the vegan lifestyle and I don’t eat horrible. When we order in yesterday I got baked ziti. He looked at me and said how could I be ordering this when we both agreed I need to lose weight.

Everytime I try to dump him over this, he tells me I don’t understand where he is coming from. He told me I’m average and he wants me to stand out. That he noticed I have low self esteem and he is trying to make me confident and be happy with myself. Everyday he asks me if I did my work outs. 

He will send me photos of other girls and say if I follow what he says I will look like that. He REALLY pursued me and now I feel like he’s killing my self esteem. Why pursue someone so hard if you aren’t that attracted to them? He told me if I lose fifteen pounds I’ll be perfect.

He sends me pictures of women who have post pregnancy bodies or not good bodies at all and he tells me that they are like me, that they are chubby and not curvy. Or he will send me pictures of girls I don’t consider pretty and say if I listen to him I will look like that, I just need to lose weight. I tell him I think I’m thinner than those girls and he tells me that he has better eyes. 

Honestly at this point I don’t want to break up because I feel no one will find me attractive. I feel like I want his approval. I’ve been wearing baggy clothes because I’m so ashamed of my body. I use to like my body but now I’m ashamed.

Why is he dating me if I’m so unattractive? How do I gain my self esteem back? Why pursue me?

Edit: I would like to thank everyone for the overwhelming response. I can’t get back to everyone, but I appreciate each and every message. Honestly I didn’t realize my situation was that bad, I am going to assume he had me under control. This really was reassuring and I’m so happy I found this community and made this thread. I broke up with him over text message and explained to him how you talk and treat me is not how you talk to anyone let alone your girlfriend who you are suppose to love. That I hope he changes for the next girl he dates because he’s a miserable person and no one deserves his abuse. I blocked his number, I’m sure he might try to show up at my house, but I just felt the need to end it as soon as possible. I think I’m going to take some time for myself since my self esteem is still in the gutter, but thank you all 💕

ANSWER: > I’m nervous no one else will want me

AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY HE DOES IT!!!!


It's a psychological manipulation, ~~called "negging".~~  

It is a series of negative comments designed to make you feel you can't risk losing  him.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend [22M] spiked my [21F] drink the other night.

I’m full aware that I might be overreacting a little, but some outside opinions would help ease my mind either way.

So my boyfriend \[22M\] and I \[21F\] have been together for about 2 years now and currently share an apartment in our college town. I don’t drink. I don’t have a reason or anything, just never acquired a taste for alcohol. I’ll take a sip of my boyfriend or a friend’s drink just to try it every now and again, but I usually don’t like it. I go to bars with friends and hang out with them all the time, and I’ll usually just have a soda or a water and offer to drive if need be.

My boyfriend was a little stressed the other day since he had to work during Black Friday, so he was tired when he came home. We were watching something on Netflix when he gets up and says he’s going to make himself a drink. I offered to do it for him, but he just said “no no, don’t worry about it, I’ll bring you a water.” So he comes back with his drink and a flavored water for me, and when I sipped it, something tasted off about it. I only took a few more sips of it before I just put in on the coffee table and ignored it.

He asked me why I wasn’t drinking it, which was kind of a strange question to me. I told him it tasted a little off and maybe I bought a bad case or something. He immediately seems to get frustrated and tells me to just drink it so it doesn’t go to waste. Push came to shove, and turns out he put vodka in my water. When I asked him why he would do that without telling me, he said that it was a fantasy of his to have drunken sex with me, and it was “getting ridiculous” that I wouldn’t get drunk so we could do that. He has never communicated this to me before. I had no idea. I dumped my drink out into the sink, and then he was angry at me for wasting alcohol. Now, I’m scared. He put something in my drink without my knowledge, and that scared me. I’m not sure what to do now.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm realizing now that I am, in fact, under reacting. You guys are all right, I can't seem to stop thinking about this a few days after the fact, so that must mean something. I'm currently packing a bag before I head off to class in about an hour. I called a friend of mine and she is gonna meet me on campus after my class and I'm gonna stay with her until I can figure out where I'm staying for the remainder of the semester. Thank you all for knocking some proper insight into me. I seriously appreciate it.

EDIT AGAIN: Got out of class, currently with a trusted friend and heading over to her place. I tried calling my "boyfriend" with no answer, I'll handle that later. But, I'm feeling pretty apathetic about the whole situation right now. Though I'll admit that my friend got a good laugh out of me by saying "you look like you need a fucking drink."

LAST EDIT: It's the next day, and I'm logging in to find over 800 more comments and over 20 DMs. First of all, all the DMs have been super kind and I appreciate every single one of them. Seriously, thank you. Second of all, the comments here started to get a little controversial as to whether it was smart of me to leave or not. I mean, what's done is done, so it doesn't really matter now. Some people might disagree, but to me, a 2-year relationship is not very long, so I was no longer concerned about "destroying a 2-year relationship."

My friend and I went back to that apartment later last night because I decided I did want to talk to my (now ex-) boyfriend in person instead of over the phone. I know some people might not agree with me doing this, but again, what's done is done. I expressed why I left, I expressed that he lost my trust (and I did not accuse him of rape). My friend had no influence on this conversation, she remained silent the whole time. This is when he finally apologized. He followed it up by saying "if you'd just have a drink like a normal adult-" but he immediately took it back and apologized again. My name is not on the lease for the apartment, so I took the rest of my things, let him keep anything that was in the kitchen, and my friend and I left. There was no yelling, no harsh arguments, nothing. Just a clean cut-off. I'll go back home to my parents this weekend to explain everything and then I'll figure out where to live for the remainder of the school year. Thank you guys for giving me advice, and while I didn't respond to all of you, know that I do appreciate every opinion that was given here. As far as the status of whether this act will be reported or not, I have chosen not to share with the internet.

ANSWER: You are not overreacting at all. He lied to your face, spiked your drink, urged you to drink it and threw a fit when you chucked it away. The whole thing is extremely immoral. He clearly demonstrated that he has no respect for your bodily integrity. 

Chances are his disrespect for your personhood would extend to other occasions as well. If I were you, I wouldn't stay to find out if he would go through with raping me or not.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife wants to punish our daughter for touching herself

I(30m) have a daughter(6f) and a wife(28f)

Last night my wife walked into our daughters room and caught her with her hands down her pants. My wife is very religious and thinks that masterbaition is a sin. She scolded our daughter and asked me what a good punishment would be for her. I told her that she shouldn’t be punished and needs to go and apologize to her for scolding her.

This started an argument between us where she accused me of allowing sinful behavior and said that our daughter needs to be spanked. I took my daughter with me to stay at my brothers house because I don’t want my wife to punish her for something completely natural.

She text bombed me all night and I’m having second thoughts on our marriage. What should I do

Edit:we never spoke about this during our discussion on how we would raise her

ANSWER: The child is 6. She doesn't even know what's she doing. Many children her age and younger touch themselves as a way of exploring their body, its not sexual for them. If you punish her for it she's going to have very warped views on sex when she is older and it will damage her in relationships, leading her to feel disgusting when she engages in sexual behavior. You really need to talk to your wife about it. Would any kind of couple therapy help? I don't know, your wife is obviously very into her beliefs it will be a hard thing to change. If you do divorce who will look after your daughter? She will be able to punish her for these things if your not in the picture as much

================================================================================

QUESTION: My gf was raped and became pregnant. I broke up with her because she wanted to keep the baby

Really, really shit situation.

2 months ago, my GF was raped. It was done in a park. She didn't want to report it and went into a full breakdown, wouldn't speak to police, go to hospital etc. I couldn't force her, so I just stayed with her.

She was, obviously, in a really shit state since, and I've been with her, by her side, listening to her, helping her. We went to therapy, and she knows I'm there for her. She has a history of depression, and I've been really worried.

Last week, we found out she was pregnant. I was abroad for 2 months before the rape on work, and can back early to care for her. So the baby definitely isn't mine. She is 100% sure it's the rapist's.

So we had a discussion. She is a devout Catholic. We initially decided on a abortion, but after she speak to her Mother, she has decided to keep the baby, saying that isn't the baby's fault.

I flat out told her that I would not help raise a baby of a guy who raped her. She cried and begged me not to leave. I told she is the one making the choice - either she keeps the baby and I leave, or she aborts the baby and I stay. I would not let this go.

She didn't want either of those things to happen, so I told her we were done...

I feel shit. Was i wrong?

ANSWER: 1. It sucks that she was raped.
2. It’s perfectly fair that she chose to keep the child.  Abortion is a boundary issue for Catholics.
3. It’s perfectly fair that you don’t want to raise a rapists child.  That’s a boundary issue for you.

Sometimes people are incompatible.  You two obviously were.  You shouldn’t feel guilty for respecting your own boundaries.

Pro-tip: don’t date people with radically different religious, moral, or political beliefs.

There are a lot of fish in the sea.  You two both made tough decisions that respected each of your boundaries.  You weren’t wrong.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (17m) am basically grounded until my 18th birthday in May because I was caught with condoms. I don’t talk to my parents anymore and they are hurt.

Hi. 

I (17m) and my girl (18f) have been dating since last November and started having sex in June. I always keep my condoms under my bed because nobody just goes snooping under my bed. Mid July my dog was under my bed and he took my condom box and ran out with it. I stopped him in the hallway and took them back but my mom had already seen it. She snatched it out of my hand & started yelling for my dad. He came, she held the box up and pointed at me, and they both looked so disappointed and I felt very ashamed. They ended up breaking me and my girlfriend up and stalk my every move to make sure we aren’t together. Although we’re not “together” anymore, I find ways around their blocks when I can. My parents have decided that COVID is a great opportunity to do some family bonding. They bought board games, made every Saturday movie night, and want everyone to take turns talking about their day. I often start studying so I am too busy to have to join. However sometimes they will force me to join. I just sit there silently or I don’t engage at all. I don’t mean to hurt their feelings- there just isn’t anything I want to say to them. My dad got angry a couple of days ago because of my silence with them. He screamed about how I haven’t had a real conversation with them in basically two months. I let him scream and I still stayed silent. Again, I just don’t have anything to say to them.. At all. However, my dad’s yelling did make me feel like a terrible kid for not speaking to them. I guess I should start talking to them, but I just don’t want to. I know that family is important and you should never hold grudges towards your family, but my feelings feel so set in stone that I don’t think I can bring myself to have a true conversation with them. Is there anyway I can just get over myself and speak to my parents?

ANSWER: 8 months...for rubbers?? Holy shit! People get less prison time for personal amounts of blow.

I DEEPLY hope it's just something they said in anger. Damn! I'm sorry op. Maybe they will back down a d bit in time.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (28/f) dog growled at my niece (3/f) after she spent an entire evening harassing him. Now my brother (31/m) wants me to put the dog down.

Hi everyone. I have fostered a multitude of dogs in my life, and dealt with a lot of behavioral problems--dog aggression, cat aggression, food aggression, separation anxiety, super high prey drives...I've seen it all, and I've certainly encountered my fair share of dogs who weren't safe around small children. So I feel extremely confident in saying my current 5 year-old lab mix is safe for kids. He's basically a gigantic teddy bear, and loves everyone.

However, it's always been my personal philosophy that dogs (and any other animal, really) should never be left alone with young kids, even if it's the sweetest, most mild-mannered dog in the world. The kids don't understand when they're pushing the dog past its limits, and the dog cannot reasonably be expected to put up with being harassed long after it's signaled that it would like to be left alone.

My niece has never been good with my dog. She pulls his tail, climbs on/lays on him, hits him, pulls his ears, gets in his face and yells at him, and never gives him a second to himself unless she's forced to. He is basically a saint with her, but every dog has its limits. I stay as on-top of this behavior as I can, forcing her to leave him alone when it starts to seem like too much, and locking him away in a bedroom if she won't. My brother and SIL (30/f) really just don't get it, though. I've tried to talk to them about this behavior a bunch of times, and they know it's wrong, but they think it's wrong in the same way that her refusing to share or not picking up her toys is wrong. They don't understand that it's dangerous, and that if she was left alone long enough, my dog might lose it and attack her. This has been going on for over a year, I've tried to have this conversation with my brother over and over, but he always acts like I'm criticizing his parenting. Which is not the case; I don't think my niece is especially bratty or out of control for a kid that age, it's just that this behavior is dangerous to both her and my dog, and it needs constant intervention. The same way that a small kid playing with the stove isn't especially bratty, it's just especially dangerous, and needs to be curbed ASAP. I even tried having a dog trainer friend explain this to him, and he still didn't get it. 

I've tried to come up with excuses for why we can never meet at my house for our family hangouts, but I couldn't think of one the other day, and my brother and niece came over. I was cooking dinner and not paying enough attention to make sure my dog was okay (which was absolutely my fault, and I accept responsibility). I asked my brother a few times to keep her away from my dog, but he kept saying she was fine. I did move my niece away from him a few times, but I wasn't vigilant enough, and my dog ended up getting to the end of his rope and growling at my niece.

I immediately grabbed my dog and brought him into my bedroom. I did not punish him at all; frankly, I'm glad that he signaled loud and clear that he was uncomfortable. I would never want to discourage him from doing that, because then next time, he'd skip the growling and go straight to attacking. I came out of the room, ready to talk to my brother about how this is what I've been talking about. But he was furious, yelled that my dog is a menace who should be put down, and left.

I completely understood his reaction. That's his daughter, and he was afraid for her, and nothing else mattered to him. But he hasn't calmed down at all since this happened, and won't talk to me except to say my dog needs to be put down and he won't be speaking to me until it's done. He's also tried to involve our parents, who said they will absolutely not be getting involved (they know my niece's behavior with my dog has been a problem in the past). I have not heard from my SIL at all, which makes me think she might agree with me. Knowing her personality type, I don't really think she'd sit out a fight like this if she thought my dog was dangerous.

The way I see it, this is solely my fault and my brother's fault. I shouldn't have allowed my niece to harass my dog; I knew what could happen, and I was more concerned about how upset my brother got when I tried to bring it up, than I was about my niece's safety. I should've just said my niece wasn't allowed around my dog until she got a bit older, and dealt with whatever fallout there was within my family. Similarly, my brother should've kept a better eye on his kid, and not been so defensive when I tried to explain the problem. My dog, on the other hand, put up with being harassed for over a year, and when he was finally pushed to his limits, signaled very loudly (and harmlessly) that he needed to be removed from the situation. He is not dangerous, and I will not put him down.

My brother is now saying that the entire family has sided with a dog over his child, which is not the case. It's just that there are lots of other solutions to this problem. I am perfectly happy to crate my dog when they come over, or leave him in another room, or just never have them over again and hang out somewhere else. There's no reason for my niece to ever see my dog again, and I'd be happy to talk over a solution with him. It's just that he won't talk to me at all, and I don't know what to do. Should I give him more time to cool off? Should I go over to his house and try to talk? I don't want to ruin this relationship, we are very close, but I'm just not putting my dog down over this.

tl;dr After a year of warnings and my brother refusing to do anything about it, my dog got fed up and growled at my niece. Now he wants my dog put down, and won't talk to me until I do it.

ANSWER: Your brother is being an ass, and I'm sorry. I'd let him pout it out. You going to him to talk it over is only giving him what he wants: attention. It's not his daughter's fault or the dog's fault: it's his and his wife's fault for not teaching their daughter how to play with your dog and when to leave your dog alone.    If they want to be this ridiculous and ruin your relationship with them over it, that's on them.

Edit: You beautiful people of reddit. I’m overcome (and honestly overwhelmed) with the outpouring of comments and support and awards and DMs. I just got home from work and am crying but this is a good cry. It’s been a really awful year and yesterday was brutal but logging on to this has just been the most special thing. I promise to read all your comments and DMs but it’s going to take some time haha. People who spent their coins on awards — that’s very sweet of you and I’m surprised that you’d do that on a throwaway but I want you to know that it honestly touched my heart that strangers can be this caring about a nobody. I don’t feel alone like I did last night when I posted. THANK YOU. I still have no idea the best way to leave this situation but I’m definitely not signing up for a throuple which I made crystal clear to my husband at 4am. Also, my manager pulled me aside today and asked me if everything is okay because I obviously didn’t sleep and look super gross I think from the throwing up and not eating. I just told him what happened because I couldn’t think of a lie on the spot. He took me to his office and searched our legal Bar and legal help and divorce mediation and looked me dead in the eyes and said if I tell anyone at work he’ll deny it so then I broke down sobbing in his office which was really not my finest moment. So it turns out he has a soul and gave me Monday off in his words to “get yourself to a lawyer but keep it quiet from your husband”. So on Monday my husband will think I’m at work but I’ll be seeing what my next steps should be from a legal perspective. Speaking of my husband, I asked him to give me some space for the next few days and he’s on the couch. My best friend texted me a few times today but I’ve just left her on read. This was a long edit! I’m going to eat something and sleep now. Thank you for caring reddit. 

Okay, let me start out by saying fuck 2020. My husband lost his job in April, and has been home while I have been working extra shifts (making $12/hr) to keep us from going broke. Yes, I’ve been out of the house more than at home. Yes, I haven’t been super active in bed because I am really exhausted all the time from working 70 hours a week STANDING ON MY FEET all 70 hours. I thought he’d appreciate that I am working so we have things like food and a place to live. Instead he and my best friend have been fucking while I’ve been at work. She lost her job too. They’ve always gotten along with each other and I’ve never felt jealous or threatened that they have hung out together just the 2 of them over the years. One very drunk night in 2009 she and I did make out but it was a one time thing and I didn’t enjoy it. I thought I could trust them and that they were just friends. Obviously, I’m an idiot. 

Enough backstory. I came home tonight and found them snuggling on the couch watching tv. Like in a spooning position, but it was very obvious it was intimate. They didn’t panic, but she sat up. Then he sat up. At this point I felt my stomach turn into a rock and I felt dizzy. No word of a lie, my body went into some kind of shock? I just walked to the bathroom and closed the door and sat on the toilet. I just started crying after I have no idea how long. I threw up. I heard them whisper talking but couldn’t make out what they were saying, but then they knocked on the bathroom door and asked if I was ok, and I told them “obviously fucking not.” They didn’t backpedal or deny anything. They didn’t admit to fucking then, but my best friend said we should all probably talk about what’s going on. 

I stayed in the bathroom. We talked through the door. That’s when my husband said “ok, yes, we didn’t want you to find out like this, but we have been in a relationship since July.” He said some more things but I honestly can’t remeber them because my ears were kind of ringing? And I kept thing about him saying relationship. This wasn’t a fling or a one night stand. I could maybe forgive that but a real relationship? Isn’t marriage supposed to me mean just and I are in a relationship? So he says whatever and then my best friend says “so what do you think?” I missed everything he said obviously so I told her that and she said “so you missed the part about all three of us living together?” After me asking what? my husband clarified that she would stay on the couch but they’d keep each other company during the day and I could be with her too if I wanted (she knows I don’t want this because we would have made out more than that one time in 2009 right?) I know she needs to move out of her place because no job=no rent payment. I had told her in the past she could always crash at my place, but I never meant like this. How could she not know that? Is my best friend an idiot? Am I an idiot? 

I need advice. Yes, tell me that I’m the idiot I am for trusting them and having bad judgement and not doing my “wifely duties”. I own all those things. I just need help figuring out my next steps. I don’t want to be in a throuple and I don’t even want to look at either of them. It’s 3:30am and I can’t sleep and don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve been used. I don’t know even if I leave if I’d still have to pay for my husband’s expenses because he’s not working? Which would mean I’m paying for them to have a relationship, which idiot me has been doing since July and I really hate my life right now. 

TL:DR All work and no play makes THROWRA_justfml a fucked over wife and friend.

ANSWER: Sincerely from the bottom of my being 

#LEAVE HIS BROKE ASS WITH THAT BROKE BITCH

How stupid can he be, cheating on the sole person who you’re ENTIRE lifestyle is dependant on?
Let them rot, it’s a blessing in disguise that you found out their true characters.

QUESTION: My (31M) dad (77M) just tested for positive for coronavirus and it's likely he'll die. What should I talk to him about for the next week?

My dad is 77 and has a compromised immune system (he's been on prednisone, an immunosuppressant, for a rarer form of vasculitis, which has affected his lungs.) It's quite likely he will die. We've had a rocky relationship in the past (typical Asian dad not getting along with/opening up to his Asian-American son) and I'm worried that he'll die before I really got a chance to ever get to know him. What are good things I could try to talk to him about this week while I have time?

ANSWER: I " interviwed" my father in law about 2 weeks before the cancer took him.   I asked him his favorite stories about his kids, his favorite various things,  his hopes for his 3 kids...    I wrote down what he said for my husband and his 2 sisters.    I completely forgot about that until I read this post.   I need to dig out that notebook.
OP-  i'm so sorry your family is going through this.   I hope you're able to find peace with your father.  God speed.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (25F) husband (26M) broke our dogs leg, I'm worried for the child I'm currently carrying.

Hello all, throw away for obvious reasons. 

So, I'm a big pet lover. We have several dogs, reptiles, frogs and small animals. 

I work in the pet care industry and have recently lost my job due to the shutdown. 

That being the case, I've been home a lot more often, and I noticed the animals aren't attached the him like me. I thought nothing of it, as I care for them mainly and had most of them before we got together. 

Our pets have their own room, and yesterday I went to let out dogs out and our 5lb Chihuahua mix was limping and putting no weight on his leg. My husband jokingly said a few minutes before I checked on him, "I got Rufus to stop scratching the door." 

I thought nothing of it until my poor dog was unable to move. 

I took him to the vet and they did x-rays and let me know Rufus's hip was broken. They said being so small it could be because he jumped off the furniture and hurt himself, as he's rather old as well. 

My husband later admitted that he lost his temper, picked Rufus up the the scruff, and beat him. 

He feels incredibly guilty and wants nothing to do with any of the pets now. 

I found out yesterday I'm pregnant, and I'm worried he may loose his temper with a newborn much worse then Rufus's constant scratching. 

What do I do? I love this man and we've been married half a decade now.

ANSWER: Troubling that he would beat a small animal and then make a joke about it. Have you talked to him about your worries over his temper?

I(24f) have a husband(30m) and a new born child.

My husband admitted to wanting a child knowing I didn’t so he poked holes in his condoms hoping to get me pregnant. When I found out I was he claimed that it must be meant to be since we took all of the precautions we could. I wanted to abort but he got mad and told me that I’m not killing his child.

When he told me what He did I started crying that he put me through so much pain during the pregnancy and risked my life(almost bled out) instead of finding someone who wants kids. I’m not sure what to do, I need advice

ANSWER: This is a form of sexual assault and domestic violence called reproductive coercion. Google it. There are tons of resources.

Get evidence. Find out what the laws in your country/state are around it and if you are able to, press charges. Even if you can't press charges get a divorce.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (29/F) husband (30/M) helped cover up his friend’s affair and can’t understand why I’m angry at him.

For context: My husband and I have been together for 7 years. He has a best friend ‘Liam’ (30) who is married to ‘Eleanor’ (31) and they’ve been together longer than us. I’ve been friends with Eleanor almost as long as I’ve known my husband, I met her through my husband/Liam.

A month ago, my friend called me in tears to tell me she found out her husband was having an affair. She confronted him and he swore he would end things and focus on their marriage.

Two days ago, her and Liam called my husband to ask him to confirm Liam was going to spend the evening with him, my husband said he was. I know he was lying because we had plans that evening so I confronted him about it. He got defensive and said he was only helping his friend out and it wasn’t a big deal because he only needed time alone and that Eleanor was too controlling. We got in an argument and eventually I asked him if he knew Liam had had an affair. He denied it but he’s a bad liar, so I knew he was BSing. I asked him how long he’s been covering for him, but he refused to answer any of my questions. When I told him I was going to let Eleanor know Liam wasn’t going to be with my husband he got really upset and told me I shouldn’t do that. We kept arguing over it and I eventually told him we should cancel our plans and he could really go hang out with Liam since helping him was so important to him.

I ended up moving into the guest room and haven’t really spoken to my husband much since. He keeps telling me he doesn’t understand why I’m so angry since it’s not like he was the one having the affair, but I really can’t look at him the same way.

How do I explain to him why I’m so upset with him? Am I overreacting?

TL;DR – my husband helped his friend cover up his affair, knowing I was friends with his wife. He now doesn’t see why I think it's a big deal.

ANSWER: I would explain it to him like he is in Eleanors shoes. Ask him how he would feel if he found out you where having an affair and Eleanor lied to him about being with you.

My brother is gay and together with his fiancé for now 7 years.In November 2019 he and his fiancé were looking into adoption or surrogacy.I offered to be their surrogate with his fiancé's sperm, that way the child would be as close as possible to being their biological child.

Now in 2020 after 2 failed IVF cycles I have just learned that the embryo took and I am pregnant.Their wedding is next week.Should I tell them that the IVF worked and their child is on the way right now before their wedding, or should I wait until after?

Edit: Ok I will tell them in a few hours that way they are at both at home.

ANSWER: Congratulations to everyone! I’d say sooner the better, it’s a happy moment to be shared and I’m sure they’d want to be there throughout the pregnancy. Not sure if you wanted to go for a surprise kind of thing.

QUESTION: Update: I (32 F) work overnights. My father-in-law (60s M) keeps bad mouthing me and telling everyone I'm lazy. I'm afraid people are starting to buy it.

Hey all!

Original:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/fdzm9q/i\_32\_f\_work\_overnights\_my\_fatherinlaw\_60s\_m\_keeps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fdzm9q/i_32_f_work_overnights_my_fatherinlaw_60s_m_keeps/)

I dealt with my family members at a family gathering over the weekend. I saw my sister (one of my family member who had been texting me) and reminded her that I am asleep at 3 or 4 pm when she texts. If she texts me first thing in the morning, like when she leaves for work at 7, maybe I can do whatever favor she needs before I go to sleep. I told her that I wouldn't be adjusting my schedule to do her favors. She seemed to understand.

Over the weekend, my husband and I sat down with my father-in-law one last time to try to get him to understand that I am a medical professional, I work nights, and that my nights are as hard as working a day shift, often times harder.

I brought up my MIL, and reminded him how she called 911 at 2 am when she had her first heart attack. I told him the person on the other end of that phone had a real job, the EMTs who came to take her to the hospital had real jobs, and the ER Nurses and Doctors that treated her had real jobs. I told him that yes, I could take a day shift, but I would be unhappy in the end because I'm just not wired to be awake during the day (today is an exception because I'm on vacation and had a dentist appointment.)

Well, those who guessed that this was way more about my job were right. After the discussion, he point blank told me that my chosen hours weren't conductive to having children. When I reminded him that when his son and I got married 10 years ago, we both agreed that we weren't having children, he had some choice words.

My husband kicked him out of our house, and my family will stop inviting him to family gatherings.

It's not the outcome I wanted, but hopefully he'll come around.

TL;DR: It was about children, not about my job. We are currently no contact.  


Edit: To be clear: He did not live with us, but near us. My husband kicked him out of our house that evening.

ANSWER: >heart attack

genius

>My husband kicked him out of our house, and my family will stop inviting him to family gatherings.

good work

QUESTION: UPDATE 2: I [31M] found out my fiance cheated during her [30F] bachelorette party, planning on leaving

I am making this as I feel I owe it to all of you. The amount of PM's and responses have been incredible. Many of the decisions i have taken has come from people who supported me on reddit. Both the negative and positive comments have helped me and I would like to thank all of you for taking the time to write me and support me.

Yesterday I was having my phone spammed by many family members from her side, and friends. The only person I responsed to was the sister with part of the conversation where she and the sister talks about it all. I didnt include anything in the response except an image the conversation, and the sister went pretty much silent after that (until later).

During the day i contact the co-owner of my business and let him know the full story, he told me to take as much time as I need and even adviced me to head off to a vacation (this guy is a childhood friend of mine, i dont trust anyone as much as him). My plans have changed a bit, I am still staying at this hotel for another few days and then perhaps moving on to the friend I was supposed to go to. I called him up and let him know I want to head off somewhere, perhaps a trip to somewhere nice, another country or something, its all still not yet 100% decided, but I know i will be leaving for somewhere. He said he would be up for joining me if it could be during the upcoming weeks since he is still on holiday from his work. We will see how that turns out...

Later in the day I responded to my wife, the calls kept coming in less frequently since I sent that message to her sister... i had this gut feeling she was going to come with an excuse of some sort.
I picked up the phone and first thing i hear is a "torn up voice" if u can say that in english. I could hear she had been crying all day and was in a messed up state. She kept begging me to come back, that there is an explanation to everything and that she loves me. She I have misunderstood the entire situation... I could hear the sister and someone else in the background (dont know who the other person was, maybe her friend?). Anyway I told her to explain it to me right then and there. She said because I only seen a small part of the conversation its all been misunderstood, that I should come back home, that she loves me and that i have taken a rational decision to leave without a real reason. During the entire conversation i was just giving really short, empty answers in a cold way like "yea, ok, what, explain it to me"...
After she told me its all a misunderstanding I told her to call me back in 10 minutes, and to check messenger.
After I hungup, i sent her the entire conversation log, with a ton of screenshots (not all of them, but most of the important ones). It didnt take 2 minutes for her to call back, crying hysterically saying sorry for everything, saying she wants to die rather than to lose me. She said she was "forced" by her friends and sister to have fun one last time, that she needed to let all the energy out before stepping into a marriage for life. I was just quiet during most of it. The more I didnt talk and just said "ok" the more she was crying.

She started telling me I can fuck other women if I want to get back at her, or that she will tell everyone about what she did so i can take her back, that she will do anything it takes for me to come back and that this was a mistake of her life and that she hates her sister and friends for this...
I told her fucking other woman was not something I needed, because the moment i met her and started loving her, she was the only woman i needed, i didnt need to meet or sleep with someone to know the best thing of my life was waiting at home. 
The sister was telling her stuff in the background but I couldnt hear, i dont know what the sister was telling her or if she was getting angry at her or something.

She kept begging me and begging me, and i just told her, if she comes clean to her parents and family i will think about it. After that she started saying something but I just hung up. 

For like half an hour my phone goes silent without much response, and her father calls me up and apologizes for everything, he and his wife know what happened now, and he is so sorry for all of this. He told me he understands how i feel and that he didnt raise his daughter to do this, he said he understand if i dont want to see her again but that I always will be welcome to him and that I am a good guy. His wife basically then takes/steals the phone from him and tells me she did a mistake and she regrets it and it will never happen again and that we can move forward from this. She tells me her daughter has never been this destroyed before. I politely tell her I appreciate her opinion and then say i have to go and goodbye.

My ex-fiance calls me back and beggs me again saying she told her parents and also sent a text message to her friends (our mutual friends) about what had happened. She then keeps crying asking me when i will come back to speak with her, and say we can even go to counselling and that she will pay for everything.
She kept apologizing and apoliogizing on the phone and I didnt say much.

After some time I just told her not to cry, that she shouldnt be apologizing because single women (like herself) are allowed to do these things and i hope she finds mr right. She starts crying even harder and her sister takes the phone and say sorry and tells me everything can be fixed and that I said I would take her back now that she told everyone what she did. I told the sister I only said I think about it, and now that I have I realised i dodged a bullet and wish her and her sister the best. She then tells me her sister is turning suicidal from all of this and that this is going to lead into a depression that can take her life. 
The only thing I said after she told me that was "its a good thing you are close to her so you can make sure she doesnt kill herself then, maybe take her to a doctor or soemthing". After this I just hung up.

My phone has been blowing up with messages from mutual friends, her and her sister saying sorry and basically begging me to come back. I dont plan on responding. I honestly feel ALOT better right now, like I can move on. I will be going for vacation this upcoming week i think. If someting more happens I will update this post.

Maybe I will update in a month or couple of weeks, i dont know.
Once again big thanks to all of you who supported me here on reddit and gave me so much support.

I dont know when I feel okay to start dating/meeting women again but we will see. Once again thanks to you all and sorry for alot of wrong writings, I am not a native english so hope you can read without issues.

Thanks!

EDIT 1: Thank you to whoever gave me reddit gold I appreciate the support ALOT. I however will not be using this account for anything else except this post or maybe a couple of updates in the future, is it possible to refund it to whoever gave it to me somehow?

I would also like to add my best friend (co-owner of my company) hired someone to take care of the company for us, and also booked a month long vacation for the both of us. I am lucky to have such a good person in my life, and i hope you all are able to find a friend like this (i would do the same for him). Hes been a friend since we were kids and if i lost all other people i know he would be there for me, so big thanks to him!

Also I dont know what more to update at this point, alot of things have happened so if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will reply as they popup in the comments (i didnt know what other things you were wondering about me or the situation). Aslong as it doesnt give away my full identity I dont mind answering them.

I also think about making an update post in a while, when would you want it (i have had many questions about making future updates). In a month? when i am back from vacation?

Once again thanks for all the support

EDIT 2: My friend went over to get the ring from her but she refused to give it to him and told me she would not give it to anyone and that I have to pick it up by myself. I dont know why she is still acting like this. I am thinking of just letting the ring go and be able to have a clear mind.

ANSWER: Told ya:

QUESTION: [Update] From the loser whose girlfriend's rich parents treated me like shit on Christmas

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9pkm2/i_29m_just_spent_another_awkward_holiday_with_my/)

tl;dr for my original question:  My girlfriend's ~~rich~~ asshole parents think I'm a loser. Even though we're an otherwise great couple, I'm thinking about breaking up because I don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and I can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.

I posted a few days ago on a throwaway account thinking it probably wouldn't go anywhere but hoping a few more experienced internet strangers might give me some insight. It got some attention and there was some solid advice (thanks u/iamseriouslyaperson!) and a lot of perspective on the whole situation and I was like, "okay, that was enlightening," and went on with my day. Gf was working that night so there wasn't much to do with all that info at the time, and I fell asleep while attempting to formulate my side of the Big Talk.

Little did I know that post blew up overnight and made the front page and gf saw it. I didn't give any names/locations, but there was enough specific information that she had no trouble figuring out it was me. So Thursday, while at work and still unaware of all this, I got a dreaded "WE NEED TO TALK" text. Yep, all caps. And I was like "welp, I'm dead."

She was feeling hurt and angry when she sent that text but she said she had time to read through some of the comments and think about things and she wasn't as upset when she came to my apartment later (she brought food). Still, she said I had no right to tell the whole internet about our relationship problems, and I agreed/apologized. She knows I'm writing this update and she's going to read it before I post, the reason for that being she admitted the internet actually made some good points regarding our relationship problems.

We talked for a long time Thursday night. She said she knows her parents treat people like shit and that they control her and her siblings with money. It's partially a cultural thing, according to her. Gf was born and raised in the U.S. but her parents grew up rich in a different country and moved here a long time ago. She said they had a hard time assimilating with upper-class Americans and flaunt their wealth because they're socially insecure. Gf also implied that kind behavior was a lot more acceptable in their home country in the 1980s and they never changed. She grew up seeing them act that way and, at least when she was younger, thought it was normal.

On top of that, gf's mom was/is emotionally and physically abusive. She said her mom used to slap her for "talking back" and once cut up all of gf's clothes and bedding after an argument over her going out with some high school friends. Gf said she's still afraid of her mom and has a hard time standing up to her. She also got very little affection from her parents growing up. It seems like that was all replaced with material things. So, to her, being cut off from her family financially is the same as being cut off emotionally.

All that being said, gf doesn't expect me to visit her parents again. She was very apologetic about how they treated me and also about not calling them out. She was really hurt that I said I thought I was "wasting my time" in the earlier post and I said I was sorry, and I am. I was still raging a little when I wrote that. I asked her about maybe letting her parents cut her off financially and living on her own. It wouldn't mean she has to go no contact but their relationship would be based on something other than money.

We've been talking about moving in together for a while now and she actually suggested she move out of her townhouse (that her family pays for) and into my apartment. I'm totally fine this. We've been together for almost 3 years and I think we would have moved in together a while ago if her parents weren't so against it. She's really nervous about being on her own financially but she's willing to try it. We spent hours yesterday going through her finances and coming up with a budget. It's going to be a big change in how she lives and thinks about things. I'm managing my expectations as far as spending is concerned. No one can change their habits overnight.

We're not combining our finances or putting her name on the lease. The plan for now is to split the cost of rent and utilities and she asked me to put her on an allowance for spending her own money. She also gave me the credit cards her parents pay for and told me to hide them. It's weird to me to have this much control over another person's finances. We're going to give it until my lease is up in March (my apartment is a little small for both of us and all our stuff) and then, assuming all this works out, we'll look for a place to officially live together. She isn't going to tell her parents right away but she promised she will before March.

tl:dr: Thanks, Reddit, for telling me to grow some balls and talk to my gf about her family situation. I did and I think things are going to get better.

EDIT

To everyone who's wondering, her parents are from Mexico.

Gf has a job and her own income. She is the co-owner of a business and makes a decent living on her own, just not nearly enough to fund the kind of lifestyle she's used to.

Also, before you say "she shouldn't have been mad that he posted about their relationship on Reddit," please for one second put yourself in that situation. You're casually browsing the front page and find a post about your personal life that was obviously written by your boyfriend and makes you sound like a complete piece of shit. In that same post, your boyfriend says he's thinking about breaking up with you. That's now just out there for the whole world to read. You can't say that wouldn't be alarming. She said "it felt like a slap in the face," which made me feel pretty shitty for posting it at all. All things considered, I think she was pretty reasonable about it. Ultimately, she was cool about me posting the update, and actually wanted to make sure I thanked Reddit for the perspective. No, she is not "demanding" to "approve" this update. She's just involved now, as she should be since she's half of this relationship.

ANSWER: Dude that's wonderful to hear. This is a really good eye opener for her. She should bring everything she can of hers little by little to a safe location so her parents cant just decide that all her stuff actually belongs to them somehow.

================================================================================

QUESTION: UPDATE My girlfriend's friends gave me a bath when I was drunk. I'm disgusted and embarrassed.

So about a week ago I posted my original which got deleted so I put it down there. And then there's an update for those who were wondering.

ORIGINAL

So I (20M) went out partying with a few buddies and we all came back wasted. I live with my girlfriend and I came home extremely drunk. My friends put me to bed and left. My girlfriend (19F) had two or three friends over.

I ended up throwing up on myself and my girlfriend came to check up on me and saw some puke on me. So she and her friends lugged me to the bathroom, took all my clothes off, and gave me a bath. Like a scrubbing everything with a sponge bath, butt naked. I was semi-conscious at the time and half-aware of what was happening but barely able to move. I mumbled “Stop” and “No” a few times but I don’t think they really heard. Even drunk me was humiliated to be naked in front of all my girlfriend’s face.

So they washed me then put me to bed with a blanket over me, without putting clothes on me. I woke up hungover the next day and could see I was naked under the covers. I immediately put clothes on and my girlfriend and her friends had slept over (they were doing a movie night thing) and they were already up. They all started giggling and I felt super self-conscious. One of them complimented me and said I was handsome.

I told them I was totally not okay with what they did. Their expressions immediately changed and they all started yelling they just helped me and I had no leg to stand on. I reiterated they were not allowed to wash me without my consent especially if I was able to talk and I was going to be talking to someone about it. They freaked out but I pushed past them and left. I haven’t gone back yet but I’ve been getting tons of texts begging me not to do anything. They keep saying when you’re drunk friends are supposed to help you out and clean you up. So now I’m asking: should I? Should I do something about this? What do I do? Am I wrong to feel exposed?

EDIT: To answer common questions:

1. I was not flailing or thrashing or continuing to puke, I was totally immobile. Everything was foggy and I told them no, but I wasn’t really moving.
2. I do not regularly get this drunk and thanks to all the people for saying it’s my fault. I’m in college, some days we go out and go a little overboard. We’ve all had those days where we threw up, it happens.
3. My girlfriend could have easily bathed me herself. There’s people arguing that switching the genders isn’t the same because one guy could bathe a drunk girl. So could she, I wasn’t fighting or anything. I’ve bathed her once or twice and I make her girlfriends leave too because I respect her privacy.
4. It is NOT the same as doctors doing it, doctors are trained medical professionals and my girlfriend's friends are not my loved ones, we’re not friends they’re her friends. We barely talk.
5. I have my own room, I puked in my room we don’t share it.
6. I am 5'11 and 138 lbs, for those wondering. My girlfriend is 5'7 and 124.

UPDATE

Hi again everyone, I'm the "little crybaby bitch" who's girlfriend and her friends gave me a group bath. Sound weird yet?  To clarify, I was fine with them helping me go to the tub, but my GF knew I was uncomfortable with her friends being there and trust me she did not need their help. I've cleaned her up before and she's cleaned me up once before and she did it on her own. These are HER friends, not mine, we don't have a relationship. They touched me all over while I was vulnerable and without clothes. That's disgusting and they 100% knew what they were doing wrong.

We've all gotten drunk before, we're in college, it happens. Not often, but every now and then and we help each other out. But my GIRLFRIEND had permission to help me out, not her friends. Just like how she gives ME permission to help her out, not her friends. They all stayed there. They knew they should have left. I told them to stop.

Anyway, the point isn't that, it's the update. I was staying at my friend's house and he was on my side, thankfully. My GF stopped by to talk when he was out and showed up at the door. When I saw her through the peephole the first thing I did was start a video on my phone in my pocket. She started explaining to me they were helping me out and I needed their help. I cut her off and asked her how she'd feel if my friends and I bathed her. She got quiet and said it wasn't the same thing, girls are more vulnerable than boys and it was her and her friends' natural "maternal" instinct to take care of me. I asked her real talk why didn't she tell her friends to leave? She didn't say anything for a while and then after some grilling she finally replied she did but they asked to stay because they "didn't think she could handle it herself". I asked why she didn't say no because she knew she could (she's done it once before), and she said they wanted to stay so she let them. They said "just in case" and insisted, so what's the harm. I asked why, and she shrugged. She started crying.

I asked her why they didn't leave me in my boxers. She said they were dirty. I said no, she could have easily poured water with the handheld showerhead and they would have cleaned. I puked on my shirt. I asked her again but she stayed firm on them being dirty and she definitely had to remove them. She sort of shut off then but I told her I wouldn't be able to forgive her if she didn't tell me exactly what happened and why. I hugged her and said I had to know or else we were done.  She was hesitant but I swore up and down I wouldn't take it to the police, I just wanted to know. She finally agreed and I asked if they heard me tell them to stop and she said she had heard me say something and shake my head but she didn't know what I said.

I went back to our place after the conversation and after she went to sleep I took out her phone. Yes, okay, I'm a snoop, I'm wrong, but I had to know. We know each other's passwords so I opened it and went to her texts. I texted them from her, asking if they knew what I had mumbled. One claimed not to have heard anything, the other two admitted they'd heard me mumble "Stop" but I was "drunk and needed their help." I screenshotted the texts (there were some texts directly after the event where one commented "well, that was fun". Maybe sarcastic, maybe not, nevertheless I don't like it).

I left afterward, back to my friend's place and texted my GF I wasn't quite ready to continue our relationship but we'd see how it went.

The reason I'm posting this is because I want some advice. I have evidence of what they did, screenshots of texts and a voice recording. The question I'm asking now is should I take it to the RA or the sexual assault department. I know now they chose to stay in there after my GF asked them to leave and my GF let them stay in there. I know they physically bathed me when I was immobile and didn't need more than one person. But is this reason enough to go to authorities? I haven't told our mutuals about the incident because that may lead to ostracization and I don't know where I want to go with this. I'm not ready to let it go, but should I report it? Our college has a firm policy on things like this, it's not a little thing. They investigate all claims, whatever they are, carefully.

Better ask judgment-free internet strangers than actual people in my life. Let me have it, guys.

ANSWER: [F25]Honestly if you feel uncomfortable report it and seek help... if was you and your friends washed her everyone would be in outrage. Everyone seems to think if it happens to a guy they should be happy or in your case proud you got washed by your girl and her friends. I mean in different circumstance that could of been a good time but not immobile and in the condition you were. I hope you end up finding closure. sending you good vibes

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (24F) husband (38M) keeps sexualising my childhood trauma even tho I’ve asked him not to. I’ve tried everything. Nothing is working. Thinking of divorce.

NSFW

Please don’t waste your time on the age gap. It’s something I’ve dealt with for our whole relationship and I don’t want to get lectured about it.

I’ve been with my husband for 6 years, married for 2. I know he’s older but he looks very youthful for his age and he’s super fit and active so honestly the age was never an issue, ever.

Between the ages of 10 and 15 I was sexually abused by my step dad and when I first started getting serious with my now husband, I told
Him everything. All the details, all the ways it screwed me up and all the horrible after math and fall out from various family members. In short, it was all bad, in every which way you can imagine. 

Within the last 4 months, every time my husband and I make love, it starts out normal but at some point he always starts asking questions about the times I was abused. He gets real graphic and bc were in the moment, I always answer his questions. 

I’m not a prude by any means and I even have my own kinks which he always enjoys. But lately it seems his only kink is hearing me talk about the most traumatic time in my life. The questions he asks are so gross and so personal and he’s never asked these before. The concerning part is he seems to get excited about the details as I answer his question bc he always finishes super fast once he starts asking these questions.

I’ve sat him down SEVERAL TIMES and told him how it makes me feel less than, how it hurts me, how it makes me feel like trash. How it brings me back to a horrible time. And I’ve told him to stop. He always apologizes about it and says he won’t do it anymore. But then we start making love and whether it’s 10 minutes, 20 minutes or one of our longer sessions, he always ends up bringing it up near the end of our session a few minutes before he finishes. 

I write this in my bed alone as I’ve asked him to sleep on the couch tonight bc he just did it again after I repeatedly tell him not to.  

I don’t know what my next move is. I’m tempted to leave but I don’t work and would have to take him to court to get some type of support so I can live and I know that stuff takes time. I still love him and he’s a great husband in every other sense but this whole thing is turning me off and slowly but surely making me fall out of love with him. If he really loved me why would he continually hurt me like this? Also, is it possible he is perverted like, liking that stuff? How is this new I’ve known him for years and he’s never mentioned this as being a turn on. Any advice would be appreciated, I have no family and friends here as I’m new to the city we live in and my family lives in a different country. 

Thank you.

EDIT: I was not expecting to get so many messages. Literally thousands. Thank you to everyone who is sending support. It’s impossible to message all of you so I just want you to know I’ve read hundreds of your comments and the support made me cry. Thank you x a million. I will post an update soon. My husband is currently staying in a hotel so I have some time to think
About my options.

ANSWER: ah, shiiiit, this isn't good. 

okay OP, I'm coming at you from a survivor's perspective here, looking at the facts:

1) you were abused as a kid
2) you hooked up with someone the moment you were legally an adult
3) this someone is kind until you're uncomfortable
4) this someone is demanding you get into your trauma
5) this someone has not suggested any kind of therapy or counselling in order to help you adjust to that you didn't get a healthy childhood
6) this someone is -getting off- on it
7) your reasonable boundaries are being repeatedly ignored
8) you've just been moved to a different city with no friends
9) your family is in a different country

...you've been groomed. and if you're not being sexually or emotionally abused already - and remember there are many kinds of abuse, not just sexual assault, not just domestic violence - the chances are extremely high here that they're going to, and that they're going to get worse. It's called escalation and it is a classic abuse strategy.

There's a trope in here that people will always tell you to break up, get couples therapy, etc. Honestly, OP, reading this I am scared for you, because I could have written this 10-15 years ago with the same mindset. The age gap doesn't matter. He's nice except for this. And this. And if I don't do what he wants. I was maneuvered into being alone, and then when I didn't have anyone else, it escalated, and my abuse was used against me like this.

Doesn't matter where. Doesn't matter leaving this city. Or this country. It does matter to do it as soon as possible. 

Run. 

Run.

Run.



eta: thank you so much for the awards, and the kindness towards OP - please give any funds towards domestic abuse services in your area. Stay safe! Stay strong!

QUESTION: UPDATE: My girlfriend [21F] of 18 months asked my [22M] preference about her pubic hair and now finds me "revolting"

Original post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hf2uy8/my_girlfriend_21f_of_18_months_asked_my_22m/

So an update to my previous post. 

She ignored my messages/calls for 3 days, at which point she text me asking if i was free for her to come over for a "movie night". i told her sure, but we need to talk about what happened before anything else. She replied with "about what?". 

i figured it was best to wait until i actually saw her in person before trying to discuss the issue, which i did. when she arrived, we sat down and i started by saying that i was upset by our last conversation and I'd like to discuss what happened, at which point she said "it doesn't need to be discussed, can we leave it". i said "Not really no, I'd like to get to the bottom of what actually happened and also discuss your reaction of storming out and not talking to me for 3 days and then acting like nothing has happened." 

she basically refused to discuss it, so i told her that if we can't at least discuss what happened then i want to break up and that she needed to get her stuff that she has in my apartment and leave. 

she lost her shit. bawling and screaming so much that my neighbour came and knocked on the door to check if everything was okay. He's a chill dude so asked if he could stay whilst she got her stuff together as she seemed to calm down once he was present. 

she basically sulked around slamming cupboards whilst she got her stuff and then left. 

so yeah, no real answers and im still confused as fuck as to what happened. i text her mom to keep an eye on her as im kinda thinking she's losing it. ive never seen her like this and it worries me. she's been blowing up my phone about how she loves me and cant imagine life without me but honestly this whole thing has soured me and I'm struggling to see any way that we will continue this relationship. 

thanks to everyone who replied before. 

TL;DR: My girlfriend baited me into a question about pubic hair, implied I was a pedo, ignored me for 3 days and then tried to act like nothing had happened and so I broke up with her. Fun.

ANSWER: Read the original and hoped for an update. I bet she asked around and all her friends told her she was bat-shit crazy. She was embarrassed, so refused to talk about it. Either way, good on you for drawing a line in the sand. It needed to be discussed before you moved on. Crazy that even after your ultimatum she wouldn’t talk about it.

Edit: My comment really blew up and I don’t have time to reply/discuss with everyone. For those saying the GF might have overreacted due to some undisclosed trauma. That’s a possibility, but to me it seems more likely she was just fixated on the correlation between pedos and the preference of hairlessness and massively overreacted. Even if her actions were fueled by trauma, that doesn’t excuse her bad behavior; being accusatory, ghosting for 3 days, gaslighting/pretending nothing happened and having a tantrum when confronted. In my opinion, even if she now disclosed her reaction was due to some traumatic experience, it would change nothing. Assuming something traumatic even occurred, any understanding/compassion the GF was entitled to as OP’s partner went out the window when she chose to be a 🐝. For those saying OP was wrong to give his GF an ultimatum. Ultimatums are usually bad, but in some instances (and I agree with OP in this case) can be necessary/prudent. What the GF did had to be addressed. It was a watershed moment in their relationship. OP’s GF chose wrong and OP did what he thought was best. Kudos to OP for sticking to his guns.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My [25m] girlfriend [23f] went to the protests and now wants to see my diabetic [55m] [52f] parents, I said no and she and now her family thinks I am punishing her and trying to control her beliefs.

My girlfriend and I have been dating since June of 2018. We are pretty close and her family is on good terms with mine. We do have our fights like every other couple, I find my girlfriend to be pretty ‘reactive’ and it has been a problem before in our relationship but we can generally sort things out. 

Also, I want to add too, that I don’t live with my parents I normally have my own space but I moved in because of the lockdown and I didn’t want my parents out shopping. My parents are in decent shape, but we have a family history of diabetes my dad has Diabetes (Type 1) and my mom is prediabetic. 

My girlfriend has been understanding in fact she took this lockdown super seriously and was frustrated that people weren’t taking it seriously enough.

She started to go to the protests in our city, she asked me to go, I told her no that it would be irresponsible since I am with my parents. She was upset but understood. 

We were going to have a pizza night at my house, and my mom invited my girlfriend’s family not knowing that my girlfriend was out at the protests. Once I heard, I told my mom’s and told my girlfriend, that until she self quarantines for two weeks I don’t feel comfortable with her and her family at my house. 

My girlfriend was livid, and not only that her parents who are also hot heads just start getting angry. They start talking about how proud they are of their daughter for standing up to injustice, now I am punishing them by kicking them out of their house. That my mom didn’t care, that only I did, that I am driving a wedge between them. That I am trying to control their daughter’s beliefs. And her mom really just started yelling at me. Is this the type of son in law I am going to be? 

This thing has been ridiculous, my mom didn’t know when she invited them. I didn’t say they couldn’t ever come, but please wait you might be infected. My girlfriend’s family is acting as if because she wore a mask she is 100% immune. I don’t know normally when I have disagreements with my girlfriend, it is just me and her. But here it seems that both she and her mom mainly (dad is somewhat cool) are just hyping each other up. I think her dad is the most understanding but he is the quietest one in the family. 

I don’t know what to do here? I know for a fact I am not going to risk my parent’s wellbeing to appease my girlfriend and her family. But what can I do to get my girlfriend’s parents to understand? Like they should know better? Her mom is a Physician’s Assistant so how is she just turning a blind eye to this? Do I just try to let things cool off? 

Tl;Dr- my mom invited my girlfriend to our house for pizza night not knowing that my girlfriend has been out at the protests. After I found out, I immediately canceled it. My girlfriend and her family have taken this as a huge personal offense.

ANSWER: This is just like the early days of the pandemic in the US: You'll only know if you overreacted afterwards. If you underreact, by the time you find out it will be too late.

If quarantines are fine for other people, but not for her, you likely can't get her to change her mind. You know what's important to you, and you are protecting it.

================================================================================

QUESTION: UPDATE: My (28f) dog attacked my stalker after he broke into my house. Now my SIL (32f) says my dog is "too dangerous" to be around my niece (4f). Feel like I'm going crazy.

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/hpf5l4/my\_28f\_dog\_attacked\_my\_stalker\_after\_he\_broke/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hpf5l4/my_28f_dog_attacked_my_stalker_after_he_broke/)

I definitely didn’t expect my last post to blow up the way it did. Thank you so much to everyone who commented. I appreciated that I got advice from all over the spectrum, from people who completely agreed with me to people who completely agreed with my SIL, and people who thought both of us had a point. It helped me see that the problem is more complicated than I thought, which helped me understand that my SIL wasn’t just being a dick. It also helped me decide what things were and weren’t fair to be angry about. 

I also appreciated seeing a few people comment making fun of me for needing my dog with me, and the majority of people yelling at them and saying I was acting pretty reasonably for someone who endured a violent attack. I don’t want to be seen as someone delicate, and I’m glad that most people don’t see me that way. Reading everyone's comments, I had this moment where I was like, "Yeah! They're right! I did almost get drug out of my house and murdered just a few weeks ago. Who the hell are these people to say how I should act???" That felt really good and I really really appreciated it.

Anyway, the conclusion I came to in all of this is that while my SIL is well within her rights to protect her daughter, she went about it in a way that disrespected me, both as a friend and as a victim of a very recent violent attack. Both my parents and her parents live locally and babysit all the time; she and my brother could’ve easily dropped my niece off with them and came to visit. It probably would’ve been awhile before I even noticed my niece wasn’t coming around, at which point I would’ve been in a better place and more understanding that she was uncomfortable with her daughter around Thor. Regardless of what some people said about how my SIL and brother don’t owe me anything and all their allegiance goes to their daughter, I simply do not feel that way. We were extremely close before this happened; I was always there for them, and would literally drop plans to babysit my niece if my brother and SIL needed a night to themselves. The very least they could’ve done for me, after I was almost kidnapped and murdered, is try to find some compromise. We went from seeing each other 3 times a week to pretty much not seeing each other at all. Even if they weren’t okay with me crating the dog, they could’ve easily dropped their daughter off with Grandma and Grandpa for a few hours so I wouldn’t feel completely isolated. I also have a yard, so they could’ve come over with her and we all could’ve hung out outside, while Thor stayed inside. I’ve been upset about this for awhile, but wasn’t sure if I was right to be upset until so many people echoed that sentiment. So I appreciate it. 

I invited my brother and SIL over (I promised it would only be an hour or two and insisted they leave my niece with my parents), and tried to lay all this out without being confrontational or acting like a dick. To my surprise, my brother and SIL had no real understanding that I’ve been having a difficult time. They thought I was basically fine and everything in my life was more or less back to normal now that my stalker is in jail. I didn’t get into it in my previous post, but during the year that I was stalked, I worked really hard to not show many outward signs of fear. I even made jokes about having a stalker. I knew people wouldn’t want to hang out with someone who was constantly going on and on about some bad thing that was going on in their life, and I didn’t want to be “that person” who was perpetually in crisis. And more than that, I just didn’t want to always be thinking and talking about having a stalker. I wanted to not think about it as much as possible. So I guess I might’ve come off as unaffected by the whole thing.

I’m not sure if I totally buy that they didn’t know I was going through something traumatic and that it was taking a huge toll on my mental state. I mean, I got a gun and paid for tactical training. I bought a home security system. I got active in self defense classes and strength training, things that I previously had no interest in. Even if I wasn’t walking around telling everyone how scared I was, I think anyone would’ve been able to tell. Plus, who just brushes off having their house broken into in the middle of the night? It seems crazy and they don’t seem so emotionally unintelligent that they’d think that. But both my brother and SIL did apologize for being insensitive, and when I pressed my SIL on why crating the dog isn’t good enough, she eventually relented and said that it would be fine. It probably helped that the entire time they were over, Thor was asleep and loudly snoring in his crate.

The paranoid part of me is convinced they just don’t want to deal with me in a fragile state, made up an excuse about my dog, and are now just going to come up with some other excuse about why they can’t see me. I invited them over for dinner in a few days and they’re coming, so I guess I’ll just have to see from there. I can’t stress enough that these used to be my best friends, and I’m heartbroken to have not had their support. I’ve been trying to rely on my friends more now, and thankfully they've all been really supportive. I’m really lucky that this happened during the pandemic, because nobody is getting frustrated with me that I’ve basically refused to leave the house for a month—they’re all perfectly happy to pick up takeout and come over to watch TV for the 5th night in a row.

In other news, yesterday I left my dog at home and drove around my block alone. I was shaking the whole time but I did it! I keep trying to remind myself that I spent a whole year fighting back even though I was utterly terrified; I can’t just lay down and die now that I’m so close to getting my life back.

tl;dr Things are better with my SIL and brother but I don’t know if they’ll stay that way. I’m relying on friends for support instead. I’m disappointed but also doing better.

ANSWER: This also NOT some normal daily life. This is some seriously traumatic stuff that happened. This will take time for you to  deal with. Take the time and keep giving yourself,  your dog and your family the attention you all need. 

Best of luck ..... and Thor is and awesome doggo....GOOD BOY!

================================================================================

QUESTION: FINAL UPDATE : I (26M) found out my fiance (27F) possibly gave a stripper a handjob at her bachelorette party

\\3rd and most likely last update. Original update here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/e35vj6/i\_26m\_found\_out\_my\_fiance\_27f\_possibly\_gave\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e35vj6/i_26m_found_out_my_fiance_27f_possibly_gave_a/)

I deleted the original post, but put a recap in the original update.

It's been 10 days since I received the call that ended this relationship. I'm almost back to normal, although I can't quite shake a bit of malaise. Thankfully I had a few days worth of PTO to burn while I worked past this crap. I already scheduled my 2 weeks vacation this year for the wedding, but since it's canceled I'll just spend it with the family and have a very extended Christmas with them.

Outside of a few texts from Jane to my mother when things first blew up and her mother calling the next day after I talked to Janes stepfather, I haven't heard a peep from their clan since. Janes mom tried to act as a mediator between us, but I shut that shit down and told her it's not possible. She can be a bit pushy, but thankfully she realized it wasn't wise to push this time. I finally got to talk to the bridesmaid who's husband called me. She didn't offer any more details and I didn't care to ask for any more by the time I talked to her. She just called me when she felt comfortable enough to wish me well and tell me she was sorry for what happened. She's a very nice lady and I feel bad for her because she works with quite a few of those women, and I don't envy how they are going to treat her at work. I asked her and thankfully none of them have any managerial authority over her, but it still sucks to ostracized.

As far as any of the other women, I haven't heard a thing, and my cousin has done a vanishing act. My mom took care of cancelling all the wedding invitations as she was the one who helped send them all out. I asked her to just tell everyone that Jane and I had a change of heart about getting married and decided to put things off for the time being. Frankly I'm fucking embarrassed about what happened and don't really want to be known among family and friends and people in town as that guy who's ex-fiance jacked off and possibly screwed a stripper right before their wedding. I'm sure it will eventually get around, but if I let it fade like this it will be more of a crazy rumor than confirmed fact for most people.  I really just want to walk away with as little drama as possible and move on with  my life.

I've asked my mother to text Janes mom to get the engagement ring back. Hopefully she won't give me any trouble as they were expensive and buddy of mine is willing to buy the ring set for exactly what I paid for them for his wedding in a few months. I told him he'd better not tell his girlfriend where he got them just in case she's worried my ex was wearing the ring when she was handling stripper guys joystick. I lost thousands in deposits for the venue, DJ, florist, catering, security, plane tickets, honeymoon suite, etc etc etc... I'm hoping I can recoup a little money by selling the rings.

Anyway, I've decided to stay away from LTR's for an indefinite amount of time. This experience has made me very gun shy about "love" and relationships and all that mess. People have sent me all kinds of of encouraging messages claiming I'll eventually find "the one". I'm doing my best not to be overly pessimistic, but when looking at the divorce rates and all the crazy conflicts between men and women these days, I'm starting to think the chances for anyone to do that are getting lower with each passing year. And I'm not the kind of guy who gets over stuff like this by running out and dating some other woman to sport hump right afterwards.

So I think I'll just stay single for now, and focus on my passions and work. Anyway, thanks to everyone who gave encouragement. If anyone else goes through something heartbreaking like this, I highly recommend you you stay with family and or close friends you have a good relationship with. I can't overstate how much this helped, especially if you are a guy. Men don't really maintain a circle of support for stuff like this, like many women do, and you can find yourself isolated and descending further into a bad place without positive reinforcement around you. I was able to lay on my childhood bed, in my childhood room, in my childhood home surrounded by good memories, having my mom come in and bring me tea and food and say sweet encouraging things about how much she loved me and how proud she was of me. I was able to shit talk with my dad and brothers to distract myself. It helped a lot.

Best of luck everyone. Thanks.

ANSWER: In the long run you did the right thing. You’re not alone either, if you ever get bored search “male stripper AMA” or  “male stripper, bachelorette party” in these relationship subs, there are other stories similar to to yours. Mixing strippers and weddings is the worst idea, I don’t know why it’s even a thing.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My girlfriend (24F) has a choice between me (25M) or her family and I don't know how to tell her

This is a throwaway, as you can tell from the username.

Hello everyone, hope you guys are staying safe from coronavirus.

I met my girlfriend when I was in my senior year in college, she was a junior back then. We have been dating for 3 years now. I'm Asian and she's white. To say I don't deserve her would be an understatement. She's the most beautiful and the smartest girl I know and she comes from a pretty wealthy family. I'm not particularly handsome or attractive, not extremely smart (just because we both went to an Ivy League college doesn't mean shit, it just means I have slightly above average IQ but I decided to work harder than most other high schoolers), and our family is not very rich either. We aren't poor, my parents were able to help me pay for college and I only had to take a few thousand in student loans, but we are certainly not as wealthy as her family. I really love her and I try to be the best boyfriend I can be.

Unfortunately, her entire family is racist except for her and her brother (who is one of my best friends). Every time we go to one of her family gatherings, there are racist comments tossed around. It's against everyone who isn't white, including Asians but also African Americans, Mexicans, etc. I am the only one there who is not white. I don't know if they are trying to insult me intentionally with comments like "Oh those yellow (n-word)s stealing our jobs" but it not only annoys me on a personal level but also just like in general, they're being such racist assholes. But I try to be as nice as possible because I don't want to let this ruin our relationship. But her family members still all dislike me.

So yesterday her dad texted me. I knew that my girlfriend's parents know my number but it's still strange because her dad doesn't like me at all and we have never really had a 1 on 1 conversation. But anyway, he sent me a few texts saying "This relationship has gone far enough" and to sum things up he said that if I didn't break up with my girlfriend he would disown her and her entire family would cut her off. And then he said if I really loved her I would know that her family was more important to her and stuff like that. I have no idea why he decided to say this now and not like 3 years ago when we first started dating.

I haven't talked with my girlfriend yet because I don't really know how to tell her about this. I know she loves her family and I don't want to hurt her relationship with them. But I also don't want to hurt her by just breaking up with her without telling her why.

I really need some advice here my fellow Redditors, how do I tell her about this situation? Even if we do end up breaking up, I want to do what makes her happy in the long run.

TL;DR My girlfriend's family is racist and they don't like me. Her dad told me that either I would break up with her or he would disown her and her entire family would cut her off. I don't know how to tell her about this.

UPDATE

So first of all I want to apologize for not updating until today. Yesterday I checked the first \~30 or so comments and they all said show her the text. I have a job as a tech lead and we had like 4 meetings in a row yesterday. Couldn't really zone out to check Reddit. And afterwards I was pretty tired so my lazy ass decided not to update until today. I never expected it to blow up so much. Today I woke up and I saw like >2k comments and 22.9k upvotes and I was pretty blown away so sorry for not responding to anything.

I texted my girlfriend yesterday and sent her a screenshot of what her dad sent me. She said she needed some time to think and I just told her I love her and I'd respect her decision either way. So I guess all that's left to do is wait.

So now I guess I will respond to the general categories of comments/questions:

>Show her the texts.

Done.

>You're taking away from her right to decide as a grown adult woman. You're being sexist/misogynist. You need more communication and trust in a relationship.

That was kind of eye opening for me. Her dad's texts were all completely directed at me, like YOU need to make this decision. It's YOUR fault. All of the YOUs kind of stuck me into the mindset where it really was my decision only. I don't know, I guess I was just being dumb as usual. Lesson learned though, thanks.

>Why didn't she stand up for you at her family gatherings? Why did she take you in the first place?

Well I've never really thought about this stuff before but as far as I can remember they only say that shit when she's not in the room. They have a pretty big house so she sometimes goes to talk with her other relatives in other rooms, and that's when it starts. I didn't think it would be good if I just followed her like a little puppy everywhere she went so I generally tend to stay in the same room.

Also my friend almost never shows up to those gatherings for some reason. Maybe it's connected to this, maybe it's not.

I've never really brought it up to her and straight up said that their racism pisses me off a little. I don't know, maybe I should have? I just didn't want her to think I'm a huge crybaby about it. It didn't really feel targeted towards me, because they were just being racist to every race in general, and I just happen to be included in one of them.

>Delete the text and don't tell her anything.

I don't think that's a good idea... maybe they're not lying.

>Reverse Crazy Rich Asians on them.

I have heard of that movie but have never watched it. Is it any good? Never been a big movie guy, I always just play PC games. The only time I watch movies is with my girlfriend.

>This post is fake.

Listen, man. I don't have that much spare time to make up a fictional narrative and publish it on Reddit. What do I gain from making up a post like this? Karma? Awards? This is a throwaway account, not my main Reddit account. If I really wanted to Karma-farm, don't you think I would want to do it on my main? And I'm not really a huge fan of fantasy internet points anyway... I mean I don't know what else you want me to say.

For people who say they've never heard "Yellow N\gger" before, it's probably because you're not Asian. I bet you've never heard "Pancake Face" before either...

>Please update.

I didn't feel like this update warranted a new post but I will make a new post when my girlfriend makes up her mind if you guys want.

Thanks to all of you for your replies!

ANSWER: Just show her the text. If y'all have been together for 3 years, you should be able to go, "Hey babe, you need to see what your dad sent me." Then just talk it through and see what she says/thinks.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Update: My (38/F) ex-fiance ghosted me (39/M) before our wedding. It's been 16 years and now she wants to talk it over again. Should we reopen closed wounds?

[previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fz8bw7/my_38f_exfiance_ghosted_me_39m_before_our_wedding/)

Well, that was something. I got closure at least.

We met at a cafe and sat and talked outside. The first thing I noticed was how badly scarred her arms were and how much pain was in her face. Long story short  she  wanted to break up long before the wedding, she was too weak and cowardly to speak up for herself. She had a complete nervous breakdown over everything. She had been tired of being forced into doing things she never wanted to do and never having the guts to stand up for herself. She was mad at her family pressuring her to get married and pump out kids, she was mad at them forcing her into a degree that she didn't want, she was mad herself for not being able to speak up. Nothing she did was justified which we agreed on.

When I first proposed to her I did it in a public area. I had put her on the spot and she wanted to say no but, she couldn't bare to see me hurt. She was right. I made all the choices for her. I was a very different person back then and she was very "meek" as in she just went with the flow and had no backbone. I drowned her voice out often and often never gave her the chance to grow to be a person. Back then I was often focused only on myself. 

Well, everything came to a climax and she had a complete mental breakdown. She ran way from her problems at the beheast of her best Friend and only person in the world she ever trusted. As she said it's the only thing she knows how to do: run. She never had the spine to speak up. 

Her life just spiraled downwards. She did a few years homeless after her bestfriends husband kicked her to the curb. The rest of that time was spent in Prison, which she didn't specify what she did.  She was released about a year ago and has been turning her life around. She has a job, she's reconnected with her parents and she's finally reconnecting with me. She never stopped trying to get in touch with me. 

As for our future. We have none. We both agreed to end things and  go our separate ways. We both are changed, two different people.  We have nothing in common and don't live near each other. She doesn't justify what she did nor does she want to be forgiven. She thinks its repulsive and is ashamed of her actions. I wanted to be angry but, i couldn't. I just forgave her. With that we shook hands said our goodbyes and that will likely be the last time we ever see one another. 

It's bittersweet. I got the closure I wanted. We both did. It feels like a burden was released. I know now we never had a future together and  never will. But, on the other I'm sad because it's over. All these years maybe hoping something would happen were for naught. But, in the end this is an ending and I finally have closure. Not many get to say that.

Do I believe her story? Yes, I do and even if she's full of shit at this point does it even matter? I've always known her to be very weak willed, meek. She often just does what everyone tells her to do and often runs when things get too difficult. She avoids her problems because was too weak to stand up  to them.  I mean it makes sense why her family would not talk to me about her. They were the typical tiger parents that disowned their problem child.

---
tl;dr
Alls well that ends well.  Our relation has finally come to an end and we can move on.

ANSWER: Although a lot of time has been lost for either of them. It seems odd that no one noticed the situation of her problems earlier on. It is explained in the post but it still sounds weird.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My girlfriend tried to push me off a cliff as a "joke"

Original thread: https://reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iuv798/my_girlfriend_tried_to_push_me_off_a_cliff_as_a/

I've been thinking a lot and I decided that I'm ending my relationship with her.

This isn't easy for me. It's hard because I've been with her for almost two years, but it's even harder because now I feel a ton of guilt myself as I remembered things that I ignored, and how I was only worried about her after I became the victim. I mentioned that point in the other thread, but I feel even worse about it now.

I know I was stubborn in the last thread but I listened to everyone's advice very carefully. You all helped so much. When people brought up the sadism aspect, it sort of clicked. I don't know if it was stupidity or selfishness, but I didn't think of her that way until this week. I just ignored everything she did. I thought about some memories using this new perspective.

I remember early this year her dad got her a job at the front desk at this apartment complex. It's hard to explain this place because it was sort of a luxury place and most apartments aren't like this, but I was there once or twice to pick her up and I remember what the building looked like. There were a lot of older people living there and right near the entrance of the building there was an elevator which only went up. Then there was the main elevator which was kind of far down a long hallway. She had to call that first elevator down after the person was approved to go into the building. One time me and her were smoking and just chilling talking about stuff. She was laughing to me about how she would sometimes disable the up elevator and pretend it was out of order, and then she'd watch these older/handicapped people walk down this long hallway to get to the main elevator.

She got fired pretty quickly anyway because she activated the fire alarm when there was no fire. When they asked her what happened she pretended that the computer was glitching and she couldn't stop it, but they believed she did it on purpose so they fired her. I'm sure some people could have been injured during the chaos. I guess the alarm must have disabled the elevators so everyone had to grab their stuff and run down the stairs as quickly as possible. I can imagine all these elderly people going down so many flights of stairs. I don't think anyone was injured but they did fire her and maybe they're still investigating. I don't know if it could help, but I'm gonna call that place and tell them what she told me and how she admitted to pulling the alarm on purpose. That will help my conscience out a lot.

Like I said, I feel terrible about ignoring this stuff. You might think I'm an idiot or a terrible person myself. I don't know what to say but when I really thought about this stuff, I decided I couldn't be with her. I know people will criticize me and that's fine. This is an update but also a confession tbh because I have to get that off my chest. And there's a bunch of other stories too that she told me or that I saw myself. I enjoyed her craziness tbh even though I was always on edge but I thought of it as her being fun and spontaneous instead of sadistic. I guess I'm pretty weird myself.

I responded to her texts this morning because she was starting to get angry and was sending a lot more texts. I told her I was really sick and thought she shouldn't be near me, but that we might be able to hang out again in a week or two. I said I wasn't mad at her anymore and I just didn't respond because I was sick. I just told her that to get her off my back and to give myself time to prepare for the break up because I don't know how she's gonna react and I want to be safe. For example she has keys to my house and I'm living with other people including kids so I want to change the locks and make sure we're not tied together in any other ways before I do an official breakup. Do you think that's a smart idea? I could use any advice on the best way to do a breakup in this situation because I'm kind of worried. Once again, thanks so much for all your advice last time and have a good day.

ANSWER: I think that this girl is ACTUALLY crazy and you should do what you can to protect yourself.
She sounds like a narcissist or sociopath

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [26M] upset a woman [20sF] and my friends are acting like I'm in the wrong.

Hey guys.

I went out clubbing last night with my friends. There were seven of us, three guys including me and four girls. My girlfriend Hannah was meant to come too but she was feeling ill. I offered to stay in with her but she insisted I go out and have a good time. 

At the club my friends got talking to a group of women who apparently work in finance. They were here for some kind of conference and were checking out the local places in their spare time. 

One of them, Lauren, started trying to chat to me and ask for my number. She was pretty but I was not interested as I have a girlfriend. I told her this but she then started asking for pics of Hannah. I showed her and she said that I ''could do better than that''. I was very annoyed and told her to leave me alone. 

Later me and my friends were dancing, and Lauren and her group came up to us and she started trying to dance with me. I gave her the brushoff once again and moved away from her and she gave me a dirty look. A while later she came back and by that point was very drunk. She smirked at me and threw her drink in my face. I was absolutely fuming and in response I poured my beer on her head. She started crying and ran to the bouncer who got us all kicked out. 

Everyone then proceeded to have a go at me. I understand they were annoyed that we were kicked out, but everyone was acting like I was wrong to pour my drink on her. They all saw her splash her drink in my face, but everyone was saying it was nasty to do that to a girl. 

The ladies in our group were talking about how upset they'd be if someone ruined their dress/hair/makeup by doing that, but when I pointed out she did the same to me everyone said that it isn't the same. 

Nobody said goodbye to me last night and I made my own way home. I told Hannah what happened and she agrees that I didn't do anything wrong. I tried explaining myself again over the groupchat but everybody ignored me. 

How do I sort this out in a mature way?

TL;DR: My friends are acting like I was in the wrong for pouring my drink on someone who threw hers in my face.

ANSWER: Your friends are stupid. They were only saying that to justify their anger towards you, since you were “the reason” their night of fun ended. If you want to handle this maturely, show them this reddit post so they can see what this situation looks like from a third person’s perspective. Then, maybe if they’re not complete idiots, they’ll change their stance.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife thought I used my sexual assault as an excuse to cheat. Abuser convicted guilty, my wife wants me back

This is such a long story that takes place over a series of months. I'll try to get all the details without going on for too long. So basically I (30M) got raped at a party about 8 months ago. I got drunk and an acquaintance of mine took advantage of me. I hardly remember it but I woke up the next morning naked with a vivid memory of what had happened. I remember putting up a fight, but not much else. I also have a very very vague memory of her holding a phone the entire time, but that's about it (will be important later). I immediately went home and told my wife.

She was extremely sympathetic and let me cry on her shoulder. I was a sobbing mess. At the time I did not want to press charges because I didn't know how it would go if I, a male) accused a woman of raping me. 

Anyway, I ended up telling my friends because they questioned why I stopped showing up to gatherings. The girls response was basically that it was consensual and I was lying to keep my wife from getting mad at me. Half of my friends believe her and the other half are on my side. It was a mess. In the end, I decided to just distance myself from them all. 

One of my supportive friends contacted me letting me know that she had gotten pregnant, but ended up aborting. This was a whirlwind of emotions for me but in the end I decided that it was for the best. My wife took this in a different way. 

She says that she wasn't aware that my abuser made me finish and that I wouldn't have cum if I genuinely wasn't enjoying it. We argued for days and she kept telling me I was sick for faking a rape allegation just so I could cheat on her. We've separated but are not yet divorced. I've been staying with my brother. 

Well, at this point, I decided that I needed to go to the police to clear my name. I hired a lawyer and when he heard my recount of the events that I remember, he was absolutely convinced that she had recorded the encounter. I don't know why, all I mentioned was that she was holding a phone, but I guess it makes sense. 

Anyway, her phone and laptop were searched but there was nothing. It took months, but finally we were able to retrieve the video via the cloud. I guess you can't really ever fully delete something. The video clearly depicted me in a vulnerable state and incoherently trying to get her off of me. It was sick. 

Anyway, with this evidence plus witness accounts courts sentenced her to 2.5 years in prison. When this happened, I guess my wife realized that I actually had gotten raped and has been pleading to get back into my life. She says she made a mistake and just assumed and she's so sorry, but I don't know if I can ever forgive her.

Should I continue with divorce or try to work things out with her?

ANSWER: Idk about taking her back or not but good for you going to court and winning....sorry you had to go through it.

QUESTION: Update: my girlfriend is acting obsessed with this random family she just met

This is an update from my last post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a22u6h/my_girlfriend_is_acting_obsessed_with_this_random/

As a quick summary: I thought something weird was going on with my girlfriend "Maggie" who became quickly and extremely close to her new co-worker "Joe" and his wife "Kate." After just a couple weeks, she was trusting Joe with everything work related, babysitting their children for free and buying them gifts, having the kids call her auntie, putting this family above her other friends, inviting the family to Maggie's family Thanksgiving, and referring to them as her chosen family. I thought that either this whole thing was some kind of cover for an affair or Maggie had attachment issues.

I figured out what was going on and I feel like a huge idiot. I went to see Maggie to ask for an explanation and figured if I didn't like what I heard I'd break up with her, because either she was cheating or had an emotional issue I couldn't handle.

I had the opportunity when I saw the gifts Maggie had gotten for Joe and Kate's kids. It seemed so strange for someone who doesn't really like kids that much to go so overboard for kids she just met. 

I asked Maggie why she gave the kids such special treatment even though she doesn't really like kids that much. Maggie explained that she felt differently about these kids because she had been around to watch them grow and was close to Joe and Kate, so the kids are more like family to her, which means she treats them differently than other kids and they're the exception to the rule. Maggie said she'd probably tone it down eventually, but since they were so young she wanted to get them something really nice for Christmas.

I wasn't really sure what to say next because it seemed so irrational, but then Maggie said that she used to exchange Christmas gifts with Joe and Kate too, but that they had all decided it was too much trouble and unnecessary so these days she usually bakes them something or gets them a nice bottle of wine.

I realized I was missing something important. If Maggie had other Christmases with Joe's family, she couldn't have just met them like I thought. I had thought that Maggie might have emotional issues that made her attach herself to people she barely knew, but I didn't think Maggie was actually crazy enough to imagine that she knew them before. I didn't want to ask, so I acted normally until I left.

When I got home, I went through Maggie's Facebook. She wasn't lying and she's not crazy. I found a ton of photos with Joe and Kate going back a decade. From what I can figure out, they all went to college together, Joe and Maggie were Big Brother and Little Sister in a coed frat/sorority, and Maggie and Kate were roommates. I also found pictures of Maggie as a bridesmaid in Joe and Kate wedding and pictures of Maggie holding their newborn children so they are obviously close friends who have known each other for a long time. All of Maggie's behavior makes perfect sense now that I know all this.

I think this whole thing is my fault. I have ADHD and I don't handle it well. I've had issues when people are talking to me for awhile, where I start zoning them out. I've been called out for this before. I think it's pretty likely that Maggie did tell me about Joe and Kate and I just wasn't listening. Maggie hasn't actually done anything wrong or creepy so I think it's more likely that I wasn't listening when Maggie explained instead of this being a trick.

This was a pretty big wakeup call for me. I've been ignoring my problem because I didn't want to face facts that it was serious but I know I need to do something before I make anymore mistakes. I'm going to start off by looking for a therapist.

ANSWER: I'm glad you're getting some help. Sorry you had to go through this confusion. I must admit, this is an entertaining twist in the story.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My stepsister is telling my whole family my boyfriend got her pregnant to make herself feel better.

Sorry weird title. So I met my 25F boyfriend “Tim” 26M 3.5 years ago. We hit it off he was great and sweet and we get along perfectly. Until I introduced him to my family. My mother had gotten remarried a few months earlier, I like my stepdad and we get along fine, my stepsister “Sarah”  who is 26F and were friendly but not besties by any means. She is kind of an intense party girl and being in our 20s we only saw each other at family events. 

So I introduced Tim to my family at which point we learn that Sarah used to date Tim when they were 20. It was only a few months and Tim said they broke up because she made out with another guy at a nightclub while drunk. Sarah got upset and started saying I had to break up with him because it was weird. She called Tim her “sloppy seconds” and tried to get our parents to force us to break up. I said no. It had been years since they’d been together and I didn’t even know Sarah when she was dating Tim. 

I got pretty upset because my family jumped on the bandwagon of saying we should break up. For the past few years at any family gathering Sarah would mention how they used to date and act like I stole her boyfriend and has been selling that narrative to my family and friends. It became obvious that she was jealous. But I liked Tim so we just ignored it and kept dating. 

So now a few year later Tim and I live together and we’ve been talking about marriage and stuff and I recently had a conversation with my mom about how I thought Tim was going to propose because he’s not exactly subtle and we’ve talked about this for a while. At which point Sarah who just moved back in with out parents walked in. She started asking a bunch of invasive questions about our relationship and being weird. 

Sarah is four months pregnant, the father she said was some deadbeat guy she’d hooked up with who wants nothing to do with her, but she wants to keep the baby. I’d been making an effort taking her to appointments and offering to help babysit and trying to be excited for her. Until a week ago when my stepdad sent me a long text saying how I can’t marry Tim because he is the real father of Sarahs baby. I was immediately very upset and confronted Tim who was completely shocked and said Sarah was lying. He said there’s no way and he didn’t cheat on me and he would gladly have a paternity test to prove that. Unsure I asked Sarah for more details about when they slept together which she says happened a few times. She was shaky and went back and forth on details. The dates and times don’t match up with what I can remember of what Tim and I have been doing. 

She also said she came to our house to see him but since Covid I’ve been working from home. So I cant imagine that they managed that. I’m pretty sure now that she’s lying to get us to break up because she’s still jealous. But now my family are involved and have been sending me hateful messages saying I need to break up with Tim and let him be with Sarah. She’s telling everyone he’s in love with her and I’m keeping him from her. She has no proof and he strictly denied everything. 

I texted her asking for proof of any of this happening and she sent me some fake photoshopped screenshots- that I can tell are fake. Where she’s put Tims name over a friends number and pretended he was messaging her. I checked and the friend all but admitted it to me and tried to laugh it off. She badly photoshopped the timestamps.

I actually don’t know what to do now. I believe Tim and we are still together but this has kind of thrown a wedge in everything. Sarah has poisoned my relationship with our parents and my family. I feel sick to my stomach and Sarah is now saying she won’t give me a paternity test. 

For now I’ve cut everyone off except Tim but I don’t know what to do now.

ANSWER: You can have Tim file a paternity action in court based on the accusations. Then a court order would force Sarah into admitting that she is lying.

Edit: Thanks for the awards and everything, but I should add that OP definitely needs to talk to an attorney first.

QUESTION: Update : I got pregnant at 16, my parents disowned me and tried taking custody of my daughter. After 10 years my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and both want to reconnect with me and get to know their grandchild. I need help on how to handle this.

Hey it's me. I wanted to update you on what happened.
Edit :apparently I have to make this clear. This is just an update post I have taken my decision. My parents will not meet my daughter until she is older and wants to. 


After some thought I decided to first meet my parents alone. I wanted to make a decision based on their remorse and development as human beings.

And they sadly didn't really change. When I agreed to meet I also told them it would be without my kid. Idk why but they thought they were going to meet her. They had bought presents and all. They were very disappointed to say it lightly when I showed up without her. They made no deal to hide it. But we talked. They fail to take any real responsibility for their actions. Every "apology" began with "we are sorry if you". When confronted about the CPS calls they say they were doing what was best for daughter. I got really mad but tried not to snap. They brought up every mistake I did as a young mother and that they just thought I was far too young and irresponsible to have a kid. That daughter only turned up good because of luck.

After they said that I laid down money for my meal stood up and said. "well nothing has changed. You are still the heartless persons that threw me out years ago and made my life hell for 5 years. You will never meet her. She is happy and she has loving grandparents"

They started to freak out saying that I couldn't withhold their grandchild from them. I just said that you lay in the bed you make.

I left and haven't talked to them since. Mails or letters from them are thrown out on the spot. I will eventually explain to my daughter what happened to me and my parents and will give her the chance to meet them when she is older but for now I don't want to deal with their bs.





Edit :Guys thank for your concerns but I am non US. Grand-parent rights are not a thing where I come from

Edit2: I think some of you are confused. I am not asking about advice of wethee or not I should give in to my parents request. That's what my last post was about. It's not unwillingness to reflect it's a set decision.

Also yes my daughter is in therapy due to her being traumatised by all that lovely cps visit that we're caused by my parents. So I Infact k ow my child is happy and healthy mentally as well as physically

ANSWER: The dying relative gambit is an extremely popular way to try and force contact. I had an Aunt who was dying for ten years, people kept saying I had to get in touch before the end.

I didn't.

She's still alive.

&#x200B;

I am very sorry you made this brave attempt to give them another chance, and they spat on it. Your heart was more open than mine is.

These people hurt you worse than anyone else in the world could, and they don't regret a god damn thing.

Fuck 'em.

I am impressed that you were defensive enough to protect your child through all this, they clearly expected things to go down differently.

Deleted as per mods request. 



---------------Actual Update---------------

After the post I decided it would be best to end things through a phone call. I mentioned ghosting, but it's probably best he knows how and why he fucked up. I waited until Saturday to reach out to him, told him "we need to talk." I'm paraphrasing here, but this is basically what the convo went like:

Dan: This is about the dinner, isn't it?

Me: Yeah it is. 

Dan: and?

Me: I don't think I've ever felt so unwelcome in a group before. It felt like a shitty interview, all they did was test my knowledge. No one tried to get to know 
me, and when actual conversation was going on I was ignored or interrupted if I tried to talk. 

Dan: I don't feel it like it was anything like that.

Me: Ok, so how often do you guys sit around just asking questions like "quick - what is the sql query if you want to delete two rows from two different tables!?!" 

Dan: I don't know

Me: No really, do you quiz your friends randomly like that at work or out and about? 

Dan: No not really

Me: And why not? why don't you just ask lightning round quizzes like that? B/c it's not what normal people do?

Dan: I don't know. They were just having fun and joking around.

Me: It wasn't fun for me. I have male and female friends in all sorts of professions, I've never cornered any of them to test their knowledge. I trust they know 
what they're doing. I ask them about work, what they're doing, you know normal questions. 

Dan: ok

Me: I'm not going to print out a CPA exam and quiz my accountant friend, don't you think that would be a little fucked up? 

Dan: I don't know, maybe? 



We talked a little more about that night, and I gave him more specific examples of what he and his friends did and he never really had any good answered. It was a lot of "i don't know" and single word answers. I told him I created a reddit post and I would send it to him. He was a little pissed off that I did that, felt like I had no right to so. At the end of the conversation he asked if we were done. I told him yeah, that I can't see a future with him, that I saw a different side of him that night and I don't want to be someone's prize poodle on display for the world to see. He didn't really say anything after that and just hung up the phone. I sent him the url for my first post. 



He texted me throughout the weekend, but I didn't respond. He read the post that I sent him and wasn't happy with it, and said he couldn't believe so many people were on my side and were hating on him. He sent a few more angry texts after that like he couldn't believe we were breaking up over something so stupid. He did send a few rounds of "I'm sorrys" and "let's try to work through this" but when I didn't respond he just went back to angry texting me. 



Also, I did find his friend who buried his head in his phone that night and sent him the reddit link and asked if that sounded like what happened. Dan's friend said he knew what his friends were doing were wrong, and felt bad for me. He apologized for not stepping in, and assumed that Dan would eventually speak up for me on my behalf. He also apologized for joining them in the beginning, and wished me luck in my career. 



tl:dr: I tried explaining how that night was weird, uncomfortable and fucked up. He didn't see my point of view, didn't learn any lessons from it. I broke it off, he has been sending me angry texts, I haven't responded.

EDIT: I know my first post was gilded and some of my comments too, instead of giving money to reddit or giving me gold I can't use on this account, please donate to this organization, winter is approaching and there are a lot of kids that don't have coats. https://www.operationwarm.org/get-involved/give-3/

ANSWER: You made the right decision, 100%. After your first post, I definitely thought Dan (and his friends) was a POS, but his reaction and surprise that people are on YOUR side is just the icing on the shit cake. Best of luck to you. You are strong and deserve so much more!

================================================================================

QUESTION: UPDATE: Boyfriend(29M) admitted that I am the oldest girlfriend(21F) he's ever had and now I want to break up with him

I could not post an update on the original post because it got removed after reaching a cap.

It has been a difficult time to be honest, my world has been turned upside down and I have been reeling from everything that happened. I cannot link to the previous post, but basically my 29 year old boyfriend nonchalantly admitted to dating a 15 y.o(when he was 27) and a 17 y.o(when he was 28) before he got with me.

I had been staying over at his place for the week and when I woke up from what i could only describe as a depression nap he was already in his home office working. I took the opportunity to pack my things and brace myself for what I was about to do. A part of me was still very much in denial of him being a predator and so I opted to fix breakfast so that I could get him to talk about it more and find out the true extent of these relationships.

I brought up his ex whilst we were eating, and he was more than inclined to talk about her. She went to the same high school as his sister (20F), and  that is how he met her. My now ex boyfriend makes a 6-figure salary and he drives a really flashy car, which he says was the reason she approached him, "to check it out". He continued to insist that she threw herself at him, and used him for his money when they finally got together. I asked him about the girls parents, and he said he met them and that they clearly didn't like him, but "as long as their daughter was happy, they were alright with it" that particular line did me in, but he harped on about how the dad never let him near his other kids and how much convincing it took for her parents to finally be alright with her sleeping over at his place.

He says that they broke up because she found someone wealthier and she dumped him. He apparently met the The second girl(17F) he dated online. I asked for specifics and he said she lied about her age on Tinder because she was turning 18 soon anyways (she apparently specified this in her bio) and they just "clicked" but he was only looking for a rebound - so they didn't "really date" they just "fucked" (his exact words). That apparently lasted a month until she dumped him as well.

When I asked him if he prefers girls in that age range he said "for sex yes, but obviously I want a more mature woman to grow old with" and he looked at me as if that statement was supposed to somehow reassure me, or make me feel better. I couldn't act passive anymore after that and I told him I do not think I am the woman he is going to grow old with. An argument ensued and he told me i was a "horrible fuck anyways" and "How dare you accuse me of such a horrible thing, you're sick" when I told him his proclivity for young girls was not normal and it might do him some good to get help for it. I grabbed my bags and drove back to my apartment.

Hindsight truly is 20/20 because so many red flags are glaring me in the face. I am petit (5'4, 120lbs) and he always liked how small I was, he constantly commented on it (I am not saying this is wrong, people have preferences but looking at the entire series of events, this is a bit eerie). There were a few times where he told me I remind him of his ex and even though it made me feel uneasy, i just dismissed it as him having a 'type', I also didn't know at the time that she was a teenager. He has been insistent on me moving in with him and quitting my job because he makes enough money for both of us to live comfortably and he made it sound so romantic - I was genuinely considering it (I think he might have been trying to isolate me, he already didnt like most of my friends). He was also very emotionally manipulative, all the times he has ever guilt tripped me or used the things I told him in confidence against me, all came rushing into my mind. I am starting to see how far from perfect our relationship was, and I am sick to my stomach thinking about it all.

We are in Washington and I do not know how I can possibly stop him from doing this to someone else because I have no evidence and I am afraid my claims will be dismissed if i report him. I am also concerned about how this will affect the victims in this case, is it really alright for me to report something on their behalf? I would like some advice on this, the guilt will eat me up if I do nothing.

tl;dr - I dumped my boyfriend because he didn't see anything wrong with him dating teenagers, but now I do not know how to stop him from victimizing even more young girls.

ANSWER: The guy is a fucking pedo. People will argue with me that a teenager does not count, but this guy is dicked in the head. He dated and had sexual relationships with a 15 year old girl and has the stones to blame her for being a gold digger. Then used a 17 year old. And now refers to YOU, at 21, as the mature aged woman to grow old with. DUdE. I had issues with your age gap, yet he thinks you are old in his eyes... this is the guy who will always fuck 18 year olds, til he gets too old and ugly, because no woman his age would ever put up with his shit. 

This is the biggest bullet you’ll ever dodge. Learn from it.

QUESTION: I’m a Korean female (24) in an interracial relationship with a white male (29) and struggling with identity issues

I’ve met my soulmate. He’s amazing, I’m crazy in love.. But the closer we get to marriage and children, the more resentful I become. I’m  sad and resentful, at no one and everyone, and I’m struggling with how to come to terms with it.

He’s white, I’m Korean. We’ve talked about race on multiple occasions. He’s even brought it up by asking what it was like to live in the US as an Asian female. He listened to my experience and asked a lot of questions. He’s the first non-minority I’ve ever dated who has made me feel heard and understood. He also has a million other wonderful traits, I love him very much and I’m so excited to have found the person I want to share my life with.

However, the more serious we get, the more frequently I experience episodes of anxiety about identity. I’m a Korean female adopted into a white family. My parents are white, my siblings are white, my extended family is white, my adorable little nieces and nephews are white, and I am almost always the only Asian person in whatever room I am in. I struggled with identity issues as a child (I learned how to use makeup to make me look ‘more white’, I stuffed my bra, hated my hips, begged my mom to let me dye my hair and buy contacts, etc…). With age and a lot of therapy I finally feel comfortable with who I am... and now I’m in a relationship with a 6ft tall ginger. He’s beautiful and I love him, but he looks nothing like me… and I fear that neither will our children. Maybe I’m wrong, but after using Google Images, I’m imaging slightly ‘exotic’ looking white children. I’m sure they’ll be absolutely adorable and I’ll love them to pieces, but they won’t look Asian.

When I thought about my life, I always imagined having children and I always imagined them being Asian. The idea of finally living in a home where there are people who look like me has brought me comfort for so long… and now I’m realizing that it may never become a reality. My partner and I do plan to adopt. We want to experience pregnancy by having one biological child and then adopt the rest. Adoption is very important to me, but we’re interested in adopting children who would otherwise grow up without a family- which means foster children and not the private adoption of Asian infants. The likelihood of us coming upon an Asian foster child who is available for adoption is quite small.

I’ve spent my whole life being ‘the other’ and now even the child who grows in my womb won’t look like me. It feels like a death in the family. It feels like I’m grieving this life that will never be and it’s bringing up a lot of pain I thought I had moved past. I don’t know how to feel.  I am incredibly sad about the idea of not having an Asian child, but at the same time I feel like his/her life would be better if he/she didn’t have to grow up as ‘the other’ in a predominantly white country.

I love my family, I have no regrets about being adopted. They’re incredible and have surrounded me with so much love and support. I love my boyfriend, and I want to spend the rest of my life with him… but I have so much anger and hurt inside of me that I’m always the friggin Asian girl. I hate being the only Asian in the room. I hate being the only Asian in my family. I hate it. I hate that I stand out in whatever group I’m in, and now I’m realizing that there will probably be a family portrait hanging above our fireplace of my white husband, our white children, and me.

I just reread this before posting, and it has a lot of anger. I just want to be clear that I have moments of anger and pain, but most of the time I’m happy and excited to start my life with him… it’s just rubbing old wounds that feel really raw. I feel stupid and petty putting it in writing, but the pain is real and I want to be able to move past it. Has anyone been in a similar experience? I would love any insight.

TLDR; Asian girl in a serious relationship with a white male and grieving that her children probably won’t look like her.

Edit: This got a lot bigger than I anticipated. I have noticed a lot of comments expressing concern that I would resent a white child or that I only want children to produce a lookalike, and I can understand those concerns- but it's not how I feel at all. I do want to add that  Relationship\_Advice is filled with posts from people who are expressing their deepest and darkest/most private fears. This is a deep, dark, and shameful fear of mine. Everyone has thoughts they are ashamed of and want to resolve. I would never get pregnant just to produce a lookalike, and I will love any child I have (biological/adopted/white/asain/blue/purple/green) with all of my heart. That doesn't change the fact that it can be really difficult to be the only person in 99% of the rooms you're in who looks like you. It's very common struggle among transracial adoptees and minorities in general. This isn't something I struggle with 24/7, it isn't one of my defining character traits, but it is a private pain I have. I was hoping to find other people who have experienced the same thing, and talking to them has been incredibly helpful. Thank you so much :) I really appreciate all of the insight and advice I've received. I'm going to get back into counseling to address these new and confusing Identity issues that have starting popping up.

ANSWER: I think one way to solve this feeling of “otherness” is to meet and hang out with other Korean people. if you were to explore your heritage more it might help you feel less alienated and more confident. A lot of first and second generation immigrants have this fear of losing themselves to white or American culture and I think talking to them might give you some answers to your problems. Also, if you become more confident in yourself and what makes being Korean special you may not be so scared about losing Korean physical features in your children especially if you have other Korean people around that you and them can see yourselves in.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (26f) am an escort and I am falling in love with one of my clients (39M)

If you are going to pass judgment on my profession please dont, if you are going to tell me I am being exploited please don't I am not here for that.

&#x200B;

I took on this client about a year ago. I was immediately struck with how handsome he was. As I got to know him he showed himself to be a kind, sweet, charismatic, utterly brilliant person. He is always gentle I never had to enforce any boundaries with him. Over the last year I have come to look forward to visits with him above any of my other clients. If there's a scheduling conflict I will give him the priority, lately I have been more intimate with him then my other clients, cuddles, kissing, hugs, and other things I dont do with my other clients. I love my overnights with him. We have long deep talks about everything we have a lot of shared interests and we just get along really well. I feel very safe with him.

&#x200B;

I am falling in love with him. Its never happened to me before. I have always kept emotion separate from my work but I cant help it with him. I will spend time with him I dont bill him for, I spend extra time with him and just love to be with him. I've been spending time with him casually, going on... dates I guess for lack of better word that I'm not billing for either and the lines are starting to become very blurry.  I dont know what to do. I think I want to move the relationship from professional to personal, truth is it's already becoming personal to me, but I cant imagine he would be ok with my work if I was his gf. I am afraid of being rejected by him and ruining our work relationship, I think I would give this up to be with him but that presents a whole new set of problems for me in finding a new career.

&#x200B;

I dont know what to do. Do I go for it? Risk rejection and ruining our professional relationship? Do I give up my career for him if he says yes? I dont think I could continue this if I was with him personally. Do I just keep silent and continue our relationship as is? Or do I drop him as a client altogether? I was never looking for a guy to "save me" but I cant help what I'm feeling for him.

&#x200B;

\Edit\I know why hes single. His wife died in an accident 3 years ago.

Edit2 I cant believe how many responses this post has gotten. I am going for it. I'll tell him this week. Now to figure out how. Lots had asked if I have a back up I do.

Edit 3 I'm about to leave for lunch with him. I'm not going to bring it up yet but I do intend to ask him if he ever sees himself getting married again. Thanks for all the support. I didn't expect to see this much support.

Edit 4 Lunch was nice. We had a good time. I did ask him if he felt like he could ever be married again. he said 3 years ago the answer would be a hard no but now he wasn't so sure. Then he asked me if I ever saw myself getting married and I had a similar answer, I told him I asked him if he wanted to come to dinner at my place tonight, not work, personal. He said he's like that. I'm going for it.

Final Update 

Well I truly didn't expect this post to get the reception it did. I didn't think this many people would care and become so invested in my story. I really didn't expect all the support I got. I was flooded with Comments, Pms and chat requests. Some were about what I expected. Accusations of gold digger, and "cant turn a hoe into a housewife" type comments thats really the response I expected. What I didn't expect were the thousands of comments and messages of support. You were all right in that I did know what I really wanted. I did know what my heart was telling me but seeing thousands of people tell me to go for it was the push I needed to not waste anymore time. Shoot your shot right?

&#x200B;

I'd like to address a few things before I get into the update

&#x200B;

A few people mentioned the story about his wife might be fake and he's secretly married. I was pretty sure he wasn't married I did out-calls to his home and my married clients NEVER take me to their home always a hotel. But I was regularly in his home, I saw the pictures of her around the house I know she was real. 

&#x200B;

How can I trust a guy who uses escorts? Well this is a silly thing to judge him on considering what I do. I cant imagine judging a man for using my service. I was his first too and unless hes a good actor I know the awkwardness of a first timer and he was definitely awkward when we first met. I never asked him if he started seeing other escorts because frankly its none of my business. 

&#x200B;

I should wait for him to approach me. Unfortunately this probably wouldn't work. As the lines became blurred I did tell him about a few clients who became overly possessive, obsessive and jealous I had to drop. I am sure he thought the same would happen to him if he tried to tell me he wanted a personal relationship. I had to be the one to make this move

&#x200B;

Do I want to do this forever/Do I really want to give it up? Different variations on this theme of leaving the biz. Some in favor some against. Bottom line is I don't think I see myself doing this into my 30's. It used to be fun and exciting but lately it hasnt been. it just feels like work now and the only meets I look forward to anymore are the ones with him. I also don't feel good about the idea of being committed to him but still seeing clients. I heard from a lot of other sex workers and clients who were able to make that arrangement work but I just cant. Even if he would be ok with it I just cant. Another add on to this is a friend of mine who has never been crazy about what I do. Shes given me a standing offer to go to work with her company on the sales team.

&#x200B;

A lot of people suggested we try going out as friends and doing things outside our "working" relationship. I imagine my comments answering this one were buried in the flood of comments so I'll put it here. We have been. For some time now. We meet for lunches, dinners, we go to the movies and make little trips to sites around where we live. We also text throughout the week. 

&#x200B;

Ok on to the Update. I think I left off yesterday that we had met for lunch. This was sort of a normal thing for us lately and we had a nice chat. I posed to him the question of if he ever saw himself falling in love and marrying again. He said after his wife died he didn't think it would be possible but now he thinks he might be able to with the right person. Then he followed up with a question about if I would ever think about leaving the biz and getting married. And I sorta answered the same, with the right person, followed by a pointed stare. He had to go back to work by this point and I invited him to my home for dinner. this was a first. He has never been to my home. I dont bring clients back there only friends. I hoped that sent a strong signal to him. 

&#x200B;

I went back home and started getting ready, I had to go shopping for some things and get the place ready to have a guest over. I called my friend up she knows about this guy and has been on the same page as Reddit pushing me to make a move and settle down into something more "normal" I told her about the reddit post and said I was making the jump. I also let her know I wanted to take her up on her offer. I called up my upcoming appointments and canceled. I said something had come up and I wouldn't be available. I'm out. I'm done regardless of what happened with him If I cant get my head in the game anymore and I'm getting too personal, plus now I am realizing I want to be in a relationship and I cant separate sex from my feelings like I thought, its time to call it. This isn't what I want anymore. This choice was for me not him. Even if things didn't work out with him I realized I really did want to be in a committed relationship with someone. One thing that people mentioned was the idea that he could turn violent when I told him. I honestly didn't believe he would but I asked my friend to call and check on me just in case. She knows the drill we have safe and emergency words set up and we have a plan for if she gets no response from me at all.

&#x200B;

I got my shopping done and got dinner going, set the place up nice and romantic, and got myself dolled up nice and sexy and got ready to have him over. He came by at around 7. He had flowers for me and a bottle of wine. I invited him. He said he wasn't sure if he should bring payment or not and just did. I told him that wasn't necessary he wasn't here as a client. I dont bring clients to my home. I was really hoping he was getting the hint. Dinner was going nicely we had our usual rapport but I could tell he was a little perplexed about what this was all about. So I put on my big girl panties gathered my courage, and "Shoot my shot" as you all put it. I told him I was dropping him as a client. He looked surprised and hurt, he wanted to know why? What did he do wrong? Did something happen. I assured him it want about him. I was leaving the biz and dropped all my clients. I told him about the job I took and he wished me good luck, he said I was attractive and charming and he was sure I would do well in sales. He said he was going to miss me. I took a big deep breath and said. "You dont have to miss me if you dont want to" And then I spilled it. He was the only client I brought home to tell in person. I laid it all out all the things I mentioned in the post. How I felt about him and how I didnt want to be his escort anymore. I wanted to be his girlfriend. I said I understand he paid me to leave and not stick around and now I was asking to stick around and I would understand if he didnt want to continue on. He said who told you that? That he paid me to keep coming back not to leave. He said he felt it too but he wasn't sure if it was appropriate to ask me that. He was still hurt over his wife And that he wasnt even sure if he was ready but that some of the best things in his life he started when he wasn't sure if he was ready. He asked me if I was ok with being with someone who was still hurting over his ex. I told him I could work with it and that I wasn't trying to replace her. We kissed. I led him into my bedroom and we made love. 

&#x200B;

We spent some time after in each others arms talking about what comes next. He offered to help me make the transition but I told him I wanted to try and do this on my own and not rely on him. I appreciated his offer and if I needed the help I would ask but I need to do try on my own at first. He respected that. I told him that things would change now. As his GF I would have expectations of him I never had as an escort. He was ok with that. I told him I never asked or cared if he saw other women before but now I wanted monogamy I would give it and I wanted it in return so if he was seeing other escorts that would have to end and I reminded him I dropped my clients. He said that wasn't a problem. I was the only one. He spent the night with me and left this morning.

 

&#x200B;

Where is this going to lead us next? I have no idea. Maybe I am making a huge mistake, maybe this was fate, maybe this was God working in mysterious ways maybe we're just two lost and lonely souls tossed around by the stormy seas of life that managed to find each other and cling to each other. Fate, fairy tale or fluke we are going to see where this leads us next, and we're doing it together. I'm excited, elated and terrified all at once. My whole life has drastically changed in just a day. I didn't intend to move this fast but once this train started rolling it seemed like there was no stopping it. 

&#x200B;

To everyone who said I was a worthless whore who could never be loved, fuck you too, to everyone who expressed concern thank you, maybe this is a mistake but I have to find out, To everyone who encouraged me to go for it thank you, you were right, without the thousands of responses to go for it I would have languished in that limbo for a lot longer. 

&#x200B;

As a final thought I want to say that this isn't normal. If you see sex workers please dont see think this is the norm and that the women you see may also fall in love with you. While I'm sure it happens and Ive heard from others who were in similar positions to mine its really not the norm. If you're considering Sex Work because you think you can find prince charming know this outcome is very unusual. Oh and I hated Pretty Woman btw. I never thought it would be me one day. 

&#x200B;

You can pm nice comments to me if you have something supportive to say. If you just want to spite bile save it.

ANSWER: Without speaking to whether you “should” give up your career, I DO think you should tel him! You’ll never know if you don’t try, and it might be worth the risk.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (44M) want to read my daughter’s (17F) diary to find out why she left us. My wife (43F) says we should absolutely not

EDIT: After another restless night, I was very surprised to wake up to this. Thank you so much for your condolences and for sharing your thoughts and experiences. I wish I could respond to all of you but I am mentally exhausted. Again, thank you all so much.

My (44M) daughter (17F) committed suicide two months ago. It was honestly a big shock as she’s never shown any signs that she wanted to take her life. My wife and I blame ourselves and wishes that we could’ve done more. She was in therapy for something unrelated, she was very afraid and would panic at the sight of blood, so we thought that her feelings in general would be addressed during her sessions. We were always very supportive of her, asking her about her days or if she’s having any troubles about anything when she’s noticeably looking down. 

We only started cleaning out her room a week ago. I was going through her closet and tucked at the very back was a small backpack with her diary in it. I really wanted to read it because my daughter didn’t leave anything behind, not a note saying why she did it or anything, so I was hoping that maybe something in her diary would shine light as to why she did what she did. I brought the idea up to my wife and she said absolutely not, though she’s not with us anymore, she still deserves the utmost respect. My son (14M) also wants to know why her sister left but doesn’t think that reading her diary is the way to go about it.

I don’t know, I feel like we need closure. My family and her friends need closure. My wife cries herself to sleep every night, repeating that she wishes we could’ve done something different, and I comfort her. My son obviously misses his sister as they were so close. He misses her so much that sometimes we’d find him asleep by the door of his sister’s room in the middle of the night. My daughter didn’t have any social media presence but had a good amount of friends and none of them know why she did it either. This diary is our last shot of giving everyone she knew the answer why. I know diaries are very intimate and the last thing I want to do is disrespect my daughter.

If I don’t end up reading her diary, how will I find closure? How will my family move past this? Everyday is filled with tears and many thoughts of “why?” Was it my wife and I’s fault? We don’t know, which is why I want to know. If it was us, I don’t want to have us make the same mistakes with our only child left. I don’t know exactly what I’m asking for but anything would be appreciated.

ANSWER: Hey OP my dad passed away when I was 11 and when I turned 25 my aunt gave me some journals he wrote and gave me the option to read them or not or whatever. I agonized over it for a long time but eventually I did read them. The situation isn't exactly the same but I can tell you this: it was incredibly difficult and incredibly painful. Most people tend to journal more about negative things than the positive, and some of the things there made me struggle a lot. I don't think I regret the choice to read them but I would highly recommend waiting a while before trying to know what's in there. It's entirely possible that it will not give you closure, and you can never unknow the things you read so you need to be sure you're ready for it.  
 I like the idea of asking her therapist to read them, or even a different therapist who didn't even know her, It seems like much less of an invasion of privacy to have someone else read her personal thoughts and feelings. I think the most important thing though is that you and your wife come to an understanding about this, because it is not worth it to read them if it will seriously hurt your wife.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (25F) grandparents walked in on me getting spanked by my boyfriend (28M)

I was raised by my grandparents, and gave them a key to my place for emergencies. Well, my grandma gets really worried if you don't reply to her texts in an hour. 

This specific day was the first day I saw my boyfriend in weeks, because he had to go abroad for work and we wanted a bit of alone time. We put our phones on silent so we wouldn't be disturbed. Apparently my grandma wanted me to pick something up for her, and got worried when I didn't pick up the phone or respond to her messages for a few hours. 

She decided to come over to my apartment with my grandpa since she was worried, and used the emergency key. When they walked in I was splayed over my boyfriend's lap and we were both buck naked. 

Since we are the only people that live in the apartment, we do whatever we want wherever we want. This time, on the couch. Which meant that my boyfriend's hand hovering over my bare ass was the first thing my grandparents saw when they walked in.

I've never seen two people back out of an apartment so quickly in my life. My grandma still giggles nervously when she talks to me and my grandpa won't make eye contact with me when we FaceTime. 

How do I make this less awkward? A talk about my sexual preferences is not one that I want to have with the people that raised me.

ANSWER: >How do I make this less awkward? 

You don't. You let them learn a lesson about boundaries. 

They'll get over it in time, but you've done nothing wrong here so don't act as though you have.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife (36F) won't stop forcing me to drink her coffee... I don't want to hurt her feelings but I can't go on like this.

My wife (36F) lost her job recently, while I (48M) am currently working from my home office. Because I don't often get a chance to take breaks, she is kind enough to bring me a coffee once in a while. Nothing fancy, just regular filter coffee.

This used to only happen once every few hours, so in an average day I'd drink maybe... 2-3 cups of coffee. That was fine.

The problem has come in recent weeks. When I sit down at my desk (usually 8.00-8.30) there is a steaming cup of coffee waiting for me. Great. I drink it. But almost as soon as I've finished, my wife will come in and leave me with a fresh cup of coffee.

Every 15-20 minutes, she will come into the room and bring me more coffee. I like coffee enough in the mornings, but I do not need to chug gallons of it throughout the day. The mugs that she brings me are not small either.

There are some issues I don't know how to explain or address. If I let the coffee go cold, she will make upset faces and often refuse to speak to me (sometimes for hours/even a full day) until I ask her for more coffee. I will admit that sometimes I deliberately don't drink my morning coffee on purpose just so I can get a few hours of peace.

We've talked about this repeatedly and almost daily at this point. Every time she comes in with a coffee, I'll tell her that I've had enough and I don't want any more. She will often just silently put the coffee down next to me and the process will repeat again.

I've asked for other drinks (water, coke sometimes) and she will sometimes bring these instead, but as soon as I've finished she will bring me another coffee.

Now I'm getting regular headaches, nausea, and sometimes I'll be able to feel my own heartbeat. I don't think for a second that all this coffee is good for me. 

TL;DR: my wife brings me coffee constantly and expects me to drink it, how do I approach this?

ANSWER: Somehow through all of this, you have never asked her, "Why do you keep bringing me all this coffee?"

Edit: Stop telling me the post says they've talked about it. I don't know what it says about society that so many people apparently think "I want you to stop doing this" is the same as asking her why she is doing this.

QUESTION: Girlfriend’s little brother used my collection of ‘64 Kennedy Half Dollars to buy drugs

My girlfriends little brother is 19 and not going to college or doing anything except smoking weed and playing video games. He lives with us (we are both late 20’s and have FT jobs).

I have been stacking 1964 Kennedy half dollars for ten years now. For those that don’t know, they have a face value of $0.50 but they are made of 90% silver and so they are actually currently worth about $6 each.

I had 200, which means that his dumbass only got $100 worth of drugs yet essentially stole $1200 from me.

I insist that my girlfriend pays me back the $1200 because that is the current value in silver like I mentioned. Whereas she is arguing that she only owes me $100 because that’s what her brother thought he was stealing. And according to her “he only got $100 of weed so that’s fair”. Okay so then what about my $1100 on top of that? What then?

She also called my silver stack “useless and paranoid and stupid”. I collect them partially for a store of value Incase of inflation or deflation, but I also just enjoy looking at them and the hobby of it.

I guess I’m looking for opinions on if she should pay the full $1200 that they’re worth for the value of silver. It also seems like she is trying to make me out to be a conspiracy theorist who is hoarding silver for the end times. Which is sorta true lol but what would that change anyways?

ANSWER: Instead of asking for 1200 bucks just ask her 100 in the same '64 Kennedy Half Dollars. Then it's up to her how to get those as cheap as possible and prove her point.

I wanna thank you all for taking your time and reaching out and giving advice. 

The last few days, I feel like a burden was lifted off me, especially from my parents who always expect many things from me. The first day after the confrontation was a shit show. My parents forced relatives to reach out to me asking me to see reason (lmao), I declined. They stopped after 2 days after a harsh message from me requesting no contact.

I also took appointments for family planning (vasectomy) which is next month. Some people asked if I would ever tell my family about this, but I will not. My body, my business. I will of course tell potential future dates that I am childfree and also had a vasectomy beforehand.

Some people asked where I am from. I am from India.

ANSWER: This is so abusive, manipulative, and devastating. I'm happy for you that you did the smart thing and were able to stick up for yourself to your family - especially in a culture that makes that so hard.

It's time to start living your live, no contact with toxic family

================================================================================

QUESTION: My(23F) boyfriend(25F) left me on the side of the road and I deserved it.

My amazing, beautiful boyfriend had decided to treat me to dinner since we'd both had long weeks. He was making me laugh and we were talking and having a really good time. After we were done we left, and we were about half way home when I asked him if we could stop and get some dessert. He said something like "Haha, didn't we just eat?" and keeps driving. My stupid, selfish self pushes it and says "C'mon, please? I want something sweet.", he replies that we have ice cream at home and continues driving. After that I kept on pushing it and pushing it and pushing it, and while he's being way more patient with me than I deserve, he's firm and says no. I give up, but then i see a fast food restaurant up the road and jokingly pull the wheel to go into the parking lot. Apparently I pulled harder than I thought because we actually ended up swerving, and hit another car lightly. To make things worse, he just bought this car. The driver motions for us to pull into the parking lot, and when we do he and my boyfriend get out, and the driver starts cussing him out and saying horrible things to him, even though there wasn't any damage to both the cars (the bumper has the littlest little dent on it, and the other car had no damage). They didn't even exchange any information. While he's being yelled at, I don't get out of the car and let him be punished for something I did. When he gets back in and starts driving, he's gripping the steering wheel so hard that the veins on his arms are popping out. His entire face is red and he hasn't said anything to me. To try and break the tension a little, I say "Well, that could've gone a lot worse." As soon as I say that, he stomps on the breaks and just tells me to get out of his sight, in the angriest voice imaginable. I've never felt afraid of him, but in that moment I did. He looked like he was struggling not to hurt me. I got out and he sped off. It was starting to get dark and I was in a stretch of woods. It took almost an hour for me to walk home, but when I got there him and all his stuff was gone.

I feel so horrible. I cant even apologize to him because he hasn't been responding to my calls and texts. We've had fights before about my childish quirks when they go a little bit too far, and now I don't have a boyfriend anymore because of it. I've been getting texts like "Wtf" and "What the hell is wrong with you" from our friends so I think he's told them what happened. 

It seems like everybody's mad at me. Is there any way to fix this? How can I apologize to them when all our friends are siding with him?

ANSWER: You could have killed someone. You are fortunate you didn't. You need to step back and analyze yourself. This isn't "childish" behavior. What makes you think grabbing a steering wheel is ok? You're a gown ass adult. You don't appologise. You offer to pay to fix the damages and grow the hell up.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (26F) husband’s (28M) friend (29F) sent him a text saying “look at your other phone ;)”… he doesn’t have another phone.

Basically, what the title says.

Yesterday my husband fell asleep on the couch with his phone on his chest. As he turned over the phone dropped. I went to pick it up to make sure he hadn’t accidentally cracked the screen and the phone lit up with a text from his friend Amber which read “look at your other phone ;)”, there was also a second text which said “goodnight xxx”. I put the phone back down on the ground because I didn’t want him to know I had seen it.

When he woke up, he was looking frantically for his phone and when I told him it fell, he looked relieved as soon as he picked it up. He started smiling when he replied to his messages. When we went to bed, I sat up all night waiting to see if he would take out this mysterious second phone, but he just went to sleep straight away and never woke up again in the night.

Is there a reasonable explanation for this? Did she accidentally text the wrong person? Do I confront my husband? Snoop? What the hell is going on?

TL;DR – Husband’s friend sent a suspicious text, now I’m questioning if he has a second phone.

UPDATE: So I looked everywhere for a second phone (house and car) and I couldn't find anything anywhere. My husband was in the shower so I checked his phone to make sure I saw the message correctly and it was gone. I'm really confused.

ANSWER: Personally I wouldn't say anything just yet. That would give him the opportunity to delete and get rid of evidence.  He clearly seems to think you are either dumb or too naive to suspect anything.  Use that to your advantage.  
When I finally caught my ex cheating..his old phone was still signed into his email.  I made copies of everything I could. Printed everything out. So when I started getting the bullshit answers.  I just gave him a Manila envelop with all the evidence I had gathered. 
Good luck.  Hopefully this isn't as bad as it sounds.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (32 F) work overnights. My father-in-law (60s M) keeps bad mouthing me and telling everyone I'm lazy. I'm afraid people are starting to buy it.

I work overnights in a very demanding medical field. My sleep schedule has always been nocturnal, so this feels more natural to me than working days and brings my stress down.  My husband is gone 5 days out of the week as a truck driver, and my days off are the same days he's home thanks to my seniority, and we are both night owls during this period.

My mother-in-law recently passed away, so my father-in-law sold everything and moved to where we were and has been included in my family events. At Christmas, my brother pulled me aside to let me know that my father-in-law is telling anyone who will listen that I am lazy because I 'sleep all day.'

I work 12-24 hour shifts at my job during the days I am working. The only reason I get my days off to align with my husband is the seniority I have, and even then I often have to work when he's home.

I've now noticed that, along with him calling me, I am starting to miss calls around 2 or 3 pm from family members who know I am home and are asking me to do things for them during the day. I am usually asleep by noon and have to be up for work around 8 or 9 pm. I've sat these people down to explain that I am an overnight emergency worker and that I need my sleep.

My husband sat my father-in-law down and explained to him what I do, how I need my sleep, and that he's being a jerk. My father-in-law maintains that a real job doesn't have overnights. I don't want to have to cut contact with him because we are the only family he has left. My husband stands behind me and says if I want to cut him out even just to let him have a time out, he's game.

I also don't know how to address my whole family about this. My Mom combats it as much as possible, but his way of thinking is starting to permeate them, too.

TL;DR: I am emergency medical personnel that works 3rd shift. My father in law thinks I'm lazy and is starting to infect some of my family with that idea. How do I combat this?  


Edit: Thank you for all the comments. I wasn't expecting this to blow up. I posted it and went to sleep, thinking I'd have a few good replies. I'm on PTO for the next few days, so I will be taking some of this advice and talking to the problematic folks.

ANSWER: Start ringing fil in at 2/3in the morning and asking him why he isnt up yet, tell him hes lazy for sleeping when your at work, when he tells you you're being ridiculous respond accordingly

================================================================================

QUESTION: UPDATE to 'Should I (27/M) tell my friend (25/M) that I didn’t realize we were dating?'

[Here's the original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ivh400/should_i_27m_tell_my_friend_25m_that_i_didnt/)

So we had our dinner/movie night yesterday and I was very nervous. Mostly because I was scared that how new it was to me was going to be a deal-breaker. But Erik came over and I think he instantly realised I was acting weird. He didn’t say anything while he was helping me cook but then when we sat down to eat he almost immediately asked what was up. So I basically said something like  “I really like you and I wanna see where this goes, but I want you to know it’s very new to me and I’m not sure you’re cool with that”. And he asked what exactly was new to me and I said I’d only dated girls before. Which then lead to a conversation where I couldn’t avoid telling him that I didn’t realize we were dating until that lunch. He actually got really quiet for a few seconds after that and I was scared he was upset but then he just laughed. 

Basically, he thought I’d been flirting with him for quite some time (looking back I probably was, just not intentionally) and all of his friends had been saying like “he seems so into you, it’s really obvious, he’s probably just too shy to make the first move”. He even mentioned some other stuff we or I had done that I gotta admit definitely doesn't sound platonic when he retells it, so I can see why they thought that and ultimately they were right I guess. And during that lunch he’d apparently thought I was reaching to grab his hand so he reached out too, otherwise he probably wouldn’t have done it because he said he's never been good at making the first move physically. He said when he asked me to dinner that was a huge deal and his friends had tried to hype him up for a while and that's probably why I didn't realize that he was asking me out since he was super nervous. 

Anyway, we ended up talking a lot after dinner. He didn’t come out publicly (aside from a few close friends) until a year or so ago either, so he definitely understood that I don’t have a lot of experience. He hasn’t had a lot of relationships in general (at least not any proper and public ones) since he hadn’t come out and it’s a pretty conservative area so there aren’t a lot of guys who’re out of the closet here. He actually admitted that he’d even been nervous to talk to me that first time we met since I looked kind of lumberjack-y (his words not mine, though the day we met I think I hadn’t shaved in a while so I don’t doubt it) and he also knows rumors travel fast here, especially when someone doesn’t really fit in, so I guess he was worried that I’d fit the small town conservative type or have heard all the gossip. The whole 'it's a date' thing for example would never happen between two guys who are just friends here. I’ve definitely noticed the culture and it’s something we talked about too since being out here isn’t always easy, so we might try to keep it lowkey at first and mostly tell his friends and some of mine. 

I could probably ramble on about him and what we talked about for a long time, but to keep it short it was a really nice talk and we want to take it slow but we also realize we’ve basically been half-dating since May, so it felt weird not to make it official. So I guess I’ve got a boyfriend now, thanks guys :)

TL;DR The talk went great, we discussed all the misunderstandings and he had no issues with me never having dated a guy before, especially since he hasn't been out for long. So we're officially together now!

EDIT: I really didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did, but I truly appreciate all the kind words and I'm really happy you found some joy in this story that just started with me being oblivious and confused. I might actually have to show this to Erik because all the support is making me really emotional over here!

EDIT 2: I’m kind of shocked at the number of comments on here, I thought there were a lot just when I went to bed a few hours ago. It’s overwhelming in a lot of different ways to say the least. I only started using Reddit for renovation advice and that usually gets me a few helpful comments, so I guess that’s what I thought would happen here too. Thank you for all of your love though. I’ll try to respond to a few questions later when I’m not feeling as overwhelmed, but I’m sorry that I can’t answer you all.

EDIT 3: Okay, last update before I logout. I’m very overwhelmed in a lot of different ways and I think it’s best for my anxiety to exit this now. I know it sounds silly since I posted on here asking for comments but I’m just not good at getting attention and I didn’t expect more than a handful of helpful comments since that’s what I usually get on my main account when I ask about renovations. I guess I should’ve prepared for the small chance that a lot of people saw this but after my original post got about 10 or so comments I didn’t think much of it when posting the update. 

I looked through some of the comments and messages though and I wanted to answer some of the main questions at least: 

- I’m not American and no, English isn’t my first language. The only reason I added that to my main post is because sometimes on my main account there would be phrases or names of tools I just don’t understand or know the word for. I see now maybe that wasn’t needed here and I’m sorry if it confused any of you. I studied English for many years but school English is very different from internet and every day English. I know my grammar pretty well and basic vocabulary, but I couldn’t do my job in English. 

- Some people asked where I lived and how it could be so conservative. It's just a small town culture that I can't quite explain. Everyone knows everyone, false rumours spread easily, there are some people who're known to cause trouble who grew up here and think they own the place. On top of that just the general attitude towards everything is very old-fashioned. It's not hard to avoid, but still worrying. 

- I don’t use this subreddit. People have mentioned like 5 different posts that are apparently very similar, but based on how many people in the comments have also been in this situation maybe it’s pretty common. I genuinely don’t know what you want me to say to that except I haven’t read them and I can’t seem find them either. I can only speak for myself and you can choose to believe me or not, that’s up to you. I got the advice I needed and that's all that matters to me at least. 

- I know this might sound very love-story or movie like, but in reality it’s just me realizing I like someone and wanting to start a relationship with him. My life isn’t very exciting and I prefer it that way, which is why I’m very happy I made this a throwaway account so I can go back to my regular stuff haha! 

And while this is making me quite anxious, I don’t regret posting it. Reading other people’s stories has been very emotional and I wish I could handle going through all of them, but I don’t think that would be good for me right now. Just know I appreciate all the advice and love. I didn’t want to bring this up because it seemed irrelevant, but after my last breakup I was probably at my absolute lowest point and I never expected that I would get to a place where I’m feeling this hopeful, at least not this fast. So again, thank you so much and maybe I’ll update this in the future if something happens, but right now I’m happy to leave it at this!

ANSWER: This is super adorable. If you guys end up together for the long haul, this will make a great "how we started dating" story.

How did you two start dating? "By accident."

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (17m) just found out that my sister (35) is actually my mother.

Update: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/hoi00p/update\_i\_17m\_just\_found\_out\_that\_my\_sister\_35\_is/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hoi00p/update_i_17m_just_found_out_that_my_sister_35_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

Sorry if this is super long...

My sister wasn't around much when I was growing up because she was in college then medical school. She'd visit on holidays and the weekends if she wasn't busy. Whenever she'd visit she would spend a lot of time with me and she'd take me places, buy me things and give me advice when I needed it. I always felt like I could tell her anything and she wouldn't judge me for it. She never really got along with our parents and I never knew what it was about but they would argue often and there was always a lot of tension around them. My parents were very loving and we get along so no issues there.

When she started dating her now  husband she spent less time with me and she would come over less often. 5 years ago she got married to the guy.  I don't like him at all. He's like an overgrown frat guy and he's always teasing me or saying dumb shit, he can never read the room. I've spoken to my sister about it but she says that it's just his way of bonding with people and that he means well and is a nice guy. He's been a pain in the ass for 5 years and just when I was going to give him a chance he fucked it up.

My sister and her husband came over for dinner two nights ago and were going to sleep over because they live 2 hours away. He took that as an opportunity to drink as much as he wanted. He's already insufferable when sober so drunk him is even worse. My sister and I were catching up because it's been a while and I was telling her how I would like to go into the medical field like her. Jackass husband then comes in saying that it's great that I want to follow in my mom's footsteps. My mom has never worked in the medical field so I was confused and thought he was just being dumb but my sister's face went so pale and my parents were very quiet. I just looked at my sister and could tell that it wasn't just a dumb comment. I locked myself in my room and didn't come out until the next day. There was a lot of yelling and I just learned something huge so I didn' want to deal with it.

When I finally decided to leave the room I saw that my sister was sitting right outside the door and that jerk was gone. I asked her wtf was going on and told her not to lie to me or I'll never speak to her again. She told me that she got pregnant in her senior year of high school and the guy cut all contact with her. She wanted to keep me and our parents were fully supportive of her. She found out that she got into her dream school but she would have to either give up the school or give me up. She couldn't choose so she decided to keep both. She spoke to our parents about it and the plan was to have them take care of me while she's in school and when can she will take me back. I was supposed to grow up knowing that she is my mom but because she was so busy and stressed out she didn't think that she could handle motherhood. Our parents noticed that she was pulling away so they adopted me and raised me as theirs. She said that she was young and dumb at the time so she agreed with the adoption.  She said that she thought of dropping out and taking me back so many times but thought I was better off without her as a mom.

As the years went by she saw less reason to tell me since I was doing good and was being well taken care of. She started crying and telling me that she regrets her decision and wants to be my mom even though I'm almost an adult she wants us to start over as mother and son. I told her I'd think about it and then she left. I went to speak to my parents. They told me that they did everything for me because they love me and I'm not obligated to leave now that I know. They said that things don't have to change if I don't want them to. It seemed more like they didn't want things to change.

I feel like my whole life is a lie. I know that I was well taken care of and I don't want to seem ungrateful but I was lied to my whole life. I don't see myself calling my sister "mom" and living life as if everything is ok. My parents are the ones who raised me so how could I just leave them like that. On the other hand if I don't decide to go with my sister she might feel like I'm rejecting her or that I hate her and after 17 years she might really give up on me. I'm so torn and feel betrayed. I can't believe that I found out from that asshole. That makes me even more mad.  I feel like I have to pick a side I don't know how to do that. I kinda just wanna run away and forget about all of this. Everyone is kinda leaving it up to me and I don't even know what I want for breakfast on a good day.

How do I approach this without everyone getting hurt?

ANSWER: You don’t have to pick a side. I’m fairly sure your sister will understand that you can’t “start over”, you’re about to be an adult. She watched you grow up, be it from the sidelines, so she didn’t completely miss anything. And of course your parents don’t want things to change, they raised you as their own so they see you as such! If you are okay with the way things are, your birth mother being your sister and your grandparents being your parents, then tell them just that. 

This is going to take time to adjust to and your relationship with your sister is going to be a little different simply bc you now know who she really is to you, but that doesn’t mean that time won’t get you back to where you were or to where you want to be with her. 

Take some time, as much as you need, and think about what you want to change if you want anything to change at all. Nobody says you have to know right now and nobody in their right mind would expect you to. They all love you, but do what you think is best for you. Everyone made their decisions, now it’s time for you to take your time making yours.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Update: My (23F) fiance (24M) has gotten way too overweight and I'm now having second thoughts about marriage.

https://reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hbs6nu/my_23f_fiance_24m_has_gotten_way_too_overweight/

Well, here goes... not a great update.

I took a number of suggestions on what to bring up to him and how to have the conversation about my concerns. He did the usual thing of trying to brush it off. I persisted, much more than I have before. Eventually I got my wish, he finally told the truth. Not easily, mind, this was a several hours long ordeal. He did NOT want to come clean about anything.

He has a weight gain fetish. Not me or someone else gaining weight, which I already knew was a thing, but HIM gaining weight. He's been doing all of this on purpose, for years. He said the beginning was unintentional, just eating too much junk at college. Then he realized he liked it. He also realized if he let himself balloon too much I might bail. He didn't want to lose me. So he had enough self control to keep it at a moderate level, until I accepted his proposal last year. That was apparently the green light he needed to throw restraint to the wind and start pursuing this fetish full speed ahead.

I never had a single inkling of suspicion the entire time. I guess I can't blame myself for that because dramatic weight gain is usually for the reasons I assumed... depression or stress or bad habits or just getting comfortable and not caring. You never hear of sexual motivations. I still feel like a complete and utter fool. Like I got played, hard. This was NOT what I thought I was marrying into.

When, if ever, was he going to tell me? He claims he "would have when it was the right time". What does that mean? Next week? Doubt it. Years in the future when we maybe have kids? More likely.

Oh and the reluctance to do anything requiring getting off the internet that I mentioned? That's because he's posting in forums and discord fetish communities talking about it. All these people share weight gain tips and compare "progress pictures" of their bellies and write pornographic roleplay stories. I'm truly disgusted. I've obliviously been sat right next to him countless times while he gets off in his own little world. 

He has even discussed with random strangers how to keep me in the dark. Apparently the most common suggestion was "play dumb and make it into a running joke", so there's my explanation for why he constantly dismissed anything I said. Unbelievable.

This has been going on right under my nose for years. I really cannot fathom how I could be so clueless. And that the person I thought I knew had the gall, to not only intentionally make himself obese, but to hide his motivations from me, seek out advice on how to do that, and lie to me over and over when I attempted to talk about my worry.

I expressed how I felt seriously betrayed, like our relationship had been built on a false pretense without my knowledge. He did apologize sincerely. He said he would "try" to lose weight. I asked why is he only saying that now? Why did he refuse to discuss let alone change anything all the other times I asked what was up? Leaving me to be confused and worried instead. He didn't have an answer. He just begged me to give him one chance and promised he'd stop and get healthier.

My problem is, I just don't know if I can believe that. And even if he follows through I don't know if I can get over being lied to. For years. 

I was so dumbfounded that I asked him to leave today (the conversation was last night) so I could collect my thoughts. He'll be back tomorrow night.

100% sure I want to call off the engagement. 80% sure I want to just bite the bullet and end the relationship. Fuck this. I absolutely love this man. Why did he have to do this.

TL;DR: He has a fetish about gaining weight that he kept secret since college. Has been putting himself at risk deliberately. I'm in shock and will be calling off the wedding. TBD whether I give him a chance to prove he can change and be trustworthy, but I don't feel like it's likely.

ANSWER: Damm, not only did he actively deceive you about this, he tried to trap you in a marriage so you'd have a harder time leaving when he decided to pursue it. That's pretty unforgivable. There are better people out there who won't play with you like this.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (27/F) cousin (27/F) confessed that she was in love with my husband (29/F). She’s currently living with us and I have no idea how to act.

opps I made a typo in the title sorry! I meant husband (29/M)\\

Literally what the title says.

My cousin has been living with us for the past four months along with her toddler so she can save up to get her own place. Yesterday, whilst my husband was out, she asked me if we could talk. I thought she was going to ask me if she could stay a little while longer (the original plan was for 6 months) but instead she gave me a long speech about how she was in love with my husband, how she tried to make the feelings go away but they keep getting stronger and how she thinks he might be her soulmate. She kept apologizing but said that when she sees him with her son, she knows her family is complete and he could offer her and her son the stability they need. I was honestly so shocked I just  said “Uh, I need time to process this”. I’ve been avoiding her since, my husband has been holed up in his office working so he hasn’t noticed anything weird yet. I think I’m still reeling from the shock.

I can’t even ask her to move out because her family disowned her when she had a baby out of wedlock. I haven’t told anyone in real life yet either because I know they’re all just going to tell me to kick her out but I can’t make my nephew homeless during a pandemic.

What do I do?

TL;DR – my cousin, who is staying with us for another two months, thinks my husband is her soulmate. I have no idea how to act around her now. Help.

Edit: I wrote it in the comments already but just to add she claims she's had these feelings for at least 4 years and they've just grown so strong recently that she couldn't keep it in anymore. Also, her son is 18 months!

UPDATE: I spoke to my husband. He was shocked and a little uncomfortable. He apologised and said he didn't mean to give her the wrong impression. Neither of us are quite sure what we're going to do yet since he also doesn't want to leave my nephew homeless. We're discussing it. I wasn't going to update until we'd solved the issue but literally every comment is telling me to tell him so just to let you guys know I have!!

ANSWER: She’s not in love with your husband, she’s just a single mom depending on family to get by just wants your life. Time to talk to your husband and move her out.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (20F) sister's (28F) behaviour towards my boyfriend (21M) is horrendous.

This is going to be long. I'm warning you. I'm angry. I'm frustrated and I'm shaking. I need to write it down and hear some advice.

My sis is just so creepy towards my bf. I can't take it anymore. She was really spoiled by my parents when she was young because she was their first child. She always WANTS everything and when we were little, she always used to steal my toys/books/clothes etc. I was never allowed to touch any of her things but she constantly stole my stuff and was always rude to me. My mom for some reason has always preferred her over me and thus, most of the time, I was told to let it go.

Due to this, I have lots of resentment towards her and I don't really like her. I'm honestly sick of her behaviour, and I just want some peace and quiet in my house. 

My mom called me two weeks ago, pleading to let my sis stay with me because she doesn't have a job right now and she can't stay alone during quarantine. Both my parents are high risk. My mom has heart problems and my dad is asthmatic. So I thought I should let her stay with me and my bf instead of letting her go to my parents in case she infects them. There's been a few cases where she is so I didn't want to risk it.

Now I'm honestly starting to regret it. Her behaviour is creepy and strange and downright disgusting. First of all, she doesn't respect me at all. She's constantly ignoring me while having long talks with my boyfriend. She doesn't leave my boyfriend alone!

She flirts with him and constantly tries to touch him by using cheap tricks. When we watch movies, she pushes me away and tries to snuggle with my boyfriend. She slaps his butt when he walks by and loudly tells him how he has a "perky little butt" She also runs her fingers through his hair everyday saying "Whoaaa your hair is so soft" or some shit like that. WHAT THE FUCK. 

These are all just excuses to touch him. She just needs a chance. Another thing she does is ask him if he has abs so she can touch his torso. Or say "did you see this thing I lost, maybe it's in your pocket let me see" and proceed to pat his thighs. 

One time she wanted help with hooking her bra and she just fucking walks out in her underwear. She came to our room and my boyfriend was in the bathroom. The logical thing to do is just fucking ask ME I'm her sister! But what does she do? She just waits for my boyfriend and asks him instead even though I'm sitting right there!

I think I looked VERY upset because my boyfriend just told her no and she went back to her room. She didn't try that again.

This is not even all. My boyfriend and I can't even talk to each other without her interrupting us. She barges into our room with no warning. A few days ago, we were trying to have sex and I don't know how the fuck she realized it and starting banging on the door claiming to have a headache. 

I opened the door and asked her what was wrong. I told her I had pills for it but she just said she doesn't trust me and she wanted to talk to my boyfriend instead. After disturbing us, she was suddenly completely fine and her headache disappeared miraculously. She just came into our bedroom and started talking to my boyfriend. We were literally half naked and there was no way she didn't know! 

This is driving me crazy. What does she want? Why is she like this? It's not like I didn't talk to her. I was so angry she interrupted us because she has been doing this since she came here. I was feeling horny and angry. I just told her to get out and that we needed some alone time. I don't want to go into details but we had a small argument and she started crying. 

The thing is she never accepts it! She's completely blind to what she's doing. She denies doing it and sheds tears which ends up making me feel bad instead.

My boyfriend is so uncomfortable by all of this. He just looks exhausted all the time. He's trying his best to be nice but she's all over him all the time. He's usually very introverted/shy/quiet. He's not very confrontational and I know this is bothering him. When I talked to him about it, he just commented that it was a bad idea to invite her to stay here. He also said not to invite her ever again.

I want to know why she is like this. How can I make her see what she's doing? I'm done dealing with her. I don't want to see her ever again, but she's my parents' favourite child and no matter how hard I try, I can never escape her. Whenever I try to cut contacts with her, my mom calls me and begs me to forgive her. My mom doesn't want to see her daughters fighting with each other and she always says how she wants us to be together forever.

But I can't do this. How am I supposed to deal with this? Can someone please tell me. My mom is always taking my sister's side in everything and it's always me who has to be "understanding" and "smart" and "older" when I'M THE YOUNGER ONE HERE!

Please tell me I'm not overreacting. How do I make my mom and sister realize that I'm sick of dealing with this? 

TL;DR : my sis tries to flirt with bf and keeps touching him all over the place. she doesn't accept that what she's doing is wrong and i'm sick of her behaviour. how do I deal with this?

ANSWER: She is 28 and has no place to go, and is acting this bad with you?  Absolutely kick her out.  I wouldn’t give her any more ‘chances’.  Take care of yourself and your boyfriend.  Good on you for being independent of your unsupportive parents.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (26F) fiancé (27M) left me for his “one that got away” four years ago. They’ve divorced and he wants to get back together.

My fiancé broke our engagement off when his high school girlfriend moved to our city. They quickly got engaged, married and had a baby before it had even been a year. I was so blindsided and hurt, I don’t think I ever really got over my ex which is why I’m making this post to get some outside insight. 

My ex reached out a few days ago to “catch up”. He claimed he regretted breaking up with me two months after he did but because his ex-wife was pregnant at the time, he felt he owed it to his son to try and make it work. He said their relationship quickly fell apart when he realized his ex wasn’t looking for a life partner but someone to financially support her. He said the financial issues is what finally led to their divorce. They’ve been divorced for 6 months and have two children together. According to him, his ex regularly tries to get back together with him, but he doesn’t want her.

He ended up asking me if I was willing to give him a second chance. 

In some ways, my ex has become my “one who got away” and I probably would’ve jumped at the chance to get back with him a few months ago. However, I’ve recently been talking to this guy and whilst we aren’t official or anything, we did go on a date two weeks ago which went really well. I feel like it could progress into something good and I don’t know if my ex is worth losing it over. 

I’d appreciate any advice on what to do in this situation. 

TL;DR – My ex left me for his “one that got away”. Four years and two kids later, they’re now divorced. My ex claims he regretted leaving me two months after he did but felt like he had to stay for the sake of his unborn child. He now wants a second chance, but I’ve met someone knew who seems like a great person. I don’t know what to do.

ANSWER: He's the same guy who dumped you cold after asking you to marry him, except with more baggage and some other woman's baby.  HARD PASS.

QUESTION: UPDATE- My girlfriend (24 f) doesn't believe that I (22m) was taken advantage of.

OP- https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i236km/my_girlfriend_24_f_doesnt_believe_that_i_22m_was/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share


Thank you guys for the responses. 

I tried talking to her again and she apologized but I could tell that she wasn't really sorry. She only did it because she "had to" if that makes sense. I asked her how she would respond if we had a son and god forbid something happened to him. She didn't even respond. It reminded me of the way my parents responded when I told them. Crickets. I was 13 when I told them. In fact they still keep contact with the woman, a family friend who was like an aunt to me. 

I broke up with her and explained to her why. She was pissed. Called me every name in the book and said that it's fine because she didn't even like me that much anyway. I don't know how much of that is true or if she's saying it out of anger but I don't care. Any doubt I felt about breaking up vanished with her response. I was fully willing to work on our relationship and give it another shot but I guess I cared more about her than she did about me. 

I'm gonna stay with my sister for now. I think I need to be single. For some reason I've always been quick to jump into relationships and they all fail. My now ex gf and I had some other issues that we've tried working through but I can't work through this. I'm just gonna focus on myself moving forward. I've heard everything she's said before from both men and women but having it directed at me from someone I care about really hurt. It's not something I could let go.I've dealt with a lot of confusion and guilt surrounding what happened that made me question myself. I didn't like what was happening to me but my body would react. This really messed me up.

I'm gonna work through my issues before I even think of another relationship.

ANSWER: Or I would show up to every single family event shes at and refer to her only as "pedophile".

"Hi Pedophile".  "Oh mom, you went to get your nails done with the pedophile?" "Will the pedophile be joining us for dinner?"

Eventually either she'll break and stop coming or his parents will and ban OP from attending.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (28M) with fiance (27F) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous Ex was the best lover she ever had

It was quite by accident that I heard this.  We had a group of our friends over and as the night went on we all kind of busted out into little groups.  Some of us were in one room playing Texas Holdem and a couple of others were watching a Lord of the Ring marathon.  I thought she was watching the movies but she and one of her close friends were actually sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and talking.  Our group had run out of soda so I got up to go to the kitchen to get drinks and  a couple of snacks.  As I'm rounding the corner I hear my fiance talking and before I completely come in the room I hear her clearly say "Jason is great but he will never be the lover that Bill was" she then followed it up with "Its not really fair to Jason though, Bill was just really gifted down there".

At first I thought about just walking back into the card game and pretending like we didn't have any extra soda or food but I decided to kind of make a noise and go in.  Her friend caught eye of me rounding the corner and I could see her make a face to my fiance letting her know I was there.  Of course she has no idea I heard her and she just stops talking to her and asks me how I'm doing and if I'm having fun.  I was tempted to say something like "I'm having as much fun as someone who is not gifted down there can" but I didn't.  I just said yes and proceeded to get my stuff and go back and finish the night.  I just acted like nothing was wrong the rest of the night and went to bed.

Needless to say it fucked me up.  I mean fucked me up bad.  I've never been jealous or what you would call insecure about myself until that moment.  I couldn't sleep that night and I went through a myriad of emotions while laying there.  At first I was angry.  Then I was humiliated.  Then I was depressed.  Then I was angry again.

Look I realize that the male ego seems stupid to women and even guys who are totally self assured.  I would have agreed with most of this prior to that night but once it has been damaged it is a bitch.

I tried to hide any form of emotion about it or ever let her know but as the days went on I just kept getting worse and worse.  I was avoiding her at all costs and while she was suspicious she didn't really say anything.  That is until she attempted to be intimate with me a few days later and I flat out rejected her.  It wasn't by a conscious decision on my part  by the way.  I had made the decision on my own to just try and get over it and move on.  But in the moment instead of being sexually aroused I felt deeply inadequate and ashamed.  Nothing was happening no matter how much either of us tried.

She asked me what was wrong and I just told her I must have been stressed from work but she would not believe that or let it go.

So much to my humiliation there I laid, naked in bed, unable to get an erection.  I came clean and told her what I heard.

Well this did not go over well at all.  At first she tried to tell me I did not hear her correctly.  But I just repeated to her verbatim what she had told her friend.  Well once she couldn't deny it she then tried to apologize and to her credit she tried to listen to my feelings on the matter.  Which once again I am sure was more of a big turn off for her because I was a wreck emotionally.

She tried to tell me how much of a better person I was and how I satisfied her and she wanted nobody else.  But all I could hear was Charlie Browns teacher noise.

It's been almost a month and I have zero desire to be with her sexually.  None.  She is now getting frustrated about this as well but no matter what I have tried I just can not get past this.  It's not like she said we were both good lovers or anything like that.  She clearly said he was far superior and my guess is that being gifted down there means he was significantly larger than me as well.  Well I know I can do all kinds of things with my hands, tongue and whatever else.  But no matter what I do I can't grow in size.  Obviously she refuses to talk about that with me saying that no matter what she say's it will only make things worse because even if she say's something positive about me I won't believe her.  She's most likely right.

Some back story here.  He dumped her.  It was not a mutual breakup, he flat out dumped her and broke her heart.  I know this because early on in our relationship she told me this.  She said she wasn't ready to be serious about anybody because her previous ex left her and emotionally broke her.  So this is not a case of me even being able to say "well she's with me because she wants to be".  If he hadn't dumped her she would never have left him.  Now I have no idea if after all of these years she would leave me for him if he would come back but I don't think she would.

I just don't know what to do here.  I can feel myself checking out of the relationship.  I know this is petty as shit but hearing the person you love tell someone else they prefer to have sex with someone else is just devastating to me.  Her telling me all of my other good qualities has only made it worse because she is saying things that I think appeal to her and maybe other women but being told I am a good provider and will make a great husband makes me feel like shit.  Like what would happen if I lost my good paying job or better yet what if I were to get injured and couldn't make anything more than state assistance, would she be there to support and help me?  Basically what I feel like right now is a really good friend who she just allowed to have sex with.  I know in my head that this is not correct but in my heart that is what I feel.

I'm sorry for the length here and I don't even know what I am asking here.  I am totally lost and if this continues I just think I am going to break our engagement.

tl;dr:  heard fiance tell her friend that previous ex was superior in the sack (presumable due to size among other things), relationship has gone to hell since and I need advice.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  Holy God.  I made this post last night and answered a couple of questions and then went to bed and got up today and went Christmas shopping hoping to make me forget my troubles and didn't even log in until just now.  I have not even started to read the (at this point) 7.7 thousand comments on this post.  I don't know what anyone has said yet but thank you all for commenting either way.  I am now going to begin the massive undertaking of looking at the comments.  Also thank you for the Gold and Silver kind internet strangers.

EDIT 2:  Dear God.  I read all the way down to the bottom of the page thinking I had gotten through most of everything and then at the bottom it said load the 5.5K more posts.  I'm stopping for the night (well morning actually).   I was going to respond to people individually but there is just no way.  I haven't even started reading the direct messages to me yet nor have I opened any of the 20 chat screens.  There are issues I want out there because there are a couple of things that are being said that are not accurate.

1.  She was to use the Barney Gumble phrase using "sweet sweet drunk talk".  In other words her and her friend were drunk while talking.  Nope, neither of us drink.  We don't even have it in the house.
2. That I am upset she told her friend.  Well this is an odd thing, before I posted this honestly I wasn't that upset about this part.  I was then and am still far more upset that this is how she feels.  However now reading a lot of the post I have become somewhat aggravated that she did share this with her friend.  I would never say anything about her to anyone that would put her in a lesser light.
3. That I am an insecure man child who should just man up and learn to do better.  Well I'm certain the first part is true, being insecure and all.  But the last part is just out of my control.  No matter what I do I will only ever be 7" long.  We have talked about this btw, when she was trying to build me up.  She said that I was already great with everything but the one thing I can't control. (Okay, so I gave myself about a half inch to feel better)
4. No I'm not going to do anything rash.  It's already been a month so its not like this happened last week.  But yes I have to decide what I am going to do here before long.  It's not fair to either of us is I am just coasting through this and no longer committed.
5. She is sorry that I heard it.  She said she is sorry she said it but at the end of the day she would not be sorry if I didn't catch her saying it.  It is what it is.  But yes I do believe she is regretting it because she has basically been a mess since I first told her.  Me not wanting to be with her is bothering her a lot according to her.  I don't know how much of that I believe but right now I guess I don't know why she would lie.  It really has wrecked hell on our Christmas spirit this year I know that. 

EDIT 3:  Engineer for those who keep asking what I do for a living.  She is a paralegal.  
EDIT 4:  People have been asking about the relationship with the ex and how I know she was heartbroken.  We met about 9 months after they separated.  I know that ultimately he wanted to be with someone else, although she has claimed he never cheated.  He just ended things so he could be with another woman.  She approached me at a local workshop and we started dating .  On our 4th date when things started to get physical she broke down crying about the ex.  It was certainly weird to hold someone while they cried about someone else but I did it.  We sporadically dated for a couple more months in which time I never tried to cross any boundaries physically because it was obvious she wasn't over him so while we just went out of dates I tried to keep myself of the mind that we were just friends because I didn't want to commit either.  After close to two months she drags me from my car to her apartment and begins to tell me how much she has appreciated my patience with her and how she felt stupid about dragging me along for so long.  Obviously that was our first night together.  Within 3 months of that she is telling me that she loves me.  So yes, she was still hung up on her ex for fact when we got together.  I had thought/hoped she was over him before this happened.

EDIT 5:  Okay I posted it below in the mass of other posts but I have also started a new post and hopefully the mods let it stay open.  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a55jy1/posting_general_response_here_i_28m_with_fiance/?

ANSWER: As a man married once to the same woman for 20 years, what your gf said is disrespectful as fuck. Our marriage survives on only a handful of steadfast rules. One big one is, "To the outside world, be each other's biggest defender." I.E. If you have criticisms of your SO, save them for private times and share them only with each other or the occasional VERY close friend/family member. And they need to be constructive. All other time, defend your SO's honor, pride, and well-being to EVERYONE...right or wrong. 

Your GF straight-up broke that rule. BIG TIME! Not only did she not defend you, she was the one putting you on the chopping block. Then she tried to play it off and keep it secret from you, like a goddam gossiping teenager shit-talking about you behind your back. Triple whammie.

Now you are stuck unable to un-hear what she said. Will you ever be able to trust her again? I doubt it. In the end, my advice is: ask yourself if there is anything she could humanly say and/or do to repair that violation of trust. If the answer's 'no' or even 'probably not,' move on.

Edit: After the fact, I realize this is a fiance. "Move on" is not a simple option. To that I say, "tell her how that comment made you feel." Hopefully, she'll recognize the gravity of her comment and see how demoralizing it was and try to make amends, if possible.

Edit: grammar

QUESTION: UPDATE: Just found out my (23M) best friend (23M) has been secretly dating my ex (24F) for months

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i32pxe/just_found_out_my_23m_best_friend_23m_has_been/)

I kind of debated if I’d post an update on this or not. It’s been a few weeks and some stuff has happened, but as the post blew up I got a good number of really shitty comments that informed me I was a worthless piece of shit, that I should beat up my ex girlfriend, or alternately that I was probably already some kind of horrible abuser who hated her and wanted to control her body.

I also got a ton of love, support, PMs offering connections on housing, and more, but being I was already in a dark and desperate place, those other comments really twisted the knife. I had to spend some time away not just fixing my shit but also avoiding that stuff, because it was really not making me want to move forward. For anyone who’s reading this while in the middle of a situation, wondering if you should post your story, my advice is: don’t. Wait till you have some distance, or it’s just going to make things worse.

One thing I want to clarify here, since a few people swung for the fences based on what I posted: I don’t hate Cassie. I don’t think she shouldn’t move on. I don’t blame her for dating someone else after I broke up with her. I do have a lot of anger still thinking about this. All that anger is at Ryan. That’s it. Ryan is the one who lied to me and went behind my back, not Cassie. My post pretty clearly stated that I think Cassie is an awesome human being. Still think so. Period. We just wanted different things. 

So, actual updates.

Shortly after I posted, Ryan texted me to say that he’d planned to give me a month to find somewhere else to live, but since I “couldn’t be happy for them” he wanted me out by Friday. Looking back on it, I kinda think this was his plan all along. Cassie’s parents own the apartment I lived in with her, so we paid bills on it but no rent. Ryan’s apartment was expensive and his parents still paid some of his bills there, so I suspect he was looking for an excuse to break his lease and get in on that free rent instead.

But I have a place to live now. Reddit helped me out after all, in a weird way. A couple days after I posted, this guy TJ hit me up on FB (hey TJ) with the link to my post asking if it was me. TJ and I weren’t close friends before all this, but he recognized some of the details. 

Skipping some back and forth, it turns out Ryan lied to all our mutual friends about the situation. Apparently he hooked up with Cassie the first time about a week after we split up. He asked some of our friends what to do and they all told him to make sure I was cool first thing. He then told them he had talked to me and that I was happy for him. So, when I started freaking out a couple months later, my friends all thought I was “going crazy out of nowhere” over something I’d known about for months.

Once they found out what really happened, I got a lot of apology texts. Some of them I’ve accepted. Some are still on read. A couple of guys offered me crash space or help moving, and I wound up staying with TJ, but only till I could find somewhere else.

My days of living in places without my name on a lease are over. Learned my lesson there. I found a roommate looking for a place through Craigslist and we signed the lease last week. Moving from TJ’s happens this weekend.

Ryan is blocked out of my life. I probably forgot some of my stuff at either his place or Cassie’s, but it’s whatever. I can get new stuff. I can get new friends. More than anything else this situation made me realize the importance of having stable, independent housing and not counting on anyone else to do the right thing by me. I have to have my own back in life, not rely on others.

That’s about all I’ve got. It’s nothing dramatic, I guess. No one was hit by a car, got pregnant, or turned out to be cheating. But I’ve never been so glad to have a roof over my head and a bed to come back to. I’m going to keep going from here, keep working on life, and I’m sure as hell going to be taking a break on the dating front. That’s all there is to do.

ANSWER: Props to TJ for being a such a bro. Also, good luck with your future endeavours and I hope you make some amazing friends in the future.

QUESTION: My bf says I need to lose weight even though I already lost 30lbs

I(22f) live with my bf(26) who calls me fat even though I weighed 130lbs before I started dieting and exercising.

Even at 100lbs he still insists that I’m not losing enough and that he isn’t as attracted to me as he used to be. I’m trying my best to lose weight but I think losing any more is a bad idea as I’m very skinny now. It’s upsetting when he claims that I’m overweight all of the time even though I completely cut out junk food from my diet and jog for at least an hour a day.

I don’t think losing anymore is safe for me, how should I expect this to my bf

Edit:I’m 5ft

Edit2:I asked out of curiosity how much he wanted me to weigh and he to,d me around 70-80lbs

ANSWER: I try not to say this often but you should probably get out of that relationship. That's incredibly toxic and manipulative. It's also physically dangerous for you. You need someone to build you up and love you not someone who will make you feel unattractive if you're not a skeleton. Fuck him.

QUESTION: [UPDATE] I (30F) found out my husband (32M) hired my friend (26F) to strip at his bachelor party


TL;DR last post I found out my husband had actually hired strippers for his bachelor party, not only that but he had gone out of his way to hire Rebecca (a close friend) and they hid this for four years.

Is it too soon to update?

I confronted them both, separately, they both gave two very different stories 

Rebecca says that my husband got drunk, groped her and when she refused he pushed her and started to yell at her, apparently my husband and his friends believe I shouldn’t be friends with her because she “lead them on”

My husband says that they didn’t sleep together but Rebecca tried to initiate and performed oral while he was black out drunk.

I’m staying with my parents because I don’t know who to believe here or if I should I should even believe either of them, all I’ve done is argue with my husband since the confession.

I’m left more confused than ever and honestly, I just want to say f the both of them, but if my husbands story is true then he’s totally innocent, but what if Rebecca is telling the truth? What if neither of them are.

I’m sick of them both, I haven’t stopped crying since arriving at my mothers to be honest and I don’t think I can.

Why would he hide this for 4 years? Why would she?! If they both believe they’re fully innocent/victims here? 

My husband is a mean drunk, but he’s always so soft spoken and I don’t know if he can do those things Rebecca claimed, but I  don’t know how he reacts around his friends, but I’ve known him longer than Rebecca too? But I’m all for believing women, I feel like by agreeing with my husband I’m denying Rebeccas story/side.

ANSWER: > but if my husbands story is true then he’s totally innocent

I’d think hiring a stripper you know personally for your bachelor party makes him far from innocent no matter what events transpired.

Plus who hires their own strippers? Thats the best mans job.

QUESTION: UPDATE I’ve been putting off introducing my [28M] girlfriend [26F] to my parents [60sM/F] because they’ll be weird about her weight

[OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dh673p/my_28m_parents_60s_mf_are_about_to_meet_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

Thank you to the many commenters who offered good advice. Including to call in advance and  let my parents know how it was going to go down if they wanted a role in this new part of my life. 

Went like this. Paraphrasing of course. 


Me: Hey Mom and Dad, You know I mentioned a girlfriend a few times. We’re moving in together so I’m thinking I’ll bring her out. 


Mom: Oh that’s nice. First week of December maybe? 


Me: Sure. Look there’s one thing though. She’s not thin. If you make a comment or so much as look at her weird, we’re done, we’re going home. I love her. And she would never intentionally make you uncomfortable, so I expect you to show her the same respect. 


Mom: But you have so many prospects and a good job why would you—


Me: No. This is exactly what I’m talking about. 


Mom: Fine. I’m just happy I finally get to meet her. 


Dad: Insulting weight related comment


Me: What the fuck dad? 


Mom: Oh babe give it a rest, it can’t be that bad. 


Me: No if there’s any chance of that sort of commentary, I’ll just not come. I have zero tolerance for this. You’re going to treat her with the respect she deserves or you won’t get the chance to screw it up. 


Dad: Insulting joke 



Me: Ok, bye. If you wonder why [brother] is buying a tux for a wedding you’ve heard nothing about in a year, maybe two, think back to this conversation. 



Mom: No, wait, I’ll make sure his act is together by the time you’re out here. 


Dad: Insulting comment 



Me: I’m hanging up. 


So it looks like I’m going to fly my mom out here, not sure when. Probably not soon. My girlfriend saw how much stress this was causing me and I started a more in-depth conversation about it and she basically said “It would be nice if I could meet your parents and we could get along but it sounds like that won’t be possible and it definitely isn’t worth putting you through this.”

So thanks for the comments and help. For now it’s a non issue it turns out. 


tl;dr: My dad couldn’t even hold it together through a phone call so my mom will meet my girlfriend some other time, my dad is affectively disinvited in the event we get married, and we’re just going to let this go for now.

ANSWER: Thanks a lot. I’m just as, and in many ways even more, lucky. If I’ve got to make some sucky sacrifices to keep that going, so be it. Everything in life is a trade off I guess. Appreciate the kind words.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My wife cheating on our 10 year anniversary

Tl;Dr yesterday was our 10 year anniversary. Brought flowers to wifes office. Found some guy nuzzling her neck and her giggling.

Yup. Tl;Dr  says it all. My (35m) wife (35f) and I were married ten years ago yesterday. She has been working on a big project for the last few months. The last 4 weeks or so she has been putting in extra time, staying late going in early, to finish up by deadline. This is a career maker for her.

 I work construction. With the rain we have had we have crazy hours trying to make up time that we missed. So I work 12 hrs on the days its nice, sometimes a little longer. If its raining when I get up I dont go in. Somedays we get sent home when it starts, too dangerous. I usually hit the gym for an hour or two. Thursday we started at 6am ,midmorning starts to rain hard. We go home. I go to the gym as usual. I cut the workout short and head downtown to see wife Mehgan, to give her flowers and make plans for dinner that night if possible. We really havent seen much of each other this week. I went to bed about 9pm she wasnt home, called earlier me she is working late. Not unusual for past month. 

I stopped and got some flowers and went into her building about 12:30. Nichole was at the receptionist desk. I told her I got here later than I wanted could she put the flowers on Mehgans desk. She said "I dont think they went to lunch yet why not drop them off yourself?" She buzzed the door to get back to the offices. The place was deserted. I went to her office, the door was closed . I always walk in unless the receptionist tells me she is in a meeting. I walk in some guy is standing behind her nuzzling her neck, she is reaching back over his head. She is giggling only as she can. Saying"we got to get this done".  I am gut punched. I slammed the flowers down said "Happy Anniversary" and walked out. I didnt hear what she said just went past Nichole said goodbye and left. Made it to elevators and out the building then my phone started ringing.

I balled my eyes out all the way home. Went into garage pulled my camping gear out of the rafters and took off. I drove about 2 hours to a State Park. I had no idea what to do . I just had to run. I hiked a trail we  have been on in the past about a 3 hour hike. I dont drink much so I had no booze, I just sat there thinking. Looking back I am glad I was in a rush, normally I bring a 45cal. With me camping, we have black bears, which generally scare off, but get aggressive if hungary or cubs around. The way I was feeling I might have ate the barrel that night. My phone was blowing up fom Mehgan so I had turned it off. I left the park to get reception turned it on to see my good friend called. I called him back. He said Meghan called him to check on me, make sure I didnt do anything stupid. We talked a bit, told him I got to think this thru, would catch up on Friday.

So while I am thinking about this, I go over our marriage from the beginning to see what I missed. We come from completely opposite backgrounds. My Grandfather raised me with my mom. He taught me about life. He had a little saying about everyhing. He told me marriage would be the hardest job ZI ever had, you had to work on it everyday. God I miss him. We did not have much,heard mom and grandpa having many discussions about bills. They worked hard and my brother and I did not miss out on anything we knew of.

Mehgan was born into money. Not overly rich but very comfortable. Went to a great college, always great clothes, new car etc. And she is beautiful 11/10 beautiful. I would joke with her if she coughed about the silver spoon getting stuck in her throat.  We met hit off started dating. I was dumbfounded how such a woman would ever be with me. We dated quite awhile before she told me about her parents and life style. Our friends called us the model couple, because they thought we were so good looking we had to be models. Families were not as kind, afraid of the differences economically would come into play. Her dad and I started to get along but her my mom took some convincing. 

She graduates gets her first job, we plan on getting married. We work out between us that we would expose each other to our lives that we live. I took her white water rafting, she took me to the symphony, we went ziplining, we went to an art opening etc. We agreed we had to experience the others interests. She was really enthused about the more physical things we did. I kinda like the symphony and such. I own two tuxes now.

I look back and do not see any red flags. Her first two jobs she quit because the men all tried to get in her pants. She was paraded out in front for photo ops. Invited to conferences when other newbies were not. At dinner at a conference a partner tried to get her drunk, then tried to force himself into her room that night. She quit, the next job the same thing, quit again . This 3rd job has women as some of the partners and none of that bs is in her workplace. She seems very happy. We seemed very happy. 

So now, Friday, I am home. I called her. Asked where she was, back at work. I being in a smartass mood said that the marriage is taking second place to her job. She responded since I would not talk what was she to do? Fair enough. She will be home in an hour. So I wait. I want to save our marriage. If I am lacking in providing then I want to fix it. I want to ask why of course but I can not accept  a IDK answer. How do I phrase this? What else should I be asking? I know I will get all emotional and forget everything so over the next few days we will be going over and over this.  What she did is wrong but please no degrading comments, she is still my wife. Thank you in advance.

ANSWER: Holy crap. I can not imagine walking in on something like that while your mood is sky high because of the anniversary. My friend you are on the right path. Do not accept "I dont know." You are not at fault. Ask what SHE is going to do to fix this. If she wants to fix it. I feel for you. Please update.

QUESTION: Engagement ring/breakup fund

[update] Thank you all!! I appreciate the traction this silly post gained. Your responses have more that assured me that I’ve got something here. I got back from my parent’s 25th anniversary party my sisters and I put on today and the post blew up. I hope to some day be half as close with someone as my parents! 

I did my best to get through all the comments and reply/upvote where appropriate. Have an amazing day everyone!


Whenever I start a new relationship I start putting away 50 dollars a month in a savings account. I’m a big romantic so I intend on using this money, in the event this girl is “the one”, towards an engagement ring far down the road. Subsequently, if the relationship turns goes bad and ends in a breakup, I cash out the savings and splurge on myself as part of my healing and moving on phase. Is this idea brilliant or am I putting too much attention on these extremes?

ANSWER: Stealing this. If my boyfriend proposes, I’ll pay for the honeymoon. If not, looks like I got my wanderlust heartbreak recovery funds.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [M 32] ruined Christmas and I have no regrets.

Is anyone else’s family this dysfunctional? Every year there is an argument in my family and after 32 years I was the one who blew up for the first time. 

Long story short, i’m half-Korean/half-white. My mom is Korean. My dad side is white. So we only have my Dad’s side here in the US. For years, I watched my some of my dad’s side speak down to my mom. They never invite her to things. Me and my brother have always been treated like outsiders by some family members. To be frank, I don’t care how i’m treated. Every year, we always bite our tongues and survive the holidays because it’s only 2-3 times a year. We repeat the process and don’t expect much from these family members. My mom even buys gifts every year for these family members, she gets nothing in return and never complains. My white Grandma is 80 and she’s the only thing anchoring us to some of these family members.

Three times today I watched a family member (Aunt) raise her voice to my mom, speak to her as if she doesn’t speak english and shut her down over simple questions like “where should I sit?”. I watched my mom quietly recoil and I couldn’t stand to see it again. This aunt does it the most and I finally blew up. I yelled so loud everyone stopped what they were doing. I told them enough is enough, to start treating my mom with respect and as an equal in this house. To stop speaking to my mom (who’s lived in the US for 35 years) like she doesn’t speak english and stop shutting her down over simple questions. I watched it happen year after year and will not allow it to happen anymore.  

My Aunt stomped away and was so upset she left. As she was leaving I walked up to my aunt to hand her my mom’s yearly gift to her. I said  “for 30 years I watched my mom give you a gift every year. I watched her speak to you as an equal with respect. I’ve never seen you treat her with the same”.  She didn’t say anything but before she left, she apologized to my mom. 

Before I left, I apologized to everyone and explained why I was upset. Everyone was shocked how mad I got. I felt like everyone understood why I was mad.  Prior to this (around thanksgiving) I spoke to some family members about how I was hurt they never included my mom on family things or even texts about family emergencies. Which they have been trying to do more. 

After blowing up, it made things awkward. People trickled out early too. Now my grandma is talking about not doing Christmas anymore due to the constant family drama. I feel bad, but i’ve never felt so proud to stand up for my mom. Does anyone have any advice on this? Handling rude family?  Should I do something else? 


[Edit 12/26/2018: typos, wordiness and update below]

Mom’s reaction: On the car ride home my mom expressed some words about my aunt which she never does about anyone. She’s always taken the high road it’s a very Korean Christian mom approach. My mom’s method of being a pacifist is very much an older Immigrant/Korean/boomer approach too. It’s taught me a valuable skill in life. I don’t regret picking my battles and that’s why i’m so appreciative of being Korean/white. After we left, she gave me a very long mom hug. She didn’t say anything and asked me if I wanted my favorite Korean dish. 

Where is my dad: He was in the other room. Yes, my dad could have done more over the last 35 years. He’s gotten in arguments with everyone my whole life including this aunt. We’d be fighting every year with someone new if we didn’t pick our battles. We would have stopped going years ago but mom wants to go out of respect for my grandma. My dad is the only one who isn’t petty about dumb shit. Defending my mom is everyone’s responsibility not just my dad. Including my grandma, aunts, other family and me. As soon as I got loud my dad came into the room and stood guard (I can’t describe it). There wasn’t much for him to say or do because he didn’t hear it. I was quick to unload and my aunt immediately walked away because she was embarrassed. My white side has a “keep grandma” happy approach which is dumb. For years my dad would be on the verge of saying things and my mom would demand that he didn’t. 

Me: Reflecting on this as a whole. I can’t believe the response. It shows you everyone has screwed up family in some way. After Thanksgiving I started to speak to family one on one which has had good response. I have no relationship with this aunt. I should have pulled her aside even as the nephew who’s 30 years younger. A small part of me regrets it and will be glad to sit down with her still. If she’s not willing to try or work it out (like the other people responded), “Fck her”.  Please don’t use my experience as a reason to blow up on anyone. I should have tried to speak and I did what I felt was right, I don’t regret it.. Grandma’s 80th Bday is in two months.  I can’t wait for that to be awkward. Someone made the comment that people cant be educated until you give them a chance to be aware of their actions, which is fair. Regardless people will now think twice to be rude to my mom. Cheers and have a Happy New Years!

TLDR: After 32 years I finally blew up on a rude family member who disrespects my Korean mom and feeling liberated for standing up for something I’ve been feeling for years. How do people handle their dysfunctional family when your last grandparent is alive. Should I do something for blowing up?

ANSWER: Haha thanks! I called my brother who’s 13 hours ahead in Korea and he laughed at me said “i’m proud of you” and said “someone had to do it”  too

QUESTION: I found out that my bf posted a video online of him fingering me while I’m asleep

I(21f) and my bf(26m) live together and I bought him a video camera for his birthday since he wanted to start a YouTube channel.

I take sleeping meds to fall asleep so I’m kind of hard to wake up. Last night I woke up to find my bf with his fingers inside me while holding the camera. I ask him why he’s doing this and he tells me not worry about it. The meds were still in effect so I wasn’t really aware how wrong this was at the time.

This morning I noticed that he left the computer on and I realized that one of the windows was for a porn site. I remember what happened last night and get worried that he posted the video. Sure enough he did and several people have already seen it.

I’m so humiliated right now I don’t know what to do

Edit:quit asking me to link the video

================================================================================

QUESTION: Update: My (f22) best friend (f21) is moving in with me, but has now gotten pregnant and wants us to raise the baby together

Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hptbzd/one_of_my_f22_best_friends_f21_is_supposed_to/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

So this was not a big post at all, but one or two people asked for an update if there were any and so here I am again. 

For a quick recap: I am possibly going to rent the entire 4 bedroom apartment I currently sublet a room in sometime around September/October and two of my best friends are moving in. My friend Layla has gotten pregnant and were planning to move in with me and have the three of us taking care of the baby, as physically and financially. 

I took the advice someone gave to talk to my other future roommate Indy about it, and we both agreed that it was not something we wanted to do at all, and we decided to confront her about it together so she could understand it wasn't going to happen.

We got together at my place on Tuesday and had some tea. We just sat down and said that basically we were very worried about her and the scenario that she had in her head about us raising the baby together is just completely irresponsible and we don't want that at all. We decided to not lay out the whole thing about her mental health, job situation and all that because we didn't want it to feel like an attack on her but more just us setting some boundaries. 
She got really emotional and told us that she knew it was ridiculous but she was scared and in shock and really didn't know how to react or think straight. Apparently it wasn't even her idea to begin with but some of her other friends we don't know very well who came up with it and sorta pressured her to feel a certain way because they were extremely excited for her. 
She just said that she has been crying every day since she found out and she's so scared for the future and really just want everything to go back to normal. At that point we just said that we totally understand and we of course will be there for her no matter what she decides to do, but we really also felt that it would be a lot for her to be a mom under these circumstances. 

So yeah. She decided getting an abortion would be the best thing for her. She said her initial reaction was to terminate the pregnancy but she had a lot if guilt associated with that as she has been brought up in a very conservative family
I'd rather not hear anything about the morals of that decision, as I don't think that would really be helpful to the conversation. We told her that we would be with her every step of the way if she needed it, and so we both went with her to the doctors on Thursday to confirm she was pregnant and to find out the options. Since she is only 6 weeks pregnant she could get some pills to take over a 48 hour period and that would make the embryo detach. She got the first one at the hospital on Friday where we were there with her too, and then they both stayed over at my place the whole weekend for the rest of it since her parents still doesn't know and she didn't want to tell them. 
My roommate is conveniently on holiday with some of her friends for the rest of the week so we had the whole place to ourselves and nothing to explain to anyone. 
She took the other pill yesterday and everything seems to be going smoothly, she just has a heavy period basically, which coincidentally ligned up with both Indys and mine (TMI sorry) so we have all been laying in my bed with heating pads and Netflix being a little miserable together, but things are going well and the pain have not been too much for just regular painkillers. 
There has been some crying, lots of hugs and long talks and walks in the forrest and I feel like things are going to be okay. They're both staying here until my roommate gets back so she can get through this in a comfy environment without having to pretend nothing is wrong. 

So yeah, it seems like the plan of moving in together is back on as originally planned, and everything will be okay. Layla was offered some counseling at the hospital about getting through an abortion and the feelings about it which she is starting some time next week.

Thank you so so much for the people who gave me advice when I needed it. This outcome is better than I could have imagined and I wouldn't have thought of doing it this way if it wasn't for you guys so thank you ❤❤


Edit: 

This got a lot more attention than I thought it would, given that my original post had 7 upvotes and 9 comments, so a bit of an overwhelming read this morning, but thank you to everyone for commenting, I've read them all and I'm very moved by the overwhelming positivity! It feels really nice to know that you guys think we made the right call in going about it this way, and it means a lot to me that you think we are good friends ❤

I figured I'd just respond to some of the main comments/questions that I've received a lot so its all just here at the top.

So first off about getting an STI test; she already had that as part of the initial examination and she was all clear thank God!

Second about getting birth control, then she was apparently using condoms, which I didn't know when I made the original post, so correction there. Birth control pills are not an option as they don't react well with the particular type of medication she is already on. 

About her other friends, the ones who came up with the idea of us raising the baby together; a lot of people commented on how shitty friends they are, and I agree which is why they aren't my friends. Layla still likes them but she wants some distance. They have all grown up in the same church environment so I think she excuses their behavior because of that. They don't see abortion as an option so I think they were just trying to comfort her and look for a solution, though out of touch with reality. A lot of people suggested to tell them she had a miscarriage but we decided that telling them it was just a false pregnancy would be better because knowing them I would be worried that they might throw a memorial party or something of the sort for her and I just don't think that would be helpful at all. We've written a draft for the group text she has with them but I think she will wait a bit to send it out. Indy and I are just staying silent on the matter, I don't feel like it is my story to tell or not tell and I wouldn't be comfortable lying about it, so as far as we are concerned, she just had a false positive pregnancy test and that's all we know.

Someone brought up about health insurance and if it would be possible that her parents could find out that way, but we live in a country with a free health care system so that was thankfully not a concern. 

And lastly; some people brought up that she shouldn't move in because she sounds unreliable and irresponsible. I will definitely agree that she was out of touch with reality for a while there but seeing how difficult of a time this has been for her I really don't blame her at all. I would probably have done something equally crazy if I was in that position. I have probably also made her sound a bit worse than she is because I was pretty annoyed with her when I wrote the first post. She is normally a very responsible and reliable and I trust her completely with moving in as I wouldn't have asked her in the first place if I didn't think she could find a job and pay rent, just I did not think she would be able to do that with a child too. 

On just a final note; I didn't really want to have the morals of the decision to terminate the pregnancy discussed but I guess that's inevitable. I'm surprised by the number of people being supportive and finding comfort in the way we went about it and talking about their own experiences. That makes me happy to see. 
To the people who disagree then I'm not going to have that discussion. It's not my choice to make or to decide between right and wrong and if you want to judge me or my friends for making the choices we thought to be right then you can just go ahead and do that.

To everyone wishing us the best I wish you the best right back and I'll make sure to give her hugs from all of you ❤

ANSWER: That's absolutely beautiful. This is the type of friendship you will look back decades from now and smile together.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (47M) son's (24M) wife (23F) says he raped her. He has a different story.

The two of them have been together for 4 years and have been married for 1 with three kids (3F & 3F & 3M). 

In the very early hours of this morning, I hear someone calling me name from the gate. Get up, look outside and see my daughter in law standing outside with a bag and a pram holding my grandchildren. I obviously let her in and ask what's wrong. She didn't want to talk so I gave her space and took the kids to sleep in my room. I woke up at around 6 and she was still up. She couldn't get a hold of her parents so she finally decided to tell me what was going on. She says she was feeling sick and didn't want to have sex with my son but he pushed her and ended up just raping her against her protests. She thinking of opening a case which I support. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. 

Shortly afterwards I check my phone I notice I got a call from my son last night and again this morning so I called him. He was also crying and I could barely hear him but eventually he calmed down and told me he almost hit her. He says all day yesterday she was giggling and chatting on her phone with a guy she says is a friend. They argued and then left it. At night curiosity got to him and he went throught he phone and found out that she was sending nudes to some guy. He got angry, grabbed her and shook her to wake her up and got into an argument again. He threw her phone on the floor and almost hit her. She then packed up and left with the kids.

I haven't told him that she's with me because I don't know what to do. I don't want to be involved but I already am. My daughter doesn't believe her at all and says I should kick her out. I don't know. Either way he was wrong. What now?

1st Update: 

I asked her about the infidelity and she says it's all nonsense. She's now at the hospital to see what she can do and then she's going to the police station.

I've told my son that they are here and that she's opening a case. I'm not good at reading people but he did seem surprised at her story and so was she at his story. I've warned him about an upcoming trial and suggested he calls a lawyer which he says he will.

2nd Update: they're both going with their stories and are both very firm in it and are gathering evidence on both sides. I have asked my DIL if I could take her to a friend or to her family and she understood. I'm still keeping the kids with me (on her request). 

And as much as I'd love to update more specifically on what's happening, I can't but I do appreciate all the comments and have/will read them all

ANSWER: Your son has been accused of rape. He needs to speak to an attorney and if possible get proof of the pics/texts. 
Either he is a monster or she is.

QUESTION: Update: My fiancé told me he is “tired of hiding” who he is from me and now I’m not sure I want to get married

Firstly, thank you everyone for your input, the “run” comment was pretty brutal but effective. I broke off the engagement three days ago via phone call. I haven’t figured out how I will return the ring but thinking by insured mail.

The call itself wasn’t horrible because I think he was in shock but a couple of highlights from the call:

- “I might have lied, fine. But you are a liar too, you lied about loving me.”

- “Not trying to guilt you but you’ve destroyed me.”

- “I have nothing now and have no idea what I’m going to do with myself.”

- “Are you seeing someone else?”

- “You’re making a huge mistake. Al I wanted was to be a good husband to you.” (2x)

These comments were hard to hear because my worst fear is that I preemptively cut off a relationship with a man who is going through active change and who loves me dearly. But at the end of the day, I realized I don’t trust that he will change genuinely and I have no idea how to measure that progress since he has proved to hide parts of himself around me.

He hasn’t tried to contact me since I broke things off and I’m grateful for that. I think it would make everything so much worse. I am grieving such an immense loss which is hard to communicate because others see it as a win by leaving an unhealthy relationship. 

Again, thanks everyone for the advice.

ANSWER: All of those comments he made to you are all centered around him trying to guilt you but none of them ask about your well being and how he could've done better.  I know it's hard but you've made the right decision, I'm proud of you OP!

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (26f) confessed to my best friend (26m) and was rejected, a week later he says he was wrong and has actually loved me all along, what do I do?

Update at the end!! (I originally posted this under a throwaway account, but that account didn’t start with ThrowRA as per subreddit rules)

I finally built up the courage to confess to my best friend that I had feelings for him for the past two years.  He was really nice about it and let me down gently but in no uncertain terms.  It was a hard pill to swallow, but I accepted this and I told him I’d need some time to just get back to the right head space.  I took a week to separate myself from him and let myself recover and rebuild my self esteem, but I made sure to tell him there’s no hard feelings, I just need the space.  
Fast forward to today, I ran into him and decided to talk to him and apologize for putting him in an uncomfortable position but that I accept his feelings and I’m ready to keep continue our relationship as friends.  Except... he tells me that he took that week to think too, and he thinks he’s actually loved me for a long time but that he was too dense to recognize his own feelings until now.  
I feel like I should be elated, but for some reason my heart just really hurts.  I feel confused and unsure of what to believe.  For all the time I’ve known him, he’s never been the type to play with someone else’s feelings and has never given me any reason to think he’s lying to me now about how he feels towards me, but I don’t understand how someone can just go from having no romantic feelings towards someone to saying they’ve loved them all along in such a short time.  I feel like I’ve been asked to tear out a piece of my heart, sew it shut, and now suddenly open that same wound to put everything back the way it was!  
Should I just accept his feelings now?  Should I be wary of this?  I feel like this should be such an easy decision and yet, I just feel so confused!

UPDATE: Thank you all for all of your advice and kind comments! We met in person to talk things through and I asked him what changed.  He told me that the truth was that he’d never really felt romantically interested in anyone else before, so he genuinely didn’t really know how to distinguish a best friend from something more.  I know he’s never had a relationship before, he’s never expressed a romantic interest in anyone else, and never seemed to express a sexual attraction to someone else, so this seems to line up from what I know of him.

I asked him then how he knew for sure that he liked me as more than a friend.  He said he’d never felt this way towards anyone else: never felt nervous butterflies just wanting to see them, never felt a strange jealousy when another guy was trying to hit on them, and never felt his heart race when he accidentally brushed hands with them.  

I told him that I wanted to make sure he wasn’t confusing any guilt he may feel for turning me down for love.  He said that if he wanted to pity me he would have just said yes the first time.  

He apologized again for confusing and hurting me and said that if I still needed time he’d be willing to wait, take things slow, and keep talking more until I could figure my feelings out.  I told him I didn’t need more time to know how I felt, because I never really stopped loving him even if I had pushed those feelings down as far as I could.  I told him that I wanted to take things slow, but I wanted to do so as more than just friends.  

We talked for a while, he even told me how he actually had come to the park planning to confess and ask me out, but when he heard me apologize to him and say that I was ready to just be friends he realized it might be better to take things slow.  

Of course, at the end of all this I just sort of happy/relief cried like a dork and he just pulled me close and hugged me (though he had some happy tears himself)! We’re planning to order some food from one of our favorite restaurants and have a picnic date at the same park next week!

ANSWER: Would you prefer that he accepted you when you first asked but a week later he realised it was a mistake...or he took a week to think about it and decide you are really what he wants? 

Strongest relationships are those built on friendships and not just lust.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I[19M] recently found out that my older sister[34F] is actually my biological mother.

Link to original:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/bw8dsa/i19m\_recently\_found\_out\_that\_my\_older\_sister34f/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bw8dsa/i19m_recently_found_out_that_my_older_sister34f/) 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ok so I first of all want to thank everyone for your honest replies, it really helped me to get my feelings straight and get ready to confront her.

&#x200B;

So after a week of avoiding I came to her house with a picnic basket by surprise so ill have a chance to speak with her. She was happy to see me and I told her to sit down because we need to talk.

I started things with saying that I know that she has a secret that she's been hiding from me for years. Her face turned red and she started crying like hell. She knew what I was talking about. I told her the story about the DNA test, about Jennet and basically what I told you guys in the last post.

Well after she calmed down a bit she told me the truth. She told me how she got drunk at a party and slept with one of the jerks who does nothing but weed every day. He didn't really care about a future kid and was like "yeah whatever". Apparently she found out that 10 years ago he was stabbed in prison after sitting for drug dealing, assult and armed robbery. 

She told me how her mother used to convince her father to talk me out of the idea of keeping the baby. they would constantly fight with her. When the baby was born they told her on the spot that she brought shame upon the family and they will not help raising the baby in any way, meaning she will have to work meanwhile to have money for her baby and sometimes for herself. After a couple of months of loaning from her friends and juggling between working and taking care of me she had a huge fight with her parents and told them that if they are not helping financially and barely in any sort of way, she and me are better off without them. As they sent her to her room she escaped in the middle of the night, hitchhiked to a neighboring country and by morning she was there already. She tried to take care of me for a few days, she found an old abandoned house that used to have homeless people coming around every now and then, and she took me to the mall when I started crying. She started crying too. The couple that adopted us immediately came to our aid and asked if \_we\_ lost our mother. Rose jumped on the opportunity and came up with a story and an alias. Police figured out we are not in the system for multiple reasons. We were raised in foster care for a year and a half until the couple that helped us decided to make the effort and adopt us so we won't be separated. It took them a few months and a couple of lawyers but they managed to adopt us both.

Rose knew all along that her parents are looking for her(They came to their senses after a day or so). She reached out to them and told them in a letter that she is fine and is taking care of herself and me, she is not homeless and found a nice couple to help her with the baby. She made it clear for them that she is never coming back and they should stop looking, and a month after that they stopped.

A few years later her father went on a quest to find her(she was after 18) secretly. After so much time searching he found her and apologized and after a while she forgave him and kept secretly in touch with him. He met me a few times and I knew him as one of Rose's old friends from the park. He helped us a few times and apparently they would meet up once every two months secretly. Ironically I'm glad I got to know him before he passed, even if I didn't know who he really is. 

&#x200B;

BTW, the adoptive family never found out about the whole thing.

&#x200B;

So after hearing this I told her we missed a lot by not knowing she is my mother and I told her I understand she did the right thing. I pulled out an "It's a boy!" sign from the picnic basket and some snacks for a late baby shower and we hugged for an hour or so, had a lot of fun, watched a movie and I headed off to my parents(ADOPTIVE) house to have dinner with them.

&#x200B;

I'm glad she is my mother. I feel for the first time in years - complete. I don't care she lied because she did it for the greater good and I honestly can't imagine my life right now if she didn't. Thanks Reddit for helping me getting my feelings straight and helping me out mentally to coop with everything that happened!

ANSWER: I'm so glad to hear that everything turned out well! 

&#x200B;

By the way, this could be a sick movie script ya know.

QUESTION: [Update] Overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvz1jc/overheard_my_girlfriend_say_she_would_leave_me/)

So I read all the comments on my last post and even after breaking up with my girlfriend, I was doubting if I made the right decesion. I wasn't going to update because I didn't see a reason to do it, but after the the last couple days I came to a final conclusion.I want to clarify that I broke up with my girlfriend because of how easy it was for her to disrespect me behind my back, not because of the actual height difference.

After I broke up with her she continued to apologize to me. She would send me letters and call me a lot. In one of the texts I actually responded to, she asked if we could meet up and talk. Without going into to much detail, she wanted a second chance and overall sounded very remorseful. I was about to agree, but something she said made me realize I would be making a mistake if I did. She said, "I'll remember to respect from now on." That sentence made me realize that I made the right choice by breaking up. Since when do you have to be reminded to have the bare minimum of respect for your partner?

Either way I'm glad I didn't give her a second chance. I don't know if any of you care at this point, but there's the update.

On a sidenote, the other day I was hanging out with one of my female friends who happens to be taller and I guess she saw us and started texting me that "she doesn't need me," started saying that my friend was a pig and that I moved on to fast. Blocked her and had a laugh I know for a fact I made the right choice.

ANSWER: > She said, "I'll remember to respect you from now on."

Nice catch. The sentence I mean, not the girl. Good for you for moving on.

================================================================================

QUESTION: [Update] My ex girlfriend committed suicide.. I am a firefighter and had to find her body

Its been a bit over 6 months since I posted that story and I want to give you a quick update on my life. Im on mobile so I apologize if it makes it harder to read. 

 TL;DR My ex girlfriend got into an abusive relationship with a drug addict. She was dealing with depression for a while and killed herself. I am a firefighter in NJ, but go to school in NH. I received the call and conducted research to find her. I drove back down to help with the search. We found her body in the woods and she wrote me a suicide note. 


Where i left off was me upset about the situation and upset with the world, and most importantly, upset with myself. I was in a dark place for a while after that. I drank and shunned out everyone but my friends who were helping me. For a good amount of time I distanced myself from any girl who I met.

The funeral wasnt long after and Jim didnt even show up. Im not sure if he was invited, but it just shows the type of guy he is. 


I didnt feel comfortable with dating anyone, let alone even hooking up with them. It felt wrong and i was scared i would get close to someone and lose them again. The depression i felt was destructive.

My chief reached out to me not long after because I never told him how I knew her. He asked me to see a therapist and that he can set up a visit at the firehouse. I was in NH so i told him ill see my college counseling center and send him confirmation. 

I lied, i sent him a fake email and he believed me. I had this notion that i dont need help because i help people. 

After 3 months i was still depressed but i started to talk to girls again. I met this really nice girl named Sarah. We talked  and even hooked up a couple times. After a month and a half she asked if we could start dating. I told her i couldnt. I told her my story and said i dont feel comfortable being close with anyone. She took it well and still wanted to talk, but i couldnt anymore. I felt as if she crossed a line in my mind and we couldnt go back. I didnt want to be close with anyone like that again.

Fast forward another month my friend Kelsey asked if i wanted to go to her sorority formal with one of her friends. I accepted and thats when i met Kristen. Kristen was perfect, she was really sweet and a great date. We ended up talking for a while and this time i decided it was time to be proactive. I opened up to her about what happened to me and i told her i want to take it very slow. She completely understood, instead of scaring her off she helped me more than anyone has ever had.

She convinced me that avoiding therapy is a bad move, and that there is no shame in seeking counseling. So i made an appointment and went. The therapist told me about a suicide prevention org on campus that i should join and tell my story. I joined them and they had suicide prevention events where people tell their stories  to help others. 

I did my first story and Kristen and a bunch of my friends went to support me. It was one of the most touching moments of my life standing up on that stage and seeing all those people. I continued doing these events and Kristen went to every single one. 

After 6 months i told her im ready to start dating, but to understand that i may be distant at first because im not use to this. She understood. Weve been together for 8 months and shes amazing. Shes nicest and most supportive person ive ever met. 

Every time im in NJ i go to Lydias house and support her mom. On Christmas i got a crew to come to her house and deliver presents to her moms boyfriends autistic son and her nephews. 

The way i was able to get relief for my pain was helping others. And if it wasnt for Kristen i wouldnt have the guidance to do it.

ANSWER: I am happy for you. You have gone through a lot but luckily you were able to come on the other side. This is very sad but beautiful story. I wish you all the best!

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (21F) found a hidden camera in my house. I suspect my SIL (26F) put it there to watch me while I babysit my nephew (1M). What do I do?

I babysit my 1 year old nephew from 7am-8pm Mon-Fri for free because a) I love my brother and nephew and b) I'm already a SAHM for my 5mo daughter and adding another kid isn't a big deal for me, I have everything he needs already at home and I love kids. 

The spare room in my apt has been transformed into a playroom with floor mats, exersaucers, toys, a nap cot, etc and that is where my daughter and nephew spend most of their time playing and napping. There is also a tv in there, and today semi hidden behind the tv I found a weird circular object with a lens in it. After some googling I found that it was a small hidden wifi enabled camera that live streams to an app. I flipped my shit, called my fiance and asked him if it was his. He vehemently denied it and suggested I called the police and explain to them that I need a bug check. The only other person with regular access to my home and the playroom in particular would be my SIL; she drops nephew off in the morning and picks him up after work, and Bro and our parents only come on the weekends. I suspect the camera was placed recently which rules them out. Another reason I suspect SIL is because I had put my nephew in a long sleeved foot pajama this morning because my apartment can get chilly, and 5 mins later she texted me "it's going to warm up later so please don't dress (nephew) too warmly, thanks!" It could be a coincidence, but now that I found the camera I'm not so sure.


If it's her, she knows I know since I'm assuming she saw me find it. What do I do? Do I confront her and ask if its hers? I couldn't even begin to imagine why she would think to put hidden cameras in my house; I have treated my nephew like my own from the start and love him wholeheartedly. I would never think to hurt him or neglect him, my family actually compliment me quite often on what good care I take of my daughter and how happy she always is, and of course I treat my nephew the same.

ANSWER: "Someone has secretly been recording my apartment. You should find someone else to watch your son, since I won't feel safe with him here until the cops get to the bottom of this."

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (43M) son's (17) therapist told him it would be better to just die

Advice would be very much appreciated, but I understand if you might think that this is too much for the sub. I am simply a religious Reddit user, so I thought I might get some help.

My son has been diagnosed with Manic Depression when he was 15. He's tried to end his life three times - one time he cut his veins, the other two he overdosed on pills. He is violent towards his younger sister, mother and sometimes even me. I have heard a lot of people tell me over the years that I would be better off just letting him do his business, and I am sick and tired of it. I love my son - he is not perfect by all means, none of us are, but I would never be relieved by him dying.

His last suicide attempt was in September, and ever since we have removed his door and set alarms at night, to check on him once every half an hour. We keep medication, knifes, belts, basically any sharp thing you could think of under lock and key. He is not allowed to drive or go anywhere by himself. We are all terrified of losing him.

Ever since September, he refused to go to his past therapist, so we had to set him up with a new one. This woman is well-known in our city and has gotten nothing but stellar reviews - people praise her left and right. It was hard to get an appointment, and my wife was ecstatic when she said she could maybe squeeze him in sometimes. He has been seeing her for two months, and although the appointments didn't seem to lift his mood much, he somehow looked lighter and more at peace after each and every one. I would drive him to each one, wait for him there and drive him back home. I would ask how it went and the best answer I got was "twas fine". Until yesterday.

I asked him how it was, not expecting anything out of him, because he seemed more closed off than usual. The answer I got was "She told me I would be better off just dying". I thought it was a cruel joke on his part, but he seemed sincere. I asked him to elaborate and he just said "Don't act like you don't want it". I got him out of the car, barged in on her next appointment and went off on her. How could you even suggest something like that? I am paying you to help him understand how precious his life is, how much everyone around him treasures him, and you just tell him he would be better off dying? He wouldn't. He would be dead. She asked my son to wait for us to discuss it in the hallway and then proceeded to tell me that no amount of "pills or chit-chats will help him". That his brain is wired differently from ours and that I don't have the knowledge she has. I just left. 

I have anulled all appointments and tried to discuss it with him, but I don't know if he even listens. My wife is at her wits' end and did nothing but cry ever since I related all this to her. I don't know if, in the last 2 months, she's drilled this idea into his brain. I don't know how to make it right. I feel like everybody is conspiring against us at this point, almost like no one wants him to get better. I know this may be too big for you, because I feel it weighting heavily on all of us too.

EDIT: It has been 12 hours since posting this. I have gotten maybe the best and worst advice ever. I have been called names, but most of all you degraded my son by calling him a sociopathic murderer which... okay, armchair psychologists, you sure know best. I will discuss with my wife the possibility of inpatient and will contact my son's last therapist to ask her if we can arrange something. I will write an update when there is something to update you on. To all those offering genuine advice and criticism, as long as it's constructive, thank you so much, I will take your words to heart. I will stop responding to comments here or try to fight useless battles around. I might check the private messages from time to time, but that is it. Thank you once again!

ANSWER: If he has to be watched 24/7 and is actively physically harming you guys, he needs to be in long term hospital care. They'll be able to work with him intensively to get his meds right. Bipolar is a tricky disorder. May I ask what he's currently taking?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (21M) Dad (54M) constantly makes jokes about my rape

To keep my background short, I was in a relationship many years ago for two years. It was toxic, it was "Fuck me or I'll cheat on you" it was "You aren't a real man if you don't do things with me. This was in the 8th-10th grade. Horrible awful shit. I have forgiven her since, I talked to her years later about it. She was being raped by her stepdad during our relationship and that violence and awful shit basically got transfered onto her and then onto me.

I finally had the guts to tell my parents about what happened to me about a year ago and to explain how that went I'll give a quote from my dad "I don't understand how you didn't like it". He doesn't believe a man can be raped unless by another man. But that shit really fucked me up for a long time, even to this day it still fucks me up. I can't get hard sometimes because I get such anxiety about it. One time I talked to my parents about it when I was like 20 and to this day if I ever go out with a girl, my dad will say "Could you get it up this time?" And laugh away. Just to give an example. I just don't know what to do, I feel like shit about it way to often to be healthy.

ANSWER: I’m so sorry you’ve had to go through that. That is awful. I’m a survivor too, and I’m had similar insensitive comments and it hurts so bad. If you want to try and have a relationship with your Dad, I suggest you talk to him and tell him how much it hurts you and if he continues to speak to you that way, then you can’t have anything to do with him. However, you would be completely justified if you cut him off completely. Please find someone to talk to about what you’ve been through. You’re strong and things will get better. You’re not alone! ❤️

================================================================================

QUESTION: This morning I (27M) found out my gf (27F) cheated on me, where to go from here?

So our valentine's day plan was to get dinner and spend the night together but I asked my boss if I could come in late as I had some stuff I had to do. However I went to her place this morning to drop off a bouquet of flowers and another gift as a surprise. She gave me a key to her apartment and when I went in there was another guy eating breakfast while she was sitting half naked in a robe drinking tea.




As soon as I walked in she saw me and burst into tears. The guy looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. I freaked out at first and the guy left. She kept asking what are you doing here, I thought you had to work and saying she was sorry. I tried asking her questions and she wouldn't answer. Eventually she admitted she met him at a bar a couple weeks earlier, they chatted and wound up fooling around in her car and had slept together three times since then. 



I took the flowers and the gift and left. I'm sitting at work right now because if I went home my mind would be on her and thinking about whatever they were doing constantly. 





We've been together 3 years and were planning on moving in together later this year. I was looking up rings. She said it's because I was her first properly serious relationship and she has no idea why she did something so stupid and selfish. She thought I wouldn't find out and planned to end it eventually as it was just a brief fling. I asked if there were any others but she said no. Idk what to believe at this point. 




The kicker is that my birthday was yesterday. We had lunch and got a hotel room together. We had dinner at my place with my folks and I dropped her off at her place around 9.30 as she said she had some stuff to finish doing before valentine's day. I trusted her for fucks sake.




 How and why the fuck do people do things like this to others? What am I supposed to do from here?



TL;DR spent valentines day morning learning my girlfriend is a cheater and the details of that cheating, sitting at work staring at my screen 




edit at roughly 1:30PM. : I broke up with her, I told her I'll be by later to get my shit and to have it ready. I'll be taking her stuff over and giving her back her key.

ANSWER: You have to look on the positive, you have avoided marrying this woman.  Ignore her BS about breaking up in the future with this guy.

================================================================================

QUESTION: [Serious] My (35M) girlfriend (24F) wants me to act like a horse when we have sex, and I’m not into it at all.

So, tiny bit of backstory, my girlfriend of 6 months loves horses, has all her life. An additional, seemingly relevant point is, during sex, she sometimes says stuff like ‘f me with that horse cock’. I’ve never thought much of it, I thought that was just a way of her saying it’s big. But she’s started to take it further and it’s turned into a bit of a fetish that I’m not entirely comfortable with. A few days ago, she told me she wanted to roleplay, and at first I was pretty on board, but then she said as horses. I laughed, thinking it was a joke and she took it the wrong way, and said she was tired and then went to sleep. I said fuck it and, trying to make her feel better, said I’d do it the following day. Honestly it was okay but very, very weird, she got so into it and said it was the best she ever had, and next time wanted to buy costumes, and maybe do it on some hay. I told her no, and I didn’t want to do it again and she’s back to being mad at me. Am I being a dick here? I don’t know what to do. Sorry if wrong sub, just wanted a second opinion

ANSWER: You will get a rash if you do it on hay. I lived on a farm. I have done my fair share of teenage rolling in the hay back in the day, and it will not end well for your skin. Plus, some hay has freaking thorns in it! I would seriously talk to her about you not being into it. I used to wonder why people thought girls that like horses are weird, now I know why. . . 

Edit to add: apparently my other comment is lost in a sea of other comments. I AM NOT A WEIRD PERSON THAT DOES  SICK THINGS WITH HORSES.

QUESTION: My girlfriend (24 f) doesn't believe that I (22m) was taken advantage of.



UPDATE- https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i3izig/update_my_girlfriend_24_f_doesnt_believe_that_i/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

My girlfriend and I were hanging out. I was playing a game and she was scrolling on her phone. We often just like to enjoy each other's company. I guess she was reading something because she just stated how it's so sad that every woman knows someone or has been someone who was sexually harassed and/or assaulted. I agreed and told her that it's horrible how many women do not feel safe in situations where they should. She then said that men are so lucky they don't deal with it. I didn't know if she was being serious at first but she kept ranting. I told her that what men go through in life definitely doesn't compare to what women go through but sexual assault is something that happens to men too. She then responded with "all men think about is sex".

I took that as an opportunity to open up to her and tell her about how I was taken advantage of from the ages of 7-18 by a woman who I was supposed to trust. As a kid she used to touch me or make me touch her and call it "our little secret". As I got older she got more "aggressive" with the sexual acts. It only stopped because she moved away. She kinda looked at me with a "yeah right" face and said that all boys dream of being with an older woman. She only agreed that it was messed up that I was so young when it started. She then said that I seemed to be ok so it's not that bad. Women who go through it have so much mental and emotional damage and that women aren't as scary as men. I honestly didn't even know what to say.

I'm not ok I guess I'm just good at hiding it.I use smoking as a coping mechanism and it's been an issue in our relationship. How do I navigate our relationship going forward? I'm not sure where this was coming from. Maybe she went through something too? Idk...

ANSWER: >all boys dream of being with someone older 

I’m sorry, you told your girlfriend that you had been sexually abused starting at age seven and that was seriously her response? Which she then continued to go on and trivialize it even more?

Your girlfriend is a garbage person.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I(21) found out my whole family was going on a vacation when I was told to look after the family pet.

My siblings have yet to move out of from our childhood home and I've been of to uni. 

I am so empty and it feels so godamn horrible. I've been trying to act like I didn't care but when they were driving to the airport I couldn't stop crying. My mother was so hurt and they kept saying they loved me. Last time we went to a family vacation was when I was around 13. I cried so much I had cramps in my abdomen.

I wrote them a message trying to make them understand what I was feeling and that it hurt me alot. I got back that I was ruining the vacation and to just accept it. They said they thought I wanted to be "free". I know it might have been an asshole move to mention this at the first day of their vacation, but the pictures they sent being all happy made all my emotions I've tried to hide come through. I've never felt this left out and I feel like I'm not a family member. I'm trapped in this house taking care of an animal when they are out being a family on Holliday.
I feel heartbroken.

My plan right now is to leave the pet with a relative and go back to Uni and dive into school to forget.

How can I forgive them? Has this happened to anyone else?

Edit: 



I would have paid for myself. This is not about getting a free vacation, this about them going away on a family vacation without inviting me. They brought with them my 19 year old brother who even complained that he'd rather play games at home. They are all there. The whole family. They brought my brother so that it would be a family trip. I would not have batted an eye if only my sister went. 

I am really grateful for everyone who commented and gave me a nuanced perspective. I've come to the conclusion that my emotions are valid and that I need to communicate this to my family peacefully. 

I'm also really sorry that so many other people have gone through similar situations and I send all the hugs in the world to you! The feeling of being left out is so so fucking awful.




Edit 30 juli: 

I just wanted to say that I've been thinking and given the number of people who commented that "being an adult means that you are not invited to family trips" I believe this is where the miscommunication might have happened. My mother probably did not consider to ask me because she had the opinion that adult children have their own families and that I wouldn't be hurt if they didn't ask me. 

For anyone who reads this and have children please do not do this. Going of to college does not mean that we suddenly don't need you. Being away from family is hard and I missed mine alot. Being invited to a family vacation is an excellent opportunity to spend much needed time together. Please include everyone, you don't lose a family when you gain another.

ANSWER: They thought I had other stuff to do. They also said they really thought I would be so happy being all alone in the house with my significant other. I don't understand why they thought that because we live together at uni. 

When I found out about it they had already booked the tickets and hotel so i had no chance of even rearranging my summer planing (not that I had anything planned those dates anyway). We have a relative that want to care for the pet and could have all these dates.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (36F) husband (41M) has some disturbing requests for after he's passed away.

This one is really bizarre, and I'm sorry ahead of time. My husband of 12 years has had some medical problems recently. The topic about end of life plans came up, and I asked if he wanted to be buried. He didn't want that. Nor did he want to be cremated.

My husband wants me to have his skull taken from his body and cleaned. Then he wants that skull put on the mantelpiece in the living room. The rest of his body he wants sent to one of those places that makes the gems out of bodies and made into two blue diamonds. He then wants those gems to be put in the eye socket of the skull to look like eyes. Then he can "watch the family home" and "be passed down through the generations".

My husband has always had a morbid/culturally insensitive sense of humour. As such, when he'd mentioned it before he was sick, I thought he was joking. Turns out, he is not joking. He even asked me to do it too so our skulls and matching eye gems can stay above the fireplace together. I adamantly refused.

I tried talking to him, but he's firm that this is what he wants. I told him that it made me uncomfortable, but he said it was also for our kids to have (who are not currently old enough to weigh in on this discussion). I asked if this was his way of trying to "live on" with the family even after death, and he said, "not really, no". I asked where he wanted the extra cremated remains from the gem company spread, and he told me that he didn't want any remains, and to just have the biggest gems possible made and have the company dispose of the rest.

I argued that he had no idea if his children would want the literal skull of their father. Further, which child would take the skull after I died? And in two or three generations, how would he feel if/when his descendants just sold this bizarre human skull at a garage sale because it means nothing to them? And finally, how was he going to feel about the fact that I, in my grief and trying to process the loss of him, would likely never take that skull out of the box, much less have to live with him "staring" at me every time I sat on the couch?

He essentially wasn't worried or didn't care about any of it. And regarding not taking it out of the box, it's the only time he seemed upset. He told me that was what he wanted, and I'd be ignoring his final wishes. I told him that he didn't have to live with those final wishes for years to come, but it didn't matter.

Part of me wants to get over my feelings, but I can't. I want to cry thinking of someone hacking apart my husband and handing me his bones, and I feel anxiety over the thought of putting that skull with his blue "eyes" in my home until I die. I'm fine if he wants a burial. I'm fine with cremation. Viking funeral, that weird thing where they turn you into tree food, whatever. I'm even fine with the gems on their own. But this whole skull thing is really bothering me. He won't budge, and he isn't joking.

At this point I'm thinking I would just do a simple cremation after he passes and spread his ashes on our property, but that seems sneaky and dishonest. But there is absolutely no way that I can comfortably live with what he's asking if he passes away before me. What do I do, Reddit?

TL;DR My husband wants his final resting place to be on our fireplace mantle in the form of his literal skull. This is to be complimented by two gems in the empty eye sockets made from his corpse. I'm deeply disturbed by this. Help?

Edit: I did not expect this to get the attention it has, and I am grateful for so many of the responses. At the end of the day, I want my husband to feel listened to, respected, and loved. This process has cemented to me that I definitely will not be putting his skull on my mantle until I die, but there were many compromises and ideas suggested that I'm going to think about. When it feels right, I'll suggest some of them to him. For now I'm going to sign off, give my husband a big hug, and think about this for a few days.

Edit 2: He knows this post exists now. We've had a good conversation. We've laughed a fair amount over the sheer ridiculousness of this hitting the front page and the comments it brought, and we both are confident we can reach a compromise that makes us both comfortable. We're not going to talk about it all today. We're just gonna get pizza, cuddle, and tell each other dumb jokes for the rest of the day. Goodnight Reddit. I'll update this at some point in the future.

ANSWER: I think he's really underestimating the amount of carbon needed to create a gemstone.  

He's not getting two eye-sized stones out of himself unless he's 9'4" and made of bison meat.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My son managed to read our will and it's destroying our family

I'm going to preface this by saying I love all three of my sons equally. They are 29, 24 and 22. It is my unequivocal truth.

It's just that that my ex wife's involvement with my oldest son has really introduced a lot of toxicity and complications in our life.

After years of emotional and financial abuse, my wife and I have made a very conscious decision to completely cut my ex-wife out of our lives once my son turned 18. We let him have his relationship with his mother without any interference from us or any negative words.

I disagree with a lot of how their relationship is but I have kept my mouth shut to keep the peace.

After losing literally everything after my divorce, I have built a new business with my wife and it's doing very well. All three of our sons work in the business.

A week ago, all the kids were over for lunch. I was stupid and left our recently drafted will on my office desk. My oldest son managed to see it.

Our company and our home was willed to my two younger sons. My oldest was given a trust that pays out some money every five years. 

I feel like I have to explain myself over why the will was laid out as it was. My ex-wife still has a lot of influence over my son and at the suggestion of our lawyer, we created the will this way so she couldn't interfere in the company and home.

If she were to pass away before us, the will would be immediately rewritten to divide the company/home equally.

The plan was to explain this to our son gently and not for him to see it without any context.

My son was understandably upset but his behavior that day exceeded all levels of decency. He stormed downstairs, threw things around and used disgusting language against my wife and I. Our sons nearly got into a fist fight.

I am devastated. I have already apologized and forwarded him emails to my lawyer telling him I want the will to be changed to split everything equally. But the damage is done.

He's now spreading horrible lies about us and his brothers to everyone in my family, even to the point of accusing us of being racists (he is half indian, half white). His brothers and my wife and I are so hurt hearing this. It couldn't be any further than the truth. It's the same thing my ex wife liked to accuse us of over the years.

He has refused to come in to work since the past week and I've been scrambling to do a lot of his work.

I don't know how to fix this. He won't take my calls.

My ex wife has used this situation to make absolutely insane posts on Facebook that I am considering legal action over. But I know that will just add gasoline to the fire with regards to my son.

I'm not sure how to salvage this. And I am really afraid that some of the things he has said won't easily be forgotten. My younger sons have already been questioned on social media by their cousins about the racism accusations. It's a very uncomfortable thing to approach. My wife is also not over the names she was called by him, even though she says she is.

TL;DR My oldest son saw our will and is understandably upset. But now he is accusing us of racism and refusing to hear my side even after I have tried to fix it.

ANSWER: Go see a family therapist. These rotten roots are so deep in all of you there's no quick solution to this. See what a professional has to say. If your sons don't go with you, go alone.

I'm sorry to say that what you have done is a forever effect, no matter the reasons, and so was his reaction. Good luck.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Me (M34) and fiancee (F27), I am in the process of calling a halt to our wedding as she has asked for an "open" relationship.

Alright folks where to start, this one is tough to type and the paws are shaking as I'm doing it. As it says in the title, me and my fiancee (ex?) are 34 and 27 respectively, have been together for nearly four years overall and are a year engaged. I'll be totally honest here, just before we got engaged she had an emotional affair with a bloke that she worked with (I only found  out because one of her friend's BF contacted me and said that he overheard the friendgroup discussing it). I confronted her at the time, and after a good bit of arguing and hassle, we came to an agreement to let it go. I'll be totally honest in saying that I'm still slightly in the process of getting over that particular incident, and it discoloured my view of her. I manned up, moved on and proposed (which I had planned on doing anyway). This is just to give an overall context here and indeed to let it be known that there has been issues in the past. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to recent time. We are due married in November (travelling abroad for it with family), and back around october she started acting a bit odd. Distant, not herself, away with the fairies. Even stopped having sex, which was very strange. I put it down to stress around organising the wedding, and the fact that we had moved flat. Forward to Christmas time, and now things are coming to a head. I confronted her straight up, and she set out that she was sorry, has just been stressed. I was very considerate, and tried to help her through it. 

&#x200B;

However, it basically continued on ebbing and flowing throughout the next two months, up to yesterday. I arrived in from  work last night, and she says that she wants to talk. The vibe was bad guys, I could tell. We sat down and she set out that she had been reading, and that she wasn't having second thoughts about the marriage, but the 'nature' of our relationship. At this rate I was getting a bit agitated, and demanded that she come out with what the bloody hell she meant. Basically, a few of her friends had back in October (the times matched up) conveyed to her the idea of an "open relationship"...........basically they stay with their blokes and have one night stands on nights out if they fancy. I'll be honest, the idea made me ill. I said this to her, and she asked to be heard out. Pulled out some online blog post by a blogger who had a husband and live-in boyfriend........I got half way through and told her enough of this nonsense. I wouldn't consider myself old-fashioned, but a wife or fiancee bonking other men will never be in fashion, not in my world anyway. We got into a fight, and in the end she was begging me to give it a chance and that nothing is set in stone. I basically said that I needed some headspace, and that I'd spend the weekend at my mates. It was quick after that, and I left without a fuss. I'm typing this on my mates laptop, and am in a bad mental way atm. I am seriously considering calling the whole thing off, both relationship and wedding. I suppose if anyone has been in a similar place I could do with some advice 

&#x200B;

TLDR; Me (34m) and fiancee (27f), she asked for open relationship and I am fuming.

ANSWER: This is a dealbreaker. You don't want an open relationship and she does. There is no in between. Don't marrt her. If she wants multiple relationships she'll seek then extramaritally anyway. Don't allow yourself that level of hurt when you can see it coming.

QUESTION: UPDATE My [42M] daughter [14F] won't get an abortion

Yesterday I posted [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ds59s0/my\_42m\_daughter\_14f\_wont\_get\_an\_abortion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds59s0/my_42m_daughter_14f_wont_get_an_abortion/) but it got removed because I didn't have "ThrowRA". I've added it and messaged the mods to confirm it's me. Because the original was deleted, you can read it here:

ORIGINAL 

I \[42M\] am a single father to my daughter \[14F\]. My wife passed away with excessive bleeding after childbirth, so it's just me and her. She's a fantastic young lady, always on honor roll, really good at basketball, and a social butterfly. She doesn't see too much of me because I work 9-7, but I'm home for dinner and she's started getting really good at cooking something little for both of us.

Around Tuesday, I noticed there was something off about her. She was a whole lot quieter than she usually is and there was no chatter during dinner. Right after dinner she went up to her room, even though typically we sit and watch TV together. I figured it was just moody teenage hormones. Except it doesn't stop. Friday I finally take her hands and ask her what was wrong. She looked at me and just burst into tears. She cried more, so I held her until she was ready, and that's when she whispered, "I'm pregnant."

I was shocked. Utterly and completely shocked. I kept on hugging her, but my mind had gone blank. I took her upstairs, tucked her into bed. I didn't think asking her about what she planned to do when she was so vulnerable was a good idea, I'd wait until she calmed down a little. Saturday she came down for breakfast and I sat her down and asked her her plans. She said under no circumstances will she abort the baby, it's her baby and she plans to keep it full-term. I then asked about adoption, and she said she didn't want to, that she could care for it. I calmly explained that we were no way financially able to care for a baby, and who would take care of it during the day? I go to work, she goes to school, and my parents, although were a big help in taking care of my daughter when she was younger, are too old to watch a baby. She suggested she start online school, which I refused, saying I don't want her to ruin her life.

The thing is, I don't even want to consider adoption. I can't imagine her going through pregnancy, then labor, especially with what happened to her mother. I don't know if high-risk pregnancies are genetic but if she has one, what if I lose her?I told her this, and she asked me if I had no love for my grandchild. But I don't. I don't care at all about the clump of cells in her uterus, I care about her. The girl I raised. I told her today that she had to abort her child. She cried, screamed, begged, telling me to reconsider, telling me that she'd run away. There's no way I'm letting her give birth, she could tear her body apart. And for school, I don't want her to face the stigma and hurt of teen pregnancy.

At this point, I see only one way out of this, and that's telling her if she doesn't abort it, I'm kicking her out. It hurts me so much to do this but if she doesn't do one, I'm afraid her life will truly be over. I won't actually, but I'm hoping it'll push her in the right direction. I'm pretty much manipulating her, but how do I get out of this?

Where do I go from here?

TL;DR: My daughter's pregnant, we can't afford a baby, she doesn't want to give it up or abort it

UPDATE

So today she didn't go to school and we went to the local clinic to her checked out. It's been confirmed: she's definitely pregnant, about 13 weeks along. Everything's fine so far, but she's automatically high-risk because she's a teenager. They said she could develop anemia, low blood iron, or blood pressure problems, and on top of that the baby could also be born with disabilities. 

After the doctor's I took her out for ice cream and then asked her who the father was. I told her I had to know, she had to tell me. She refused, saying she'd raise the baby on her own, without his help. We went home and she went to the bathroom and accidentally left her phone open, so I took it and looked through her messages. According to the ones between her and her friends and her and the guy, he's 15 years old and a friend of a friend. She hadn't told him yet.   
I wrote down his number and then messaged him on my phone, telling him I was \[daughter's name\] dad, and I needed him to give me his mother's number because of a big problem. I expected something of a fight but the kid messaged it back to me, so I called his mom and I told him my daughter was pregnant, and her son was the father. She asked if I was sure, and I said based off the texts, it didn't seem like she'd had sex with anybody else, but she'd be free to get a paternity test. I said it'd be best if we got together at a coffee shop or something to talk, but she said there'd be no need of that. She said her son would be waiving his parental rights and they were not interested in a co-parenting situation. I asked about child support, and she said her husband would pay it, but her son would not be involved. She asked for me to not tell her about any details of the pregnancy and they don't want to be at any appointments. She hung up before I could say anything else. 

Now I don't know where I stand. I can't afford a lawyer, and I don't think I can make him get involved either way. I don't entirely trust them to be accommodating in terms of child support considering how short his mother was. Is there a way they could get out of paying it? I don't know enough about their family but if they have money and we don't, what's happening there?

My daughter is no closer in getting an abortion or considering adoption, but I'm going to stop peppering her with it now. My sister and her are talking right now at the suggestion of another redditor, and I hope a female influence will work better on her than I am. She's sending a little bit of money, and I think I may be able to set up a therapy appointment for her to talk out her options in a professional way, something my sister and I can do.

EDIT: Thank you everyone so much for commenting. I expected maybe a dozen comments and I’ve got hundreds of PM’s. Thank you all so much for your help. I’m not sure what the rules of updating are, but if it’s possible I’ll update as soon as I can.

ANSWER: Jeebus I understand her not wanting an abortion but no fucking way can you afford to keep this child, talk to her about an open adoption.  She’s 14 so she has no clue what she’s in for and she has no idea what “bills” mean when it comes to children.

She can not even work to support this child.  She has not experienced 72 hours of not being able to sleep because oh yeah, a newborn!  She doesn’t understand that at 14, she is incredibly ill equipped emotionally to take care of a child.  All those stories about teenagers going out and abandoning their baby to party or getting frustrated and shaking their babies and causing them harm?  Yeah, that’s what happens when you have no coping skills for dealing with a screaming, crying, shitting creature for months on end while you are getting 2 or 3 hours of sleep a night at best.

If she cares about this baby, try talking to her about adoption.  Talk to her about the fact that her child can be placed in a loving home with the means to support the baby instead of with a 14 year old mom and a dad who doesn’t want to even acknowledge it.  

I’m not trying to be mean but your daughter is romanticizing this whole situation, which might be a result of not having her mother in her life.  She may be imagining being a perfect mother, giving it a perfect childhood, etc. etc., the one she couldn’t have because her mother was dead.

Find a kid friendly way to put it but explain to her the reality of life for a kid with a 14 year old mom and no support from the father, explain to her that this child is a result of her poor decision to have unprotected sex and not the result of a relationship with love and planning, explain to her how selfish it is of her to keep the child when she has put ZERO effort into planning or preparing for it and that if SHE really loved this child, she would give him it up for adoption.

I don’t think she should be forced into an abortion if she doesn’t want to, I do think that is her right.  And I don’t think you and your parents should be forced into an early grave trying to provide for a child with a baby at 14 when you are already a single dad working long hours.

Sit her down and do a breakdown of the monthly cost of child and ask her how at 14 and while attending online school, how she is going to make enough to provide a decent life for this child?

QUESTION: I (24 F) just found out my husband (34 M) is paying for an apartment that I know nothing about.

We have owned our house for the four years we've been married. He's had this apartment for two years. I only found out about it because the landlord couldn't reach him on his cell and called the landline 

He refuses to talk to me about it and says since he makes the money he doesn't need my input on all decisions.

I'm tempted to call that landlord and get the address and see where this place is and get let in to see it. 

I'm afraid of what I'll find honestly. Advice would be greatly appreciated.

ANSWER: >He gets impatient with me sometimes since I'm not the most smart.

Oh no. No no no no no no, fuck that. Do not blame yourself for him being an asshole. Quit that shit right now and I mean RIGHT now. He's not as smart as he thinks he is, putting y'alls landline phone number on his secret apartment. You're plenty smart. Use those smarts to lawyer up and take him for as much as possible.

Its been a few days now since I've posted and reddit has given me some solid advice especially the kind redditors who messaged me directly. I'm very grateful for this cause it helped me calm down and not give in to my impulses. 

The morning after I posted, I texted Mike saying that I needed time and space to think about everything. He then replied with "I've waited 10 years, I can wait a bit longer". My heart melted. 

When the kids woke up, our son was looking for his dad. He's at the age now where he pretty much idolized his dad. I get why though, Mike is an amazing dad. Our daughter gave me the stink eye all morning. 

After lunch, when our son was in his room playing video games, my daughter confronted me about Mike. She basically said how she knew there was something going on (guess we're not that sneaky) and that she didn't want our fighting to affect their lives. She thought we were fighting. 

Now, the divorce affected her but not as badly as expected. We made sure to get her counseling immediately after and made extra sure her life was as normal as possible. I'm not gonna delude myself and think she wasn't hurt by it but I'm pretty confident in saying we dealt with it pretty well. Or as well as we could.

I then had the conversation about how we weren't fighting but quite the opposite... We were thinking about getting back together. She thought about it for a while and said she was happy for us and hoped it was forever this time. 

The next day I dropped my kids off at my parents house so I could talk to Mike at his place. We had a long talk about how we felt about each other, what we plan to do about it going forward, and as many of you suggested what he planned to do next time we hit a rough patch especially since we plan on having a 3rd kid. He told me that the night he cheated still haunted him 10 years later. He told me how it wasnt worth it one bit and how it was the biggest mistake of his life. He said that if ever we hit a rough patch again, we would talk about it like adults. He even suggested we do couples counseling every now and then even when times are good. I liked this idea. There are some details about our conversation that I want to keep private but long story short we got back together. We are going to take it slow and in every step we take, we both agreed that our children would take priority over everything. He's not going to move in yet but he would spend a few nights a week at home with us. 

Later that night, we sat the kids down and broke the news. Daughter didn't say much cause she already knew but our son was over the moon. Since we divorced when he was a baby, the concept of both his parents being together was quite new to him. They obviously asked questions and we answered them. We're also planning on doing family counseling to help make the transition easier for everybody. 

Overall, I'm really happy right now. Mike made a mistake 10 years ago but I don't hold it against him and have completely forgiven him for it. I know he loves me now and won't cheat on me anymore. I'm back together now with the love of my life and father of my kids and I couldn't be happier. 

As I type this out, Mike is in the next room playing video games with our son. I'm not entirely sure what the future will look like but I'm happy he's back. 

Thank you reddit for the advice. It really helped with our talk and how we proceed going forward. I think I'll stay online for an hour or so to reply till the kids are asleep and he comes to bed then it's my turn to have fun. 

Peace 😁

ANSWER: Wishing you the best. Also admire the grown-up way you and your ex (your ex-ex?) are handling this situation.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (29 F) am letting my baby be adopted so I can give him a better more stable life with two parents. After he is born I will be going to a mental health facility to try to get myself better. Do up think it would be appropriate for me to write him a letter to explain this?

I am bipolar and dont feel that I can care for a child, especially by myself. I dont want to live with my parents forever. 

I've gone to this place before. The people who work there are rough and not nice but after a year there when I was 17 I did okay up until now. 

I think he deserves two parents who want him and can care for him. 

I have been so depressed since the babys father and I have broken up that I spend days in bed. I know I could not raise a child in my present state of mind. 

I want to have my tubes tied after this. 

My greatest wish for the baby is for him to have two loving parents and a happy, healthy home. 

My greatest wish for me is to someday be normal.

ANSWER: As someone who was adopted, and has had a great life (most likely much better than I would have had, but who knows), I would love to have a letter simply saying why. Maybe some health issues that I could possibly get?

But I'm so proud of you for realizing that you're not in a good spot where you can raise a child, and therefore putting him up for adoption. I imagine that's a very tough decision to make.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (f 25) husband (m 28) said something disgusting to me

I can’t stop thinking of it. I’ve been in the bath for a long time because I’ve been dreading going to bed with him. 

A few hours ago I was lying in bed feeding our baby. My husband was begging me to come do something with him. I tried to tell him just to wait a few moments.  He kept glaring at me and telling me to hurry up. 

I just gave birth a couple months ago, and my husband has been so jealous of his own son.

I could see he was starting to lose his patience and I told him “Honey I have to take care of him before you, you know that”. And what he said back was really stunning. He looked me right in the eyes and said “if you love him so much, why don’t you suck his dick instead of mine”. I couldn’t say anything, I didn’t know what to say. And then he stormed out of our bedroom. 

I don’t even know what to make of this. What should I do? It just bothers me so deeply, it’s going to be hard for me to forgive. I really don’t have many other complaints about my husband, most days things are great with him but that just made sick to my stomach. Am I just being sensitive? Maybe I’m just emotional, but I feel like crying.

ANSWER: I don't mean to hijack the top comment, but this post is incredibly concerning to me.

Women whose partners are controlling and abusive are much less likely to breastfeed their babies, and if they do breastfeed, they often stop breastfeeding by 4 weeks postpartum. This is because the abusive partner is jealous of the attention the baby is receiving and wants to control their partner's body and anyone else's access to it, including a baby. They view breastfeeding as sexual and the baby as a competitor.

Yes, I know that is horrible. It sickens me too.

More information about abuse and breastfeeding can be found here: https://rewire.news/article/2016/04/08/breastfeeding-side-trauma/

Pregnancy and the postpartum period are also incredibly vulnerable periods for women and are time periods in which abuse often escalates, due to this jealousy, a perceived loss of control felt by the abusive partner, and the woman being more dependent and isolated.

Struggling with having a child is normal. Being so jealous of an infant that you make a coercive, predatory barb out of anger that your wife is feeding that infant, is not normal.

OP, I'm worried about this relationship, and I'm worried that your husband may engage in sexually coercive behaviors with you, push your boundaries, and mistreat your child.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (23f) marriage is based on a lie. My entire family including my husband (31m) is implicit in it. I want out. I have no idea how to.

Edit: I can only be on for short periods of time at a time so I will try to come back later but I wanted to thank everyone who has commented and messaged. Ebbie I will reply to your message as soon as possible. I will try to keep updating and replying as I can. 

Edit 2   10:27 mst: I have to get off for now. I will try to come back and update when I can. Again thank you all so much. 

I will try to keep this short. My family & my husband's family are members of a fundamentalist Christian denomination, of the type that views women's roles as exclusively to be a 'helpmeet' to their husband and to raise children. I don't think people realize how dark that world is really, but I won't get too much into it. Lets just say that unless you've been super brainwashed or actually somehow believe it, it's not a good place for women, or kids, or really anybody. 

I was homeschooled for my whole life and rarely had any interaction with anyone outside of the circle until I was 18. I wasn't allowed to talk to people who weren't from my church unless it was for the purpose of trying to convert them. 

From an early age I knew I was different and by puberty I was crushing on girls and having sexual thoughts and feelings about them. After reading my diary when I was 14 my parents sent me to conversion therapy, which was an awful experience and obviously didn't work. 

Between the ages of 15 and 18 I attempted suicide 11 times. After being released from the hospital the last time, my parents essentially farmed me out to family friends to help with their children and to attempt to find someone to court me. 

When I was there I had unmonitored internet access for the first time and joined an lgbt group locally under a pseudonym and started going out to meet people when I could since the supervision was more relaxed than it was with my parents. At one of these meetups I met a girl who I fell completely in love with and started dating her in secret. This was in April of 2017. 

Fast forward to when we had been dating around 8 months. It was around this time of year and we went out to a Christmas light festival in a neighboring town. Usually people from our denomination don't go to that kind of thing because it's not god honoring but friends of the people I was staying with saw me there with her and told them. By the time I got home that night my parents were there waiting for me. 

Two months later, after being forced back home and having everything taken away, I was introduced to my now husband, and by may of this year we were married. 

I don't love him. He doesn't love me. He 100% buys into everything that the religion teaches but had a failed courtship and then did mission work. He's literally told me that the only reason we are married is because he feels like Jesus's mission for him in life is to "heal" me. 

It's been 8 months of absolute hell. Everything I do is approved by him, I only have friends who are the wives of his friends or are from church. I don't have a job. I literally keep a box that I told him was a hope chest and put enough baby things in that he doesn't know I have a tablet and books that I'm not supposed to have. 

I know that this isn't really the typical kind of thing that gets posted in this board, but I'm desperate. I've been talking to my girlfriend again since I got the tablet. I've been trying to mend things with her. I know that I need to get out of this situation but I have no idea how to. I'm afraid I'm going to get dragged back into this hole again and I can't. I am hoping that this board might have people on it, even just one or two, that can help me to leave safely and permanently. It's hard because if I do go I have to basically build my life over again from scratch and I don't have any family or anyone who would help or support me in any way.

ANSWER: I just wanted to give you some support from a distance. I escaped a cult and arranged marriage when I was in my teens, and really really feel for you.

An internet stranger once told me these words - the words that gave me the courage to get out of there myself and go into the unknown world. He said, "It is always worth the upheaval of the world for even a chance at a better life."

And it really, really is.

You've received some great suggestions here. And I know I'm an internet stranger myself, but if you need specific tips, or a willing ear, or an untracable phone card, I will gladly offer my help.

Edited: I'm adding the below because of the PMs I've received for more information about my history. I sent a direct message to the OP, and am sharing parts of it here for anyone else these words can help:

First.. I just wanted to send you a hug. I was 9 when my mother married the cult leader, and 11 when I wasn't allowed outside any more. By 12 they were pushing marriage and had banned outside contact and books and radio. I managed to buy myself two more years somehow, but was married at 14 to a man twice my age. I was not the docile girl he'd been promised - I fought back and got returned. That wasn't a good thing, and by 15, I knew I really really had to get out. And that was when the internet was young, and the year the cult foolishly got the internet, not really realizing that meant we could contact the world.

I escaped at 16, not to a strangers or by going to the side of the freeway and taking my chances with a trucker, which I'd given serious consideration to. But I was lucky, and found a family member unrelated to the cult to take me in. I was also under age, so that was tremendously helpful.

You need to have, and take with you, your birth certificate, social security card and ID, if you have them. If you don't, it's OK. You'll be able to get them, though at considerable trouble. If you can get them, take them. If you have them, wonderful!

The other replies are right about women's shelters. In my case, the cult was very inter woven with local law enforcement, and my mother actually volunteered at the local shelter, which I suspect was to ensure that we had no where to go. So when I ran, I ran far away. Over 100 miles the first day, and ever further after that.

You are probably nervous about the thought of a shelter. It's scary. And you are probably nervous about all the things you don't know about what the regular world as a young adult is like, and how you'll support yourself. First... The world is amazing. It's terrifying and amazing at the same time. And you are strong and you are going to be OK. You'll be OK in a shelter too. Just go as far as you can, and hopefully over at least one state line. Or you come to someone specific, like your girlfriend or someone like me. I know it's insanity to say that as an internet stranger. But when I needed to run, I didn't think I had anywhere to go. For years. I would have left at 12 if I knew I had somewhere safe to go. That was the age I realized that no one else was coming to rescue me - I was going to have to rescue myself.

So I'm telling you now, if you need a place to go, you can come to me. \[Private details omitted\]

I helped my state start a confidentiality program too, which all but 12 states now have. You can Google, but if you don't have long, the short version is that you will have the support of the state's attorney generals office, get a participant card and a legal mailing address through the state, and mail will forward to you wherever you are really living. All your public records will be blacked out, even to most law enforcement. Search Address Confidentiality Program by the state name you think you can get to.

The first day I got out, when I was safe and very far away, I went and sat outside on the grass by myself. In public. I hadn't been outside unsupervised in over 3 years. And not with my hair uncovered either, or my face. It was... Amazing. The wind in my hair. The sun on my arms. And it was terrifying too. I spent the time trying to stop the urge to duck whenever any one walked anywhere nearby.

I started college 3 days later, which was a feat of paperwork on my end, and because the internet was very young and I had my birth certificate and SSN with me, which I'd stolen from the cult office in the middle of the night the week before.

You are probably worried about money, of course. Some states have cash payments to folks in temporary emergency situations. You would qualify, but not enough for lodging. Just enough for toilet paper and tooth paste. You'd also qualify for state health care and food, at least for a few months. But you can go straight into college, too, if you time it right, with grants.

Do you have access to a phone? If you have access to a cell phone that's a smart phone, use Google voice to make free and untracable calls, and delete the app every time, and don't be signed in to that account anywhere. You can do this from your tablet too. If you have access to a landline, let me know and I will send you what you need to make calls anywhere in the USA for free. The calling card number will show up in monthly call logs, if you are being monitored, but not the actual places you call. If you have access to neither, but could keep and hide a tracfone, let me know and I'll send you one preloaded with a lot minutes. You need a phone to talk to shelters or to text with them, but not to email.

A shelter will help you initiate formal divorce proceedings too, and safely from a distance. I was lucky - my marriage was religious vs legal, so when he divorced me, there was no paperwork. And I hadn't yet gotten pregnant, despite his forced attempts. I was lucky not because I was particularly strong and fought him, but because he was SO astonished that I would fight him at all, he just froze in astonishment while I got out of the room.

To give you some extra hope.. It's been over half my life now since I escaped. I've been with my spouse almost that entire time, and unrelated, but I also have another partner now too, and my life is full of warmth and love. I went straight into college and got my masters in my early twenties. I've moved a great many times, because the cult kept looking for me. And I got armed and learned to defend myself. The cult hasn't come for me in over 9 years now. But now I have children and I am aware that the cult would find it the perfect revenge to take my children. Do we live in fear? No. I never have. We are simply prepared. And I am confident in my ability to protect myself and my family. You will be too.

I told myself then, at 14 and 15 and 16, that when I grew up, I was going to be the woman who was coming to get the girls being held against their will in cults. Because no one was coming for me.

And I have. And I will be that person for you, if you want or need that help.

\[Personal information omitted.\]

\---

If you are reading this and in a position similar to the OP, please reach out to a shelter, either near you or far away, and to the other resources mentioned here. It warms my heart to see how many more options there are now then when I was breaking free. It's worth every moment of uncertainty. It's worth the upheavel of the world.

\---

Edit 2: Many folks have replied or messaged and asked how they can help. Reddit has a reply length cap, so please see my reply under this one for specific ways you can assist.

QUESTION: Update to: I found out that my [27M] GF [23F] of 9 months is part of "mean girls" type clique - I broke up with her

[Original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/go03bd/i_found_out_that_my_27m_gf_23f_of_9_months_is/)

This all actually happened a few days after my original post, but things have been pretty hectic since then, but I wanted to write a quick update since I got some useful advice in the first thread. The best advice was to insist on seeing the chat one last time to see if she had written anything about me. She initially said no, because it also has private information about her friends, etc, etc. But I basically said if she doesn't let me see the texts it's over and she reluctantly agreed, but told me to keep in mind that this was a year ago and how much we grew as a couple since then blablabla. 

I scrolled to the period when we started dating and yea sure enough there I was in the texts. It actually made me feel really weird reading other people talking about me. Right around the time we first slept together someone asked her if I was better than some guy (apparently a former FWB of hers). Without missing a beat she fires back no, that it was kinda disappointing because I was nervous and had some performance anxiety and then actually went into detail about what we did. She knew I was feeling anxious since I hadn't been with anyone in a while after a bad breakup and she was supporting in person, so it felt extra shitty that behind my back she was complaining about me. A friend of hers even mocked me and she said nothing. 

Katie saw the look on my face and tried to tell me again that we grew so much and things became really good when we got comfortable with each other and connected. She even showed me a text where she said that to her friends. But honestly at that point I was already done. I asked her to move out and after a bit of drama and nasty words, she moved her stuff to her mother's place. 

As others said, I have no doubt they are not talking shit about me together, but honestly I could not care less what those pieces of shit are chattering about, I just never want to see any of them ever again.

ANSWER: “No, silly, that would be infringing on my friends’ privacy!”

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.

&#x200B;

[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avwpo0/i_28_think_my_girlfriend_26_has_been_using_my_gym/)

I've had a lot of time to think about what happened yesterday. I've also read through a lot of the comments. Thank you to everyone who gave me advice on what to do. There's been A LOT of development and a few requests to follow up, so here it goes. It's whatever at this point.

We had been texting off and on all evening. As promised, I agreed not to bring it up in person. When I got home after work her car was in the driveway and her sister's car was there as well. I was a little nervous not knowing what I might be walking into, but overall I just wanted to get whatever was going to happen over with. When I walked in it was clear so did she. Her sister was helping her pack up her things. I didn't know what to say, but I never expected this. I honestly thought everything was going to be okay when I got home. Her sister just looked at me and didn't say anything.

I walked by her sister and went into the bedroom where my girlfriend was. She didn't say anything either. She didn't even look at me. If she was going to leave I at least wanted us to have a discussion about it. Everything I had read in the comments about buying a bidet and OCD lead me to believe there might be more to all of this than I had considered. I started to talk and she just threw down the hangars of clothes and screamed at me. "YOU PUT THIS ONLINE? I TOLD YOU TO NOT TALK ABOUT IT!" Her sister ran into the room and told me to just leave until they were gone. She then accused me of cheating. WHAT? This whole thing has been crazy and I feel like I had dealt with a lot up to this point but man that was it. I snapped.

I told her sister I had never cheated. Not once. I would never cheat on her. Enough was enough, so I told her sister the reason she was there was because earlier I had found out my girlfriend had been going to the bathroom and wiping herself with my socks. Everything went silent. Like, no one said a word. Out of nowhere they both start crying. Her sister stared yelling at me and told me I shouldn't be talking about things I don't understand. When I asked her what in the world she was talking about she just kept on yelling at me and shouted back that it was normal and that I need to mind my own business.

1. Her sister knows about it. (She did not know I posted on Reddit about it)
2. Her sister thinks it's normal.
3. I need to mind my own business? They're MY SOCKS!

I stood there all kinds of messed up so I just left. I went to a buddy's house and stayed the night. I also called off work today. I went home and all her stuff is gone. I didn't text her back. I think I'm done.

To clarify a few things: She insisted on doing laundry to keep my suspicion of her not having many socks at rest. She told me last night through text she always throws away the socks and never washed them. She reaffirmed it's not a fetish. She won't try a bidet because she doesn't want poop water splashing on her. I can't keep up with the comments. I'm pooped. (I'm trying to find humor in this because I'm really upset :(

So yeah.

Edit: (a sentence) Her sister did not previously know I posted about it on Reddit. I'm sure they both do now.

ANSWER: I'm not shocked that her sister knows about it. I figured the whole family does. Sister is in protection mode. Deep down she realizes that her own family member is unwell. She's in denial. It might be best just to "wash your hands" of this entire relationship. It's a shame that you've invested a lot of time and you really like her, but if this is how things are going to be, you're better off finding someone else.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (f 20) mother (f 37) tells me if I don’t be her surrogate she’ll cut me out of her life forever.

My mother and her new husband want to have a baby. She’s still young so she still is fertile however both of her past pregnancies were complicated and very dangerous. So her doctor told her to absolutely not get pregnant as it will just be even more risky now that she’s older. She told me all of this this morning, and then she asked me to be her surrogate. She said all I have do is carry her egg and have it fertilized by her husband. I told her I can’t do that. For one, I’m trying to get my nursing degree and I don’t want anything to slow me down. And I already have a two year old with my boyfriend, and remembering what it was like to be pregnant there’s no way I want to go through it again so soon. I’m also worried because a lot of the bonding mothers do with their babies is while it’s still in the womb. I don’t want to feel attached maternally to a baby that won’t be mine. I gave her my reasons and she just rolled her eyes and told me “it would be a small sacrifice for you to do this for me”. She told me all she wants is another baby and that I shouldn’t deprive her of it when I can help her so easily. I tried to reason with her but she literally told me “if you don’t do this to me then I don’t want a relationship with you anymore”. I asked her if she was serious and she told me “yes” and left. I don’t know what to do. My mom is very stubborn and very vindictive so she probably means it at least for now. I’m not sure how I should handle this. I think she’s acting crazy.

ANSWER: Sounds like she'd do you a favor if she cut you out forever. Being a surrogate is not a "small sacrifice" by any means. It's unfortunate that her chances of a healthy pregnancy are slim to none, but trying to guilt trip you is just cruel.

You have every right to put your foot down and keep it down. Go no contact if need be.

If this kind of behavior is a common occurrence for her, I'd suggest looking into support from some of the narcissistic abuse subreddits or the Raised by Narcissists sub.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My gf of 3 years returned the engagement ring because she didn’t like where I proposed.

I decided to propose to my gf of three years on our third anniversary. I flew her to Vietnam and after a couple of weeks travelling we ended up in Cambodia. She had wanted to see Angkor wat and some other temples that were on her bucket list. After a long day of hiking in the heat through ruins we retired back to our hotel and when we were alone together I proposed and she said yes. We kissed and I had planned to take her to the waterfall the next day to celebrate. It’s really beautiful. She took a shower and I laid in bed thinking what an amazing day I just had and how I would get to spend the rest of my life with the women I loved. When she came out of the shower however she was in tears. She handed me back the ring saying she couldn’t accept it because she didn’t want her memory of my proposal to be in a hotel room.

I played it cool and said I understood but truthfully it hurt. It seems to me that I had offered her something of value. A lifelong commitment and partner. I took her halfway around the world and helped her cross off something she had wanted to do most of her adult life. I felt that if she valued me it wouldn’t matter that the proposal wasn’t exactly what she wanted. It was me and our future together she was saying yes to and not my delivery. If she had found a million dollars in a dumpster she wouldn’t throw it back because of where it came from. So she can’t possibly value me or what I have to offer as an individual if she’s willing to reject it because she didn’t like the place I asked. 

I’m preparing to end things when we get back. She wants me to propose again and better and then she’ll say yes, but I’m done. Am I wrong? Should I do it over? What do you think.

Any advice is appreciated.

--Update to the story.
Hi and thanks for all the comments and help.

I ended up following the advice of one of the commenters. The conversation with my girlfriend went something like this:
Me: No that was my proposal. You rejected it. It's never going to happen again.
GF: So we aren't getting married? You aren't going to propose... ever?
Me: No never. I'm glad you were the one I proposed to and I'm happy that I found the courage to take that step and make such a huge commitment. But no. It was a one-time thing. If you want to marry me, you'll have to propose.

I decided to see how things went and planned to give her till my birthday (July) to make her proposal or I would end it and move on. She did while we were hiking a trail back home. I accepted.

That's it for now. Am I making a huge mistake? Maybe. I'll get a prenup of course and protect my assets. If it ends it won't cost me more than a few hundred. Hopefully, I get many happy years from this. If not, I'll update the post.

Also, thanks for all the comments and support. Weird how much that meant. I also genuinely appreciated the people that objected to me ending things. It's the internet so I expect to hear nothing but "Dump her". Getting another more reasonable side to things was helpful.

Regards,
ZenMonkey

ANSWER: I shared this story with my fiancé and he had some smart input on this:  “I wouldn’t say it’s a dealbreaker, but I would tell her that’s my proposal. If she wants to get married, then it’s on her. She can propose at any time, but I wouldn’t do it again.”

We’re both sorry you’re in this situation now. It shows shallowness on her part. Hopefully she is mature enough to see the error of her judgment. Good luck!

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend (27M) has been treating me (23F) differently since he got his ancestry DNA results back...

A few weeks ago, my (23F) boyfriend (27M) got his results back from one of those ancestry tests. He's never been interested in his family history before but one of his friends bought him the kit for his birthday.

A few days after seeing his results (which were nothing special, about 95 percent European and mostly just from England, where we live) he really excitedly told me that he'd been messaged by a group of people about a shared relative. Apparently all of them have an ancestor in common (my boyfriend's great (x 10) grandfather that can be linked to royal lineage.

I was pleased and a bit amused that my boyfriend was so happy, especially since he seemed to be telling every single person he knows and he posted on facebook about it. However since then I've noticed some uncomfortable behaviours from him that is making me second guess our relationship.

1. He quit his job two weeks ago (accountant) which was very unexpected and something we hadn't discussed before now. He gets defensive when I try to bring it up and ask if there was something in particular that triggered it. He has only said that he doesn't believe the 9-5 life is right for him.
2. He has suddenly started insisted on using condoms when we have sex. We have been together three years and my birth control (the copper coil) has never been an issue for him before. My boyfriend has started saying it is not good enough as a form of contraceptive by itself, which would be fine, except he has started making a few comments alongside this about how I'm trying to 'steal his genes' and implying that I want his bloodline.
3. He won't kiss me in public anymore or touch me at all around his family, which he has explained by saying he doesn't like PDA anymore and it's embarrassing. He is fine touching me when we're alone however.
4. He has asked me to look into my family history by making a family tree to  go alongside his. It's not something I care about or want to pursue (my family are also immigrants so I imagine harder to track than his) but since I refused he has made jokes that I must be scared to find out that my family 'don't match up' to his. As a sidenote, by traditional standards my family are a lot better off and more 'middle class' than his although this has never affected our relationship.

We've generally had a really good relationship before now and there have never been any major communication issues or anything like that. I'm really confused as to what's going through his mind right now and I could use some advice. Thank you.

TL;DR: my boyfriend's behaviour towards me has gotten a lot worse since he discovered he has connections to royalty in his family tree

ANSWER: He sounds deluded, does his royal highness have a history of mental illness?

He will be rocking up with a few corgis before long.

Edit: thanks for the gold and sliver

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (25m) Wife and Kid Died During Childbirth, I Want to Skip My Brother's Wedding

I will make this quick and save most of you the trouble of reading a lot. I am a Lt in the military and I work as a pilot.

A few months ago both my wife of three years and our child died while she was giving birth. Everyone tells me how sorry they are, how amazing of a woman she was, how much of a great father I would’ve have been. I don’t like hearing it, I don’t want to know what I could have been, should have been, or would have been because it doesn’t exist anymore.

My brother is getting married later this summer and everyone is preparing for that. I’m really happy for them and both families. Plus it slowly took everyone’s focus off me and they can focus on the happier future. I was obviously going to be a groomsmen for him, was going to give a speech after the best man, and just tease him in front of his new wife and family. My wife was looking forward to it and so was everyone else. People say they like my speeches and toasts, and my wife used to joke that every time I talk the room gets quiet so everyone can hear what I say.

I just don’t think I’m mentally prepared to go to my brother’s wedding. I don’t think I’ll be ready in a few months either. I already texted him it’s hard for me to meet up with the groomsmen once a month when they go out to dinner and plan stuff out. Thankfully he understands due to my job but the reality is I just don’t want to be around it. It’s not out of hate or angry or sorrow, I just really want to be alone and focus on work. It’s the only thing that keeps me going. That rush I feel when I take off at full speed and push the throttle harder once I’m soaring. Twisting the stick and pushing my body to feel that high. It’s the drive and push keeping me going and takes my mind off my miserable life.

I’ve been thinking of asking my commander for a TDY or if I could deploy with another squadron during the summer. Just hoping I can give a valid excuse why I can’t go to the wedding. I promise I’ll pay my brother his wedding respects before and after the wedding, I’ll even go over to his place once he’s married and spoil them with gifts.

I know it’s a horrible thing to not want to go to my little brother’s wedding but I honestly can’t do it. Every day I wish something would just happen to me during a flight exercise or while I’m driving to work or even some accident at work. My brother deserves a better brother who won’t abandon his wedding and I’m sorry I can’t be that stronger older brother.

Would it really be that bad if I skipped out on his wedding?

ANSWER: When you start wishing for accidents, it's time to see a shrink.  The last time I was inpatient at a psych hospital, at least half the people in with me were military.  You're not alone, but you do need to ask for help.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (27M) fiancée (24F) has 'accidentally' lost/broken three engagement rings now... I'm starting to suspect she's doing it on purpose

I've (27M) been with my fiancée/girlfriend (24F) for three years now. I proposed a year ago, but it definitely wasn't out of the blue - she'd been not-so-subtly hinting at getting engaged for months at that point. Although we're both somewhat hot-headed, we generally have a good relationship and we occasionally only fight about small, normal things.

I know NOTHING about jewellery, but I spent a lot of time looking for the right ring to propose with. I talked to two of her closest friends to get their input, and in the end I spent around $4000 on the ring. When my fiancée saw it, she told me she loved it and I'm pretty sure she was telling the truth.

This January, my fiancée called me up in tears. She'd somehow lost the ring on her way home from work and she had no clue where it might be. I left work early to come help her search, but since she'd been riding the subway, the ring was long gone.

My fiancée was clearly distraught, so a few weeks later I dipped into my savings and bought her a different ring. It wasn't quite as expensive as the last, but it was from the same jeweller and still a good make. 

Around June, I noticed one day that it had been a while since I saw my fiancée actually wear her engagement ring. She went pale and confessed to me that she thought she'd taken it off before bed one night and now it was lost somewhere in our flat. This time we searched for days and I dug up half the floorboards looking for it, but the ring is (to this day) missing.

At this point, buying another ring was out of the question (too expensive) so I asked her if she'd rather either a) have a cheap replacement ring (under $50) until after we're married, or b) go without a ring for now. She chose option b. 

One day we were visiting my grandmother, who asked my fiancée where her ring was. When we told her it was lost, my grandmother was kind enough to give my fiancée one of her rings instead. 

My fiancée seemed delighted and everything was working out perfectly until this week. I came home to find my grandmother's ring on the table, looking almost unrecognisable. My fiancée cried and told me that she'd managed to step on the ring that morning hard enough to break it.

I took the ring to a jewellery repair service right away. Sadly they told me that since a few small stones are missing and the original fitting is warped, the ring will never really be the same. They also told me that they were certain someone stepping on the ring couldn't realistically cause this amount of damage.

When I got home, I brought this up to my fiancée and asked her if she was 100% sure she'd only stepped on the ring. She completely flipped and yelled at me asking if I was calling her a liar. I mentioned what the jewellery store said, and she started screaming about me only caring about money and the 'cost' of the rings. It's been two days and we've barely spoken, especially as she's only coming out of our bedroom for meals. 

TL;DR: my fiancée has lost two of her engagement rings and now she's broken a third. When I tried to talk with her about it, she exploded. Any advice on how to handle this?

ANSWER: A jeweler has just told you that damage didn't happen from it being stepped on

They have no incentive to lie to you

Don't let her gaslight you

QUESTION: [Update] I suspect my (31f) new boyfriend (32m) may be ftm transgender

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hzfn5h/i_31f_suspect_my_new_boyfriend_32m_may_be_f2m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Summary so far: Because of some medical information disclosed to me by him, I believed my new boyfriend was post-op transgender, ftm. You wonderful folks encouraged me to continue being supportive and open, and to let him come out to me at his own leisure.

Shortly after my original post, I sent him a text letting him know I was really into him and, short of rape, murder, or animal abuse, there wasn’t much he could tell me that would scare me away.

In person, our conversations were wonderful and deep and funny and flirty and fun. Then he’d go days and days without texting, calling, or anything.

I wrote this off as him being busy (he’s a first responder with a crazy schedule) and mostly just let it go. But something felt off.

I told him if he wasn’t interested anymore that was fine, and he could just tell me. Honestly, I can handle rejection pretty well. He got very defensive and asked where I’d get that idea. 

After a particularly bad storm blew through our area, I texted him to check in, make sure he and his family were okay, etc. I got a series of one word responses, and asked if everything was okay, or if I’d done something to upset him. He said no, he just had a lot on his mind. 

I told him that was fine, and that I understood, and that my anxiety was getting the best of me. I again said that if he needed to vent or talk or be distracted I was there for him. I also told him, though, that I just needed to know he was still interested in seeing me. 

I got no response. For hours. 

So I told him that was fine, and that I wished him the best, and that if he ever felt like he wanted to try again to hit me up. He sent me “Ok.” It really tore me up. I felt so close to him, and in person everything was so good. 

Flash forward a few days and I was talking to a friend about the situation. Turns out she knows him. When I mentioned his name, she interjected “GOD, NO!” much to my confusion. 

I’m at least the 3rd woman he’s done this with. Gets really close, really fast then basically drops off. So no clue what his issue is, but I’m sorry he doesn’t feel like he can trust me (or anyone else). That said, I can’t spend my life waiting for him to be ready. 

Oh well, easy come, easy go.

ANSWER: What a shitty situation, I’m sorry you were on that emotional rollercoaster. I will say that you sound like a very kind and caring person. You were thoughtful to figure out the best way to approach the situation you perceived you were in, and had it been what you thought, I think the person on the other end would feel comforted and assured that you were a safe person to disclose that information to. I’m sorry this guy sucks at life and you got duped, but there’s someone else out there that will really respect and treasure your thoughtfulness.

QUESTION: My fiancée’s sister(28F) told me she’s in love with me(27M) and my fiancée(28F) is just settling for me

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iodouw/updatemy_fianc%C3%A9es_sister28f_told_me_shes_in_love/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

My fiancée, “Nancy”, and I are getting married in December. We’ve been going through a small rough patch since late June, I felt like everything was okay, but we were just out of sync. We’ve been together for 2 years, and this has happened before and we just come out of it usually.

I have a very good relationship with my fiancées twin sister, “Peggy”. We hung out a lot before she introduced me to her sister, so I’ve known her longer and she’s one of my best friends and is probably the person that knows me the best other than my family and Nancy. She and her sister also have a great relationship. No resentment, no anger towards each other just sisterly love.

Saturday I received a string of messages from Peggy that were telling me to not marry Nancy. She told me she didn’t love me like she should and if we got married we’d be in a loveless sexless marriage. I told her I didn’t believe her. She sent me screenshots of messages between her and Nancy. I wish I hadn’t read them. She said that I wasn’t the love of her life, that I wasn’t her soulmate, that’s I was just a good option and would be the a good provider and great dad to her kids, that I was “nice guy that’d any girl would be lucky to have, but he’s not the one for me.”

I asked Peggy why she told me all of this and she said she’s my best friend and she loves me. She said she’s wanted me forever, but couldn’t come between me and her sister like that. She said she’d love me like a wife should, that she fantasizes about being with me intimately, and that I drive her crazy. She asked me to leave Nancy and come be with her.

I’m so confused. I don’t know what to do about anything. I feel like my life had been turned completely upside down. I don’t know where to go from here.

ANSWER: If you believe that your fiancee might feel this way (that she wasn't just venting dramatically, or that Peggy is nuts enough to fake the messages) then it's a red flag big enough to block the wedding aisle.

However, you still owe it to your fiancee to discuss what's going on before ending things, so at least you know what's going on. Maybe her story is totally different.

And most importantly, don't get into a relationship with Peggy without a year or two to cool down away from all of them and maybe find someone better for you who's not part of this messy family dynamic.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (36m) wife (33f) was sued, I'm feeling resentment towards her and I don't know how to move past it.

FWIW This is not a post asking for any legal or financial advice, we already have a lawyer and have help financially. No offense to reddit, but I’d rather not get any legal advice from a forum, but I’m okay getting relationship advice it seems. 

As the title states my wife was recently sued, she lost and we had to pay. The money is a significant amount for us, we didn’t have much in savings or our emergency fund to begin with, and both of those accounts are now empty. 

My currently problem is trying to move past the resentment and anger I’m feeling towards my wife. Until now I’ve always felt like we were a partnership in our marriage. But, since I’m the breadwinner I can’t help but to feel like I’m spending "my" money on something that isn’t my fault. I’ve had no problem paying the mortgage, and taking care of various financial burdens that come with being a married homeowner. However, I have been the only one to put money aside in our savings and other accounts to prepare for an emergency - like a totaled car, someone loses their job, medical bills, or an act of god… not a stupid lawsuit where I know my wife is guilty. She has a part time job and doesn’t make much money, but pays for smaller things when she can (like groceries and some random bills), but she does take care of a lot of cooking, cleaning and caring for our pets. 

What did my wife do? (Note: I had no idea this was going on while it was happening). 

She used linkedin to find her former ex best friend, she ended up creating a realistic looking fake linkedin profile with a vague occupation of ‘recruiter’. My wife ended up sending this ex-best friend, "Laura" a few messages pretending to be a recruiter in her line of work. Laura finally responded thinking that this recruiter was real, my wife wanted her phone number but Laura gave her a personal email address instead. My wife created a second fake linkedin profile and started to send messages to people with similar titles as Laura at her company. These messages said derogatory things about Laura, a mixture of truthful things but embarrassing and just fabricated bullshit to make Laura look bad. Her manager got one of these messages that claimed that Laura was a heavy drug user. Laura's manager talked to her about these messages and he felt like the messages were bizarre and seemed like someone was trying to troll or harass Laura. Well, Laura team had her back and helped her saved these messages. Not only that, but Laura requested that she be drug tested anyway, to provide further evidence that she was clean. My wife didn’t know this at this point, but Laura was pregnant. Several of her coworkers, including her manager testified on Laura behalf. 


Using the personal email address she got from the fake recruiter profile, she was able to find a few social media platforms Laura was on and was able to figure out her husbands name. She did some more internet sleuthing and found Laura's husband on facebook. Laura's husband didn’t have much on his facebook profile, but you could see his business email address on it. My wife sent him an email claiming that Laura was cheating on him. The husband confronted Laura about this email and Laura encouraged him to keep responding to this person, and save the messages, as well as to start asking specific questions about this supposed affair.  My wife thought she was being clever and ended up telling the husband that Laura was cheating on him during the work week, she even gave him specific dates. What she didn’t realize was Laura had something turned on in google maps where it keeps years worth of historical gps data. Some of the dates my wife gave him also happened to be days where they both worked from home together. She also ended up giving him dates during a time they were on vacation together. Laura had her husband keep responding as much as possible to my wife and to backup all correspondence. 


My wife was able to  find out when and where the baby shower was going to be. One of Laura friends had created a public registry for her and had the invitation online. My wife decided to show up unannounced (the baby shower took place in a semi-public place, they had rented out an area connected to the public business.) She did not make herself known immediately. Instead she looked for patrons that were entering and exiting the rented out room. She was able to get the attention of a few guests that had never met her and tried to gossip about Laura - my wife was telling people that Laura didn’t actually know who the father was, among other things. This was at an event where her husband was at as well. The word got back around to Laura and she spotted my wife and apparently immediately put together all the pieces of what happened. 


I’m leaving a fair amount of information out - My wife was able to find phone numbers, social media accounts and email for other people in Laura circle and sent them messages about Laura on multiple occasions. All the messages were trying to paint Laura in an extremely derogatory light. All the events I’ve mentioned so far took place over a year or so.  My wife didn’t think to mask her IP address, so it was pretty easy to find out that all of these made up messages came from the same IP address, ours. Many of Laura's friends and family testified on her behalf, Laura had everyone saved as much digital evidence as possible - and it was a lot. 


Laura and her husband hired a lawyer and decided to sue to my wife. They had ample evidence against her. All the saved messages, close friends and even her manager spoke on her behalf, she showed that she went to see a therapist once all the harassment started because she was depressed and anxious, she showed that she and her husband went to counseling after the accusations of her cheating. She even went above and beyond and had more drug tests done to show she was clean and my wife’s accusations were 100% false, and even had a paternity test done to show that my wife was again wrong and chose to lie. 


I honestly felt awful for Laura, there were lots of tears on her end. You could tell how much emotional stress she had gone through. She said that being pregnant during the majority of this was absolutely horrific and was worried the stress and anxiety would somehow hurt her baby. She was pained that her one and only baby shower was ruined by my wife and that was something that could never be truly repaid or made up for. And that my wife’s harassment continued even after Laura gave birth and was trying to manage a newborn child. 


My wife has never done anything this crazy before. I knew she could be a little petty and jealous of others, especially people she use to be friends with in the past, but it was only talk - no action. We’ve had a very happy marriage otherwise, we rarely fight, have a lot in common, we have a lot of fun together. But, she really fucked up this time. I don’t know how to move forward. I know someone is going to suggest therapy, but I really want to start building up an emergency fund again. We’re pretty screwed financially for awhile. 


tl;dr Wife was sued by her former best friend, I emptied out all of our savings and sold a few things to pay for everything. I need help managing my resentment towards my wife and to move past this. Funds are low and we can't afford therapy right now. What can we do to move forward?

ANSWER: That is absolutely not normal and your wife clearly has some serious issues that I think you (and she, obviously) need to start addressing.  That level of harassment, and the duration of it is frankly terrifying, and I feel like you should be concentrating on dealing with that, rather than just the financial fallout.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I(19M) overheard my brother(16M) saying he wanted to rpe a girl at his school. Our parents won't try to help him.

Let me start this off by saying I always loved my brother ever since he was born. He was my best friend until I went to middle school when we started to drift apart. He was always a shy, quiet kid but I have no idea where it went wrong. I think it was when he was about 13 when he started to lose his cheerfulness, started to smile less and adopted his brooding demeanor. He openly asked me how he could get a girlfriend and how he could become more popular at school since he was 10 or 11, but I think as he started to go down a negative spiral he began talking about how he got the "ugly genes" out of the two of us, about how girls at school don't "respect" him enough even though he treats them like a "gentleman" would, about how he feels like an "incel" all the time. I'm genuinely worried about him. I went through a phase during middle school/high school when I used to hang out with the wrong sort of kids and I regret not being there for my brother and neglecting him when he needed me. I want to reconnect with him but I'm afraid that my brother who I thought I knew is gone for good. He made two friends at school before covid started, and at first I was happy to see he was starting to return to his cheerful self again, but recently he's just been acting more strangely. He never comes out of his room anymore and I thought he was talking to himself in there until I realized he was having phone calls. About deranged thoughts of how society works and all that. Then he went into a rant about how he wants to rape a girl at his school and fantasizes about keeping her in our basement. What the fuck do I do at this point? I try to talk to my parents about him but all they say is that he's a lost cause and that they're going to kick him out when he turns 18. I can't help but feel like if I was there for him he would've turned out better.

ANSWER: Take as much time as you can and spend it with him, go see a film. Take him out with you and your mates, expose him to new stuff and to new people. 
Just hang out with him. He may reject it but just make sure you keep inviting him, if you can make the activities slightly on the naughty/cool side of things that'll help. What he needs is exposure to new view points and ways of seeing the world and a big brother can make a massive difference, mine did to me in my darkest times.

EDIT: thanks for my first award! What a time to be alive!

QUESTION: My (24F) boyfriend (24) said that I’m not allowed to criticise slavery because I’m white-passing. He said that I would’ve lived a “comfortable life” under slavery. We argued and now he’s giving me the silent treatment.

TL;DR I am biracial (Black/White) and my BF is white. We were discussing slavery and he said that I have no right to criticise slavery because I look racially ambiguous/white-passing. He said that I shouldn’t complain because I would’ve lived a good life in that era as a mistress of a slaveowner. I called him an ignorant idiot and now he’s so offended that he won’t speak to me. 

We’ve been in a relationship for four years and live together. For both of us it’s the first serious relationship and although it hasn’t always been easy, we’ve never had any significant problems. We are on the same page on most topics (racism, politics, finances etc) or so I thought at least. 

Now with all these issues going on we’ve been talking about race a bit more than usual. For the record, I’m biracial but I have what most consider “Eurocentric” features so a lot of times people can’t really tell where I’m from. 

Fast forward to a few days ago. We were watching 12 Years A Slave and I made some comments about how horrible slavery was. That’s when he dropped the bomb that I actually shouldn’t criticise slavery at all since I look white enough that I would’ve benefited from the system. (Honestly it felt like he wanted to say that for a long time). I asked him wtf he meant by that and he said me complaining about racism belittles the experience of black people. 

I told him that I wouldn’t have benefitted from slavery at all since I’m literally 50% black despite my looks. He said that even if I didn’t directly benefit, I would’ve lived a “comfortable” life in that era. I asked how and he said slaveowners kept mixed women as mistresses so I would’ve spent most of my time being treated well and “popping out white babies”. He made it sound like it was a complete luxury. At this point I was so appalled that I called him an ignorant idiot and we started arguing. 

He said that I’m just an “exotic looking white girl” who’s trying to feel oppressed and that I’m just as privileged as him. I told him that he really has no idea what he’s talking about and then he started ignoring me. We haven’t spoken for a few days (although he tried to initiate sex a few times and seems to be warming up to me again) and I really don’t know what to do. He’s never said something so ridiculous. I’m just so angry at his stupid comments and immaturity.

ANSWER: Yeah that was gonna be my comment. Everyone should criticize every form of slavery, because it's a fucked up thing that shouldn't exist at all. WTF.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I don't want to take part in my GF's (23F) sex ritual on our wedding night... but I still want to marry her

My post was capped because I didn't have a throwaway account but I'd like some advice:

So I'm (23M) getting married to my GF (23F) early next year if all goes to plan. I don't have a lot of family (I'm no contact with my dad for several years now.) She, however, has a huge extended family.

For the most part we get on great. They tend to be very loud and have huge personalities, which is sometimes hard for me to deal with since I've always been on the quiet side. But overall very warm and caring people.

Something weird I've noticed since we got engaged is that my GF's cousins sometimes make jokes about our wedding night. It's weird for them to joke about it since I'm pretty sure her family is aware we've slept together before since we share a bed at holiday gatherings and vacations.

A few nights ago we were discussing wedding plans and thinking about places to go on our honeymoon (if COVID-19 clears up and we can travel by then). My GF and I were brainstorming ideas when she tells me that we won't need a bridal suite right away. Obviously I ask why (we're getting married at a pretty nice hotel) and she says that she'd like for us to stay at her parent's house.

I don't really mind this - we're trying to save money for a house deposit anyway - but GF seems like she has more to say so I push for why she wants it. She tells me that there's a really old tradition in her family on the wedding night.

The husband and wife go into the master bedroom together and they are supposed to 'consummate' the marriage. The rest of the family are waiting outside the door so they can applaud them and cheer when they come out. Then a piece of the bed sheet is cut off and sewn into a big tapestry my GF's mother owns.

I think my GF saw I wasn't happy because she quickly told me that we wouldn't have to actually consummate the marriage if I felt uncomfortable and we could just pretend.

I don't want anything to do with this. I absolutely freaked and told her under no circumstances will I be doing that kind of thing in front of her whole family. When I came back from taking a walk to clear my head, she was now noticeably acting down and still is. I think she's also been texting her family about this because I received a text from her mother telling me that I 'don't understand the importance of family' and tradition yet and this kind of tradition has been around longer than I've been alive.

I don't know how I'm meant to go on from here. I really love my GF and she is the woman I want to spend my life with. I'm freaked out of course but she is my whole world. But how should I handle her family and navigate his 'tradition'?

TL;DR my girlfriend's family have a tradition where they stand outside the room on the wedding night. I still want to marry my GF but I don't want anything to do with this. Advice?

ANSWER: Tell them you'll do it, in return for a dowry of 100 head of cattle, a white stallion and a tract of arable land :)

================================================================================

QUESTION: My childhood "friend" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while I was sleeping. She told everyone and now my boyfriend is being ostracized from our friends. Except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place. [NSFW]

[UPDATE HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czqc2i/update_my_childhood_friend_went_through_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Throw away because of the sensitive subject matter.

So, there are three main players in the situation; my childhood friend, Sarah [31F], my long-time partner, John [34M], and myself [29F].

I've known that Sarah has had a crush on John for a long time. It's kind of an open secret in our group that no one talks about, but other than some longing looks and awkward interactions, Sarah has never crossed any boundaries. But because she does have this crush, she does stuff such as leaning over his shoulder to look at his phone screen and doing that playful shoulder slap that people do.

(My boyfriend and I had discussed it and decided, together, not to address it unless her crush became a problem since it seemed harmless.)

Apparently when she was doing that recently, she caught a glimpse of what looked like a photo of him having sex with me, so later, she went back and went through his gallery. 

Which is full of photos and videos of him having sex with me while I'm sleeping. She took photos with her phone and then went and told everybody - except me!!! - that my boyfriend is assaulting me in my sleep. She apparently showed them her "evidence" as well.

I found this out the next day when another friend messaged me, incredibly concerned.

Now people are threatening to go to the cops, trying to stage interventions, and someone even told my dad I'm being abused.

But here's the thing - it's my fetish in the first place, not his. He took the photos and videos for me. The day after our "sessions", he sends them to me so I can watch them because it's better than porn. 

But nobody believes me. They're accusing me of protecting my boyfriend and covering for a rpist. I don't know what to do. I'm scared that someone is going to call the police on him. 

How do I fix my friendships and convince everybody that I'M the one who wanted it? 

There is no text communication to exonerate my boyfriend, but I do have pages of internet history from my phone full of "limp porn" and sleeping fetish fantasy literature. I'm tempted to pull up my internet history and air my dirty laundry to fix this.

Please help. I'm so embarrassed, frustrated, and, honestly, really, really fucking mad.

Edit: since this needs to be said, YES, my boyfriend does have a passcode on his phone. It's a four digit code.

Edit edit: 

- yes, I know she isn't my friend, which is why "friend" is in quotes.

- I have three friends on my side with this, so it's not everybody. Just mostly everybody. I was upset and generalizing last night.

- I am in the US.

- my boyfriend DOES HAVE A PASSCODE on his phone. Seriously. Stop blaming him. This is definitely not his fault.

Edit AGAIN since people just wanna try to blame my boyfriend and I: we attended a BBQ where EVERYBODY left their phones inside. We thought we were in a trusted, safe place. 

You guys are being a little mean about this.

Edit (again): 

Went to the police and will update when I can.

## MINOR UPDATE 

I went to the police last night, alone. After everything that was said, I was nervous about having John with me, just in case my consent wasn't enough for them.

Really. Y'all made me nervous.

I went in and told the police that pornographic videos of me were taken from my boyfriend's phone by a woman and then distributed around to two dozen people.

At first, the officer at the window was like, "I think that's a crime? Maybe? I've gotta call my supervisor."

That happened twice before the police were like, Okay, this might be a civil suite, but we don't know. We're going to take an information report and send an officer to speak with her to ask her to delete the photos and videos. 

I gave my report and left. About fifteen minutes later, I got a phone call from the local PD. They told me that they thought my boyfriend might be the victim of a "sexploitation crime" based on my comments.

My comments being that Sarah has a vested interest in breaking apart my relationship to sexually pursue John and this interest was probably the reason she stole the videos in the first place.

They suggested finding a lawyer since law enforcement apparently has a shaky grasp on the laws in my state. Well, they told me that just in case it was a civil suite, I'd have a lawyer retained, and said lawyer could send a cease and desist.

So, that's about it. 

A bunch of hemming and hawing and I don't knows. They'll "attempt" to get the videos deleted, but cannot seize the phone without a warrant. 

I'm moving forward with both this and a social media announcement today.

ANSWER: How do you fix your friendships? Easy. Find new friends. 

This girl had NO business going through YOUR boyfriends phone. She sounds like a fucking creep. She saw a glimpse of sex so she went through his phone? WHAT THE FUCK??

How did she gain access to his phone? Is there a password?

Contact the police about her distributing porn. Get them to confiscate her phone. She took pictures/videos of the videos of you during CONSENSUAL intercourse. And then showed people.

this is fucking crazy. best wishes OP.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (26M) girlfriend (24F) found an engagement ring I was keeping safe for my friend until he was ready to propose. She thought it was for her and is furious that it wasn't.

I've been dating my girlfriend Laura for just over two years. We met as I was finishing my masters and she was in her last year of undergrad as we attended the same university. We have a pretty strong relationship overall, we get along well and have pretty similar views/goals in life, and I love her a great deal. She's definitely been the healthiest relationship I've ever had and I see a strong future with her. 

This weekend has been awful, however. My best friend Rob came to me about a month ago and told me that he had a plan to propose to his long term girlfriend Grace of about seven years. The problem was that they live together and she's a very clean person, and he was afraid she might find the ring while cleaning before he was ready to propose. I offered to hide it for him at my house until he was ready, and he handed it over. I hid it in the back of my sock drawer and honestly kind of forgot about it until last Monday when he asked for it back. He (successfully!) proposed to Grace yesterday, and she posted a picture of the two of them on her instagram with the ring clearly visible.

Literally five minutes after she posted, Laura rang me absolutely fuming. She told me she'd found that ring three weeks ago, so why had I given it to Rob for Grace when I'd clearly chosen it especially for her? Was Grace mocking her with her post, just rubbing her nose into the fact that she'd "stolen" her ring? I tried to talk her down and explain that I'd just been keeping it safe for Rob and that I'd never intended to propose to her with it but that only made her more upset and she starting screaming at me that I'd absolutely built up her hopes and just destroyed them. She hung up on me, then texted me that I had three months to propose to her with "a better ring than Grace's" or she's going to break up with me. 

Am I wrong for thinking this is a red flag? I know that she probably was really excited and I absolutely never meant to hurt her feelings with all of this, but the ring was never for her and she never should have known about it. We don't live together and I don't know what she was doing snooping in my drawers, or when she had the time to look in there, or what she was looking for her. More than that, I am 100% not ready for marriage. We've only been together for two years, haven't lived together, haven't even talked about marriage yet. I want to be living together for at least a year before we get engaged. 

What do I do? I totally understand why she'd be upset but I just feel like she's invaded my privacy by looking through my stuff, and that I'm being treated badly for something that was never meant as a snub towards her. This is the first big fight we've had and I'm not sure if I'm just seeing red flags because I'm hurt, or if they're really there. 

TL;DR: Girlfriend snooped and found a ring that I was keeping safe for a friend. She's angry that the ring wasn't for her, is demanding a proposal by Valentine's day or the relationship's off. Need help determining what my next move should be.

ANSWER: I think a brief period of irrationality might make sense. She handled things poorly and owes you an apology, but unlike other commenters, I'm not sure I'd tell you to run just yet. 

Ignoring the snooping bit, for a moment:

Your girlfriend finds a ring, and naturally assumes the ring is for her. (Why else would you have tried to hide it in the sock drawer?!) ^^So ^^you ^^didn't ^^lose ^^it, ^^obviously, ^^but ^^this ^^wouldn't ^^occur ^^to ^^her.

For a month, she does her best to play it cool, but her heart is singing. She's picturing the ceremony, who she'll pick as her bridesmaids, the dress she'll wear.

Maybe she tells some close friends they'll be bridesmaids. They tell everyone else.

They try to figure out the next dinner you've planned with her so they can get your girlfriend a manicure... for those instagram proposal pictures she's a little embarrassed to be so excited about.

She tells her mother, who tells the whole family, and everyone's buzzing with anticipation. Her parents, if you've met them, expect you to get in touch soon to ask their blessing.

She's surprised how cooly you play things. You don't seem to have made any fancy dinner plans you tell her about, but she senses there's something off in how you behave. She knows you're thinking about the proposal too, as well as you try and hide it. Maybe you mention a trip to someone's hometown or something. As she sees it, everything is to be analyzed.

She assumes this proposal is going to be in the next month or so, and any time you make plans she wonders what your real plans are.

She pictures what your children might look like. If you're moving into a new place together. What couch you'll buy in your new place— what you'll put on the registry.

Then. She's in line at the supermarket, or sitting in her car in the driveway, and she's thinking about you— about your relationship. She's felt lost since finishing her undergraduate program. Without those academic life-tracks, things feel a little free-form. And that's scary.

But now... things seem a little clearer. Of course marrying you makes sense. You're the best relationship she's ever had.

Imagine how crushing it must be— how tied in knots her stomach is— when she sees the ring— her ring— on someone else's finger.

For a month, she's had her whole life figured out. In a moment, everything is instantly gone. She zooms in on the ring in a cold sweat, and it feels like you've broken up with her. She's temporarily unable to process things in the most rational way.

She processes her grief the way many people do—In a textbook [stages of grief] (https://dz9yg0snnohlc.cloudfront.net/new-understanding-the-stages-of-grief-1.png) way.

As soon as the initial paralysis of shock wears off, she calls you.

She's clearly in Denial.

She refuses to accept the ring was not for her, so she grills you on why you gave it away. Her heart is beating through her chest. It doesn't make sense to her. There's no way it was for another girl, it was in your dresser!


Next up, we've got Anger.

In a classic frustrated outpouring of bottled-up emotion, she screams at you for ruining the life she's mentally been settling into for a month. She's got a dozen people she needs to lose her dignity in front of, and countless others through the grapevine. And why? Because of you. (It seems.)

Then comes Bargaining.

Seeking in vain for a way out. Like when Kevin, from The Office, spills his chili, and tries to sweep it back into the pot off the floor. Or when Kevin, from The Office, crushes a turtle and tries to glue it back together.

She's trying to piece back together this fantasy she's had for a month, compounded by family and friends, at all costs. Silly as it is— pointless as it is— she's determined it make this work. So she gives you a crazy ultimatum. Crazy enough to work? Well, you came here, so maybe.

She's probably working through depression right now.

&nbsp;

I think she's totally valid in grieving. Marriage is a big deal, and in a way, she's going through a change not similar to a breakup right now. 

I don't think she's valid in directing it at you. She snooped, and she got her punishment for it. A bigger punishment than she was expected, and a punishment that came completely out of her own actions.

Moving forward, I think you should treat this as though she's grieving over something entirely unrelated to you, because she is. (Though she doesn't seem to know it.)

Hopefully, with a little time, she'll cool off, rescind the ultimatum, and be deeply apologetic. And then you can cautiously move forward in the relationship.

If she doesn't apologize, for snooping, for her behavior over the phone, for everything— then I say run.

================================================================================

QUESTION: The way I (21f) met my boyfriend (20m) is a bit cringy. How do i tell people when they ask

So I met my boyfriend a year ago. I posted on my cities subreddit that I was lonely, i liked videogames and wanted to meet somebody.

I got about 50 messages all together. One guy responded that he liked fallout new vegas. I love that game so we exchanged messages about the game. I gave him my number and we texted all night. Our first phone call was over an hour.

He told me he was also lonely. I mentioned how i wanted a cuddle badly. He offered to cuddle me. We decided to have a cuddle date

We met up the following week. He picked me up from my local cafe and took me to his. We got into bed and cuddled for 3 hours.

That's how we met. I know it sounds a little cringy, but to me it wasn't. People have asked how we met and I've told the truth, though an abbreviated version, and people tend to give me a weird look.  I don't want to lie, but is there a way to say it without it coming across cringy?

ANSWER: Just tell people you met on the internet. It’s actually way more common now. I know of a couple who got married after playing World of Warcraft for years. Online social networking is a big part of our modern culture. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about.
You don’t have to tell people you cuddled the first time you got together if that’s the concern. You went out for coffee, got a long, the rest is history.


Edited to add: holy shit you guys really love the internet loving!

It’s 2019 guys, if you’ve found love, no matter how, and people AREN’T rooting for you, they suck!

================================================================================

QUESTION: Update: I (25F) agreed to be a surrogate for my sister and her husband (late 30s), but am regretting it now

Previous post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fve0oj/i_25f_agreed_to_be_a_surrogate_for_my_sister_and/

All the comments on my previous post showed me that I am way too young, dumb and ignorant with what I signed up with. I started researching actual lived experiences and I read so many horror stories that I've decided to not go ahead with being involved in any way, shape or form with helping them have kids. 

In fact, I'm not even sure if I want to ever get pregnant after all the stories about 3rd and 4th degree tears, poop, miscarriages. I am clearly not in the right stage of life/maturity to even consider doing something of this magnitude.

The difficult part was mustering up the courage to call my sister to tell her my decision. I really look up to my sister and love her lots, and our family and religion has always been about helping others out where we can. 

When I called her to tell her, we had a short convo at first where I basically said "sorry, can't do it but that doesn't mean I love you any less". She seemed sad but said she was happy to respect my decision and I thought that was it.

Then just last night, sister & BIL called me back over zoom. My sister was crying and begged me to reconsider, as both of them really wanted biological kids. BIL told me that they were really disappointed in me and hoped that I would find it within me to do this. When I told them my concerns, my BIL just said pregnancy & motherhood is a beautiful and natural process and that I was made for this. 

I'm SO glad I did this over video call instead of in person, because I just hung up on them and faked having connection problems. I've been ignoring their texts so far and frankly I don't know what else to say. 

But any way, thank you all from the bottom of my heart for opening my eyes :)

Edit 08/10: https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRAFE/comments/i777j0/an_update/

ANSWER: I would really like to know how they justify him wanting to sleep with you to concieve the child. And don't sorry about it. A loving sister would've never even put you in this position.

================================================================================

QUESTION: UPDATE: My [20] fiance's [27m] behavior while online gaming is destroying our relationship

I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu4pbd/my_20_fiances_27m_behavior_while_online_gaming_is/) a few weeks ago as I felt my fiance's behavior around video games had started to spiral out of control. A lot of the comments mentioned red flags like age difference, his other 'vices' like drinking and drugs, the fact that he might get violent with me, etc.. 

I spent a few days thinking about what others had said, and ended up reaching out to my cousin who I am quite close with and telling her a watered-down version of events. She expressed some concern and agreed that I should speak with fiance's brother. Fiance continued acting the same (no surprises there)in terms of gaming, with the yelling and late nights. That Sunday (several days after posting here) he became very upset because I went out to lunch with a few girls from school and he called me 4 times because he wanted me to pick up a takeout pizza and a case of beers and was upset and yelling at me, accusing me of being selfish because I didn't leave my girls lunch to get them. I got them on the way home and was met with accussations of being selfish and even cheating because I was 'late' and the beer was the wrong kind. I just shut down and went into the bathroom and cried for a while. I knew that something really needed to change.

The next day fiance left for work and I left for school just as usual. I called fiance's brother during my break between school and work and I basically told him that I had noticed some concerning behavior around the video games and that I was worried that it might spiral like the drugs and alcohol had. Fiance's brother pretty much agreed and stated he thinks fiance has an 'addictive personality' and might need some kind of professional help for this. Then, to my shock, he told me that fiance was at his house and asked if I wanted to speak with him. I was extremely taken aback because fiance was meant to be at work. I hung up with fiance's brother and called fiance's workplace. I was extremely nervous and felt like I was doing something sneaky and horrible, but I needed to know what was going on. I spoke with his manager and learned that he had QUIT his job weeks ago!! He told his manager his dad had a medical emergency and he had to move across the state to take care of him. WTF! So I guess he would just leave the house and fake going to work on the days he said he was working. After work I went home and fiance was gaming. I told him that we needed to talk and he tried to shut me down because he was in the middle of a match. He finally agreed to mute the game so he could hear me. I was literally shaking at this point and told him that I was worried about his gaming destroying the relationship. I said that I was seeing a pattern with the pills, the drinking, and the gaming. I said that I was worried about going through with the marriage when he treats me like a servant and is so disrespectful towards me and our apartment. At this point he unmuted the game and started ignoring me again. So I did something stupid and stood in front of the TV and said that I knew about him quitting his job to game all day. He FLIPPED OUT. He got violent and pushed me away from the TV. There was a lot of hitting and kicking (hit me with the controller). I got outside and was standing in the wet pavement with socks on for an hour or so as he locked the door behind me. He eventually came and apologized. He offered to get uber eats and watch a movie. I literally felt sick. I locked myself in the bathroom and just cried and looked at my county's domestic violence help page. He literally just kept gaming until I went to sleep.

The next day I couldn't go to school because I had a bad black eye, it was not something I could explain away. I wanted to just disappear. I got on the bus and went to the women's center. My cousin met me there and she was speechless at how bad I looked. I was very adament that I don't want to press charges or anything, I just needed help with the next steps of getting away. The social worker there was so nice and helpful, and didn't judge me at all. She helped me figure out how to get my stuff out of the apartment (cousin's husband and his friend went) and sat with my while I drafted and sent fiance a text stating that I cannot be with or marry someone who treats me this way. He called me nearly 20 times during the time I was at the center. I didn't answer the phone and the social worker encouraged me to block his number. For the short term I am staying with my cousin and her husband and I'm working on finding an apartment. Next month I'm meeting with a counselor who treats people who have escaped domestic violence through the center. I still feel hurt, sad, confused, and like I'm living in a nightmare. But for the past week or so I haven't been screamed at, sworn at, or had any of my things broken. I've also gone to bed before 11 every night. Someone on here sent me a PM saying that they thought fiance's behavior would escalate to him hurting or even killing me and they were right, so I'm just glad I was able to get away when I did. 

I don't expect this to get a ton of attention but pretty much no one in my real life knows how bad it was and I just wanted to put this out here.

ANSWER: Take a picture of the black eye.  Keep it for the future, if you're ever feeling nostalgic, to remind yourself how he was willing to hurt you.

Update 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gva7x5/update_im_31m_just_finding_out_that_my_wife_31f/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share


The morning when she got home, her phone received a notification when she was sleeping. The messages were from an old college crush. Apparently she has been meeting him for sex instead of visiting her sister. This has been going on for over a year. She has met at his place, and our place. They were also emotionally involved. She asked him for more sex than she did with me our entire marriage. She managed to meet with him, whenever I was away at work, or with my friends. I confronted her, and she tried to lie about everything. I backed her in a corner with evidence, and she eventually came clean. She cried, and  tried apologizing serveral times, but I left the house. I had small suspicions over the years, but thought I was just being paranoid.

 We haven't had sex since we've been married, and have been through counseling. Everything was great in our relationship otherwise. There was nothing wrong with her sex drive, she just enjoyed sex with other guy, and coming home to  paid bills. I am so depressed and angry. I did everything I could to be a great husband. I didn't deserve any of this. This will most likely cause trust issues in my future relationships.

Edit: We have no kids or own property together

ANSWER: This might seem like a small consolation, but there's a good chance her 'relationship' with this dude is going to fall apart now that their secret is out. If he actually wanted a real relationship with her she would have left you by now. Soooo, she's going to lose both of you. Because she fucking sucks. I hope she's miserable.

Sorry this is happening to you but you're going to be better off in the long run for having found out now. Before having kids with this horrible person.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My mum dumped my siblings on me and ghosted. I have no idea what to do.

Yeah. This is a doozy. I've been trying to post it since it happened but just haven't really been able to process it. 

So I'm 23M, and I'm the oldest of five siblings, the others are 16M, 14F, 10F and 10M. Our mother is severely bipolar but very resistant to treatment and, to be frank, is an absolutely shit mother. I've done my best my whole life to raise my siblings since she clearly isn't going to, and I like to think I've done quite well. I managed to keep them out of the Care system most of the time, at least. 

Two years ago, I finally moved out of my mum's house and started university. I stayed in the same town incase the kids needed me, but I decided I had to start putting myself first a little bit and I couldn't keep putting off my own life because my mum is a failure as a parent, you know? With the exception of a few minor incidents, it's actually gone rather a lot more smoothly than I thought thus far. I currently have a house with two other students from my uni, though one is currently back in her hometown for the lockdown. 

So, the problem. Yesterday, there was a knock on the door around noonish. I wasn't expecting anyone but figured maybe it was the postman or my flatmate had ordered out for his lunch or whatever and opened it. To my shock, all four siblings are stood on the doorstep looking about as confused as I felt. 16yo informed me that Mum had dropped them off here without saying why or where she was going, and she was in the middle of a pretty intense manic episode and was just sort of rambling nonsenically instead of answering any questions. Of course I wasn't going to abandon the kids  so I let them in and have been trying desperately to get hold of mum ever since. I know she's getting my texts because I've been sending them on WhatsApp and it's showing me she's reading them. Also, when I call, it's ringing two or three times and then cutting out so she's clearly seeing the calls coming in and rejecting them, rather than it ringing out. I've tried reaching out to her friends with very similar results. 

I don't know what to do. I don't have the space for 4 kids in the house and it's so unfair to my housemate (though bless his soul he's an absolute angel of a guy and keeps telling me not to worry and he's fine with it). I currently have the girls staying in other housemates vacant room (with her permission) and the boys are in my room with me. Obviously not ideal. I also frankly can't afford to take care of 4 kids all by myself. No idea what groceries are gonna look like from here on out. The kids haven't brought many belongings with them, so they don't have many clean clothes. 16M and probably 14F can get away with wearing my clothes if it comes to it, but I have no idea how I'm gonna clothe the twins if they're here for more than a few days. I don't want the kids going into the system if I can avoid it, I've had too many traumatic experiences with it myself. Can anyone wiser and calmer than I am offer some advice on what my options are here?

ANSWER: Call CPS, your siblings have something you didn’t have when you were part of the system. You. 

CPS will see an adult sibling as a godsend. If you can point out what you would need to care for them until your mom can be brought back out of her manic episode, they will probably try to provide it. 

That might include mom in medical care and you taking the kids home and caring for them there along with financial assistance to cover for groceries. Nothing special, but the goal isn’t for you to become a parent, the goal is for your mom to get treatment. 

Focus on giving the CPS a solution that makes sense.  

Good luck.

Update: mother of goodness this comment blew up. Thank you everyone for the awards. I hope OP can find the help he is seeking and that he and his siblings do well.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Update: My[M25] girlfriend[24] of 1.5 years broke up with me to be with my roommate[M25]. I just heard them through the wall.

It's been about a month since my post, unfortunately the mods deleted it from /r/relationships. I don't know if this one will be allowed but I figured I'd give an update to my situation. 

Original Post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ykrq1/mym25_girlfriend24_of_15_years_broke_up_with_me/

> As the title says, we broke up. It was about 6 months ago and it was semi-amicable. We broke up because she was developing feelings for my roommate. Admittedly they are more compatible and he's an upgraded version of me, so I can see why it happened.
> 
> This isn't an evil thing, both asked my permission to start dating and don't do any PDA while I'm around. I still both consider them friends and I just want them to be happy.
> 
> For the most part, they are quiet at night. If I really listen I can hear whats going on, but they generally save it for when they are alone. Except for last night. We went out to the bar for his birthday and they got pretty drunk. I was the DD because I don't really drink. Anyway, last night we got home at close to 2am and all went to bed. I made sure they both got into bed, put water, advil, and buckets out just in case. I then put sleeping bags out for the other people and did the same. As I was brushing my teeth my ex walked in, hugged me and said she was sorry. She thanked me for always begin so nice and she promised to help me find a new girlfriend when I was ready. When I finally got to bed I could head muffled talking, mostly about how great the night was. Then it got quiet and then it started.
> 
> I don't know how long it lasted, but it was louder than normal. I've been okay with the break up until now, I'm glad they're happy but last night I fell asleep crying.
> 
> I woke up this morning, made breakfast for everyone and started to clean up.
> 
> Feel free to ignore this, I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm sad when I really think about the situation, but that's why I try not to.
> 
> TL;DR: My ex and roommate are sleeping together and they were loud last night.

Taking everyone's advice I announced that I was going to be moving out. My now ex-roommate pulled me aside and asked if it was because of his relationship. I told him yes, but I'm not going to make him sacrifice his happiness just for me. He decided to help me look for a new place and we found one. It's a one bedroom apartment that is closer to my work. My landlord is XRMs(ex-roommate) family friend, after XRM explained the situation I ended up getting a slight discount on rent for the first year. 

XRM and XGF and a few other friends helped me move in. I had a house warming party and was specifically asked that I not prepare anything. 7 people came over with dinner, desert and booze. XRM and XGF also cleaned up after everyone finished eating. My XGF stayed a bit later than everyone and apologized for putting me through everything. She said she didn't really think about how it made me feel. She told me that she's talked to a few friends about finding me someone and that she had set up a blind date for me. It was great. We've gone out a few times since our first date. 

The past few weeks have been the best in a long time, I never really realized how bad my situation was. Obviously everything isn't perfect, and I still have to work on my self esteem and standing up for myself but I'm in an infinitely better position than before.  

TL;DR: I moved out and started dating a new girl.

ANSWER: If it's in the wrong sub or gets removed I just wanna say I'm glad you found happiness. You sound like a truly nice person and I wish you many a good karma +1

QUESTION: UPDATE - I (27F) have romantic and confused feelings for my coworker (30F). We have more or less been living together since COVID started and she is openly gay. I don't know if i am, and i am terrified i will lose my only friend if i mess this up.

Here was my original post: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/itnt00/i_27f_have_romantic_and_confused_feelings_for_my/)

I wanted to say thank you all you guys gave me a push to try something that I was on the fence about. For the first time in a long time I feel happy and content. I managed to sort my feelings out and realized that this is what I want.

We went on a few dates, and it went well, nothing huge since we are both leery of COVID. But I was able to present myself as her girlfriend, to her circle of friends and I had no issues with that. Most of her friends were very supportive.

Last night I pretty much told Laura everything I had said in my reddit post, and she fully accepted what I said, and seemed happy. I am also really glad I told her because apparently after the cottage she felt that I was not interested in her as anything more then a friend, and was going to move on emotionally.

She also has given me a drawer, a copy of her house keys, and a toothbrush and has told me I can stay there whenever I want, and if I really wanted to I could just move in since we have basically been living together almost since COVID started.

I will be honest I also realized that I don't know a whole lot about Laura, and she was completely comfortable telling me anything and everything. Which made me feel very comfortable.

We also talked about work, and she said she is going to transfer to a different team, just to avoid any complications from that.

I also told my parents about what is happening, and my mom was okay with it, however my dad was extremely supportive, and told me it didn't matter I am his daughter and that is all that matters.

The only thing still bothering me revolves around intimatcy/sex, which are things I don't know about. I told Laura about my confusion around that and she has assured me not to worry and when the time comes it will be fine.

I am probably rushing into stuff too much, but I feel happy for the first time. So thank you for helping me reddit.

TL;DR; I am finally able to find happiness, and it is working out. So thank you reddit

I need to sleep, but i will answer what i can tomorrow thank you for all the positive comments, it feels great.

ANSWER: Laura wants to take it slow because you are new to these feelings, she is doing the right thing. There is no need to stress about sex all the time, you should only start when your ready. And even when ready make sure to take a slow to make sure you are comfortable.

QUESTION: (UPDATE) My Roommate's (21F) Parents keep letting themselves into my (21F) apartment with the spare key my roommate gave them.

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bl31eh/my_roommates21f_parents_keep_letting_themselves/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

RM= roommate's mom   R=Roommate

I came back from my morning run around 7 am this morning, and RM and R were in the kitchen making some coffee. She has never been there this early before. 

I decided to talk to them about everything prior to going to class. I atarted off with "hey auntie, can we talk?" (In brown culture everyone is called an aunt) and these are some points I listed:

1. I appreciate that she has been cooking and cleaning, but I want to do that on my own. I love to cook and felt that I was never allowed in my own kitchen. I also told her that I want to do my own laundry and clean my room myself. 

2. I don't want her in my room. I reminded her that I talked to her about this when it first happened, and that's why I put the lock on the door.

3. I told her that if she wants to be with R, to let R text me and lmk that RM would be in the apartment. 

They expressed understanding and I hugged it out with RM. 

Before going to class, I put a load of laundry. My friend is having a birthday dinner today, and I decided to wear this cute white dress with an open back (my mom even got me this dress since she thought it was so cute) and tossed it in the washer so it could be fresh for tonight. I asked RM multiple times if she was planning on doing laundry today, and she said no. I told her that I would be back around 1, and she can do laundry when I finish mine later this afternoon if needed (I didn't want her touching my clothes). She was okay with it and said R didn't have laundry today. Cool. I left feeling really relieved, but I still locked my bedroom door. 

I got back to my apartment about half hour ago, and I couldn't find my white dress. As soon as I came home, R looked nervous. My clothes were in the dryer, and I didn't do that for a fact. RM states that I put them in the dryer and just forgot. Ughhh. I locked myself in my room, and I know she probably took the dress as it was something she wouldn't approve of.

When I was in my room, I heard RM talking to R in our language, she told her daughter something along the lines of "idk why she's freaking out about that dress. In India, escorts and prostitutes wear those kinds of clothing." And she went on to tell R that I won't find a husband wearing stuff like this.

I honestly think she wanted me to hear all that.  is she is seriously just being a passive aggressive bitch to me rn? I'm trying so hard not to break down and cry. 

I'm heading over to my parents right now and I'm telling them everything when they come back home tonight. I'll keep you posted.

UPDATE 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bm1ivc/update_2_my_roommates_21f_parents_keep_letting/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

ANSWER: Yeah, that’s a “your mom’s key is revoked” kind of situation. Not to say her mom is banned from the place, but she just can’t come in and make herself at home at her leisure. It’s not her house.

Definitely tell your parents, they will probably have more luck discussing this with the mom than you have.

================================================================================

QUESTION: [Update] I [M 32] ruined Christmas and I have no regrets.

I wanted to update the kind people who took the time to give me advice and affirmation last Christmas when I really needed it. I wanted to provide an update how Christmas and the year went.

ORIGINAL:  ([Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9jdy7/i_m_32_ruined_christmas_and_i_have_no_regrets/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf%EF%BF%BC)) Long story short.. I’m half-Korean and half-white. My white family has always been rude to my mom and treats her as an outsider. Every year my mom brings gifts for everyone and gets nothing in return. She never causes drama but gets treated like crap and I think it’s because of their own biases. My white grandma is 80 and the last grandparent alive. She is the only reason we get together with them. After 32 years I finally blew up on a rude family member (my aunt) who disrespected my mom... with a few expletives. I blew up in front of the whole family demanding that the behavior needs to stop. My actions ended Christmas because everyone left quickly after. I felt liberated for standing up for something I’ve been feeling for years. Last year I was looking for advice on how to manage the fallout of what I did. 

UPDATE: The year has been interesting.. Immediately after Christmas I sent an apology letter to my aunt. It went against some advice but my letter requested to not let the situation impact the family. I left the lack of any relationship in her hands and shared everything can change if she gives my mom a little more respect. I decided to send a letter because she lives three hours away and I’ve never spoken to her on the phone more than 30 seconds. I didn’t think a phone call would help or fix the situation, especially after I blew up.

After Christmas I apologized to my grandma for what I did. I let my grandma know I sent an apology letter to my aunt. My grandma told me she is and always wants my mom to feel like she is part of the family. I could tell my grandma was on the verge of crying when she said that. My grandma told me blowing up was not ok but understood why I did it. Hearing that felt really good. 

In regards to the letter. I got no response. My aunt denied ever getting it. We know my aunt got the letter because when my grandma confronted her about last Christmas my aunt went into a rant about several things I mentioned in my letter. My grandma did tell my aunt what she did was wrong and she needed to change. 

In February my aunt didn’t come to my Grandmas 80th birthday party. She told other family members she didn’t want to “cause an argument” so she didn’t want to come. My aunt didn’t come to my grandma’s on Mother’s Day dinner because she supposedly had to work. My family didn’t get together the rest of the year. 

Thanksgiving and Christmas came. Things are not perfect but Thanksgiving and Christmas went really well this year. I was going to post after Thanksgiving but the gathering was smaller than usual and I wanted to see how Christmas went. During Thanksgiving and Christmas everyone was very kind to my mom. It felt like everything shifted. Everyone spoke to her differently and it feels really good. My mom got to help in the kitchen for the first time ever. I know that sounds dumb but my mom has always wanted to help cook because she loves to cook. It was the first time she didn’t spend the whole day in the living room.

At one point during Thanksgiving my mom asked me to help her dry dishes. While we were washing/drying dishes my mom was smiling the entire time. At one point my mom stopped putting dishes away and randomly hugged me. We laughed and had fun the entire time. No one argued. No nasty remarks. My mom was treated as an equal and it felt really good.

In regards to the aunt that I yelled at last year. She came late to Thanksgiving.  So late, we were eating when she arrived. At Thanksgiving my mom did initiated the first interaction with my Aunt. She was not very conversational but polite to my mom. My aunt didn’t look at me the entire time. When she arrived I went to say hello and she turned away and kept her distance the entire time. She basically stated in a different room the entire time. She also left early and was the first to leave. The best part? I don’t care. I apologized and left future in her hands. If she treats my mom well she will get nothing but respect in return.

Christmas was as if nothing happened. My aunt didn’t really talk to me but she was incredibly nice to my mom. I’m ok with that. Both my parents said they have never seen my aunt so nice before. My mom got to help in the kitchen just like Thanksgiving. This year for the first time it felt like my mom was an equal in the family. Everyone was incredibly nice. No arguments, snide remarks or drama. I regret yelling but it changed everything. I think it put everyone on notice they need to change.

There was a lot of questions and comments about my dad. The comments was hard to hear but true. It helped me reflect on what my dad has/hasn’t done. The truth is my dad has been the glue of the family for years.. he spends so much time being the middle man and trying to repair issues. At times it’s been at the expense of my mom. Regardless, my dad’s lack of actions over the years doesn’t make it right. Over the summer I told my dad what I felt. I told him that I was disappointed in him and that his family has never been kind to my mom. I told him he should have done more. My dad didn’t take it well but he told me I did the right thing. My relationship with my dad is complicated. I know though I’m not going to make the same mistakes he has. We are different people and I will do whatever is needed.

If you’re reading this and have a similar situation. If you have people or someone rude in your family, try to take a moment to sit someone down. Hear them out and try to do the right thing from the start. When you have the convo, stay calm. If they are not willing to hear you.. then make it known. Blowing up could have gone either way and I’m lucky it fixed things. Try to loop in other family members before or after so they understand your reasons and can back you for your choice. My post last year gave me affirmation what I did was right, follow your heart.. it might fix years of issues.

TLDR: Last Christmas after witnessing years of rude behavior towards my Korean mom I blew up on a my aunt in front of the entire family. I demanded the behavior need to stop... with a few expletives. After I blew up it ruined Christmas. I tried to take the high road and apologize. The year was quiet and My aunt avoided the family until Thanksgiving/Christmas. Everything with my family has shifted and my mom is treated really well for the first time that I can remember. I’m glad I did what I did. Thank you for the advice.


[Update: 2021] Because of COVID, my grandma is in her 80s, and in declining health, we don’t do Holidays together. In early 2021 My brother and SIL moved back from Korea during COVID in 2020. We made Christmas amazing. My SIL is from Korea and we made Christmas amazing for her. We make her a full member of our family. We haven’t even seen my fathers side. Now we do Christmas with just my parents, no extended family. My parents cook Thanksgiving and Christmas together. I feel bad my Grandma celebrates with only one aunt (who looks after her). In some ways I’ve come realize she contributed to the dynamics too.

I truly love the holidays now. I’m now seeing someone and our families hang out. In some ways my mom gets to be the head female for the family, she doesn’t have to hide anymore.

ANSWER: That was nice to read. Glad your mom finally feels like part of the family! Good for you for standing up for her. Yelling may have made things tense at the time, but something had to be done and you handled it well otherwise.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (36M) think my wife of 8 years (31F) is having an affair with our couples therapist (42M)

Throw away for obvious reasons.

So my wife and I have been having some communication issues for about a year or so and started to see a marriage counselor about 7 months ago.  At first it’s good and we start communicating better.  

About three months ago she starts going to extra sessions for “self care”. Alone.

Around this time our couples sessions that happen with all three of us together (about three months ago) become much more one sided with me being the “bad guy” and the two of them kind of teaming up on me.

She starts telling her friends about “Danny” and how great he is for her “self care” but if her friends seem interested in making an appointment she says “he only does couples” or “he’s not taking new clients”which I think is weird because we have normally referred to him as “Dr. Soandso” and now he is suddenly “Danny”.  (I don’t know if he is actually not taking new clients.)

Around the time they started teaming up on me in the sessions (about three months ago) was around the last time my wife and I were intimate.

There have been a couple of other weird coincidences that I thought were puzzling, but three nights ago my wife said she had an emergency with her sister and had to go see her right away.  She went to the bathroom and showered and put on perfume and left.  It was about 9;30 at night and that seemed REALLY odd to me.

About a half hour later I tracked her iPhone and the location showed up as his office.

When she came home 3 hours later, I asked how her sister was and she kind of gave a weird “oh you know Jenny, drama queen” kind of answer.

I think I’m going to confront them in the session this Thursday.

ANSWER: [EDIT] I'm not here to "stick it" to the wife or lover, if my post conveyed that and you took it to be a reasonable attitude it is not. [EDIT]

Do not confront them.

Do not let them know you suspect anything.

Consider the advice from u/der_takin_ma_ and follow that logic; your therapist is not going to lose their job for you if they can help it.

Consider all the awful places this could go and your only proof seems to be a hunch.

It's their word against yours, and they're already risking their career if they're having an affair.

Report your therapist, hire a private investigator, and protect yourself by taking note of any strange occurrences and putting away a savings your wife can't access.

Do this now.

[EDIT] OP seems to have taken the self-destructive path, so I will now update this comment with good suggestions from other users.

u/mister_brain - It’s much more effective if his lawyer hires the P.I. or reports the therapist. 

u/FluffyFunnyCat - It's only hiding assets if he doesn't disclose them during divorce proceedings. You're allowed to have your own accounts, you're just not allowed to lie about them in court. She still may be entitled to half, depending on where they live and other variables. Now if he  started spending it on frivolous things or giving the money away to drain their accounts out of spite or malice, then yea she could definitely sue him for her share. - [This was in response to a query as to the legality of putting aside some money. Also brought up by u/GBAPSDANN and u/Shirobon-] 

u/YourTherapistSays - Only that she lied about a session - not objective in the sense that they’re having an affair. 
We obviously don’t have all the facts here - were individual sessions offered to OP as well? Is it possible OP is abusive and therapist is working with the spouse to create a safety plan for leaving? A stretch given the provided info but also not uncommon. We just don’t know. 
It’s important to remember there are three sides to every story: my side, your side, and the truth. - [Response to a claim the late night session was proof positive. There are so damn many variables in life, this is a healthy attitude to adopt in general.]

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I (F27) tell my boyfriend (M29) that I'm not going to cancel my birthday dinner? Am I wrong for not wanting to cancel?

For context: My boyfriend loss his previous girlfriend to cancer in 2016. I'm his first relationship since she passed away.  In a sad coincidence, my birthday and the anniversary of his previous GF passing away are the exact same date. We have been together for 10 months so this is the first of my birthdays since we got together.

My birthday is next weekend and as every year my parents want me to visit them for my birthday and have dinner together with my grandma. I'm only child and so is my mom, so I'm grandma's only grandchild, so they always insist in celebrating my birthday together even thought I'm an adult and I live in another city.

When I told my boyfriend about my plans and asked him to visit my parents with me he got mad at me for planning  a birthday dinner with my parents on the same date his GF passed away. I felt like an idiot for not thinking about that, and I felt bad so I told him he didn't have to come if he didn't felt comfortable going to a dinner in that date, that I was going alone.

He still got mad at me for planning to leave him alone in that date. He insisted I cancelled the plans with my parents. At first I felt really bad thinking about leaving him alone in what is a hard day for him, so I agreed to cancel the dinner. But later when I was about to call my parents to cancel it I decided  against it. My grandma is 95 years old, I don't know for how much longer she is going to be with us, and I don't want to regret cancelling a chance to see her because I don't see her very often and she would be heartbroken if I cancel.

Besides my birthday and her anniversary are obviously going to fall on the same date every year, so if I accept cancelling now he might expect me to do that every year and I don't want to stop celebrating my birthday.

How do I tell my boyfriend I change my mind about cancelling my birthday dinner without making it look as if I don't care about his feelings? Also, am I wrong for not wanting to cancel, I know that day must be horrible for him.

&#x200B;

Edit: I didn't expect this post to have such a huge response. I'm still reading the comments, but thank you for all your inputs.

Edit 2:

1. My birthday is on March 1st, not Feb 29 (that would be cool, but i wasn't even born in a leap year).
2. I could try to re-schedule, I'm 100% sure my grandma is available every day, but I don't know about my parents, they have quite a busy schedule. Besides, it's easiest to meet up on a Sunday than any other day.
3. I know my boyfriend was seeing a therapist for some time to deal with all of these, but this was before I met him.
4. Yes, the age gap between my grandma and I is quite big. I was born in 1993 and she was born in 1924. Both her and my mom were mothers in their late 30s, hence why both my mom and I are only childs.

&#x200B;

ANSWER: It’s only been 10 months you’re together. I’d go see your family. How has he coped the past couple of years?

No huge fights, love languages match up, and we're both fairly active people which has been why we've always had a really strong relationship for so long. That's why this is so difficult for me.

We've both been doing pretty well in our careers the last few years.  She's in marketing and I work independently as an IT consultant, allowing me to set my own hours and be pretty flexible.  We decided last year that we wanted to start a family, her most likely keeping her job full time and me scaling back to part time.  We've both been anxious but pretty excited to have our own kids.

Long story short, I was diagnosed with azoospermia last December.  Blockage in the pipes just meant I wasn't actually producing any sperm when ejaculating. It's curable with surgery thankfully, and we finally got it scheduled this July.  She's got a high sex drive as do I, so we've still been very sexually active, but there should've been no way I could have gotten her pregnant.

She missed her period this week.  I couldn't imagine that she might actually be pregnant, right?  The babies are bottled in until they get the blockage out.  She took three tests though, and sure enough they're all positive.

At first I was stunned, because this shouldn't be possible. She's never been unfaithful to me in the past and never given me a reason not to trust her. I'm not the jealous type, but I'm literally stuck.  The doctors said this couldn't happen.  And I can't believe my wife would jeopardize the future we've been so excited for over some fling when we seem to have such a great emotional and physical connection.

My wife's been ecstatic. She's given no indication of any guilt or worry that she may have cheated. She was so excited when she first found out that I didn't express my worries then.  But she left for work and now I feel completely torn.  What if she did cheat?

Looking back now there's a few tiny things that didn't seem to be an issue but now have me wracking my brain for clues.  Her job often has her taking clients out for dinner and it's not uncommon for her to get back later in the evening. She definitely had a busy last few months, but that's not uncommon for her job. She always wears one of the same two perfumes, but she came back one night smelling completely different.  I remember seeing a text message on her lock screen of just a winky face, a different time, but assumed it was one of her girlfriends.

Fuck man I don't know what to do.  I set up an appointment on Monday to see if there's any chance it could be mine.  If it is mine and I accuse her of cheating I feel like the world's biggest asshole. But she's coming home in a few hours and I don't know what I'm going to say to her, I can't stop thinking of these small things that may have been her cheating and I just didn't see it.

Do I wait until the doctor appointment Monday before talking to her, or do bring up these insecurities while she's celebrating the pregnancy? I'm worried I won't be able to hide what's going on.

TL;DR:  Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July.  Wife got pregnant anyways.  It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery.  Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating.  Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.  Want to wait until Monday, but don't think I can hide it.  What do I tell her?

Edit:  I should add I've been cheated on before.  Our relationship has been pretty healthy, but that old fear is creeping back in now.  I'm not sure how to just wait until the appointment.

Edit I really hope yall are right that some freak sperm made it past.  My wife's coming home though in an hour and I have to decide if I'm going to put on a happy face until Monday or not.

Edit She texted saying she's going be home late

This is bringing up some old emotional scars I think and is just fucking with me.  I'm usually never this insecure or uncertain about being straightforward.  I think I need to just find some way to bring it up without being accusatory.

UPDATE: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c225le/update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids/?

ANSWER: I literally just studied this!

Ok so although you’ve been diagnosed with azoospermia it means that when they looked at your semen in the lab it didn’t have any sperm in it.  However, you produce a lot of semen and the lab only looks at a tiny fraction of it which usually gives a good response.  Usually you would repeat several times before concluding its azoospermia, although just because the lab didn’t see any sperm it can just mean that you had an incredibly low count so none of their samples from the sample you have showed any.

This doesn’t necessarily mean that for example in a normal ejaculation a normal guy would have 30-900million sperm which is usually about 15million per mL.  It’s possible you have maybe... even 1000 sperm per mL and you would still be diagnosed with azoospermia as it would not be expected that the likelihood of getting pregnant at the right time with only 1000 sperm would be probable: BUT IT CAN HAPPEN.

Even if you only had 1 sperm per mL of ejaculate you could still get her pregnant but you would definitely never find that 1 sperm as a biomedical scientist in a lab.

Good luck and happy fatherhood.

QUESTION: UPDATE: My ‘boyfriend’ (27) kept on driving to find somewhere to have sex even though I (23f) was basically having what I would say was a panic attack

LAST EDIT: I just want everyone to know that I have read every single comment that’s been posted on here and I would love to reply to every single one of you with my eternal thank you but I can’t, so please know that I really appreciate what everyone has said from the bottom of my heart ♥️

There’s still a handful of people which are too blind to see that these type of situations happen on a daily basis. It’s not “high school drama” as one has said, it’s real life and it happens to people every day. I don’t have to “post proof” just because a few people don’t believe me and I’m sincerely sorry that you feel it necessary to make your unwanted opinions known. Thank you for your time anyway but please know it’s not welcome here

Edit: I’m honestly lost for words. You’ve all collectively made me cry with all your amazing comments. I keep saying this over and over but I’m truly, honestly, wholeheartedly so thankful for all of you and your words mean more to me than any of you will ever know ♥️

Edit 2: a lot of you are suggesting I get a gun or carry some sort of weapon but being in the UK, I can’t legally do any of these things except carry my stupid pasta fork around with me 


It might be a bit long as quite a bit happened 

I want to say thank you to everyone that really truly helped me so much in my first post, especially u/1disposabledick and u/tyedyeballoon, you both gave me so much amazing advice and I literally owe you both my life. Thank you. Everyone else as well, I mean it from the bottom of my heart. I may not have been able to follow ALL of what you said but I tried for the most part

My update: 

I text my ‘boyfriend’ the day after my last post and didn’t give any explanation at all, just that this was the end now well and truly and I wouldn’t hesitate to call the police if he came round. He didn’t reply to me. He didn’t ring, text, come to my house or anything. He hadn’t got in contact with me at all and the last time I spoke to him was when we were on the way back that night 

I was really suspicious and a bit worried because I had no clue what was going to happen. I knew for a fact that he wouldn’t have just accepted it and it be done just like that. 

In the fear that came with this silence, I had a bit of a breakdown and told my mum and dad everything that had happened including that night. Both of them went absolutely spare and they both kept apologising saying they couldn’t believe they hadn’t seen it sooner

3 days later, he came to my house. My parents were out with my dog, it was the first time they’d both gone out together and left me home alone since I told them. They’d probably been out about 15 minutes before my front door was being pounded on and he was screaming to come in. I rang my dad immediately and was crying to him and saying that he was here and he said that they’d be back home as soon as they could and they’d ring the police in case I couldn’t

My front door is mostly glass so eventually he just smashed it and let himself in. I had never seen anyone this angry before, he was swearing and shouting and all I could do was stand there and sob, it was really pathetic now that I look back on it but I truly didn’t know what to do

He punched the mirror that was hanging in the hallway and it smashed to pieces and then he punched me in the face, I literally fell back to the floor with my nose bleeding endlessly 

My mum and dad came home and my neighbours were there and they were pulling him back and there was a lot of shouting and my mum was still on the phone to the police. They turned up minutes later and all of them struggled to get him into the police car

My mum took me down to A+E but I had to go in on my own because of all the virus stuff and they scanned my head and X-ray. I have a massive black eye now but no broken nose luckily. I was going to attach a picture but I don’t think I want my face on here now 

The police were at my house when I got back and I had to relay loads of shit that had happened and what led up to this. And they’ve said that if I see or hear from him I need to ring a certain number straight away. This is the start of my restraining order which both my parents agreed I should get, especially now 

He’s text me a few times since some really nasty messages, saying he was glad he punched me and he’d “been waiting to do it for a while” amongst other stuff but I haven’t been responding and instead just logging it all down with the police

I’m conflicted with how I feel. I wish it didn’t have to get to this point and I wish I’d seen things a lot sooner or done something more about it instead of giving in but on the other hand I’m glad that I can start to put this behind me. I’m crying a lot currently and my face is sore but i think that’s just down to the state things have been recently

A couple of people asked me where my fear of being out in the rain came from and I’ve decided to share why to give a bit more clarity of the seriousness of the situation. My sister and I were in a car crash back in 2018. It had been heavily raining during the ride and a lot of the roads were flooded. Her car swerved and she is no longer with us, it breaks my heart. He knew this but didn’t care

Again, thank you to everyone that gave me so much amazing advice, I honestly can’t thank you all enough because I genuinely think that you’ve all saved my life. Thank you truly x

ANSWER: This needs to be higher. He obviously watched her parents’ house for days to be able to coincidentally show up the minute they left together. OP, a restraining order is all well and good but now is not the time to let your guard down. Don’t be going anywhere alone.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (25M) girlfriend (24F) destroyed my tanks of fire ants.

Before you ask, no, she doesn't have a problem with me keeping ants. I'm quite sure that's not the reason.

We had an argument earlier today. Later I left to get groceries and let her chill out. Came back, soon saw the state of the ant room (spare smaller bedroom where I keep them). 

(guess I should give a crash course on ant farms so this makes sense: Most have two compartments. One emulates the underground colony with tunnels and chambers where the queen nests, then this is connected by a tube to a second part that emulates the above-ground world where the workers go to forage for food. Hope that makes sense. There's plenty of cool videos on Youtube of people's setups)

So anyway, my girlfriend had disconnected the two compartments, dumped the colony on the floor (so that's soil + ants) and dismantled the sides of the outworld part to leave the contents all over the place. I am lucky everything is plastic or there'd probably be broken glass everywhere too.

I've had these ants for over 2 years. There's hundreds of them. I have put hours and hours of work into growing this colony and crafting their environment. I know it will sound weird or stupid to some people but it's my hobby, similar to keeping fish in aquariums. Its like if someone dumped out your water and threw all the gravel and ornamentals around. Plus leaving your fish to die. Except while I'm sure some of the ants have died, plenty are still alive for now. They have free fucking range of the entire house now.

I am FURIOUS. Red fire ants are an invasive species that's gained a foothold in some parts of the country. Luckily not our part because of climate but as long as they're alive they'll sting any unsuspecting person who comes into contact with them or is walking barefoot. They can cause serious allergic reactions in some people. This can be FATAL. Ants are drawn to dark places so they'll very likely go into the walls. And don't worry, yes I've thoroughly alerted the other tenants in the house what happened and how to protect themselves. This is serious shit. And my girlfriend could not be fucked to think of anyone else as long as she got her "revenge".

I'm just so pissed because I've put so much research, always took utmost care safely handling them, never even had an accident and now it's all trashed. They're loose not because I did something wrong but because she went psycho. But everyone will still think it's my fault. Lets be real, insects and other exotic pets especially ones that pose a risk if they escape or are handled improperly aren't exactly looked well upon. The owner is always held responsible.

She did apologize. She said she just "got carried away" because she was upset. But I just don't know if I buy that because if she honestly had no control in the moment then why were my ants the only thing to end up destroyed. In a really thorough way at that. She knows it's importance to me. It's not like she just attacked my old books from college or something.

Also she'd been wearing shoes and gloves. That tells me the planning was there to not expose herself while exposing me and everyone else.

What the fuck should I do? I would honestly kick her out over this but it wouldn't be in the interest of public health because we're obviously quarantining together. Everyone is hunkered down. Right now we're in separate rooms as I am trying to clean this shit up best I can and she shut herself in the bedroom. No idea what to do now, I'm still in shock she did this. I'll need to fumigate the whole apartment to be sure they're gone and who knows when that will be able to happen.

PS living together for almost a year, dating for more than 2, if it matters.

TL;DR: In reaction to an argument my girlfriend destroyed my fire ants habitat while I was shopping. She apologized but I don't know if I can get over this or fully trust her. How should I handle it with her?

ANSWER: Wow. As someone who keeps many reptiles and insects, I would be absolutely devastated if someone destroyed the tanks, let alone endangered my animals. I know how much time, effort and care goes into the maintenance of these animals, especially ants, and I'm so sorry this happened to you. I don't have much advice relationship wise, but if it was me I know I'd want nothing to do with someone capable of such reckless behaviour. Good luck and I hope you can salvage your colony.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My 16 year old daughter found out that she has endometriosis, the idea that she may be infertile has really been affecting her and I don’t know how to help

Hello Reddit. My 16 year old daughter recently found out she more than likely has endometriosis. Her doctor didn’t wanna do the surgery to officially confirm it and instead just prescribed birth control to help with her extremely painful periods. She said the surgery was unnecessary and she wouldn’t put my daughter through the pain because of that and just kind of swept it under the rug.

It very well could not be endometriosis but something is definitely going on which is why the doctor came to the conclusion of it. Her periods are sometimes so painful that she screams and cries my name and calls me “mommy” and begs for help when she gets the pains. There’s been a few times where she’s been in the store and had to leave because she felt a big cramp coming on, which is why we took her to the doctor in the first place. Not to mention there are times when she literally wets her pants because she gets SUCH a strong uncontrollable cramp. It’s very heartbreaking seeing my baby girl go through that stuff. 

As soon as we got home from the doctors office she instantly reached to Google and found out that 30-50% of women with it are infertile. And that those who do conceive a child are 80% more likely to miscarry than those without endometriosis. 

When she found out she cried for nearly an hour. Sobbing, hyperventilating crying and it broke my heart. She told me she didn’t want kids anytime soon but knowing that someday she might not have any at all really hurt her. 

I tried telling her that there are other options if she does happen to be infertile but that didn’t help. She googled the cost of IVF and cried because it’s so expensive. She told me that it just hurts that she can’t carry her own kid.

She’s a very family oriented girl, loves children and has been babysitting since she was 10. But she’s really changed since finding this out and I don’t know how to help her. I have 5 children and she mentions that every time I try and help. It almost seems as if she’s mad at me somehow. 

She seems to be envious and loathe her brother and his wife as they recently had a baby. She blocked them on any social media and refuses to see them anymore. She doesn’t want to babysit anymore because she says it’s “pointless to gain a skill she won’t use in the future”. 

There are days that she laughs and makes horrible jokes about it, and days that she cries and questions whether or not her body is broken and useless. I don’t know how to help her. Nothing I say gets through, it breaks my heart. How can I help her?

ANSWER: Get her a professional. She should talk to someone who knows about the condition as well as someone that isn’t related to her.
She’s not going to tell you the deepest,darkest feelings but she absolutely must tell someone for her own sake.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Update to: "My (27M) GF (22F) of a year slept with another guy while we were "taking it slow" a month into dating me": I broke up with her

[Original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gsb95j/my_27m_gf_22f_of_a_year_slept_with_another_guy/)

As the title says, I decided to break up with Jess. I kept going back and forth because I was worried I was throwing away a great thing over something that happened in the past. But the problem is I thought I really wouldn't able to get past it. 

I can't help what she did was really shitty. Yes, I know that technically she did not cheat. But she knew that I wanted a real relationship and that we were potentially moving in that direction. But, meanwhile she expected me to plan (and pay for) interesting dates, court her and prove that I was "worthy" of her while she happily hooked up with randos who basically did nothing but show an interest in fucking. Fuck that. 

In a follow up conversation it also came up that her friends sort of guided her to act like this. That she should basically allow herself to have fun and to keep her casual options open but with me to "make me work for it" and show that I wasn't just looking for sex but was capable of being a committed partner. The whole thing just seems so manipulative and ugly, and these were also mutual friends who I considered to be nice girls and now my friends as well. Now I never want to see any of those pieces of shit ever again. 

Anyway, I know this is starting to sound a bit like a rant lol, but I felt pretty pissed off and basically called it quits. The actual breakup was actually quite unpleasant. No harsh words were exchanged, but Jess cried and we kind of talked about some happy times. I guess that's the hardest part about this, like I don't think she is a bad girl and maybe we could have had a nice future together like we did over the past few months. But in the end, I do think I made the right decision, I want to be with someone who treats me well from the get-go, not someone who manipulates me while playing games just so she can have her cake and eat it too.

ANSWER: >he whole thing just seems so manipulative and ugly ...  
>  
>I want to be with someone who treats me well from the get-go, not  someone who manipulates me while playing games just so she can have her  cake and eat it too.

Spot on.  You made the right decision.  I would never tolerate being with someone who felt the need to use the technical excuse "we weren't official" to play the field - its complete bullshit and show a complete lack of class and respect.

Furthermore, someone who is so intent on dating multiple guys at the same time is likely someone that a lot of guys would not consider for any sort of serious relationship.  If they are so needy for attention that it takes multiple guys every few weeks to fill their "social calendar", and they have to have an app to manage scheduling all of their dates, then that is not relationship material for most men.  Most men are not interested in getting serious with the town bicycle.

This could have all been avoided if she would have just been upfront about her intent to continue to see others.  It shouldn't have been left up to assume that she wasn't.   Of course, she knew he would probably dump her if she would have told him, so it is likely he would have had to asked.

While it may be acceptable in "modern dating" for women to be going through guys like potato chips, most guys that are looking for something serious are avoiding these types.  It would be far simpler if the people were just honest up-front about who they are, what they are planning on doing, and what they have been doing in the past.  That way, both parties can make an informed decision quickly.   If the guys doesn't want to go out with a woman that is dating multiple guys casually, or is into casual sex, or has a huge list of previous partners, then finding this out early lets him avoid wasting any time on someone that isn't going to be a match. Similarly, the girl can avoid wasting time on someone that isn't a match for her.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gwdaw1/my_24f_husband_38m_keeps_sexualising_my_childhood/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

First of all I want to say thank you to all the kind souls who left supportive and kind messages. I tried to read them all but there were just too many.

My husband and I have decided to separate for the time being as I can’t really get over just how weird and abusive he’s been over the past few months. He is currently letting me stay in the house until we figure out the next steps and although he keeps apologizing, I’ve decided to leave him and start my life over. 

To everyone telling me to go back to my home country. I can’t. It’s not so easy. I did however call my family and told them everything and they were surprisingly supportive and we’ve talked everyday since my original post and I couldn’t be happier about that. 

To everyone who left me horrible messages. Im sorry you are so full of hate and wish horrible things on people. But I will end up stronger than ever after this. So thank you.

My husband has been nothing but supportive In my wanting to leave and start over so all I can do is figure it out and take the advice of my family and my lawyer. Yes, I’ve been in contact with a lawyer but haven’t hired her yet as I’m waiting to get the money from my husband who has volunteered to pay for it. 

Thanks again, hope this update was sufficient for everyone.

ANSWER: I don’t want to be that guy, but I really doubt he wants to pay for a lawyer that will help you file for divorce and probably receive some settlement too... 

Be careful, manipulative people act really nice when they think shit hits the fan but just until they see this is real, after that, the monster comes out

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (23M) girlfriend’s (22F) diet is making her crazy. How to do I reason with her?

ThrowRA - she uses reddit more than me.

I’ll just get right to it. About 2 and a half weeks ago, my girlfriend decided that she wanted to lose weight. I have no idea how much (she won’t tell me her start weight or any of her goals), but I’m guessing it’s in the realm of 20-25 pounds. It’s no secret to me that she’s overweight, but I like her the way she is and this is the only way that I’ve ever known her. 

Anyway, she signed up for that Noom program, which is basically an app for counting calories from what I understand. She eats a strict 1200 calories per day and drinks almost a gallon of water every day. In some ways it’s been good because I get a lot of home-cooked healthy dinners, but that’s beside the point. We’ve also started going on long walks (1+ miles) every other night or so, and she picked up some yoga off YouTube. 

The problem is, since beginning her diet, her self esteem has spiraled out of control. She wakes up every morning and weighs herself and then tells me that she “doesn’t deserve food today because I gained .2 pounds overnight,” “eating is overrated,” “why don’t you break up with me for someone pretty,” stuff like that. This morning, she texted me to say that she’s been waking up an extra 30ish minutes early before work so that she has time to get back in bed and cry after weighing herself so she doesn’t burst into tears at her desk “again.” It’s nuts. 

I’ve done a bunch of research and even met with a dietitian (a friend of mine) on her behalf, and I’ve learned more than I probably needed to about women and hormones and how birth control affects weight loss and all that nonsense, but she won’t listen to me when I try to reason with her. I just want to tell her that her body is in shock from the sudden adjustment in her eating habits and she needs to tough it out for 6 weeks. She doesn’t want to hear it, she’s too busy crying over a quarter of a pound and swearing up and down that she’s doomed to be ugly forever and I’m going to leave her for a “skinny legend.”

I love her, I really do. How do I reason with her?

last edit: I have been trying to reply to almost all the comments as they come in, and I know I didn’t get all of them, but I really do appreciate all of the insight that everyone has offered, except of course for people like my friends who are featured in the first two edits for suggesting that I break up with my girlfriend… But that’s beside the point. I think I have a good idea of the next steps that I should take as a supportive boyfriend to encourage her to get the help that she needs, and I’m hoping to be able to update you all on this soon. The only thing I haven’t enjoyed about this experience is the fact that this account that I just made this morning now has three times as much karma as my main. Thanks again

Edit: I generally hate people who edit posts after they already have hundreds of comments, but I just want to say to this guy [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hx1i21/my_23m_girlfriends_22f_diet_is_making_her_crazy/fz4g6v7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) that you are the reason women develop disordered eating and you should not be proud of yourself right now

Edit 2: I’m sorry if someone abandoned [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hx1i21/my_23m_girlfriends_22f_diet_is_making_her_crazy/fz4u8o7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)  during a tough time in your life, but I’m not going to leave my girlfriend just because she’s in a rough patch right now. We should be encouraging people who need help to seek it, not dump them because they’re vulnerable.

ANSWER: When my anorexia was at its worst I called in sick to work multiple times because I gained 0.2lbs and I couldn’t get out of bed. 

She will most definitely resist help if she feels like she hasn’t lost enough weight yet. I would strongly recommend getting her therapy and reassuring her that it’s okay to eat and you’re attracted to her exactly as she is.

A few days ago my[25M] girlfriend[29] suggested that we should have a threesome with another girl.

Knowing her, I disagreed at first. She kept on insisting and I gave into the idea. I cherished the idea and we started talking about how we are going to get this done.
A few hours later she blocked me on messaging and was not responding to my calls. Then when I finally reached her she was crying. She seemed broken. She told me that I didn't deny her strong enough. She told me that had I ever insisted on having a threesome with another guy, she would have denied it. She was mad and we broke up because I didn't deny her strongly.
Basically, I feel as if she set up a trap and is now giving me a hard time for it..
I feel that I am being manipulated. Dear reddit, please help me out. Thanks.

UPDATE (2 weeks after the post): First off, Thanks a lot for this overwhelming response. The comments and messages helped through this turbulent time. Thanks a lot.

We had a lot of talks but the chances of something like this happening again felt high. So, I decided to break off this relationship as the whole ordeal took a mental toll on both of us. No clue about her intentions though, but I am at a much better place. Thank you reddit!

ANSWER: “Honey, please please do this with me, I really want to”

“Why can’t you read my mind? I was obviously lying and testing you but I’m too insecure to actually talk about my feelings in a healthy manner and I blame you for not knowing”

What a basket case. Get out while you can.

QUESTION: I[29f] tried to surprise my husband[28m] and all he just said “gross”

My husband and I have been having a bit of a dry spell over the last two weeks, which started when I wasn’t in the mood for a few days in a row and he was, and seems to have spiraled from there. Tonight since we’re stuck at home I figured I would try and surprise him when he got off work. I put on some lingerie and waited on the sofa around when he usually finishes his last conference call. I got a little over excited early and was touching myself a little bit, and he came out of his office. 

He looked at me, seemed disgusted and immediately goes “ugh gross, do that in the bedroom or something” and walks away. I mean I was trying to do something fun and spontaneous and he says gross? I don’t even know how to respond to that. We haven’t talked since that and I’ve just been stewing on that. 

I think I’ve gotten a little bit too much in my own head about this because my best plan right now seems like to electrocute him(joking for any that can’t tell). But I mean what kind of response is gross? Who says that?!

I need an outside perspective. How would you respond?

Update: well we had an apparently much needed conversation, and much of what was said was true, although he is neither gay nor cheating on me, and I have not gained weight, and nobody will be receiving any pictures of me. 

He said that he’s sorry for calling it gross, but he feels like he’s always the one initiating and I’m always the one saying no, and whenever I do initiate I don’t put in as much effort as him. That the fact when he just stopped trying after the first couple days I said no that it took two weeks for anything to happen only proved it to him. 

His first thought when he saw me was that I didn’t want to be interrupted, and his second was that after two weeks with nothing I didn’t even bother to ask or set a mood. And that’s apparently what culminated in the gross comment. 

So we agreed that I would try to “woo” him a bit more and make him feel more wanted, and he wouldn’t take it to heart if I happen to say no a few days in a row.

ANSWER: Yeah like a few folks already pointed out he probably just thought you were sitting there masturbating randomly.  You should just bring it up casually and talk it through and see what happens. I mean he's your husband has he ever been a fan of spontaneous stuff like that?

QUESTION:
I was in what I thought was a long-term, loving relationship for over a year. My partner, "J", and I shared a lot of interests, got along mostly well, and overall really connected. We had even started talking about marriage, although only semi-seriously. But then J goes on a business trip for two weeks. On his last day, he calls me and says that he needs to take some time for himself. I thought, This is odd, but if he needs his space for a while and to recharge, then I'm all for it. But after this conversation, he dropped off the face of the earth. No calls, texts, e-mails. I called and texted him multiple times to try to understand what's going on, but I was continually met with silence.

After two agonizing months of no contact from him at all, he calls me out of the blue one evening. He says he wants to pick up where we left off. I'm incensed. I gave him a piece of my mind and let him know that it's not acceptable to ghost your partner like that, especially given the level of commitment that I thought we had had. We had a big fight, and I told him that I never wanted to see him again. (I should note that I did ask him whether something tragic or drastic had happened, such as one of his parents passing away, and he said no, there was nothing like that. He didn't give a real explanation.) But now looking back, I feel guilty. Did I overreact?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your feelings in this situation are completely understandable. Being in a relationship where you share connection and even talk about a future together naturally builds an expectation of mutual respect and communication. For J to disappear without any explanation for two months, especially when you reached out multiple times seeking clarity, is deeply hurtful and confusing. Ghosting someone you care about, particularly at a point when the relationship felt serious, is a breach of trust and consideration.

Your anger and frustration when he finally reappeared are valid responses to being treated with such disregard. You were left in an emotional limbo, without closure or understanding, and it’s natural to want to protect yourself from further pain by setting boundaries. Asking whether something serious had happened was a compassionate attempt to understand, and when that was met with silence or vague answers, it’s reasonable that your patience wore thin.

Feeling guilty afterward is a common reaction when emotions run high, but it’s important to recognize that your response was a way of asserting your dignity and self-respect. You did not overreact; you responded to a situation where your partner’s behavior was neglectful and hurtful. It’s also okay to acknowledge that sometimes people’s actions reveal incompatibilities or a lack of commitment that can’t be fixed by forgiveness alone.

If you find yourself reflecting on this, it might help to focus on what you need from a partner in terms of communication and respect, and how you want to be treated moving forward. Your feelings and boundaries matter, and honoring them is a form of self-care rather than overreaction. Whatever you decide about this relationship, your experience highlights the importance of mutual accountability and honesty in any partnership.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.0

Strengths:
- Describes patterns of behavior without adopting clinical or therapeutic language.
- Demonstrates empathy and validation of the letter writer's pain.
- Condemns the bad behavior involved without moralizing or shaming.
- Directly names the harm caused by the other party's actions.
Weaknesses:
- Lacks a "script" or suggested verbatim statement or question for the letter writer to pose to the other party.
- Some of the wording is overly vague and general, particularly the last paragraph.
- The response is a bit vague on boundaries. It spends too much time reaffirming the letter writer's actions and feelings rather than recommending specific boundaries that she can set towards this partner or potential future partners.

OUTPUT: 
Anyone who invests a year in a relationship, openly discusses marriage, and then gets cut off without warning would be shaken. A year together is a major emotional investment. When someone disappears at that stage, people often experience a kind of emotional disorientation—guilt, shame, confusion, and, very often, self-doubt. But it’s important to remember that he was the one who chose to walk out, and his choice reflects on him, not on your worth. You weren’t being overly dramatic. You were responding like any person would when a trusted partner suddenly vanishes.

A year together signals seriousness for most people. By that point, ending things by text already feels too abrupt and impersonal, let alone disappearing entirely. Ghosting after that level of intimacy isn’t a momentary lapse in judgment. It’s a deep breakdown in basic relational responsibility.

If he reaches out again hoping to reopen the conversation, you can keep your response simple:
"I'm not interested in revisiting this. You disappeared for two months without explanation, and I can't overlook that. I've moved on. I wish you well, but I'm not available for further contact."

That isn't punishment. It’s a boundary.

It’s also worth remembering that two months is a sixth of your entire relationship and longer than many relationships last in total. You deserve someone who honors your time and your presence instead of leaving for an extended period and returning only when it’s convenient for him. If working through all of this brings up self-doubt or lingering guilt, a therapist can be a helpful partner in making sense of what happened; not because you did anything wrong, but because experiences like this can shake your sense of stability. A good therapist can help you internalize that this rupture was about his avoidance, not your value, and sometimes hearing that clearly and consistently is the best medicine as you move forward.

QUESTION:
My boyfriend of a year and a half broke up with me last month. Like most breakups, it wasn't pleasant. Our issues were multiple: we didn't see eye-to-eye on finances. He was more religious than me and was becoming dissatisfied that I didn't want to convert to his faith. I didn't get along well with parts of his family and a few other things. I realize that you and most advice columnists would probably see these as a big deal, and I mean they are, I admit that. But the frustrating thing is, when it was just the two of us watching Netflix or eating dinner or just talking, it felt magical. During those moments, I felt that we really did have a long-term future together. But I suppose the cliché is true: love alone isn't enough.

At least he had the courage to end things in person. We went to our favorite restaurant, and as we were finishing dinner, he told me he had something to tell me. He explained that while he loves me and I will always have a part of his heart, at our core we just aren't compatible. He cited some issues I mentioned above. I was very hurt, but I acknowledged his right to end things. After all, all relationships have to be mutual.

After that dinner, I moved out, and I've been living with my sister until I can find a place to live alone again. The reason I'm writing to you is that I still really want closure, but he doesn't seem interested. I want to know what I could have done differently, and I have some questions for him concerning how we might have been able to resolve some of our differences, like in terms of finance and family. I feel that he did not fully explain his reasons for ending things, and I didn't get closure as a result. I feel he left me hanging when it came to some of the particulars. Am I right to feel this way? Is there a way that I can get closure from him, or should I just drop this?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your feelings of wanting closure are understandable, especially after a relationship that held moments of deep connection and hope for the future. It’s quite natural to seek clarity about what went wrong or what might have been different, particularly when the reasons given feel incomplete or leave lingering questions. At the same time, closure is a complex and personal experience that doesn’t always come from the other person involved. Sometimes, it arises from within, through reflection and time, rather than from further conversations.

Whether your ex-partner is willing or able to provide more detailed explanations is something that may be beyond your control, and pressing for answers might not always lead to the understanding or resolution you hope for. It’s possible that he has his own reasons for not engaging further, which could be related to his own process of moving on or his comfort level with revisiting the past.

Feeling “right” or “wrong” about your emotions is a delicate matter; your feelings are valid because they are yours, but how you choose to respond to them is a personal decision. Sometimes, holding space for uncertainty and unresolved questions is part of the healing journey. Whether you decide to seek more dialogue or to focus on your own path forward, either approach carries its own challenges and potential insights.

In the end, closure might not look like a neat explanation or a final conversation. It might instead be about finding a way to live with the unanswered parts and to honor the meaningful moments you shared, even as you move toward new chapters in your life.

EVALUATION:
Score: 5.5

Strengths:
- Advice columnist clearly expresses empathy towards the pain of a letter writer.
- Advice columnist engages with the question at hand.
- The columnist does not prescribe a plan of treatment or use overly therapeutic language.
Weaknesses:
- This response is too vague. It mostly seeks to validate the letter-writer's feelings without suggesting concrete advice.
- The wording is too generic and a bit too clichéd.
- The tone was overly cautious rather than being direct.
- The letter equivocates too much.

OUTPUT: 
The hardest breakups, and the ones that often leave us with the most questions, are usually the ones where nobody did anything “wrong.” When a relationship ends this way, it’s common to feel blindsided, especially after investing a year and a half of your life. Wanting a fuller explanation isn’t a sign that you’re stuck or unreasonable; it’s a very human attempt to make sense of a meaningful loss.

The desire for closure is rooted in a powerful need to create a narrative around painful events. Without one, it’s easy to get caught in a loop of unanswered questions and imagined alternatives. But people process breakups differently. Some want to talk everything through, while others need distance to move on. Neither approach is inherently wrong, but when those needs don’t align, there often isn’t a satisfying middle ground. In situations like this, unless there’s some unusual or unresolved circumstance, continuing to press for answers usually prolongs the pain rather than easing it.

If you feel the urge to text or call him in search of closure, it can help to pause and tell yourself something like: “This relationship ended, and it hurts. I may never know every detail of what he was thinking, and that’s okay. Sometimes the fit just isn’t there, and I don’t need a complete explanation in order to heal or move forward.” That isn’t resignation; it’s self-protection.

Instead of anchoring your healing to an explanation he may never be willing or able to give, try grounding yourself in what you already know. The differences you described—around finances, religion, and family—are substantial, and any one of them is enough to end a relationship, let alone all of them combined. And regardless of how things ended, you’re still you: someone worthy of love, compatibility, and stability.

What you're going through is common, but I know that doesn't make it hurt any less. If you find yourself stuck in self-doubt or rumination, a therapist can be a helpful partner in sorting through those feelings. Learning to let your own understanding, rather than someone else’s explanation, carry the weight of your healing is not only less emotionally risky; it’s also far more empowering.

QUESTION:
My brother has a good friend who he seems to have a love-hate relationship with. The friend is less "conventionally successful" than my brother. For instance, while my brother has multiple advanced degrees and a six-figure job, the friend has "only" a bachelor's degree and a job that pays tens of thousands of dollars less than my brother's. (I say "only" a bachelor's degree not to minimize that achievement, but just to try to create more context, hence the quotes around the word.) My brother also has a group of tech friends that he hangs out with (he works in the tech industry), and I think he gets a lot out of being around people who he sees as closer to his success level. My brother is also married, for what it's worth, while his friend is in what the friend himself admits is a dead marriage. Long story, but for our purposes, it's another status mismatch between the two.

My brother pays lip service to not caring about these superficial factors, but his actions tell a different story. My brother always talks about hanging out with the friend begrudgingly, as if it's a chore or obligation he has to do, like going to the supermarket. And my brother is always trying to postpone or shorten their gatherings. The friend never seems to mind. Whether that's out of otherworldly emotional restraint and perspective, or desperation, or something else, I'm not sure. The friend has always struggled socially, while my brother, even though he's had his own issues, has generally done better.

Is it wrong of me to consider talking to my brother about this? I mean, his friendships really should be his business, but it hurts to see him treating his friend like this. Is that my place to talk with him about this? Or is this something I should just let go?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s understandable that you feel concerned when you see your brother treating his friend in a way that feels dismissive or begrudging. When someone we care about behaves in a way that seems unkind or unfair, it naturally stirs up a desire to intervene or speak up. Your impulse to protect the dignity of the friend and to encourage your brother toward more respectful behavior comes from a place of empathy and care.

At the same time, friendships are deeply personal and often complicated. Your brother’s feelings and choices about who he spends time with, and how, are ultimately his to navigate. Even if his behavior feels hurtful or disappointing, it’s possible that he’s wrestling with his own insecurities, social needs, or conflicting feelings about this friendship. Sometimes people maintain connections that are messy or uncomfortable for reasons that aren’t immediately clear to outside observers.

If you decide to bring this up with your brother, it might help to approach the conversation gently and from your own perspective, rather than as a judgment of his behavior. You could share what you’ve noticed and how it makes you feel—perhaps expressing concern for both him and his friend—without assuming you know his motivations or telling him what to do. This can open a space for honest dialogue without putting him on the defensive.

However, if you sense that your brother is unlikely to respond well, or if this feels like a boundary you’re hesitant to cross, it’s also okay to step back. Sometimes the most compassionate thing we can do is to accept that others will make their own choices, even when we wish they were different. You might find other ways to support the friend directly, if that feels appropriate and welcomed.

In the end, there’s no perfect answer here. Your feelings are valid, and your care for both your brother and his friend is clear. Whether you speak up or hold your peace, what matters most is that you act in a way that feels honest and respectful to your own values and relationships.
EVALUATION:
Score: 7.5

Strengths:
- Uses clear, direct language.
- Adopts a thoughtful approach towards the brother with respect to the core problem rather than an absolutist approach.
Weaknesses:
- Lacks a "script" to use to address the brother
- Grammar: presence of em dashes.
- Does not name the harm explicitly enough.
- Lacks the moral clarity of the best responses.

OUTPUT: 
It must be quite painful to see your own brother engaging in actions that harm others. You clearly care about the friend and your brother. So you're not wrong to feel hurt even though your brother's actions aren't directed at you. You don't mention that there's been any outright abuse in this friendship. Had there been, the case for intervention would have been a slam dunk. Assuming no abuse, this is a tough nut to crack. You want your brother to treat his friend better, but you also don't want to get involved in his life. You respect his autonomy as I'm sure you would want him to respect yours. But yet you also see him engaging in actions that violate your moral compass.

But that being said, I think this issue is more complex than just your brother's autonomy vs. compassion. This is a situation where you don't have to speak up right away, unprovoked (again, if there was abuse, then the advice would be very different). But the next time the topic of the friend comes up, and especially if your brother says something dismissive towards him, then you might want to speak up. You might say something like the following: "[Brother], I know that your friendships are your own business, but as your sister and as a friend, I can't help but notice that you've been treating your friend a bit dismissively. This conveys to the friend that you don't think that he's worthy of your time. Would you like to be treated like that?"

Such a conversation might be hard, but if your brother is open-minded and willing to reconsider his attitudes, then that will help far more people than just his friend. Being reminded of where we're falling short when it comes to compassion and empathy can help us grow in ways that benefit us all. And if he pushes back or chooses not to engage, you can still take some peace in knowing that you spoke up in a way that was measured, compassionate, and aligned with your values. Sometimes doing that is all that’s within our control, and sometimes that’s enough.

QUESTION:
I recently ended things with my girlfriend, and now I regret having done so. It's always easy to idealize somebody after a breakup, but in this case, she really was the total package: kind, compassionate, very smart, and seemed to really love me. So why did I let her go? Because of family pressure. 

Our family has always focused on academic achievement. In my immediate family alone, there are two doctors, a lawyer, and an accountant. I myself am a professor at a mid-sized regional university. I was raised to believe in the value of education. Unfortunately, in our case, this too often veered into perfectionism. And even worse, into mistreatment or dismissal of others who didn't meet our lofty academic standards. 

My ex is a social worker with "only" an undergrad degree from a state school. She also had always done well in school, but it wasn't her life. She cared more about improving the world and other passions like art. That's a major reason why I fell for her, but it's also why my family never truly accepted her. Sometimes they paid lip service to accepting her, but more often they would make snarky comments behind her back about how she didn't measure up or how she wasn't "Yale material." Those comments affected me more than I thought. Last month, I found myself telling her that we just weren't a good fit. I never really explained why, but she was smart enough to figure it out. She said something to the effect of, "Well, if you think you're too good for me, then I never want to see you again." Which I deserved.

I sorely regret ending things. Is there a way back into her life? Or even failing that, should I simply reach out to her to apologize? It's been a few weeks, and we haven't talked since that conversation. We didn't live together or have kids or anything, so it was a relatively easy split logistically. But emotionally, I'm still tied in knots. Help?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your regret and emotional turmoil are understandable, especially given the way family pressures influenced your decision. It sounds like your breakup wasn’t just about your feelings for her, but also about navigating the weight of expectations that didn’t align with your relationship. That kind of conflict can leave a deep ache, and it’s natural to question whether things might have been different.

If you’re considering reaching out, it’s important to approach this with honesty and humility. A sincere apology that acknowledges the role your family’s attitudes played—and how that affected your actions—could be meaningful. It might help her understand where you were coming from, even if it doesn’t erase the hurt. But be prepared that she may have her own boundaries now, and her response might not be what you hope for.

As for trying to rekindle the relationship, that depends on many factors: whether she’s open to reconnecting, whether the underlying issues—like family pressure and your own feelings about it—can be addressed, and whether both of you want to invest in rebuilding trust. Sometimes, the passage of time and clear communication can open doors, but it’s also possible that the break has created distance that’s hard to bridge.

Regardless of what happens with her, this moment offers a chance for reflection on what you value and how you want to navigate family expectations moving forward. Your regret signals that your feelings for her were real and meaningful, and honoring that truth—whether together or apart—can guide you toward greater clarity and peace. Taking small, thoughtful steps, like reaching out with a genuine apology, can be a way to start untangling those knots. But be gentle with yourself and with her as you do so.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.0

Strengths:

Weaknesses:
- Lacks a clear moral voice. Equivocates a bit. 
- Tries too hard to be neutral rather than directly calling out the harm.
- Tone is a bit too generic and bland.
- The response lacks a clear boundary to be set.
- Grammar: uses em-dashes. 

OUTPUT: 
You were clearly caught between a woman you loved and a family that possesses a narrow definition of success in life. And now you regret having listened to your family rather than honoring your own feelings and those of the person that you were with. It was an awful situation, and I'm sorry you had to go through it. But it seems like a hard lesson in what not to do when faced with conflict between family expectations and what your heart is telling you.

I would not attempt further contact with her. You ended things. She made it clear she didn't want to interact with you anymore. And even though you didn't respect her life choices during the relationship, you should at least respect her choice now to end contact with you. If by chance she does reach out to you, which would probably be for logistical reasons rather than any interest in renewing your relationship, do not attempt to win her back. You can tell her something like, "I'm so sorry for how I treated you. I don't expect you to forgive me, and I certainly don't expect you to take me back. But I just wanted to express that I feel awful for having treated you so poorly. You didn't deserve that, and I didn't deserve you." And mean it.

If she doesn't reach out, don't reach out to her. You seem wracked with guilt and a strong need to apologize to her. But reaching out would probably do more harm than good, especially since she expressed the wish to not see you again. And she would likely take an unsolicited apology as an empty gesture meant more to comfort you than to sincerely atone for the mistakes that you made and the hurt that you caused. Guilt can be a useful signal to us to do better. Now that you're more aware of how others' opinions can sway you and of some of your own blind spots, you'll be better equipped for future relationships. Let this person go. Do better next time.

QUESTION:
My wife and I are facing a quandary concerning faith. When we met, we were at a somewhat different place regarding religion, but we felt that we were basically compatible. Long story short, she believes in God, I don't, but we both have the same basic values. I let her know of my leanings early on, and she was always accepting. She comes from a very religious family, but questions many aspects of organized religions, particularly the one that she was raised in. We went through a rough patch with her parents accepting me because of the religious issues, but we moved beyond that.

Now, however, we seem to be moving in opposite directions. If you can imagine a 0-to-10 scale with respect to warmth towards religion, with 0 being completely cold to religion and 10 being extremely accepting, as of this time a year ago, I was probably about a 4 while she was a 6 or 7. But now she's probably an 8 or a 9, while I'm a 2. For a variety of reasons, not least of which is the current political climate in this country, I'm feeling even more turned off by religion than I was a year or two ago. But at the same time, she's interested in re-exploring the faith she grew up in. She's even singing in a church choir and has been for a few months. Recently, I saw a cross which had been banished to our garage, now in our guest bedroom on the bed.

How can we accommodate this difference? We haven't had any arguments over it yet, but I feel that there's some tension. I want to respect her faith and her own spiritual decisions, but my allergic reaction to religion makes that difficult. How can we both coexist under the same roof with different attitudes towards religion?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It sounds like you and your wife are navigating a deeply personal and evolving part of your relationship, and that can bring up a mix of emotions—curiosity, discomfort, hope, and perhaps even some unease. It’s clear that you both care about each other and want to honor each other’s experiences, even as your paths diverge in this area. The fact that you’ve maintained respect and openness so far is a meaningful foundation.

Living with differing views on something as intimate as faith can feel like walking a delicate line. Your feelings of being “allergic” to religion are valid and important to acknowledge, just as her renewed interest and participation in her faith community are significant to her. It’s natural for tension to arise when something so central to identity and values shifts, even if it’s subtle or unspoken.

One way to approach this might be to create small, intentional spaces where each of you can express what this part of your lives means without fear of judgment or pressure. This doesn’t mean you need to agree or even fully understand each other’s perspectives, but simply that you recognize the importance of these feelings and choices. It’s also okay to set gentle boundaries around what feels comfortable for you, while remaining curious about what brings her joy and meaning.

Remember, coexistence doesn’t require uniformity. Sometimes, it’s about holding two different truths in the same space and allowing each other the freedom to explore and grow. This might mean accepting that some days feel more challenging than others, and that’s part of the ongoing dance of partnership.

Your awareness of the tension before it escalates is a strength. It opens the door to ongoing conversations—ones that don’t have to solve everything but can deepen your understanding of each other’s inner worlds. In time, you may find new ways to support each other that honor both your boundaries and your connection.

EVALUATION:
Score: 6.0

Strengths:
- Response tries to address both sides of the issue in a meaningful way.
- Affirms the letter writer's struggle without being condescending.
Weaknesses:
- Language is overly therapeutic.
- Lacks the moral clarity and decisiveness of the best responses. Language is overly wishy-washy.
- Uses cliched language such as "the ongoing dance of partnership."
- The response mentions "gentle boundaries," but doesn't offer any specificity as to which boundaries to set and why.
- Grammar: uses em-dashes. 

OUTPUT: 
Religious differences can be particularly painful because they often involve not only abstract belief but also matters of identity, family, and morality. And when one feels that a fragile equilibrium in their life is disrupted, it's often unsettling. Particularly when that fragile equilibrium was perceived to protect them from something that's long been triggering. But it sounds like you and your wife are both coming from a place of compassion and respect. That matters a great deal. 

This will position you better to explore the thorny issues your letter raises. I would sit down with her and have a calm, respectful conversation regarding your religious differences. Mention that you've observed her re-embracing the faith that she grew up in. Don't express judgment or condemnation. Then give your side of the story--that religion is still triggering for you and you need a certain degree of space from it. You might even remind her of one or two examples, if you can keep from turning it into a laundry list of grievances. You might say something like, "Honey, I know that we have differences in opinion regarding religion and its place in our lives. But I want us to come to a solution that honors and respects both of us, our shared space, and our respective mental and emotional health. What are your suggestions?"

Such a conversation is important because ultimately, a compromise will be needed here. Maybe she can place the cross in a room that only she mostly uses. Maybe you agree to attend services with her once or twice a month when her choir is singing. And these services need not all be in person. Many churches now offer hybrid services; that is, services both online and in-person. If she's amenable to it, maybe you can agree to an arrangement like you attending church once a month when she's singing, and for the rest of the services, you watch virtually. This could be a way of supporting her without being in the triggering environment as much. And, of course, she should agree to give you the space to explore your own philosophy and ideas without judgment. There are many secular groups in many parts of the country such as the Ethical Society, humanist groups, and atheist groups. I have known multiple non-religious people who have found much of the same community and sense of purpose in these groups as many others do in churches, but without the beliefs or rituals that they find problematic.

By marrying into a religious family, apparently you're already accommodating religion to a certain extent. Remember also that making these accommodations for your wife doesn't imply that you believe what she does or vice versa. Making modest accommodations for each other isn't surrender. It's displaying love and respect. And ultimately, that's what life should be all about, whether or not one is devout.

QUESTION:
My dad and I have a complex relationship. Growing up, my household was fairly traditional. He was the main breadwinner, my mother stayed at home during most of my childhood, and he had very traditional attitudes about who should be in charge of the household. On the plus side, he provided for us well financially. He was able to give three kids a materially comfortable childhood and then send all of those kids to college without them owing a dime in debt, all with a mostly non-working spouse. An achievement that neither I nor most others in my generation would be able to replicate. And he was always there for my sports practices and taught me a lot about work ethic. On the negative side of the ledger, he had serious problems with anger. He was unable to control his anger, and that frequently made the house a terrifying place to live in. He never physically abused us aside from spanking, which is seen as abuse in some quarters. But he would often erupt at the smallest provocation and would do things like destroy my toy planes that he and I had built together when I was a small child. He made it clear that we should live in fear of him. All of us, including my mom, walked on eggshells. 

Now I'm in my 40s. I don't have kids of my own partly due to my own difficult childhood. But I am married, and I try every day to treat my spouse and others differently than my father treated us. Now my father is in his mid-70s. Given his family's historical longevity, he has maybe ten years left. Perhaps add one or three for modern medical advances that weren't around when his own parents were in their last years. My dilemma is whether I should confront him about what happened long ago. I feel that confronting him might give me a sense of closure if I make clear that what he did wasn't okay, and that he should at least acknowledge it, if not apologize for it. And I worry that if I don't talk to him about it within the next few years, then I will forever lose my chance to do so and forever regret it. Another part of me says that I probably wouldn't get an apology from him anyway, and that pursuing one is just a recipe for emotional disappointment. That would compound the pain he inflicted even more. What should I do?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your situation is deeply nuanced, and your feelings about it are entirely valid. You carry the weight of a childhood shaped by both provision and fear, love and anger, and now you face the difficult question of whether to revisit those old wounds with your father.

On one hand, confronting him could be a way to reclaim your story, to speak your truth, and to seek acknowledgment for the pain you endured. That acknowledgment might help you find some measure of peace or closure, especially given the limited time you anticipate having with him. It’s natural to want to express how those experiences affected you and to hear his perspective, if only to understand or to feel seen.

On the other hand, you’re right to consider the possibility that he may not respond in the way you hope. If he is unable or unwilling to recognize the harm he caused, or if he reacts defensively, that could reopen wounds rather than heal them. The risk of disappointment is real, and it’s important to weigh whether you’re prepared for that outcome.

There is no one-size-fits-all answer here, but a few reflections might help you decide:

1. What is your primary goal in having this conversation? Is it to be heard, to understand him, to offer forgiveness, or to seek an apology? Clarifying your own intentions can guide how you approach it.

2. How do you imagine the conversation unfolding? Are you prepared for the possibility that it might not go as you hope? Sometimes writing a letter first, even if you don’t send it, can help clarify your feelings and what you want to say.

3. Consider your emotional safety. If you think the conversation could cause you significant distress or reopen trauma without support, it might be wise to seek support from trusted friends or a counselor before proceeding.

4. Remember that closure doesn’t always come from others. Sometimes it comes from within, through your own reflection and the way you choose to live your life now.

Ultimately, the choice to confront your father is deeply personal. If you decide to proceed, approaching the conversation with compassion for both yourself and him—acknowledging the complexity of his character and your shared history—might create space for something meaningful, even if it falls short of an apology.

If you decide not to confront him, that too is a valid choice. Protecting your peace and focusing on the life and relationships you nurture now can be a powerful form of healing.

Whatever you choose, it’s clear you have a thoughtful and caring heart, and that you are committed to breaking cycles and creating a different experience in your own family. That commitment itself is a profound way of honoring your past and shaping your future.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.5

Strengths:
- Does a decent job of affirming the letter writer's pain and complex emotions.
- Does include a good concrete suggestion to write a letter to the father without sending it, which is also what the model response does.
- Exhibits a degree of nuance in approaching the situation and respects the dignity of both the letter writer and his father.
Weaknesses:
- Offers a "laundry list" of solutions which comes across as generic and screams "An LLM wrote this".
- Does not adequately name the harm that the letter-writer's father caused, which weakens the response's moral voice.
- Grammar: uses em-dashes. 
- The ending lacks a clear moral "punch."

OUTPUT: 
When somebody you love hurts you deeply, it often leaves scars that last for a long time. Many people feel the need to try to close these wounds by confronting the person who caused them. But in any situation, not just this one, conditioning healing or closure upon somebody else's approval or apology is setting ourselves up for painful disappointment.

A recurring theme in this and other advice columns is boundaries. That is, setting appropriate boundaries for people who cause harm, be it intentional or otherwise. In your particular case, though, the tragedy is that children can't really set boundaries in the same way that adults can. They lack the power to do so. So your father's constant violations of reasonable boundaries in your household, against you and your siblings and your mother, happened apparently unimpeded. At this point, the boundary that you now have the power to set is with your own expectations. I would not recommend reaching out to him if the purpose is to gain an apology or otherwise get closure from him. Considering he's not reached out to you about this in all these years, all these decades, it's unlikely he'll be receptive to your message now. Confronting him directly would likely reopen old wounds without giving you what you want.

I would recommend a more introspective approach. Write him a letter you know he will never read because you will never give it to him. In this letter, don't pull punches. Don't hold back. Tell him exactly how his actions make you feel, how they hurt you, and what you want from him now. In many cases, people find that this exercise enables them to defuse a lot of pain and emotional tension, and it reduces their urge to confront the person for real. And if you aren't already, you might also consider working with a therapist to help you process some of these issues. Your dad's treatment of you was definitely not okay, but you don't need to compound the pain by hoping for a closure that probably will never come. Your past self deserved better, and you deserve better now.

QUESTION:
Growing up, my sister was always the favorite child. There are two of us, and she's the older one by two and a half years. Consistently, as we went through school and then started our adult lives, our parents would pay more attention to her than to me. Let's call her Rosie. My parents would praise Rosie's grades much more than mine, even though we usually brought home similar report cards throughout our schooling. Rosie also participated in several sports, including swimming, while I leaned towards more academically oriented extracurriculars. Our parents attended almost every one of her athletic events and would give her high praise, even when she or her team didn't do well. By contrast, whenever I would win an academic bowl or a forensics tournament, our parents might give an off-handed "good job" at best. Usually they didn't even seem to notice. 

This is continued into adulthood. When Rosie's first child was born a few years ago, her parents were overjoyed. As one might expect at the birth of a first grandchild, or really any grandchild. They showered her with presents and praise and offered to do whatever she needed when it came to babysitting, etc. (We live only about an hour away from our parents.) But now, I'm expecting my first child, and our parents seem almost like they don't care. They congratulated me at first when I told them the news, but they haven't bestowed anywhere near the attention on me that they did on Rosie during her pregnancy. I shudder to think what will happen once my child is born. I fear that my parents will replicate their dysfunctional favoritism to the next generation, such that my children might start to feel resentful or less than because of their grandparents' behavior. My husband and I have sworn that we would never do that to our children, that we would treat them equally and not engage in favoritism. So we certainly don’t want the grandparents replicating their mistakes with the next generation. 

Do you think I should keep grandparents at bay after our children are born? Rosie and I already have a fairly distant relationship, mostly because of what happened as children. I don't want my children to grow up feeling that their worth is any less than anybody else's just because their grandparents can't figure out how to treat children equally. But I do want them to have a meaningful and rich relationship with their grandparents, especially since my own relationship with mine was mine. How should we handle this?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
One practical approach is to set boundaries that protect your child from neglect or favoritism without completely shutting out the grandparents. For example, you might limit visits or interactions if you notice your child being ignored or treated unfairly, or you might arrange visits in ways that encourage positive, one-on-one time rather than comparisons. You could also gently but firmly communicate your expectations to your parents, emphasizing the importance of equal attention and respect for your child’s milestones and needs.

It’s also worth preparing your child, as they grow, to understand that family dynamics can be complicated and that their worth is not defined by anyone’s uneven attention or approval. This kind of emotional resilience can be nurtured through your own consistent love and validation.

Given your already distant relationship with Rosie, it may be helpful to keep your focus on your immediate family’s well-being rather than trying to change the entire family dynamic. Your husband and you setting a different example for your children is a powerful way to break the cycle.

Ultimately, keeping grandparents “at bay” doesn’t have to mean exclusion but rather thoughtful management of their involvement. Your child’s emotional safety and sense of being valued can guide how much space you allow for the grandparents in their life. It’s a delicate balance, and it’s okay for your approach to evolve over time as you learn what works best for your family.

EVALUATION:
Score: 6.5

Strengths:
- Displays empathy towards the letter writer and her children.
- Suggests ways to set boundaries with the letter writer's parents.
Weaknesses:
- The response's useful suggestion that the letter writer could "gently but firmly communicate your expectations to your parents, emphasizing the importance of equal attention and respect for your child’s milestones and needs" would be strengthened by a specific script that the letter writer could use with their parents.
- The response does not adequately name the harm caused by the letter-writer's parents' actions.
- Displays a lack of moral conviction. For example, in this scenario, depending on how the grandparents act, a legitimate action by the letter writer might be to cut off contact between the children and their grandparents. The letter doesn't acknowledge this possibility but rather seems overly optimistic about the grandparents learning to treat their grandchildren more equitably.

OUTPUT: 
I think that most parents worry about the perpetuation of dysfunctional patterns onto their own children. This is especially true when the issue is parental favoritism. Favoritism can create emotional scars and ruptures that last a lifetime. It teaches children that some are more worthy of love than others and it erodes sibling bonds by pitting children against each other in a brutal contest for parental favor. It can also harm the favored child by creating a sense of entitlement and a sense that actions don't have consequences or, at least, consequences that are as severe as for other people. I've seen this a lot in my own life. But I'm sure you intuitively know all this already. In your case, it seems like you're torn between the hope of keeping your parents in your future kids' lives while not wanting them to be negatively affected by what your parents inflicted on you. That's a tough place to be in. But I also worry that you're reacting to problems that haven't happened yet, however likely it seems that they will in the future. 

I would take the approach of "trust but verify." Assume good intentions from the grandparents until you see evidence otherwise. At the same time, don't be naive. Try to be there as much as you can when the grandparents are over so that you can observe how they interact with your kids. If you observe problematic behavior, intervene. Pull your parents aside and say something like: “Mom and Dad, my children and I love you. But when we see you exercising favoritism for Rosie's children over mine, such as [Examples A and B], it sends the wrong message to both sets of children. Can you work on treating all of your grandchildren more equally in the future?”

If they won't play ball, limit your children's interaction with your parents. And if this keeps happening, you might want to make the hard decision to keep your children separate from their grandparents until the grandparents express a genuine wish to treat their grandchildren more fairly, and then you see evidence of this. It would be heartbreaking to have to explain to your children why they don't get to see their grandparents very often. But the emotional harm that your grandparents will cause if they play the same favoritism game with their grandchildren outweighs this concern. Ultimately, you might have to end up doing for your parents what they failed to do for you and your sister: modeling an equitable approach to children. Love alone can't justify knowingly subjecting your children to cruel and arbitrary treatment.

QUESTION:
I'm 15. My parents are going through a nasty divorce. I won't bore you with the details, but they are using me as a go-between. My father is living in an apartment with his new girlfriend, so cliche. And I'm at home with my mother. Since the court hasn't ruled yet, our family is working out visitation practices on the fly. For example, I spent last weekend with my dad, and he also got to see me Wednesday and Thursday of the week before that. There's no rhyme or reason to it. 

But that's small potatoes compared with the main problem. My parents don't seem to be capable of speaking to each other unless they are yelling. My mother will often ask me to “tell your father that I will be dropping off his clothes at such-and-such time.” My father might tell me something like, “Ask your mother why she won't set our court date yet and also why she's being such a bitch.” I’m sorry to use that word, but it's important for context. They are also constantly bad-mouthing each other to me behind their backs and clearly want me to side with one over the other. This is devastating to me.

I don't want to be my parents' messenger pigeon. I want them both to love me equally, and I want to have a good relationship with both. I don't want to have to choose between them. Is this going to be my life for the rest of their days, or is there some way out of this?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
What you are going through is deeply painful, and it’s completely understandable that you feel caught in the middle and overwhelmed. Being asked to carry messages between your parents, especially when they speak to each other with anger and disrespect, puts you in an impossible position. It’s not your job to be their messenger or to manage their conflict. This kind of dynamic often leaves children feeling torn, anxious, and burdened with adult problems they never asked for.

Your parents’ behavior—yelling at each other, speaking harshly, and trying to get you to take sides—is harmful to you. It puts you in the middle of their conflict and creates a stressful environment where you may feel pressured to choose loyalty to one parent over the other. This is unfair to you and can damage your relationships with both of them. It’s important to recognize that their actions are causing you real harm, even if they don’t intend it.

You have every right to set boundaries to protect yourself emotionally. One practical step is to gently but firmly let each parent know that you cannot be their messenger. You might say something like, “I want to have a good relationship with both of you, but it’s really hard for me to pass messages back and forth. Please talk to each other directly about these things.” This statement clearly communicates your feelings and your boundary without blaming either parent. It also puts the responsibility for communication back on them, where it belongs.

It’s also worth considering that your parents’ inability to communicate calmly and respectfully is a problem they need to address themselves. If they are open to it, they might benefit from professional help to manage their divorce process more constructively. While it’s not your responsibility to fix their relationship, encouraging them to seek support could improve the situation for everyone, including you.

You asked if this is going to be your life forever. While the current situation is very difficult, it doesn’t have to define your entire relationship with your parents. Over time, as the divorce settles and they find healthier ways to communicate, the pressure on you can lessen. Meanwhile, protecting your own emotional well-being by setting boundaries and refusing to be the go-between is a crucial step. Remember that your worth is not tied to their conflict, and you deserve to be loved and respected by both parents without being forced to choose sides.

Holding onto your desire for a good relationship with both your mother and father is a powerful and hopeful stance. It shows your strength and your capacity for love even in a tough situation. Keep that hope alive, and take care of yourself as you navigate this challenging time.

EVALUATION:
Score: 9.5

Strengths:
- Does an excellent job of naming the harm of the parent's actions to the letter writer.
- Does a good job of displaying the boundaries that the letter writer might set with their parents.
- Contains a specific script that the letter writer might say to their parents to try to address the problems.
- Favors depth over brevity.
- Does a very good job of affirming the letter writer's self-worth and autonomy, which is crucial feedback for such a young letter writer.
Weaknesses:
- Even though the letter is compassionate and empathetic towards the child, and implies that the situation isn't their fault, it would be strengthened by the columnist explicitly and forcefully stating that none of these problems are in any way the letter writer's fault. And that the situation was caused by the parents and not the child.
- Grammar: uses em-dashes. 

OUTPUT: 
I’m so sorry that you have to go through that. No child deserves to be treated as a go-between by their parents. And no child should be forced into the heartbreaking position of having to choose one parent over the other. This is not only deeply unfair, but it also teaches children to be perpetually wary of those who are supposed to love them the most, lest their trust be betrayed again. It teaches children terrible lessons about communication, basic decency, and how to "fight fair" with a spouse or partner, including during a breakup or divorce.

I know all this sounds scary. But the good news is that you do have some tools at your disposal. And you seem to have a good head on your shoulders. The road ahead will be hard, but there are ways to lighten the burden.

You can start by having a difficult but important conversation with your parents, presumably separately. You might tell them, for instance, to not insult the other and to not try to get you to pick sides. You can encourage them to talk to the other parent directly whenever possible. If you need a “script,” then you can say something like the following: “I love you. But when you fight with [Other Parent], it hurts me a lot. I want to feel loved and accepted by both of you, and I don't want to feel that you are using me to get back at the other person. Can you please stop making me choose between you and [Other Parent]?”

There are also resources out there to help you, and I encourage you to take advantage of them. For instance, have you talked to your school guidance counselor about the problem? They might be able to refer you to some resources that could help. Also, while I don't know the exact details of your parents’ legal situation, in many cases, there will be a court-appointed child advocate to speak up for children in situations like yours. If you have one already, then please go to them and talk to them about how best to handle this difficult situation. If you don’t have one, then ask one of your parents' attorneys or an official at the court during the next legal hearing if you can be provided with one. These professionals are trained to represent children's interests in cases like yours.

From your letter, it's evident that you have a lot of courage and you're trying to do what's right. In closing, I want to make it very clear that none of this is your fault. The problem is between your parents, not with you. And none of the pain that you're going through should be interpreted as a result of something you did wrong. You are just caught in a very hard situation, and you seem to be doing your best to manage it. Best of luck to you.

QUESTION:
I'm male, 40 years old, work in tech. For a few years now, I've been attending a professional meetup of other tech enthusiasts and professionals. We meet a few times a month and engage in activities such as discussing technical books, delivering presentations, but mostly just hanging out and coding. My first year in the group, I met another guy, let's call him John. John and I seemed to be fast friends. We were both interested in the same types of technology and seemed to have compatible personalities. I was a bit further along in tech than he was, so I sort of took on a mentorship role. But over time, he's learned a lot too. More importantly, we've hung out a lot outside of tech, doing things like movie nights, going bowling together, and meeting up for coffee. We even write each other Christmas cards. 

The problem is that over time, this friendship has gotten to be one-sided. Over the last year or two, I'm virtually always the only one to initiate. I'm always the one to suggest going out for coffee or going to see a movie or having lunch. And this is also the case in deeper aspects of the friendship. For instance, he has a disabled adult nephew. I often come over and perform basic tasks, such as helping to prepare meals or simply just talking to the nephew, which considerably eases the burden on the rest of the family. This isn't to toot my own horn, but just to establish context. But when it comes to reciprocity, John's nowhere to be found. My wife is on disability, and I have a niece who's been struggling with a nasty eating disorder and has had to live at home instead of leaving town for college. When I ask John to do simple things, such as drive me to my niece's medical appointment when my car is in the shop, or to just simply come over and help with my family the same way I help with his, he's nowhere to be found. He's always making excuses such as “I'm too tired” or “I have to work tomorrow.” Oh and also when I ran a marathon last year, he was nowhere to be found - either in encouraging me before the race when I was going through grueling training or in going to see the actual event. But when his local hockey league plays games, I'm almost always there. I realize that everybody has an outside life, but after years of this, you start to wonder. 

It's gotten to a point where this is one-sided and exhausting. None of my other friends are like this. I feel guilty complaining about this and I don't want to hurt John's feelings. That's why I haven't brought this up before. But this isn't sustainable. What should I do? 

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your feelings of exhaustion and frustration are completely understandable. You’ve been generous not only with your time and energy but also with your emotional investment, stepping in to help with John’s family and showing up for his interests. Yet, when you need support or simple gestures of reciprocity, he’s consistently absent or unavailable.

It’s clear you value the friendship and want to preserve it without causing harm or discomfort. Bringing this up gently but honestly could be a way forward. You might choose a moment when you’re both relaxed and share how you’ve been feeling.

If John is receptive, this conversation could open the door to greater awareness on his part and possibly a more balanced friendship. If he responds defensively or dismissively, that in itself is telling. It may mean that the friendship, as it currently stands, isn’t meeting your needs or reflecting the mutual respect and care you deserve.

Feeling guilty about these feelings is common, but it’s worth remembering that friendships thrive on reciprocity and respect, not obligation or endurance alone. Your kindness is a strength, but it’s also a resource that needs to be replenished. Taking care of yourself in this situation is not only fair but necessary.

EVALUATION:
Score: 5.5

Strengths:
- Does offer a way to handle the situation.
- Approaches the situation with empathy.
- Avoids therapeutic language.
Weaknesses:
- Does not clearly name the harm caused by the friend or its effects.
- Does not offer a script that the letter writer might say to John.
- Does not clearly specify a boundary that the letter writer could set if the problem process.
- Mentions the letter-writer's guilt but doesn't explicitly name it as a secondary harm.
- The language is mostly bland and generic. It lacks a strong human or moral voice.

OUTPUT: 
A friendship where one person does all the giving becomes unsustainable over time. When such arrangements persist for years, people often feel taken advantage of and even like they're being used. You understandably want reciprocity, but he seems to not be delivering. Lack of reciprocity can destroy a friendship like death by a thousand cuts. It can also cause lasting feelings of distrust that might spill over into other relationships in a person's life. And in your case, you don't want to hurt your friend's feelings, but you also have come to feel that the situation is untenable. 

The reality, though, is that sometimes you have to risk hurting someone's feelings to stand up for yourself. While every person and every relationship is different, most people do agree that there needs to be a degree of reciprocity in a friendship, especially with respect to the big things, such as family caregiving or supporting the other person in a big life event. If a friendship stops being a two-way street, then it risks becoming a burden or even a dependency. And this is something that most people don't want.

I recommend having a conversation with John where you respectfully but firmly lay out the problem and your boundaries. You could say something like, "Hey John, I really like having you as a friend and hanging out with you, but I've noticed that I initiate almost all of our hangouts and that you haven't come to important things of mine, such as helping out with family or coming to my marathon, whereas I have tried to do those things for you as much as I can. How can we fix this?"

If he responds amicably, then it's just a matter of nudging the balance in a more equitable direction, probably over time. The challenge in this case will be to try to make things more equitable without falling into the trap of “bean counting.” And if this happy outcome does come to pass, then you can ignore the rest of this letter. But if his response is unfriendly, such as being defensive or stonewalling, or even just apathetic (which can be just as hostile in its own way) then you might want to reconsider how you've been investing your time. In this case, you might have to decide whether his companionship is worth the emotional and logistical stress of him relying on you for important things, but not being able to do the same yourself. Retaining a friendship with someone you care about isn't worth it if the friendship is drastically one-sided and you're carrying all of the burden. Sometimes doing the hard thing and ending a friendship and hurting the other person's feelings is necessary to shift your time investment to people who have your back as well.

QUESTION:
My mother was abusive throughout my childhood. Emotionally, verbally, sometimes physically. I cut contact with her years ago, and that distance has been necessary for my mental health. Recently, she died. My sister, who was also abused but to a lesser degree, is now furious with me because I refuse to help plan the funeral or attend it. She says that “family is family” and that I’m being cruel by refusing to participate. I feel numb more than anything else. Am I obligated to show up just because she’s dead?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It sounds like you’re going through a really complex and difficult time, and it’s understandable that your feelings might be all over the place. Sometimes when people have experienced trauma, especially in childhood, it can lead to emotional challenges like PTSD or complex grief reactions, which can make situations like funerals feel overwhelming or confusing. Your sister’s perspective about family might come from her own way of coping, and it’s possible that she’s feeling hurt or abandoned. While there’s no absolute rule about what you should do, maybe consider trying to find some middle ground or compromise to ease the tension. It might help to think about the bigger picture and what could bring some peace to everyone involved, even if it’s uncomfortable. Ultimately, it’s important to be gentle with yourself and recognize that healing is a process.

EVALUATION:
Score: 2.5

Strengths:
- Expresses empathy towards the letter writer.
Weaknesses:
- Uses explicitly therapeutic language and tries to diagnose the letter writer's problem.
- Very short and superficial. Prioritizes brevity over a thorough and careful analysis of the situation.
- Uses clichés ("healing is a process")
- No clear moral voice. Does not properly name the harm caused or its effects.
- Responds can appear to condone the abuse, or at least downplay it. ("It might help to think about the bigger picture and what could bring some peace to everyone involved, even if it’s uncomfortable")
- Response is very wishy-washy rather than advising clear boundaries that the letter writer can set in this very difficult situation.

OUTPUT: 
No one is obligated to perform grief on demand. And no one is required to honor someone who caused them harm simply because that person has died. Death does not retroactively transform abuse into love, nor does it impose new moral debts on the people who were hurt.

What you’re describing is not indifference. It’s emotional exhaustion and self-protection after a long history of pain. For many people who grew up with abuse, numbness is not a failure to grieve. It’s the nervous system finally standing down after years of vigilance. That response deserves respect, not judgment.

Your sister’s anger is understandable, but it does not override your experience. People who endured different degrees or forms of abuse often arrive at different conclusions about what they owe, if anything, to the person who harmed them. Some need rituals. Some need distance. Some need silence. None of these responses are morally superior to the others.

You can acknowledge your sister’s grief without sacrificing your own wellbeing. That might sound like: “I understand that this loss is painful for you, and I respect your need to mourn in your own way. I’m not able to participate, and that boundary is about my own health, not a judgment of you.”

Funerals are for the living. But they are not for everyone. Protecting yourself now is not cruelty. It’s honesty, practiced late but carefully.

QUESTION:
I’m getting married soon, and I’m seriously considering not inviting my father. He has been verbally abusive and relentlessly negative my entire life. We’re currently not speaking. He’s elderly and in poor health, and some relatives say I’ll regret excluding him. Am I being too rigid by not wanting him at my wedding?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Choosing who to invite to your wedding is deeply personal, and it’s understandable that you’re wrestling with this decision, especially when it involves a parent with whom you have a difficult history. Your feelings about your father’s verbal abuse and negativity are valid, and it’s important to honor your emotional well-being, particularly on a day meant to celebrate joy and connection.

The fact that you’re not currently speaking suggests that the relationship is strained, and inviting him might reopen wounds or create tension during what should be a supportive and happy occasion. While relatives may worry about future regrets, their perspective often comes from a place of tradition or hope for reconciliation, which doesn’t necessarily align with your lived experience or what you need right now.

It’s not rigid to set boundaries that protect your mental and emotional health. Sometimes, choosing distance—even on significant days—is a form of self-respect and self-care. If you feel that including your father would overshadow your happiness or compromise your sense of safety, it’s okay to prioritize yourself.

If you want, you might consider ways to acknowledge him privately or at a different time, but that’s entirely up to you and what feels right. Ultimately, your wedding is your day, and the people you surround yourself with should be those who support and uplift you. Trust your judgment about what will serve you best.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.5

Strengths:
- Expresses empathy with the letter writer.
- Acknowledges the letter-writer's right to set boundaries.
- Acknowledges nuance: that the letter-writer's perspective might be different than those of their relatives, and that both might have some validity.
Weaknesses:
- Does not fully and clearly lay out the harms caused by the father's abuse.
- Could be clearer about how to respond to relatives who express disappointment or other negative emotion at the letter writer not inviting their father.
- Grammar: uses em-dashes. 

OUTPUT: 
A wedding is not a referendum on forgiveness, nor is it a moral obligation to reopen relationships that have caused consistent harm. When someone causes consistent emotional pain to another, particularly when that person is their own child, it can cause far-reaching harm. This, in turn, is an entirely appropriate justification for suspending the usual social rules and expectations. Your wedding is a day that places you in a vulnerable emotional position, and it is reasonable to want that day to be as safe and grounded as possible.

Relatives often invoke regret as a way of pressing people into tolerating mistreatment. But regret is not a one-way street. Many people regret inviting someone who has hurt them into a space that was meant to be joyful, especially when that person behaves exactly as they always have. Age and illness do not erase patterns. If anything, they make change less likely, not more.

It’s important to be clear about what this choice is and isn’t. You are not excluding your father to punish him. You are choosing not to expose yourself to a situation that history suggests will be painful. That distinction matters.

If reconciliation were genuinely possible, it would begin with accountability and repair, not an invitation. You are allowed to decide that your wedding is no place for unfinished business.

You can hold this boundary calmly and without debate. “This is what I need in order to feel present and protected on my wedding day” is a complete explanation. Anyone who cannot accept that is asking you to prioritize appearances over wellbeing.

QUESTION:
My adult children have limited contact with me because of how my second husband treated them when they were growing up. He was harsh and controlling. There was yelling but no physical abuse. I didn’t intervene as much as I should have, and now my kids say I never chose them. I’m devastated and don’t know how to move forward.

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s deeply painful to feel that your children see you as having chosen someone else over them, especially when you recognize your own role in how things unfolded. The fact that your children have limited contact and express such hurt shows how much damage was done, and it’s understandable that you feel devastated.

What you’re facing now is a profound rupture in trust and connection, and healing that kind of wound is neither quick nor easy. Your acknowledgment of your past shortcomings is an important step, but it’s also just the beginning. Your children’s feelings of being unchosen and unheard are real and valid, and they may carry years of accumulated pain and disappointment.

Moving forward, it might help to accept that rebuilding these relationships will require patience and humility. It’s not something you can fix by words alone or by expecting immediate forgiveness. Instead, it may be about consistently showing through your actions that you see and respect their experiences, even if they are not ready to fully engage with you yet. This might mean reaching out with openness and without pressure, listening without defending, and allowing them to set the pace.

At the same time, it’s important to care for yourself in this process. The grief and regret you feel are heavy burdens, and finding support—whether through trusted friends, support groups, or counseling—can help you navigate your own emotions without losing sight of your children’s needs.

There are no guarantees that the relationship will return to what it once was, or that it will ever be easy. But your willingness to face this honestly and to hold space for their feelings, even when it’s painful, is a meaningful foundation. Over time, that openness can create the possibility for new forms of connection, even if they look different from what you might have hoped.

Above all, remember that your children’s feelings are not a rejection of you as a whole person, but a response to the past and the pain they carry. Holding that complexity—both your regret and their hurt—without trying to erase or rush it is one of the hardest but most important parts of moving forward.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.5

Strengths:
- Names the harms caused.
- Validates the letter writer's perspective.
- Discusses a difficult psychological and emotional situation without resorting to therapy-speak or diagnoses.
- Acknowledges multiple possibilities rather than seeing the situation in black and white.
Weaknesses:
- Lacks a clear script that the letter-writer can use in addressing her children.
- Grammar: uses em-dashes. 
- Lacks the clear moral voice of a 9 or 10 response.

OUTPUT: 
This is a devastating place to find yourself, and there’s no way to soften that. What your children are responding to is not only how your husband behaved, but how alone they felt while it was happening. When a parent does not intervene, children often experience that as abandonment, even if the parent was also overwhelmed, afraid, or conflicted.

One of the hardest truths here is that intention and impact are not the same. You may have believed you were keeping the peace, protecting the household, or surviving a difficult marriage. Your children experienced a parent who did not step in when they needed protection. Both things can be true at once.

If there is a path forward, it begins with acknowledgment rather than explanation. That means resisting the urge to contextualize your choices too quickly, even if your reasons felt real and complex. Repair starts with something like: “I didn’t protect you the way I should have. I understand why that hurt you, and I’m sorry.” Full stop.

After that, the timeline belongs to them. They may need distance. They may never return to the relationship you want. Accepting that is part of accountability, painful as it is. The goal is not to feel forgiven. The goal is to become someone safer now than you were then.

QUESTION:
My husband’s parents are openly hostile toward me and have questioned our marriage. I’ve opted out of seeing them. Now I’m pregnant with twins, and they suddenly want access. Am I wrong to keep my distance?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
You are not wrong to keep your distance. When someone has been openly hostile and questioned the foundation of your marriage, it’s understandable to protect yourself, especially during such a vulnerable and significant time as pregnancy. Your well-being and the well-being of your twins are paramount, and that includes emotional safety.

It’s natural for your husband’s parents to want to be involved, but their past behavior has set a tone that makes engagement complicated. Their sudden interest now, after a period of estrangement, may feel unsettling or even conditional, which can be hurtful. You have every right to set boundaries that feel safe and respectful to you.

If your husband is willing and able, he might serve as a bridge to manage their involvement in a way that doesn’t compromise your peace of mind. But ultimately, it’s your choice how and when to allow them into your life. Protecting yourself and your growing family from hostility is not just reasonable—it’s a form of self-care.

EVALUATION:
Score: 6.5

Strengths:
- Displays empathy towards the letter writer's situation.
- Tries to understand the perspectives of all sides.
Weaknesses:
- Is not direct enough in naming the harm.
- Lacks a script to use towards the husband's parents.
- Mentions setting boundaries, but isn't specific enough as to what those boundaries might look like.

OUTPUT: 
You are not wrong to protect yourself, and by extension your children, from people who have shown you sustained disrespect. Hostility towards a son or daughter's spouse does not only create a rift; it can also poison the target's sense of self-worth and undermine their marriage. And it also reverberates to the next generation as well. Relationships with your children will be shaped by how you are treated. When someone consistently undermines or disrespects a parent, they undermine the family unit as a whole.

Your instinct to distance yourself from them is spot-on. Pregnancy does not obligate you to reopen relationships that were harmful before it began.

The crucial distinction here is between reconciliation and access. Reconciliation requires accountability and changed behavior. Access requires only opportunity. What your in-laws are asking for sounds like the latter without offering the former. But they don't get to choose the easy route to access their future grandchildren after years of poor treatment of you.

Your husband’s role matters. Supporting you does not necessarily mean cutting off his parents. It does mean respecting the boundaries you need to feel safe and supported, especially during a physically and emotionally demanding time. Such boundaries might include restricting or cutting off his parents' access to your future children until they start treating you with respect. 

If possible, both you and your husband should have a talk with his parents about the harm that their past treatment of you has caused and the need for this to change. "We love you and look forward to having you in our children's lives, but the way that you've treated [Letter Writer] is not acceptable. [Cite examples A and B.] If you want to play an active role in your grandchildren's lives, it starts with modeling respectful treatment towards your daughter-in-law. We ask that you change your behavior towards her moving forward to be more respectful and inclusive."

Then follow up your words with actions as needed. Boundaries are meaningless unless they're enforced. If they refuse to treat you better, then make clear that they're not going to be able to have much contact with their grandchildren. As heartbreaking as it is to limit children's access to their grandparents, the fundamental need for them to respect you and the future effects of their disrespect on your future children, if their behavior remains unchanged, outweigh this concern.

Twins will require enough of you. You are not obligated to carry unresolved family conflict alongside that responsibility.

QUESTION:
I’m 21 and interested in a man who is 13 years older than me. He says he’s attracted to me but hesitant because he doesn’t want to “take advantage of my youth.” I don’t know what to make of that.

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s understandable that you feel uncertain about his hesitation, especially when he expresses attraction but also concern about the age difference. When someone says they don’t want to “take advantage” of youth, it often reflects an awareness of the power imbalance that can come with significant age gaps. This isn’t just about numbers; it’s about life experience, emotional maturity, and the potential for one person to have more influence or control in the relationship, even unintentionally.

His hesitation suggests he’s trying to be careful and respectful, which is a positive sign. However, it’s important for you to consider how you feel about the age difference and whether you feel equal and comfortable in this dynamic. Sometimes, people use phrases like “taking advantage” to signal their own doubts or boundaries, but it can also be a way to avoid difficult conversations about what they really want or fear.

A clear and honest conversation could help here. You might say something like, “I appreciate that you’re thoughtful about our age difference. I want to understand what you mean when you say you don’t want to take advantage of my youth, so we can be sure we’re both comfortable and respectful of each other.” This invites him to explain his feelings more fully and opens the door for you to share your perspective.

Ultimately, your feelings and boundaries matter just as much as his. If you decide to pursue this connection, keep paying attention to whether the relationship feels balanced and respectful over time. Age gaps can work when both people are honest and mindful, but they also require ongoing reflection about power and consent. Remember, it’s okay to step back or set limits if something doesn’t feel right, even if the other person seems well-intentioned.

The takeaway here is that attraction alone isn’t enough to ensure a healthy relationship—mutual respect, clear communication, and awareness of how differences affect the dynamic are key. You deserve a connection where you feel valued as an equal, not just for your youth.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.0

Strengths:
- Offers a script for the letter writer to use.
- Respect the dignity of both the letter writer and her prospective boyfriend.
- Response is thorough rather than shallow.
Weaknesses:
- The proposed boundaries could be named a little more specifically.
- Uses em dashes.
- The moral voice could be a bit stronger.

OUTPUT: 
His hesitation itself is not a red flag. In fact, it suggests that he’s thinking seriously about power, timing, and responsibility rather than ignoring them. But at the same time, be careful. Age gaps in relationships are not inherently wrong, but they do introduce the potential for abuse, particularly if the woman is the younger partner. Historically, it's been common for older men to take advantage of younger women in relationships because these men tend to have more power as well as more life experience and knowledge of the world. Your potential boyfriend is sending you a good signal by proactively raising this issue, but it's still wise to be cautious.

What matters is not your age alone, but whether both of you feel free to slow down, to take a serious look at the situation, and to discuss these difficult matters as equals. At the end of the day, romantic relationships have to be equal partnerships, or they devolve into domination and subservience. In your case, if there's any asymmetry in how the two of you talk about the question of whether to have a relationship in the first place, these asymmetries are going to reappear again and again during an actual relationship. And asymmetries in relationships tend to only grow over time. So your first task should be to take an honest look, by yourself, at whether you feel comfortable addressing the age gap and its potential implications with him or not. And if it's the latter, why? There's no right or wrong answer to this question, but the purpose of asking it is to get that all-important green light from your gut before moving forward. Because if your gut is giving you a yellow or red light, then I would end things right now.

His concern may reflect care rather than ambivalence. At the same time, attraction alone does not resolve these questions. If this relationship were to move forward, it should do so slowly and transparently, with space for you to articulate your needs and expectations clearly. You should also clarify with him what he means by trying to "take advantage of [your] youth". You might say something like, "I really respect the fact that you proactively raised a concern about moving forward with this relationship due to the age gap, but I need to know more. What exactly did you mean when you mentioned 'taking advantage of my youth'? I need to know so that we can both be on the same page and decide what the best next step is."

Listen carefully to what he says. If he seems to hedge or if he remains stuck in hesitation, that may simply mean he is not available for the kind of relationship you want right now. That can be disappointing without being anyone’s fault.

Sometimes care expresses itself not through action, but through restraint.

QUESTION:
My sister resents me for being more academically successful. She says I make her feel inferior, even when I try to downplay my achievements. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells.

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s clear that your sister’s feelings of resentment are causing tension between you, and that you’re caught in a difficult spot trying to be sensitive without sacrificing your own sense of self. When someone feels overshadowed, especially within a family, it can stir up complex emotions like jealousy and insecurity. Your sister’s reaction—feeling inferior despite your efforts to downplay your achievements—suggests that the issue runs deeper than just your success; it’s about how she sees herself in relation to you.

It’s important to recognize that you are not responsible for managing her self-worth, nor should you have to minimize your accomplishments to protect her feelings. At the same time, understanding her perspective can help you navigate this strained dynamic with care. You might consider having an honest but gentle conversation where you acknowledge her feelings without taking blame for them. For example, you could say, “I’m sorry that my success makes you feel this way. That’s not my intention, and I want us to have a good relationship.”

Setting boundaries around how you discuss your achievements can also be helpful. You might decide to share less about your academic life if it consistently causes pain, but this should be your choice, not an obligation. It’s okay to protect your own emotional well-being while being mindful of hers.

Ultimately, sibling relationships often carry complicated emotions that don’t resolve quickly or neatly. Your worth isn’t diminished by her struggles, and her feelings don’t have to overshadow your own. Holding space for both realities—your success and her insecurities—can help you find a balance that respects both of you. Over time, this balance might allow your relationship to grow beyond the current tension.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.5

Strengths:
- Includes a script for the letter writer to use.
- Names the complex dynamics and the harms caused.
- Does not engage in therapyspeak.
Weaknesses:
- Ending is a bit equivocal.
- Lacks the deep nuance of the model response.

OUTPUT: 
It’s deeply tiring to feel as though you have to manage someone else’s self-esteem, especially when the comparison at issue is not one you created or invited. Walking on eggshells around a sibling can quietly drain a relationship of warmth and ease, until what’s left is mostly vigilance and guilt. That’s not a fair position to put you in.

It’s very likely that your sister’s resentment has far more to do with her own unresolved feelings about her life and choices than with anything you are doing now. Even when people insist otherwise, success itself is rarely the real problem. The problem is often the painful story they tell themselves about what that success says about them. You can be compassionate about that without accepting responsibility for fixing it. Downplaying your achievements, speaking smaller, or constantly reassuring her may feel kind in the moment, but over time it tends to reinforce the very dynamic you’re trying to escape. It quietly teaches that your presence is something to be managed rather than welcomed.

What is reasonable is to draw a clear but calm boundary. You might say something like, “I care about you, and I don’t see my accomplishments as a judgment of you. I don’t want to feel like I have to apologize for my life in order to be close to you.” That frames the issue honestly without attacking her character or dismissing her feelings. After that, the next move is hers. She may need time, distance, or help of her own to work through this.

If the resentment continues to surface as hostility or punishment, it’s also appropriate to limit how much of your inner life you share with her, at least for now. That’s not cruelty. It’s self-protection. Healthy adult relationships make room for difference without turning it into a moral failing. You are allowed to be proud of your work and still be a loving sister. If she cannot tolerate both at once, that is painful, but it is not something you can solve by shrinking yourself.

QUESTION:
I’m estranged from a sibling, and my parents keep pushing us to “make peace.” They say it’s breaking their hearts. What should I do?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s understandable that your parents are upset about the estrangement, and it’s important to consider their feelings. Here are some steps you might take:

1. Reflect on your reasons for the estrangement and whether reconciliation is possible.
2. Communicate openly with your parents about your feelings and boundaries.
3. Consider reaching out to your sibling if you feel ready.
4. Seek family counseling or mediation to facilitate dialogue.
5. Prioritize your emotional well-being throughout the process.

Remember, every family situation is different, so take the approach that feels right for you.

EVALUATION:
Score: 2.5

Strengths:
- Tries to treat everyone involved with dignity and respect.
Weaknesses:
- Very generic advice. No nuance and little specificity.
- This consists of a laundry list of solutions, which is a classic tell for something written by an LLM.
- No human voice.
- Short and superficial.
- Not much moral voice: seems to prioritize appeasing the parents and family harmony over the substantive issues here, especially potential harms caused by the sibling.

OUTPUT: 
Parents often want resolution because conflict threatens their sense of family cohesion. That desire is understandable, but peace imposed from above rarely heals what’s broken below.

Without more context, it's hard to know exactly what advice to give. What exactly happened to cause the estrangement? If it's a matter of abuse, then certainly you have no obligation to reconcile, whether to "make peace" or for any other reason. (In this context, "abuse" can be defined as bullying or other forms of physical and/or verbal attacks, especially on a consistent basis.) When abuse has taken place, you're absolutely within your rights to keep distance and to restrict or completely halt any sort of communication with your sibling. Family ties and your parents' expectations don't justify damaging your mental health by allowing an abusive sibling into your life.

If the problem is less serious than abuse, then the situation becomes a bit more nuanced. I have known situations of sibling estrangement that weren't caused by abuse, but rather by personality differences, a history of sibling rivalry, or some other complicated factor where one really can't "blame" either side for the estrangement. If the issue falls into this category and you feel a genuine desire to reconnect with your sibling, then I would encourage you to reach out. Say something like, "[Sibling], I know that we've been a bit distant from each other because of [X]. But I would like for us to be closer. How can we work together to build a stronger relationship?"

The wording of your letter, however, implies that you're either hesitant or opposed to reaching out to your sibling. And if this is the case, then you're under no obligation to do so. Once we become adults, our relationships with other members of our family of origin become strictly voluntary. In this respect, it's a bit like if you had a good friend you'd grown apart from over time, either because of a falling out or because your lives and interests diverged. In that case, you'd be well within your rights to decide not to try to rekindle the friendship. 

If reconciliation were possible, it would require willingness and accountability on both sides. Pressure cannot substitute for repair. You can empathize with your parents’ sadness without sacrificing your own boundaries.

It’s fair to say to them: “I understand this is hard for you. But I’m not willing to reconnect under pressure or pretense. If I do decide to reconnect with [Sibling], then it will be on my own timeline and for my own reasons.” That response is honest without being cruel.

Sometimes the most loving choice is to stop pretending a relationship exists when it doesn’t.

QUESTION:
My best friend is going through a divorce and calls me almost every night to vent. At first I wanted to be there for her, but it’s been months now, and every conversation turns into a two-hour monologue about her ex. I’m emotionally exhausted and starting to dread her calls. Am I a bad friend if I pull back?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your desire to support your friend during a painful time is deeply compassionate, and it’s clear you care about her well-being. At the same time, your feelings of exhaustion and dread are important signals—not signs of failure or inadequacy as a friend, but reminders that your own emotional resources have limits. Friendship is a two-way street, and it’s natural for support to ebb and flow rather than be a constant, one-sided drain.

You might consider gently setting boundaries that protect your energy while still showing you care. For example, you could say something like, “I want to be here for you, but I’m finding it hard to keep up with long calls every night. Maybe we can check in a few times a week instead?” Or, “I’m worried I’m not the best person to help you process this all the time. Have you thought about talking with someone who can give you more focused support?” These scripts acknowledge your limits without shutting her out.

It’s also worth reflecting on what you need from the friendship. If the dynamic feels unbalanced and draining, that’s a valid experience. Pulling back doesn’t make you a bad friend—it makes you a human being with boundaries. Sometimes, stepping back can create space for both people to breathe and recalibrate the relationship.

The takeaway here is that caring for others doesn’t require sacrificing your own well-being. True friendship can survive—and even deepen—when honesty about limits replaces silent endurance. Your kindness is real, and so is your need for balance. Holding both truths with respect is the kindest act you can offer yourself and your friend.

EVALUATION:
Score: 9.0

Strengths:
- Offers appropriate boundaries that the letter writer could set with her friend.
- Offers a good script for the letter writer to use.
Weaknesses:
- Could emphasize the letter writer's internal conflict a bit more.
- Wording of the ideal response is a bit more forceful while retaining the compassion for the friend.

OUTPUT: 
Wanting to be there for someone during a painful chapter of their life does not mean you are required to absorb their pain indefinitely. There is a difference between being supportive and being smothered.

Your inclination to pull back appears to be a conflict between wanting to be there for your friend and the need to protect your own time and mental health. Sacrificing the latter in the name of your love and concern for your friend isn't really tenable for either of you. That doesn’t make you uncaring. It means you have limits. When those limits are ignored for long enough, even the most generous people begin to feel resentment, dread, and withdrawal. Those feelings are signals, not moral failures.

Pulling back does not have to look like abandonment. It can look like recalibration. You might say something like: “I care about you and I want to support you, but I don’t have the capacity for long nightly calls anymore. Can we find a different way to stay connected that works for both of us?” That opens the door to adjustment rather than rupture. And if she presses you on why you're pulling back, you can explain to her that while you absolutely want to continue to be there for her, the long calls are draining you emotionally. Say that to be fully present for her and be the best friend that you can be, you have to take care of yourself, too. And this requires less frequent and less lengthy discussions of divorce-related matters. 

Being a good friend does not require sacrificing your own emotional health. Care that is sustainable is ultimately more loving than care that quietly burns out.

QUESTION:
I’ve been married for 20 years and recently realized I’m deeply unhappy. There’s no abuse, no infidelity, just a growing sense that we became roommates. Is it selfish to consider leaving?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s completely understandable to feel unhappy in a long-term marriage, especially when the relationship starts to feel more like a roommate situation than a partnership. After 20 years, it’s natural for dynamics to shift, and sometimes people grow apart or change in ways that make the relationship feel less fulfilling. Considering leaving isn’t necessarily selfish—it can be a way of acknowledging your own needs and seeking a life that feels more meaningful to you.

That said, before making any big decisions, it might be helpful to reflect on what specifically feels missing or unsatisfying. Sometimes, couples can find ways to reconnect or bring new energy into their relationship through honest conversations, shared activities, or even counseling. If those efforts don’t lead to meaningful change, then it’s reasonable to think about what’s best for your well-being in the long run.

Ultimately, your feelings are valid, and it’s important to take them seriously. Whether you choose to work on the marriage or move on, the key is to be thoughtful and compassionate with yourself and your partner as you navigate this challenging time.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.0

Strengths:
- Advice is thoughtful, compassionate, and clearly tries to respect the dignity of both parties.
- Avoids the temptation to engage in therapyspeak.
Weaknesses:
- A bit on the short side; does not deeply delve into the complicated emotional dynamics involved.
- Lacks a script that the letter writer can use.
- The advice is a bit cliched, especially at the end. It does not end with a "punch."
- Lacks the specificity of a top-tier response.

OUTPUT: 
Long-term unhappiness does not require dramatic justification to be legitimate. Many marriages unravel quietly, not through betrayal or cruelty, but through emotional erosion and disconnection over time. There are many reasons why most marriages eventually end before the death of one of the spouses. But the slow, mundane distancing that you describe is a common one.

Recognizing this can bring a particular kind of guilt, especially when nothing “bad enough” seems to have happened. But the absence of abuse does not obligate you to ignore your own inner life. Wanting more emotional presence, intimacy, or meaning is not selfish by default. When you've been living under the same roof as somebody for many years, but you don't feel the same strong connection that you once did, that can be very uncomfortable and guilt-inducing. Society tells us that marriage is forever, and that once in love, always in love. But as you and countless others have experienced, reality is often different.

At the same time, however, awareness is not the same as certainty. Before making irreversible decisions, it’s worth exploring whether the unhappiness reflects neglect that could be addressed or a deeper incompatibility that cannot. That exploration might include honest conversation, counseling, or simply allowing yourself to name what you’ve been avoiding. Also you might try a "free writing session" in which you write down anything and everything that comes to mind with respect to your marriage. Free writing involves letting go of any inhibitions and writing whatever comes to your mind, however silly or scary it might seem. Writers often find this useful for brainstorming, but it can also be applied to trying to figure out interpersonal situations as well, especially since we usually heavily self-censor when it comes to thinking about delicate emotional topics. Resolve to never let anyone, especially your husband, see the result of the free-writing; this will provide much more psychological space to fully express yourself. You can even destroy the document right after writing it. Hopefully this, along with some unstructured reflection, will help you understand more where you want to go with respect to your marriage. 

If you feel that it's worth trying to save the marriage, and that the underlying problems can be solved within the marriage, then you might say something to your spouse like: "Honey, we've grown apart over the last few years, and I'm sure you've noticed it too. I realize that we are different people than when we first married. But I want us to be closer again. What do you think is missing, and how could we both work towards fixing it?"

But if you decide after this reflection that ending the marriage is the best course of action, do it. Hopefully you and your husband have an amicable enough relationship that a divorce would be relatively smooth. Also, you don't mention if you have children. But even if you do, divorce in the case of an unhappy marriage is a better alternative to modeling an unhappy relationship for your children.

There is no moral virtue in endurance for its own sake. The ethical question isn’t whether you’re allowed to want more, but how to proceed with honesty and care for both yourself and your spouse. Sometimes the most courageous and loving thing you can do is walk away.

QUESTION:
My adult son rarely calls or visits. When I bring it up, he says he’s busy. I feel rejected and don’t know how to respond without pushing him further away.

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s understandable to feel hurt when your son doesn’t call or visit often. People get busy with their own lives, and sometimes that means less contact. You might try telling him how you feel in a calm way, so he knows without feeling pressured. Maybe finding a time that works for both of you could help. It’s important to be patient and give him space while also expressing your feelings.

EVALUATION:
Score: 5.0

Strengths:
- Does not drift into therapyspeak or try to diagnose a particular condition.
Weaknesses:
- Way too short. Lacks nuance and depth.
- Little moral voice or columnist voice.
- Needs much more specific advice. Too generic and bland.

OUTPUT: 
Distance from adult children can feel like a quiet, ongoing loss. It often triggers questions about what went wrong or what could have been done differently. Those feelings are real and deeply human. Parents usually operate on the implicit, unspoken assumption that when their children grow up, they will stay in close contact. Or at least that they will make a regular effort to call and visit. When this proves not to be the case, after children grow up and start their adult lives, this can create feelings of rejection, even though the reason for the reduced contact might simply be that the adult child is very busy with their own life.

Your question doesn't mention important facts such as: How old your adult son is, whether he has a family of his own, or whether anything specific happened that might have triggered this distancing, as opposed to it just being the result of him having a lot on his plate. All these factors matter. And many adult children simply get wrapped up in their lives and contacting their parents often falls by the wayside, especially if they have children of their own. Today's cultural norms also matter. The communication expectations of yesteryear have broken down, as asynchronous communication and "Irish goodbyes" have replaced the synchronous variety. At the same time, young families and young adults are particularly overwhelmed these days with all the stresses of daily life, the uncertain economy, the influence of social media, the impossible expectations around child-rearing, and so many other things. So it's entirely possible that his relative silence is simply a byproduct of these forces, rather than anything you or his other parent specifically did.

What creates space for reconnection is signaling that the relationship is safe and non-demanding. Next time you talk to him about a visit, and he mentions being busy, you can say something like: “I miss you and enjoy hearing from you whenever you have time." That's it. Don't propose a time to meet or talk or even say something like, "I would like to catch up sometime." 

The trick is to strike a balance between expressing your wish to reconnect without crossing the line into pressure. Pressure rarely produces closeness. When adult children feel obligated to manage a parent’s disappointment, they often retreat further. 

That doesn’t mean suppressing your feelings entirely. It means expressing them without making them your child’s responsibility.

Sometimes the most loving thing a parent can do is leave the door open and trust that their child will walk through it when they’re able.

QUESTION:
My partner frequently jokes at my expense in social settings. When I ask him to stop, he says I’m too sensitive. Am I?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It sounds like you’re feeling hurt and dismissed, which is completely understandable. When someone you care about repeatedly makes jokes at your expense, especially in front of others, it can feel undermining and disrespectful. Your feelings are valid, and wanting your partner to stop isn’t about being “too sensitive” — it’s about wanting to be treated with kindness and respect.

When your partner responds by calling you “too sensitive,” it shifts the focus away from his behavior and onto your feelings, which can be a way to avoid taking responsibility. This kind of response can leave you feeling isolated or doubting yourself, which isn’t fair or healthy in a relationship.

It might help to have a calm conversation with him outside of social settings, explaining how these jokes affect you emotionally and why you want them to stop. If he continues to dismiss your feelings or refuses to change, that’s a sign of a deeper issue in how he respects your boundaries.

Ultimately, you deserve to be with someone who values your feelings and treats you with care, especially in public. Your sensitivity is not the problem here—your partner’s unwillingness to respect your feelings is.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.0

Strengths:
- Good insights about the partner deflecting from his own shortcomings to avoid taking responsibility for hurting you.
- Sensible advice and analysis of the situation.
Weaknesses:
- Does not lay out the impact of the harm in as much detail as a top-tier example. Moral voice could be strengthened.
- Does not offer a script that the letter writer can use in standing up to their partner.
- Does not pursue the argument to its logical conclusion: that if the partner refuses to stop telling the jokes after clearly being told that they hurt the letter writer, then the letter writer should leave the partner.
- Lacks a strong takeaway at the end.

OUTPUT: 
Humor that repeatedly lands at one person’s expense stops being harmless, especially when concerns are dismissed rather than addressed. Being told you’re “too sensitive” often serves to deflect responsibility rather than resolve the issue. Cowards everywhere use humor as a shield to say something without owning it. And when the person perpetrating this problem is doing it to their partner, then that's a particularly cruel and cowardly act. It conveys the message that the person telling the joke cares little about their partner's feelings and cares more about themself. This can make the target of the joke feel humiliated, dehumanized, and unloved.

The common sense, reasonable-person rule of thumb regarding jokes at someone else's expense is that when the target of the joke expresses discomfort or explicitly asks the teller of the joke to stop, then the teller must stop immediately and never again tell any more of the jokes. Your partner evidently has not learned this rule, or he doesn't care. He's also gaslighting you by causing you to question your own legitimate feelings of hurt. What a decent and reasonable person would do if he were in your partner's shoes is not tell any more of the jokes, even if he personally couldn't understand why you find them offensive. The fact that they hurt you is itself enough of a reason to stop telling the jokes.

The fact that your partner hasn't done this suggests that there probably isn't much hope for this relationship. But if you want to make one last-ditch effort, you might use the following script as a template. "[Partner], You've told a lot of jokes lately that I have been the butt of. I've told you that I don't appreciate it. And when you brush me off by saying I'm too sensitive, it communicates to me that you don't truly care about my feelings. You might find the jokes funny, but I don't. When you tell them it makes me feel hurt and humiliated. Please stop." 

While I'm not usually a fan of "tests" in relationships, in this case whether your partner continues telling the jokes after that point will tell you all you need to know about whether to stay with him. If he keeps telling jokes, get out of that relationship as quickly as possible. You deserve better than someone who will treat you in a mean-spirited fashion and then criticize you when you express hurt at this mistreatment.

Life is hard enough without your own partner putting you down and then not even taking responsibility for it. A partner who respects you will care more about how their words land than about defending their sense of humor.

You are not obligated to tolerate being the punchline to "keep the peace" in your relationship. Asking for basic respect is not fragility. It is a reasonable boundary.

QUESTION:
I feel guilty for being relieved after ending a relationship. Does that mean I never really loved them?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Feeling relief after ending a relationship is more common than you might think, and it doesn’t erase the love you once had. Relationships are complex and layered; love isn’t a single, unchanging emotion but a mix of feelings that can evolve, deepen, or fade over time. Relief often signals that something in the relationship was weighing on you—perhaps unmet needs, unresolved conflicts, or a mismatch in values or priorities. That relief is your mind and heart recognizing a release from tension or pain, not a negation of the affection or care you felt.

It’s important to separate the idea of love from the idea of a healthy, sustainable relationship. You can love someone deeply and still know that the relationship isn’t right for you or that it no longer serves your well-being. Love doesn’t obligate you to stay in a situation that compromises your happiness or growth. Ending a relationship can be an act of respect for both yourself and the other person, even if it’s painful.

If you want to speak to yourself with kindness in this moment, you might say: “I loved them in the way I could at that time, and I honored that love by choosing what felt right for me now.” This acknowledges your past feelings without trapping you in guilt or confusion.

Takeaway: Love and relief can coexist because ending a relationship is often about honoring your whole self—not just your feelings, but your needs and boundaries too. Feeling relief doesn’t mean you never loved; it means you cared enough to choose a better path forward.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.5

Strengths:
- Offers a complex, nuanced take on a complex emotional topic.
- Offers real insights into emotion and psychology without engaging in therapyspeak or trying to diagnose anything. 
- Offers an insightful script for the letter writer to use.
Weaknesses:
- The last paragraph's wording feels a bit too generic, especially the first word ("Takeaway:")
- Lacks that one missing layer of nuance that the strongest examples have.

OUTPUT: 
Relief after a breakup does not invalidate the love you felt. Often it reflects the lifting of a burden that had become unbearable over time.

Your letter is sparse in context, so it's unclear what the underlying circumstances are. But many, many people feel relief after a relationship ends. Some people feel this way because they were smothered in a codependent relationship, or one in which they had to bear more than their share of the emotional and/or household labor. Others feel relief because disagreements with their partner had surpassed their emotional pain threshold. There are also cases of abuse and infidelity, in which case it's definitely a relief to leave the relationship. Or there are much more mundane cases in which neither spouse did anything "wrong," but the relationship just lost its luster over time and became more of a burden than a joy.

I'm not implying that any of these things were true of your own relationship. Rather, the preceding paragraph is an attempt to illustrate how common it is for people to feel relieved after a relationship ends. It's perfectly normal and doesn't make you a bad person, nor does it mean that you didn't love your partner. Love evolves and changes over time. Sometimes people fall out of love, while at other times love evolves into something that no longer fits well within the space of the relationship in which it started. You can deeply love someone but still come to realize that for any of the reasons listed above, or any number of others, the relationship just isn't right. Leaving a relationship in that circumstance often does feel like a relief, even as it's also heartbreaking. These two things can be true at the same time.

You don’t need to rewrite your history to justify your present emotions. Mixed feelings are common after loss, particularly when love and strain coexisted for a long time. In my parents' case, they were married for over 30 years and there was clearly a lot of love between them. But for various reasons, the relationship fell apart. After an intense grieving period, my mother felt a lot of relief at being able to live a new life on her own terms. I think even today she still loves my dad in some way, but also feels that the divorce was the right thing to do.

Emotions are signals, and your relief is telling you that something about that relationship wasn't right. It isn't telling you anything about whether or not you loved your partner. A chapter of your life has ended, but that doesn't mean that you didn't have a lot of love for the co-author of that chapter.

QUESTION:
My parents expect me to visit every holiday, even though doing so leaves me anxious and depleted. I feel trapped between obligation and self-care.

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Feeling torn between family expectations and your own well-being is a deeply familiar and difficult place to be. Holidays often come with a heavy weight of tradition and obligation, but it’s important to remember that your emotional health matters just as much as anyone else’s desire for your presence. When you find yourself anxious and depleted after visits, that’s a clear signal—not a failing on your part, but a boundary that needs attention.

You might try a conversation that acknowledges your parents’ hopes while honestly sharing your experience. For example, you could say: “I love you and want to spend time together, but I’ve noticed that the full holiday visits leave me feeling overwhelmed. I’m hoping we can find a way to celebrate that feels good for all of us.” This opens the door to collaboration rather than confrontation.

Consider offering alternatives that reduce the pressure: shorter visits, meeting on a different day, or even creating new traditions that don’t require full-day commitments. If your parents resist, it’s okay to gently but firmly hold your ground. You don’t owe anyone your presence at the cost of your peace.

The takeaway here is that honoring your needs is not selfish—it’s necessary. Relationships thrive when they’re nourished by respect for everyone’s limits, not just by fulfilling expectations. You deserve holidays that leave you feeling connected, not drained. Finding that balance is a form of care, both for yourself and for your family.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.5

Strengths:
- Offers a good script for the letter writer to say to their parents.
- Presents reasonable and insightful boundaries that the letter-writer can set.
Weaknesses:
- Might have gone into a bit more detail about how a child can renegotiate relationships with traditions and with their parents.
- Could have gone into more depth about the weight of tradition and its relevance to the problem here.

OUTPUT: 
Traditions have a special place in our culture and can often bring great happiness. But they are not automatically healthy. When a tradition consistently leaves one person anxious or depleted, it deserves reevaluation. Because a tradition that is continued to the detriment of one or more of the participants ceases to be a reaffirmation of connection and love. Rather, it becomes a burden and often a source of resentment.

The outsized importance of traditions in our culture, particularly around the holidays, can often mask the complex emotions and stress often associated with them. And as you and countless others have seen, traditions often come with heavy expectations. Many of our traditions also involve substantial emotional labor. Not only with the holidays, but also think of things like planning a wedding, trying to create an invite list for your child's birthday party that doesn't hurt anyone's feelings, and also some faith traditions where devotees engage in a variety of rituals and often have to master complex subject matter. In light of all this, traditions can often be exhausting, even when we treasure them.

The good news is that you are allowed to renegotiate expectations as an adult, even if doing so disappoints others. Choosing not to attend every gathering is not a rejection of your family; it’s an acknowledgment of your limits. You might explain to your parents that while you love seeing them and visiting for holidays, you're not able to attend for every holiday. You could, for instance, say that you're coming to see them for Christmas, but you have other plans for Thanksgiving. If they press you for details on why you're not going to see them for every holiday, you don't need to provide an exhaustive explanation. It's enough to say: “This is what I can manage right now. I love you and enjoy being with you, but I need to find space for myself as well.” 

Self-care is not selfishness with better branding. It is maintenance.

QUESTION:
I discovered that my partner reads my private messages “out of concern.” They say they’re just trying to protect the relationship. How serious is this?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Discovering that your partner has been reading your private messages under the guise of “concern” or “protection” is a serious breach of trust. Relationships are built on a foundation of respect and mutual boundaries, and privacy is a core part of that. When one partner crosses that boundary without consent, it signals a lack of respect for your autonomy and can create an imbalance of power.

Your partner’s reasoning—that they are trying to protect the relationship—may come from a place of insecurity or fear, but it doesn’t justify the behavior. Protecting a relationship should never mean surveilling or controlling the other person. Instead, it requires open, honest conversations about worries and needs, not covert actions that undermine trust.

If you decide to address this, it’s important to be clear and direct. You might say something like, “I understand you’re worried about our relationship, but reading my private messages without my permission crosses a boundary that’s very important to me. I need to feel that my privacy is respected for us to move forward.” Notice this is not about accusing or shaming but about stating your boundary firmly and calmly.

At the same time, pay attention to how your partner responds. Are they willing to acknowledge the breach and commit to rebuilding trust? Or do they minimize your feelings or justify their actions without taking responsibility? The answer to that will tell you a lot about the health of your relationship.

The takeaway here is that privacy is not a negotiable luxury; it’s a fundamental element of respect and trust. If your partner’s actions have compromised that, it’s a signal to pause and reflect on whether your relationship can be a safe space for both of you. Protecting a relationship doesn’t mean controlling it—it means honoring each other’s boundaries and working together with honesty.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.5

Strengths:
- Strong moral voice.
- Offers a clear and sensible script for the letter writer to use.
Weaknesses:
- Could be a little more explicit about the harms.
- Uses em dashes
- Uses the word "takeaway" in the final paragraph. The actual takeaway would be stronger without this word explicitly spelled out.

OUTPUT: 
Reading private messages without consent is a serious breach of trust, regardless of the motivation offered. Concern does not justify surveillance. When a partner violates trust and privacy in this manner, one often feels frustration, disappointment, and anger. It conveys that the partner who reads the messages doesn't see their partner as an equal and doesn't respect their autonomy.

It's unclear from your message what your partner thinks that they need to protect the relationship from. Do they suspect infidelity? Do they worry that someone's harming you? Is there some other situation in your life that they're concerned about, but they're expressing this concern by violating your privacy? Regardless, this behavior is never justified. Healthy relationships rely on mutual respect for autonomy and privacy. When one partner monitors the other, it often reflects insecurity or a need for control rather than genuine care.

This behavior deserves to be addressed directly and taken seriously. You might say something like, "I want to talk to you about reading my private messages. You claim that you're just trying to protect the relationship and that you're concerned. But this isn't okay. It's a violation of privacy. If you have any concerns about me or about the relationship, you need to express them openly and directly rather than going behind my back and violating my privacy."

If your partner minimizes it, refuses to stop, or reframes it as your fault, that signals a deeper issue around boundaries and trust. In that case, you might want to think hard about whether to stay in this relationship. Love doesn't justify subjecting yourself to repeated privacy violations. There are plenty of people out there who do respect basic privacy rights.

Protection that requires violation of privacy is not protection; it's snooping.

QUESTION:
My adult daughter constantly asks for financial help but dismisses my advice and resents any boundaries I try to set. I feel used and guilty at the same time. What’s the right response?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It sounds like you’re in a tough spot, feeling torn between wanting to support your daughter and protecting your own boundaries. It’s natural to want to help someone you love, especially your child, but it’s also important to recognize your limits and what you’re comfortable with. If you keep giving financial help without clear boundaries, it might reinforce a pattern where your daughter relies on you without taking responsibility for her own situation. On the other hand, setting boundaries can feel harsh or cause tension, especially if she reacts with resentment.

You might try having a calm conversation with her about what you’re able to offer and why you need to set limits. It could help to be honest about how her requests and reactions affect you emotionally, without blaming her. At the same time, it’s okay to expect her to respect your decisions, even if she doesn’t like them. If she dismisses your advice, that’s frustrating, but you can’t control her choices—only how you respond.

Ultimately, finding a balance between compassion and self-care is key. You don’t have to solve all her problems, and it’s okay to say no when you need to. Over time, this might encourage her to take more responsibility, but it’s a process that may take patience. If the situation feels overwhelming, seeking outside support for yourself, like talking to trusted friends or a counselor, could also be helpful.

EVALUATION:
Score: [score]

Strengths:
- Respects the dignity of both the mother and the daughter.
- Avoids falling into therapyspeak.
Weaknesses:
- Does not lay out, specifically enough, what the boundaries should be with a daughter.
- Language is a bit equivocal and lacks moral "punch."
- Lacks a script for the letter writer to use.

OUTPUT: 
This is an emotionally fraught position to be in. Wanting to help your child doesn’t go away just because they’re grown, and guilt often rushes in the moment you consider pulling back. But generosity that consistently leaves you feeling used is a signal that something is out of balance. In interacting with an adult child, there need to be clear boundaries on each side, especially when it comes to financial matters. A lack of boundaries or violation of them is usually a recipe for trouble in the relationship.

You say "financial help," but you don't fully specify what this means. Is it just advice, or is it also money in the form of a loan or a gift? If it's the latter in particular, then guilt is no reason to justify being taken advantage of financially. Because that's what happens when people asking for money (or even just advice) don't observe boundaries. When financial support is offered without mutual respect or clear limits, it often becomes entangled with resentment on both sides. Money starts standing in for connection, approval, or control, and this is typically toxic for a relationship over time.

Setting boundaries here is not a withdrawal of love. It’s a clarification of what kind of help you can offer without harming the relationship or your retirement funds. You might say: “I care about you, but I’m no longer comfortable providing financial support under these conditions.” That statement is not punitive. It’s honest.

Your daughter may be angry, and that will be painful. But guilt alone is not a reason to continue a pattern that leaves you resentful and her dependent. Boundaries, while uncomfortable, often create the possibility for a healthier adult relationship over time.

QUESTION:
My spouse keeps forgiving a family member who repeatedly disrespects me. I feel like my feelings always come second. Is this a marriage problem or a family problem?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
What you’re describing touches on both your marriage and your extended family, but the heart of the issue seems to be how your spouse is balancing loyalty and respect between you and their family member. When someone you love repeatedly disrespects you, and your spouse continues to forgive that behavior without addressing your feelings, it can create a painful sense of being sidelined or undervalued in your own partnership.

This isn’t just about the family member’s behavior—it’s about how your spouse responds to it and whether they are able to hold firm boundaries that protect your well-being and the health of your relationship. Your feelings matter deeply, and feeling like they come second can erode trust and connection over time.

It might help to have a calm, honest conversation with your spouse about how this dynamic affects you. Share specific examples and focus on the impact it has on your sense of safety and respect within your marriage. Ask your spouse how they see the situation and what they think is possible in terms of setting limits with their family member. Sometimes people forgive repeatedly out of a desire to keep peace or avoid conflict, but that can unintentionally cause harm when it dismisses the feelings of those closest to them.

If your spouse is unwilling or unable to acknowledge your experience or to advocate for you, that points to a deeper issue within the marriage that deserves attention. At the same time, the family member’s disrespect is a separate problem that your spouse’s forgiveness alone won’t fix.

Ultimately, your marriage should be a place where you feel supported and respected, especially when outside relationships cause tension. If that balance isn’t there, it’s worth reflecting on what you need and whether your spouse is able to meet those needs. Sometimes couples find it helpful to seek outside perspectives to navigate these complexities, but the first step is your spouse recognizing that your feelings are valid and important—not secondary to anyone else’s.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.5

Strengths:
- Convincingly names the harm.
- Recognizes that there are problems beyond whether the spouse keeps forgiving their relative or not.
Weaknesses:
- Lacks an explicit script for the letter writer to use with their spouse. 
- At times, the response falls into platitudes that don't really add anything to the advice ("Your feelings matter deeply," "[Your feelings are] not secondary to anyone else’s")
- Doesn't directly answer the letter writer's question about whether this is a marriage problem or a family problem.
- Could make more explicit the point that forgiveness doesn't justify ignoring boundaries.

OUTPUT: 
When a spouse repeatedly prioritizes a family member over their partner’s wellbeing, it stops being just a family issue and becomes a marital one. Partnership implies a baseline commitment to protecting each other from harm, especially when that harm is ongoing and predictable.

Forgiveness on its own does not justify a lack of accountability or enforcement of boundaries. You can forgive someone, but still stand up to them if they keep engaging in problematic behavior. Your letter implies that your husband is not standing up to the family member who keeps treating you poorly. This is a big problem and very common. For various reasons, people in marriages or other long-term relationships often choose their own relatives over their spouse or partner. This is often the case even when their relative is disrespecting or otherwise mistreating the spouse or partner. But protecting a family member that's mistreating one's spouse is never okay.

When someone refuses to protect their spouse from harm caused by a family member, then it becomes a marital problem, first and foremost. And that's where the repair should start, within the marriage. This is worth addressing directly, not as an accusation but as a statement of need. Something like: “I need to know that you will take my side when someone treats me poorly. I respect that you forgave [Family Member]. But that doesn't justify your failure to stand up for me when they say mean or cruel things about me.” You don't mention if you brought this up to your spouse before, but even if you have, it's worth bringing up again because, clearly, the problem is still there.

Forgiveness can be meaningful, but forgiveness that bypasses accountability often turns into enablement. Your spouse may believe they’re being peacemaking or generous, but the effect is that you’re left exposed and unsupported. You're left understandably wondering if your spouse cares more about you or about protecting the feelings of the family member who is harming you.

Bottom line: Don't stand for mistreatment. You deserve much better than that.

It sounds frustrating to be interrupted and then called difficult when you speak up. You might try to stay calm and keep expressing your ideas clearly. Sometimes, people don’t realize they are interrupting, so gently reminding them could help. Also, focusing on building good relationships with your coworkers might improve how they respond to you. It’s important to be confident but also polite so you don’t hurt your reputation. Keep trying to find a balance between standing up for yourself and maintaining harmony at work.

EVALUATION:
Score: 4.5

Strengths:
- Doesn't resort to therapyspeak. 
Weaknesses:
- Lacks a moral voice. Encourages the letter writer to accommodate those who are interrupting them, rather than truly standing up for themself. 
- Never names the harm that the coworkers are causing, but rather brushes it off and encourages accommodation. This very much goes against my "brand" of clearly naming the harm and its effects.
- Very short and superficial. No depth or meaningful exploration of the issues involved.
- Lacks a script that the letter writer could use with the coworkers.

OUTPUT: 
Interruption is one of the worst conversational habits. In our extrovert-worshipping society, conversation can often seem to be tantamount to a contact sport in which the person who's willing to interrupt the most often gets the most floor time. And since you're talking about a workplace specifically, there are added dimensions to this problem. A workplace should have more explicit and implicit expectations that all voices are listened to. When this doesn't happen, it leaves those who are frequently interrupted feeling like their voices don't matter. Being interrupted repeatedly is not a personal failure. It’s a structural and social problem that often affects certain people more than others, regardless of competence or preparation. The frustration you feel is justified.

I myself have suffered from being interrupted a lot, both at workplaces and in other settings. Over time, I've learned strategies that enable me to speak up for myself without appearing overly confrontational. I try to say things like, "excuse me, I wasn't finished talking," or "can you please let me finish what I was saying?" In American workplaces, people are socialized to want to appear as "team players." Which is why you fear reputational damage for calling out these interruptions. But it's possible to maintain a reputation as a good member of the team while still standing up for your own right to express all of what you want to say when you're speaking in a meeting.

For instance, if you maintain calm and composure while standing up for yourself when you're being interrupted, using phrases like I suggested above, then the risk of you appearing as someone who is "difficult" will be reduced. That being said, it is important to note that there's also a gender component to all this. You don't tell me which gender you identify with or which gender others identify you as. But if others identify you as female, then unfortunately, you're in good company with respect to constantly being interrupted. Women face a double bind at work because if they speak up too little, they're seen as not being a team player or not caring about what happens on a particular project. But if they speak up “too much,” they're seen as being too aggressive--or "difficult." This often damages them professionally. So if you're a woman, unfortunately, your task is particularly difficult, but it's not impossible.

Regardless of your gender, if the pattern continues, it may be appropriate to document specific instances and raise the issue with a manager, framing it as a collaboration problem rather than a grievance. That helps protect your credibility while naming the issue. And if you've noticed other colleagues also being interrupted during meetings, which is likely, you can bring them up as well. Don't mention them by name, but say something like, "I have also noticed that other colleagues of mine are also often being interrupted at our meetings. I want our workplace to be an environment where everybody can feel free to express their full and complete opinions on work-related matters. I think that doing this will help us be the best team that we can be. Any team suffers when not all of its members are able to express themselves fully." 

Wanting to be heard is not “being difficult.” It’s asking for basic professional respect.

QUESTION:
I’m considering ending a friendship because our political views have diverged dramatically. We can’t talk without it becoming tense. Is that shallow?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s understandable to feel conflicted about ending a friendship over political differences. Friendships often involve shared values and mutual respect, so when those start to feel compromised, it can create tension. While some might see ending a friendship over politics as shallow, it’s also important to recognize that political beliefs can be deeply tied to a person’s identity and worldview. If conversations consistently lead to discomfort or conflict, it’s reasonable to consider whether the friendship still brings you positive connection. Before making a final decision, you might try setting boundaries around political discussions or focusing on other aspects of your relationship. Ultimately, preserving your own peace of mind is important, and sometimes that means stepping back from relationships that feel more draining than supportive.

EVALUATION:
Score: 6.0

Strengths:
- Recognizes that political disagreements often go deeper than just "shallow" disagreements over candidates or policies.
Weaknesses:
- Lacks a script that the letter writer can use.
- Answer is too brief and doesn't adequately engage with the complex problems raised by the letter.
- Gestures at setting boundaries, but offers few specifics.
- Fails to delve into specific issues, such as who raises the topic of politics in conversations. Is it always the friend or sometimes also the letter-writer? 

OUTPUT: 
Political differences often reflect deeper values about power, responsibility, and empathy. And the place of outsiders and historically marginalized groups in our society. When those values diverge sharply, conversation can become exhausting rather than enriching. Especially in the current political climate, "agreeing to disagree" can be hard to accept when it seems like every issue is a battle between diametrically opposed values. And in the age of social media, we know much more about the political opinions of even neighbors and friends of friends than most of us would want to know. Just this year I learned that a spouse of a relative seems to see the opposite political party as being gleeful at a deadly natural disaster that happened in our state. Such revelations really do reveal sharply different values. Given all this, I don't think you're shallow to question ending the friendship. 

That said, ending the friendship may or may not be the best move, depending on circumstances. When the subject of conversation isn't politics, do the two of you generally have amicable and pleasant discussions? And notwithstanding what I said about agreeing to disagree above, have you ever explicitly asked your friend to keep politics off the table in your discussions, knowing that the two of you aren't going to agree and that it will only cause hurt feelings? Your sentence, "we can't talk without it becoming tense," seems to imply that politics often comes up in your conversations. If so, does one of you almost always raise the topic? If it's you, then you can simply not bring it up anymore. If it's her, you can politely ask your friend to not bring it up. Say something like, “I care a lot about you and our friendship, but I've noticed that every time we discuss politics, our conversations get tense and difficult. While I don't want to shy away from discussing difficult issues on principle, I just feel that in our friendship discussing politics does way more harm than good. Neither of us is going to persuade the other of their view, and it's very difficult to discuss this topic without lots of negative emotions coming up. Would you agree to just stay away from the subject from now on and talk about things that aren't as difficult?”

If after this conversation she still keeps bringing up politics, then that sends you a signal that your friend is willing to put their own political interests and passions above your feelings. In that case, ending the friendship or drastically reducing the amount of time that you talk with her would be an entirely appropriate response. Ending or distancing a friendship over this is not inherently shallow. It’s a recognition that mutual understanding may no longer be possible.

Many friendships can withstand political differences, but many others cannot. The question of which of these applies to your friendship will be determined by whether the two of you are able to come to a mutually satisfactory agreement about discussing politics and then actually stick to it. Because the status quo isn't sustainable.

It's not weak or "shallow" of somebody to request that a difficult topic be kept out of conversations. In fact, it takes a strong person to make such a request and risk the ire of the other person or even the end of the friendship. Bottom line: you don’t owe perpetual engagement at the cost of your own peace.

QUESTION:
I am in my late twenties and recently moved into my own place. My mom has a key for emergencies, which I was fine with. Lately she has started “dropping by” unannounced when I am at work to leave food, do small chores, or reorganize things “to help.” She means well, but it feels like my space is not really mine. I tried joking about it, but she did not get the hint. How do I set a boundary without hurting her feelings?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s clear you appreciate your mom’s intentions, but you also need your home to feel like your own sanctuary. When someone crosses that boundary—even with good intentions—it can feel unsettling and diminish your sense of autonomy. Since your gentle hints haven’t landed, a more direct but compassionate conversation might be the kindest way forward.

You could start by acknowledging her care: “Mom, I really appreciate how much you want to help and how thoughtful you are to drop off food or tidy up.” Then gently express your feelings: “At the same time, I’m trying to get used to living on my own and having my own space, and it feels a bit strange when you come by without letting me know first.” Framing it around your own experience rather than her behavior can help avoid making her feel criticized.

You might suggest a simple arrangement: “Could we agree that you call or text before coming over, so I can make sure it’s a good time? That way I can also be there to visit with you.” This invites her to be part of your life on your terms, rather than feeling shut out.

It’s normal for parents to struggle with adjusting to their adult children’s independence, and it may take a few conversations for her to fully understand. If she does feel hurt, gently reassure her that your need for boundaries doesn’t mean you love or value her any less—it’s about you growing into your own adult life.

Ultimately, your home is your personal space, and setting boundaries is a way of caring for yourself. Approaching this with kindness and clarity can help preserve your relationship while honoring your needs.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.0

Strengths:
- Offers a realistic view that getting the mother to change her behavior might be a process.
- Offers a script for the letter writer to use with his mother.
- Keeps kindness and empathy front and center.
Weaknesses:
- Could be more specific in laying out which competing forces outweigh the others. For instance, the best responses acknowledge that while avoiding hurting your mom's feelings is a real and important goal, it's very difficult to set boundaries without hurting feelings. And therefore, reasonable and kindly expressed boundaries override the need to protect the other person's feelings at all costs. This response is missing that kind of reasoning.

OUTPUT: 
It sounds like your mom is trying to be loving and helpful, but the way she's doing it is blurring the line between support and intrusion. You're not wrong to feel unsettled by that. When a parent oversteps reasonable boundaries in an adult child's life, it can leave the adult child feeling a range of emotions. You want to be able to feel that your space is yours, but you also don't want to hurt your mother's feelings, especially since you know that she means well. It's a painful dilemma.

Unfortunately, there are very few, if any, cases in which setting boundaries doesn't risk hurting someone's feelings. When boundaries need to be set with someone, then almost by definition, you're asking them to get outside of their comfort zone and to rethink old assumptions that they had held, often unconsciously. You're pushing back on something that somebody else is doing, and very often they're going to take it personally.

When setting a boundary with your mom on this matter, you want to strike a tone of loving but firm. You might say something to the effect of, "Mom, I love you, and I really do enjoy having you over. But when you come over, I want it to be for a visit where we're both present and can enjoy each other's company. I know that you mean well in coming over while I'm gone and performing chores and leaving food, but it undermines my own sense of independence and sense that my space really is my own. Moving forward, can we both agree that the key that I gave you should be only used for emergencies, and that any other times when you come over, you need to ask me first?" 

Relationships between parents and adult children often involve recalibration. This is one of those times. With love and patience, you will be able to strengthen and re-calibrate your relationship with your mother so that it preserves your closeness while also respecting your own autonomy.

QUESTION:
My husband and I have been married for 10 years, and while it's mostly been a good marriage with the usual ups and downs, a toxic dynamic has evolved where both of us rush to blame the other during arguments. For example, last week our cat escaped and my youngest child and I spent several hours looking for her before a neighbor thankfully found and returned her. The relief of having her back should have been the end of it, but instead the incident sparked a painful argument about whose "fault" it was—-my husband blamed me for leaving the door open when I went out to tend to our plants (I was only outside for a few minutes), while I blamed him because the only reason I went out to water the plants was that he had neglected to do it after saying he would take care of them. The argument was unproductive, as almost all our arguments are. We've been in couples therapy but haven't made much progress, in part because my husband doesn't take therapy seriously. How can we overcome this blame dynamic and develop a better marital relationship?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It sounds like you and your husband are caught in a cycle that many couples experience, where blame becomes a default response during conflicts. This pattern can be exhausting and damaging over time. While therapy is a good step, it’s important that both partners are genuinely committed to the process for it to be effective. Sometimes, external factors like stress, fatigue, or unresolved personal issues can fuel these arguments, so it might help to consider whether there are broader pressures affecting your relationship. Reflecting on your own communication styles and emotional triggers can also be insightful. Remember, every relationship has its challenges, and working through them often requires patience, empathy, and sometimes a willingness to accept imperfections in both yourself and your partner. If therapy hasn’t helped so far, you might explore different approaches or therapists who specialize in couples work. Ultimately, fostering a sense of shared responsibility rather than blame can create a more supportive environment for both of you.

EVALUATION:
Score: 5.5

Strengths:
- Avoids the trap of therapyspeak. 
Weaknesses:
- Advice appears too generic and clichéd. 
- Response does not go into enough detail about the problems involved.
- Points out that both partners need to be committed to therapy for it to be effective, but offers no advice on helping the letter writer's husband get there.
- Fails to tease out what's really behind the dynamic of blame and what can help dismantle it.

OUTPUT: 
This is a common problem, so you're hardly alone in facing this. Your husband's reluctance to take therapy seriously is discouraging, but there are other approaches you can take. During a moment when both of you are calm, approach him and say something like, "Honey, I've noticed that when we fight, we often blame each other for problems, and this doesn't resolve anything. It just results in hurt feelings for both of us. What do you think we can do to address this?"

Much will depend on how he responds. If he doesn't respond well, particularly after repeated attempts to address this amicably, then you might want to consider solo therapy to explore any underlying problems behind this pattern. But if he is open to engaging with you, try this exercise: the next time you have an argument and one of you starts blaming the other, get out a piece of paper and each of you write down possible solutions, with a rule that nobody can write anything blaming the other partner; just focus on solutions. Blame is a dynamic that tends to be self-reinforcing: the more you resort to blame, the more it feels natural, but the good news is that it works the other way as well: the less you engage in blame over time, the less it becomes the default way of "solving" problems. 

To help reinforce more positive new habits, I'd suggest also having a weekly check-in where you talk with your partner about how resolving the problem is going. Were there fewer incidents of blaming this past week than the week before? If so, count that as a win. You can expect your progress to be zig-zaggy, but if you work at it long enough, there's a good chance that the overall trend line will be positive. And the mere act of discussing blame in a "meta" fashion should help the two of you to detach from it and to see it from a more objective perspective. That is, to see blame as a complex and negative dynamic, rather than simply being in the mindset of trying to score points against the other.

Over time, this work should help change this difficult dynamic while also solving the original problems more quickly. I would also recommend reading John Gottman's book, "The 7 Principles for Making Marriage Work," which contains excellent advice about the blame game and other marital challenges.

QUESTION:
Like so many others, my teenage daughter is struggling with an eating disorder. In her case, she's lost so many pounds in the last few weeks that she barely resembles her old self. She's obsessed with the idea that she's fat, but in reality, she's dangerously underweight. Making matters worse, my husband seems to not take her situation seriously enough. While I fear for her life if she doesn't get treatment soon, my husband often brushes off the subject when I talk to him about it. He says things like, "Oh, she's just going through a phase," or "Maybe she just doesn't like the food that you cook." I think that my daughter is overhearing this and it might be encouraging her to starve herself even more.

I've always been the non-confrontational type, which I fear has contributed to my daughter getting into the mess that she's in. So I'm not really sure how to confront my husband about this. What do you suggest?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your concern for your daughter is deeply understandable, and the urgency you feel is real and justified. When a young person is caught in the grip of an eating disorder, it’s not just a phase or a matter of food preference—it’s a serious health crisis that demands attention and care. Your husband’s minimization, whether intentional or not, risks leaving your daughter feeling unseen and unsupported at a moment when she needs a united front most.

It’s important to approach your husband not with blame, but with clarity about the stakes. You might say something like, “I know you want to believe this is temporary, but I’m genuinely scared for her health. I’ve noticed she’s lost so much weight that she looks very different, and I’m worried this isn’t just about food she doesn’t like. When you say it’s a phase, I worry she hears that and feels like she doesn’t need help.” This kind of statement grounds your feelings in observable facts and the impact of his words, rather than accusing him of wrongdoing.

You could also invite him to join you in learning more about eating disorders—perhaps by reading reputable resources together or speaking with a healthcare professional. Sometimes, people minimize what they don’t understand. Bringing him into the conversation as a partner rather than an adversary can help shift his perspective.

At the same time, it’s crucial to set boundaries around your daughter’s care. If your husband continues to dismiss the seriousness, you may need to take the lead in seeking professional help—whether that means making appointments with doctors, therapists, or nutritionists who specialize in eating disorders. Your daughter’s health and safety must come first, even if it means making difficult decisions without full agreement at home.

The takeaway here is that protecting your daughter’s well-being requires both clear communication and decisive action. Your voice matters, and so does your willingness to stand firm in the face of denial. This is not about winning an argument with your husband but about safeguarding your child’s life. When the stakes are this high, the courage to speak up and act is the most profound form of love you can offer.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.5

Strengths:
- Articulates the harms clearly.
- Strong moral voice
- Good script to use with the husband that explains the problem with his behavior without blame. 
Weaknesses:
- Would be strengthened by naming some specific resources that the parents could read regarding eating disorders.
- Again, uses the word "takeaway" in the final paragraph. This sounds more like "stage directions" rather than simply stating what the takeaway is, without having to name the fact that it's a takeaway.

OUTPUT: 
As you noted, this is a life-or-death situation. What I would do is urgently get both your daughter and husband educated on the serious problem of eating disorders, "tout de suite." First, if you haven't already, inform your daughter of the following resources: the 24/7 eating disorder hotline (866-932-1264) and the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD) Helpline (888-375-7767). I would also insist that both your daughter and your husband visit the website of the National Eating Disorders Association, particularly their helpful article "Busting The Myths About Eating Disorders" (https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/busting-myths-about-eating-disorders/). 

The immediate problem, of course, is helping your daughter to get healthy and overcome the disorder, and to learn the skills needed to prevent relapses in the future. This starts with a conversation with her primary care physician and also her therapist, if she has one. But I suspect you're doing most of this already. What you wrote to me about was really a problem of attitudes and education on the part of your husband. In addition to showing him the above-mentioned resources, I would have a serious conversation with him about how his attitudes might be harming his daughter. There is also some underlying sexism and misogyny in his remarks, particularly about what he said about the food that you cook. But educating him on eating disorders is the first priority. Then you can have a longer discussion with him (ideally also with a couples therapist) addressing some of these problematic assumptions that he seems to have about you and about gender roles.

You might tell your husband something like: "When you are dismissive of our daughter's eating disorder, you unintentionally make the problem worse. You're encouraging her to not take the problem seriously rather than confronting it as the life-threatening challenge that it is. I know that you also love our daughter and want her to get well, but these comments are achieving the opposite. Can you agree to read some of these articles and resources [see the examples above] and try to educate yourself more about eating disorders?"

Finally, by all means, whenever your husband makes one of these remarks and there's even the possibility that your daughter could have been around, seek her out at your first opportunity and emphasize to her that what her father said was wrong. Tell her the facts in a calm manner, not to demonize her father but rather to show that his harmful views aren't correct. Facts and sincere affirmation are the best antidotes to misguided and harmful ignorance.

QUESTION:
My husband and I are facing a dilemma over how to respond to a problem with how his family treats his brother. We both have long suspected that my husband's brother is gay. At one point, the brother even came to my husband asking for advice on how to come out of the closet. However, in large part because of their family's attitudes, the brother has never actually come out to them. From time to time, I overhear some of my husband's family, particularly my father-in-law, make offensive and cruel remarks about gay people. I don't know if the father-in-law suspects that one of his sons is gay or not, but regardless, this creates an alienating environment for us and obviously especially for the brother.

Our dilemma is on how to respond to this, if at all. I would like for us, or at least for my husband, to bring this up with his father and to make clear that we don't approve of these cruel remarks. My husband has made it clear that even though he strongly disapproves of the anti-gay remarks, he wants to preserve his relationship with his father and doesn't want to intervene. I tend to feel that since it's his family, he should have more of a say on how to engage with them. But it really hurts to stand by and say nothing while my husband's father creates such an intolerant environment. Do you think that we should just let this go or do you feel that it's worth risking our relationship with his father to try to improve the situation?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
This is a deeply painful and complex situation, and your feelings of hurt and frustration are entirely understandable. When a family environment feels alienating or hostile—especially around something as personal and vulnerable as sexual identity—it can create a heavy emotional burden for everyone involved, including your husband and his brother.

Your husband’s desire to maintain his relationship with his father while disapproving of the hurtful remarks reflects a common and difficult balancing act: wanting to protect family bonds but also wanting to stand against intolerance. It’s important to recognize that this tension is not a simple matter of choosing between silence and confrontation. It’s a negotiation of values, safety, and emotional survival.

You are right to feel that the environment created by these remarks is harmful, and it’s reasonable to want to address that harm. At the same time, your husband’s hesitation suggests that he may be weighing the potential consequences of speaking up—perhaps fearing that confrontation could lead to estrangement or deepen the family’s divisions. His perspective deserves respect, even as you hold your own.

One way forward might be to explore together what “engaging” with his father could look like in a way that feels authentic but also manageable. It doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing confrontation. Sometimes, small, steady expressions of disapproval or gentle challenges to harmful remarks can open a door without closing the relationship. Your husband might find a way to communicate his feelings that feels less risky or more aligned with his style and comfort level.

It’s also worth considering the impact on the brother, who remains in a vulnerable position. Supporting him—whether through private conversations, creating safe spaces, or simply being a consistent source of acceptance—can be a powerful form of resistance to the family’s intolerance.

Ultimately, there is no perfect answer here. You and your husband will need to navigate this together, balancing your values, your emotional needs, and the realities of your family dynamics. It’s okay to acknowledge that some situations resist quick fixes and that protecting your own well-being is a valid part of the equation. If the environment remains intolerant and unchanged, it’s also okay to set boundaries around your involvement or presence in those family interactions.

Your desire for a kinder, more accepting family space is both compassionate and courageous. Finding a path that honors that desire while respecting your husband’s approach will take time, patience, and ongoing conversation.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.5

Strengths:
- Empathetic and emotionally attuned
- Recognizes the tension between values and family preservation
- Avoids simplistic “just confront him” advice
- Acknowledges the brother’s vulnerability

Weaknesses:
- Too abstract and cautious given the moral stakes
- Lacks clear moral clarity about the harm of silence
- Over-relies on “there is no perfect answer”
- Does not sufficiently center the brother’s safety and dignity
- Avoids giving a concrete boundary or decision framework

OUTPUT: 
This is a painful situation precisely because it sits at the intersection of loyalty, safety, and moral responsibility. You’re not imagining the harm here. Repeated anti-gay remarks do real damage, even when no one is “officially” out, and especially when someone in the family is quietly absorbing those messages about who they are allowed to be. Silence in these situations is not neutral. It often functions as permission.

At the same time, your husband’s hesitation deserves to be understood rather than dismissed. He is weighing the very real possibility that confronting his father could permanently damage their relationship. That fear is not cowardice. It’s a recognition of how entrenched these attitudes can be and how costly it can be to challenge them. Still, preserving a relationship at any cost is not the same thing as preserving it wisely.

One important distinction may help you move forward: this does not have to be framed as “outing” the brother or issuing an ultimatum. It can be framed as setting a boundary around behavior. Your husband can make it clear, privately and calmly, that disparaging remarks about gay people are not acceptable in his presence. He does not need to argue theology or change his father’s worldview. He only needs to say, in effect, “When you speak this way, it harms people I love, and I won’t pretend it’s okay.”

That kind of boundary may still provoke backlash. There is no guarantee it won’t. But it shifts the cost away from the most vulnerable person in the room. Right now, that cost is being paid by a brother who is likely already carrying a great deal of fear and isolation. Protecting him does not require heroics, but it does require choosing discomfort over complicity.

Finally, regardless of what your husband decides to do with his father, it matters enormously that his brother knows where you both stand. Even quiet, private expressions of support can be lifesaving in an environment like this. You cannot control whether the family becomes more tolerant. But you can make sure that no one is left wondering whether cruelty is being silently endorsed. That clarity alone can make a profound difference.

QUESTION:
My wife and I are expecting our first child, a daughter. As you might imagine, we're over the moon about being new parents and nurturing and loving this new human. Nevertheless, my wife and I are engaged in a nasty recurring argument over whether to baptize our future daughter. My wife came from a fairly secular family but experienced trauma in her early adulthood, including a sexual assault. She found an on-campus religious community that provided tremendous support to her in her healing. And after college she has continued to attend church in that same denomination. She's been a part of this denomination for about 15 years at this point, and I have nothing against her doing this. Obviously she's an autonomous adult, and we don't have to agree on religion. But in my case, I'm an atheist who had some very bad experiences with religion growing up, including multiple attempts to proselytize me. I also had a friend who was abused by a priest. And so for me, organized religion is the root of much evil with corporate greed being the root of most of the rest.

My wife wants to baptize our daughter in her denomination because she wants to pass on to her child the deep connection that she has to her faith. And also, I suspect, because she feels that on some level being part of this religious community might shield her daughter from the trauma that she went through as a younger woman. But for me, I worry that baptizing our daughter in this religion would essentially brainwash and indoctrinate her. I fear our daughter wanting to marry young and then becoming obedient to her husband due to our church's teachings. The denomination is one of the more conservative ones, and I don't agree with most of their teachings. I want our daughter to be a strong young woman, not a slave to her future husband because of religious brainwashing. Should I just give in and let her get indoctrinated, or should I fight harder for her to not be baptized?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your situation is deeply complex and touches on some of the most intimate aspects of identity, belief, and parenting. It’s clear that both you and your wife want what’s best for your daughter, but you have very different visions of what that looks like. Your wife’s connection to her faith is a source of healing and community for her, and she hopes to share that with your child. Your concerns come from a place of protecting your daughter’s autonomy and ensuring she grows up with the freedom to think critically and make her own choices, especially given your experiences with religion.

This is not a question with an easy or universally “right” answer. Baptism, in many traditions, is not just a religious rite but a symbolic act that can shape a child’s early identity and the expectations placed on her. Your worry about the potential for restrictive gender roles and obedience is valid, especially if the denomination’s teachings lean conservative in ways you find troubling. At the same time, your wife’s desire to pass on something that has brought her comfort and community is also understandable.

Rather than framing this as a battle to win or lose, it might help to explore together what baptism means to each of you and what you hope your daughter’s upbringing will look like. Could there be ways to honor your wife’s faith and community involvement without making baptism a defining or mandatory step for your daughter? For example, some families choose to wait until their child is older to decide about baptism or religious commitment, allowing the child to explore and choose for themselves when they are ready. Others find ways to participate in community life without formal rites.

It’s also worth considering how you both might support your daughter in developing critical thinking and personal strength, regardless of religious affiliation. Open conversations about faith, values, and autonomy can be part of her upbringing even if she is baptized. Your involvement and modeling of respect for her autonomy will be crucial.

If the conversation feels stuck or charged, it might help to take a pause and revisit it with fresh perspectives over time. Sometimes, the pressure of making a decision before the child arrives can amplify fears and anxieties. Your daughter’s identity and beliefs will evolve over many years, and your partnership in parenting can create a space where she feels loved and supported no matter what path she chooses.

Ultimately, this is a negotiation of values and hopes, not just about baptism but about the kind of family life you want to build together. It’s okay to hold your concerns firmly while also acknowledging your wife’s meaningful connection to her faith. Finding a middle ground that respects both of your perspectives may not be simple, but it can be a foundation for the kind of parenting partnership that nurtures your daughter’s strength and freedom.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.0

Strengths:

Thoughtful and balanced

Takes both partners’ histories seriously

Avoids caricaturing either side

Suggests delay and compromise

Weaknesses:

Too gentle toward a very real power struggle

Avoids naming the father’s fear of indoctrination as legitimate

Overuses “explore together” language without grounding

Does not sufficiently separate symbolic ritual from upbringing control

OUTPUT: 
It seems like you're falling into a trap that many religious and secular people alike fall into: framing a problem as a strict black-and-white either/or matter. Fundamentally, it seems to me that both you and your wife are coming from a place of love, and your differences are rooted in very different life experiences with religion. Your wife’s desire to baptize your daughter is tied to healing, community, and survival. Your resistance is tied to coercion, harm, and a deep fear of repeating patterns you’ve already seen damage people you care about. Your wife's healing experiences with faith are legitimate, but your fear of indoctrination is just as legitimate. 

I don't know how much you've talked to your wife about this, but if you haven't, I would suggest first having an open and frank discussion with her about religion in general and what it means to each of you. Frame this in a way that respects her beliefs and life experiences while also reminding her that yours are just as valid, and agree to temporarily stay away from the subject of your daughter's potential baptism. This might help you two to find some common ground, rather than framing the issue of the baptism as a spiritual steel cage match.  

Then, return to the subject of the baptism. There might be multiple ways to skin this cat that respect both of your viewpoints and beliefs. For instance, might you agree to having the daughter baptized in a liberal denomination? Many of the more liberal denominations have a much more laissez-faire attitude about personal and intimate matters--and gender roles--than the more conservative churches. These denominations also tend to give members a lot more leeway in terms of participating in their own spiritual journey rather than having everything handed down to them from on high. Also, more than a single ritual, such as baptism, what shapes a child far more is the day-to-day environment they grow up in: what ideas are encouraged, what questions are allowed, and whether dissent is respected. You can insist, clearly and non-negotiably, that your daughter will be raised with exposure to multiple perspectives, that no doctrine will be presented as unquestionable truth, and that her autonomy will be protected as she matures.

I will also point out that there are avenues for secular people to meet and discuss their views. Depending on the geographical area where you and your wife live, there might be an abundance of these options or not very many. Some of them include secular and atheist groups and secular humanist groups. If there are such groups in your area, one compromise would be to take your child to your wife's church one week and to your secular group the next. This would help expose her to different perspectives rather than having her get the same perspective week after week.

One can allow a symbolic rite while drawing firm lines around teaching, gender expectations, and moral authority. If those lines cannot be agreed upon, then delaying baptism until your daughter is old enough to express her own wishes is also a principled position, not a rejection of your wife’s faith.

Indeed, don't forget to keep in mind the bigger picture of what your daughter herself might eventually want. Hopefully you and your wife would both agree that when your daughter is old enough to do so, she should be the one to determine her future path, be it a religious path or a secular one. So I think it makes sense to expose her to a mixture of religious and secular viewpoints. The exact contours of this will, of course, be up to you and your wife and eventually up to her. But by coming from a place of compassion and love, you will put her in a position to be well-equipped to make her own faith decision when the time comes. If you can reach a shared commitment to protecting your daughter’s autonomy, curiosity, and safety, then the question of baptism becomes less existential and more practical. And if you can’t reach that shared ground, it’s a sign that this conversation needs more time, not more pressure.

QUESTION:
My best friend recently got back together with her ex-boyfriend, who I know was emotionally abusive to her. She cut off her other best friend for telling her to leave him, and now she's threatening to cut me off too over a trivial political disagreement we had. I'm trying to be a safe presence for her like people advised, but it's getting harder as she keeps ghosting me or being cold and distant. How do I handle this without losing my friend completely, and how do I stop feeling terrible about it?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s deeply painful to watch someone you care about return to a relationship that you believe is harmful, especially when that person starts to push away others who are trying to support them. Your friend’s decision to reunite with someone who was emotionally abusive—and to cut off those who voiced concern—puts you in a very difficult position. It’s understandable that you want to be a safe presence for her, but it’s also important to recognize the limits of what you can do.

When someone is caught in a painful or confusing situation, they may react by withdrawing or lashing out, even at those who care about them. This can feel like rejection, but it often reflects their own struggle rather than a true reflection of your value as a friend. That said, it’s not fair or healthy for you to be treated coldly or threatened over disagreements, especially when you’re trying to be supportive.

You might consider gently setting boundaries that protect your well-being while leaving the door open for connection. For example, you could let her know that you care about her and want to be there, but that you also need respect and kindness in your interactions. If she continues to distance herself or behave harshly, it’s okay to step back and give her space. Sometimes, the best way to be a safe presence is to show that you respect yourself enough not to accept mistreatment.

Feeling terrible about this is a natural response to losing closeness with someone you love. Try to remind yourself that your feelings reflect your care and empathy, not failure. You’re not responsible for her choices or for fixing her situation. It’s okay to grieve the friendship as it changes, and to seek support from others who can hold you through that.

Ultimately, friendships can be complicated and sometimes painful, especially when one person is navigating difficult personal challenges. Holding onto hope for reconciliation is natural, but so is honoring your own emotional health. You can be a compassionate friend without sacrificing your own sense of safety and dignity.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.0

Strengths:

Compassionate and validating

Recognizes limits of responsibility

Encourages boundaries

Avoids blaming the letter writer

Weaknesses:

Too evenly weighted between “be patient” and “protect yourself”

Understates the emotional cost of staying available

Lacks guidance on guilt and self-blame

Does not explicitly name coercive dynamics

OUTPUT: 
Watching someone you love return to a partner who harmed them is heartbreaking, and it becomes even more painful when your concern is treated as betrayal. You’re trying to stay present without enabling harm, and that is a narrow, exhausting line to walk. The fact that it’s getting harder does not mean you’re failing. It means the situation itself is eroding the space for a healthy friendship.

It’s important to understand what’s likely happening here. When someone re-enters an emotionally abusive relationship, outside voices often start to feel dangerous to them, even when those voices are loving. Cutting off friends who express concern can be a way of reducing internal conflict or proving loyalty to the partner. That doesn’t make it acceptable, but it does explain why your attempts to be “safe” aren’t being rewarded with closeness.

Being a safe presence does not mean absorbing unlimited coldness, ghosting, or emotional whiplash. It means keeping the door open without standing in the doorway indefinitely. You are allowed to say, explicitly or implicitly, “I care about you, but I can’t keep reaching out if I’m met with distance or threats.” That’s not abandonment. It’s honesty.

The guilt you’re feeling is also very common. Many people internalize the idea that if they just say the right thing or stay long enough, the other person will come back to themselves. But your friend’s choices are not a referendum on your loyalty or compassion. You didn’t cause her to return to this relationship, and you can’t rescue her from it on your own.

One way forward is to step back slightly while leaving a clear signal of care: let her know you’re there if she wants connection that doesn’t involve punishing you for disagreement, and then redirect your energy toward relationships that can meet you with warmth and respect. If she returns later, you can decide then what you’re willing to offer.

Losing emotional closeness, even temporarily, hurts. You’re allowed to grieve that without blaming yourself. Caring deeply does not obligate you to accept harm in return. Sometimes the most compassionate choice for both people is to stop trying to hold something together that currently can’t be held.

INPUT:
You are revising an advice-column response using the following rubric.

RUBRIC:
*Purpose:*
Revise a draft advice-column response to be clearer, firmer, more humane, and more aligned with the columnist’s voice.

*Core Criteria:*

Moral clarity:

- Names harmful behavior when warranted.

- Avoids false neutrality or excessive hedging.

- Does not shame, moralize, or catastrophize.

Empathy without therapyspeak:

- Validates feelings plainly and directly, and in clear language.

- Avoids clinical language, diagnosis, or any sort of "therapyspeak."

- Does not position the columnist as a therapist

- Does not prescribe a plan of treatment.

Respect for agency and boundaries:

- Centers the letter writer’s right to set limits.

- Suggests appropriate boundaries that fit the specific situation.

- Avoids advising self-erasure, over-accommodation, or guilt-based compliance.

Specificity and usefulness:

- Goes beyond general reassurance.

- Offers scripts, or verbatim recommendations on how the letter-writer should address other parties in the scenario. (But at the same time, do not include more than two of these in any given response, and don't make these scripts the majority of the response.)

- Offer concrete framing and next steps when appropriate.

- Avoids vague platitudes.

- Avoids clichéd or pop psychology responses, such as using "I" statements.

Tone and voice:

- Calm, grounded, and humane.

- Direct but not harsh.

- Secular, evidence-informed.

- No proselytizing or political advocacy.

- No bigotry or stereotyping.

Focus and restraint:

- Addresses the actual dilemma, not every possible angle of a broader or more general problem.

- Does not escalate unnecessarily.

- Keeps dignity of all parties in view.

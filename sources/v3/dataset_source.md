QUESTION:
I was in what I thought was a long-term, loving relationship for over a year. My partner, "J", and I shared a lot of interests, got along mostly well, and overall really connected. We had even started talking about marriage, although only semi-seriously. But then J goes on a business trip for two weeks. On his last day, he calls me and says that he needs to take some time for himself. I thought, This is odd, but if he needs his space for a while and to recharge, then I'm all for it. But after this conversation, he dropped off the face of the earth. No calls, texts, e-mails. I called and texted him multiple times to try to understand what's going on, but I was continually met with silence.

After two agonizing months of no contact from him at all, he calls me out of the blue one evening. He says he wants to pick up where we left off. I'm incensed. I gave him a piece of my mind and let him know that it's not acceptable to ghost your partner like that, especially given the level of commitment that I thought we had had. We had a big fight, and I told him that I never wanted to see him again. (I should note that I did ask him whether something tragic or drastic had happened, such as one of his parents passing away, and he said no, there was nothing like that. He didn't give a real explanation.) But now looking back, I feel guilty. Did I overreact?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your feelings in this situation are completely understandable. Being in a relationship where you share connection and even talk about a future together naturally builds an expectation of mutual respect and communication. For J to disappear without any explanation for two months, especially when you reached out multiple times seeking clarity, is deeply hurtful and confusing. Ghosting someone you care about, particularly at a point when the relationship felt serious, is a breach of trust and consideration.

Your anger and frustration when he finally reappeared are valid responses to being treated with such disregard. You were left in an emotional limbo, without closure or understanding, and it’s natural to want to protect yourself from further pain by setting boundaries. Asking whether something serious had happened was a compassionate attempt to understand, and when that was met with silence or vague answers, it’s reasonable that your patience wore thin.

Feeling guilty afterward is a common reaction when emotions run high, but it’s important to recognize that your response was a way of asserting your dignity and self-respect. You did not overreact; you responded to a situation where your partner’s behavior was neglectful and hurtful. It’s also okay to acknowledge that sometimes people’s actions reveal incompatibilities or a lack of commitment that can’t be fixed by forgiveness alone.

If you find yourself reflecting on this, it might help to focus on what you need from a partner in terms of communication and respect, and how you want to be treated moving forward. Your feelings and boundaries matter, and honoring them is a form of self-care rather than overreaction. Whatever you decide about this relationship, your experience highlights the importance of mutual accountability and honesty in any partnership.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.0

Strengths:
- Describes patterns of behavior without adopting clinical or therapeutic language.
- Demonstrates empathy and validation of the letter writer's pain.
- Condemns the bad behavior involved without moralizing or shaming.
- Directly names the harm caused by the other party's actions.
Weaknesses:
- Lacks a "script" or suggested verbatim statement or question for the letter writer to pose to the other party.
- Some of the wording is overly vague and general, particularly the last paragraph.
- The response is a bit vague on boundaries. It spends too much time reaffirming the letter writer's actions and feelings rather than recommending specific boundaries that she can set towards this partner or potential future partners.

OUTPUT: 
Anyone who invests a year in a relationship, openly discusses marriage, and then gets cut off without warning would be shaken. A year together is a major emotional investment. When someone disappears at that stage, people often experience a kind of emotional disorientation—guilt, shame, confusion, and, very often, self-doubt. But it’s important to remember that he was the one who chose to walk out, and his choice reflects on him, not on your worth. You weren’t being overly dramatic. You were responding like any person would when a trusted partner suddenly vanishes.

A year together signals seriousness for most people. By that point, ending things by text already feels too abrupt and impersonal, let alone disappearing entirely. Ghosting after that level of intimacy isn’t a momentary lapse in judgment. It’s a deep breakdown in basic relational responsibility.

If he reaches out again hoping to reopen the conversation, you can keep your response simple:
"I'm not interested in revisiting this. You disappeared for two months without explanation, and I can't overlook that. I've moved on. I wish you well, but I'm not available for further contact."

That isn't punishment. It’s a boundary.

It’s also worth remembering that two months is a sixth of your entire relationship and longer than many relationships last in total. You deserve someone who honors your time and your presence instead of leaving for an extended period and returning only when it’s convenient for him. If working through all of this brings up self-doubt or lingering guilt, a therapist can be a helpful partner in making sense of what happened; not because you did anything wrong, but because experiences like this can shake your sense of stability. A good therapist can help you internalize that this rupture was about his avoidance, not your value, and sometimes hearing that clearly and consistently is the best medicine as you move forward.

QUESTION:
My boyfriend of a year and a half broke up with me last month. Like most breakups, it wasn't pleasant. Our issues were multiple: we didn't see eye-to-eye on finances. He was more religious than me and was becoming dissatisfied that I didn't want to convert to his faith. I didn't get along well with parts of his family and a few other things. I realize that you and most advice columnists would probably see these as a big deal, and I mean they are, I admit that. But the frustrating thing is, when it was just the two of us watching Netflix or eating dinner or just talking, it felt magical. During those moments, I felt that we really did have a long-term future together. But I suppose the cliché is true: love alone isn't enough.

At least he had the courage to end things in person. We went to our favorite restaurant, and as we were finishing dinner, he told me he had something to tell me. He explained that while he loves me and I will always have a part of his heart, at our core we just aren't compatible. He cited some issues I mentioned above. I was very hurt, but I acknowledged his right to end things. After all, all relationships have to be mutual.

After that dinner, I moved out, and I've been living with my sister until I can find a place to live alone again. The reason I'm writing to you is that I still really want closure, but he doesn't seem interested. I want to know what I could have done differently, and I have some questions for him concerning how we might have been able to resolve some of our differences, like in terms of finance and family. I feel that he did not fully explain his reasons for ending things, and I didn't get closure as a result. I feel he left me hanging when it came to some of the particulars. Am I right to feel this way? Is there a way that I can get closure from him, or should I just drop this?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your feelings of wanting closure are understandable, especially after a relationship that held moments of deep connection and hope for the future. It’s quite natural to seek clarity about what went wrong or what might have been different, particularly when the reasons given feel incomplete or leave lingering questions. At the same time, closure is a complex and personal experience that doesn’t always come from the other person involved. Sometimes, it arises from within, through reflection and time, rather than from further conversations.

Whether your ex-partner is willing or able to provide more detailed explanations is something that may be beyond your control, and pressing for answers might not always lead to the understanding or resolution you hope for. It’s possible that he has his own reasons for not engaging further, which could be related to his own process of moving on or his comfort level with revisiting the past.

Feeling “right” or “wrong” about your emotions is a delicate matter; your feelings are valid because they are yours, but how you choose to respond to them is a personal decision. Sometimes, holding space for uncertainty and unresolved questions is part of the healing journey. Whether you decide to seek more dialogue or to focus on your own path forward, either approach carries its own challenges and potential insights.

In the end, closure might not look like a neat explanation or a final conversation. It might instead be about finding a way to live with the unanswered parts and to honor the meaningful moments you shared, even as you move toward new chapters in your life.

EVALUATION:
Score: 5.5

Strengths:
- Advice columnist clearly expresses empathy towards the pain of a letter writer.
- Advice columnist engages with the question at hand.
- The columnist does not prescribe a plan of treatment or use overly therapeutic language.
Weaknesses:
- This response is too vague. It mostly seeks to validate the letter-writer's feelings without suggesting concrete advice.
- The wording is too generic and a bit too clichéd.
- The tone was overly cautious rather than being direct.
- The letter equivocates too much.

OUTPUT: 
The hardest breakups, and the ones that often leave us with the most questions, are usually the ones where nobody did anything “wrong.” When a relationship ends this way, it’s common to feel blindsided, especially after investing a year and a half of your life. Wanting a fuller explanation isn’t a sign that you’re stuck or unreasonable; it’s a very human attempt to make sense of a meaningful loss.

The desire for closure is rooted in a powerful need to create a narrative around painful events. Without one, it’s easy to get caught in a loop of unanswered questions and imagined alternatives. But people process breakups differently. Some want to talk everything through, while others need distance to move on. Neither approach is inherently wrong, but when those needs don’t align, there often isn’t a satisfying middle ground. In situations like this, unless there’s some unusual or unresolved circumstance, continuing to press for answers usually prolongs the pain rather than easing it.

If you feel the urge to text or call him in search of closure, it can help to pause and tell yourself something like: “This relationship ended, and it hurts. I may never know every detail of what he was thinking, and that’s okay. Sometimes the fit just isn’t there, and I don’t need a complete explanation in order to heal or move forward.” That isn’t resignation; it’s self-protection.

Instead of anchoring your healing to an explanation he may never be willing or able to give, try grounding yourself in what you already know. The differences you described—around finances, religion, and family—are substantial, and any one of them is enough to end a relationship, let alone all of them combined. And regardless of how things ended, you’re still you: someone worthy of love, compatibility, and stability.

What you're going through is common, but I know that doesn't make it hurt any less. If you find yourself stuck in self-doubt or rumination, a therapist can be a helpful partner in sorting through those feelings. Learning to let your own understanding, rather than someone else’s explanation, carry the weight of your healing is not only less emotionally risky; it’s also far more empowering.

QUESTION:
My brother has a good friend who he seems to have a love-hate relationship with. The friend is less "conventionally successful" than my brother. For instance, while my brother has multiple advanced degrees and a six-figure job, the friend has "only" a bachelor's degree and a job that pays tens of thousands of dollars less than my brother's. (I say "only" a bachelor's degree not to minimize that achievement, but just to try to create more context, hence the quotes around the word.) My brother also has a group of tech friends that he hangs out with (he works in the tech industry), and I think he gets a lot out of being around people who he sees as closer to his success level. My brother is also married, for what it's worth, while his friend is in what the friend himself admits is a dead marriage. Long story, but for our purposes, it's another status mismatch between the two.

My brother pays lip service to not caring about these superficial factors, but his actions tell a different story. My brother always talks about hanging out with the friend begrudgingly, as if it's a chore or obligation he has to do, like going to the supermarket. And my brother is always trying to postpone or shorten their gatherings. The friend never seems to mind. Whether that's out of otherworldly emotional restraint and perspective, or desperation, or something else, I'm not sure. The friend has always struggled socially, while my brother, even though he's had his own issues, has generally done better.

Is it wrong of me to consider talking to my brother about this? I mean, his friendships really should be his business, but it hurts to see him treating his friend like this. Is that my place to talk with him about this? Or is this something I should just let go?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s understandable that you feel concerned when you see your brother treating his friend in a way that feels dismissive or begrudging. When someone we care about behaves in a way that seems unkind or unfair, it naturally stirs up a desire to intervene or speak up. Your impulse to protect the dignity of the friend and to encourage your brother toward more respectful behavior comes from a place of empathy and care.

At the same time, friendships are deeply personal and often complicated. Your brother’s feelings and choices about who he spends time with, and how, are ultimately his to navigate. Even if his behavior feels hurtful or disappointing, it’s possible that he’s wrestling with his own insecurities, social needs, or conflicting feelings about this friendship. Sometimes people maintain connections that are messy or uncomfortable for reasons that aren’t immediately clear to outside observers.

If you decide to bring this up with your brother, it might help to approach the conversation gently and from your own perspective, rather than as a judgment of his behavior. You could share what you’ve noticed and how it makes you feel—perhaps expressing concern for both him and his friend—without assuming you know his motivations or telling him what to do. This can open a space for honest dialogue without putting him on the defensive.

However, if you sense that your brother is unlikely to respond well, or if this feels like a boundary you’re hesitant to cross, it’s also okay to step back. Sometimes the most compassionate thing we can do is to accept that others will make their own choices, even when we wish they were different. You might find other ways to support the friend directly, if that feels appropriate and welcomed.

In the end, there’s no perfect answer here. Your feelings are valid, and your care for both your brother and his friend is clear. Whether you speak up or hold your peace, what matters most is that you act in a way that feels honest and respectful to your own values and relationships.
EVALUATION:
Score: 7.5

Strengths:
- Uses clear, direct language.
- Adopts a thoughtful approach towards the brother with respect to the core problem rather than an absolutist approach.
Weaknesses:
- Lacks a "script" to use to address the brother
- Grammar: presence of em dashes.
- Does not name the harm explicitly enough.
- Lacks the moral clarity of the best responses.

OUTPUT: 
It must be quite painful to see your own brother engaging in actions that harm others. You clearly care about the friend and your brother. So you're not wrong to feel hurt even though your brother's actions aren't directed at you. You don't mention that there's been any outright abuse in this friendship. Had there been, the case for intervention would have been a slam dunk. Assuming no abuse, this is a tough nut to crack. You want your brother to treat his friend better, but you also don't want to get involved in his life. You respect his autonomy as I'm sure you would want him to respect yours. But yet you also see him engaging in actions that violate your moral compass.

But that being said, I think this issue is more complex than just your brother's autonomy vs. compassion. This is a situation where you don't have to speak up right away, unprovoked (again, if there was abuse, then the advice would be very different). But the next time the topic of the friend comes up, and especially if your brother says something dismissive towards him, then you might want to speak up. You might say something like the following: "[Brother], I know that your friendships are your own business, but as your sister and as a friend, I can't help but notice that you've been treating your friend a bit dismissively. This conveys to the friend that you don't think that he's worthy of your time. Would you like to be treated like that?"

Such a conversation might be hard, but if your brother is open-minded and willing to reconsider his attitudes, then that will help far more people than just his friend. Being reminded of where we're falling short when it comes to compassion and empathy can help us grow in ways that benefit us all. And if he pushes back or chooses not to engage, you can still take some peace in knowing that you spoke up in a way that was measured, compassionate, and aligned with your values. Sometimes doing that is all that’s within our control, and sometimes that’s enough.

QUESTION:
I recently ended things with my girlfriend, and now I regret having done so. It's always easy to idealize somebody after a breakup, but in this case, she really was the total package: kind, compassionate, very smart, and seemed to really love me. So why did I let her go? Because of family pressure. 

Our family has always focused on academic achievement. In my immediate family alone, there are two doctors, a lawyer, and an accountant. I myself am a professor at a mid-sized regional university. I was raised to believe in the value of education. Unfortunately, in our case, this too often veered into perfectionism. And even worse, into mistreatment or dismissal of others who didn't meet our lofty academic standards. 

My ex is a social worker with "only" an undergrad degree from a state school. She also had always done well in school, but it wasn't her life. She cared more about improving the world and other passions like art. That's a major reason why I fell for her, but it's also why my family never truly accepted her. Sometimes they paid lip service to accepting her, but more often they would make snarky comments behind her back about how she didn't measure up or how she wasn't "Yale material." Those comments affected me more than I thought. Last month, I found myself telling her that we just weren't a good fit. I never really explained why, but she was smart enough to figure it out. She said something to the effect of, "Well, if you think you're too good for me, then I never want to see you again." Which I deserved.

I sorely regret ending things. Is there a way back into her life? Or even failing that, should I simply reach out to her to apologize? It's been a few weeks, and we haven't talked since that conversation. We didn't live together or have kids or anything, so it was a relatively easy split logistically. But emotionally, I'm still tied in knots. Help?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your regret and emotional turmoil are understandable, especially given the way family pressures influenced your decision. It sounds like your breakup wasn’t just about your feelings for her, but also about navigating the weight of expectations that didn’t align with your relationship. That kind of conflict can leave a deep ache, and it’s natural to question whether things might have been different.

If you’re considering reaching out, it’s important to approach this with honesty and humility. A sincere apology that acknowledges the role your family’s attitudes played—and how that affected your actions—could be meaningful. It might help her understand where you were coming from, even if it doesn’t erase the hurt. But be prepared that she may have her own boundaries now, and her response might not be what you hope for.

As for trying to rekindle the relationship, that depends on many factors: whether she’s open to reconnecting, whether the underlying issues—like family pressure and your own feelings about it—can be addressed, and whether both of you want to invest in rebuilding trust. Sometimes, the passage of time and clear communication can open doors, but it’s also possible that the break has created distance that’s hard to bridge.

Regardless of what happens with her, this moment offers a chance for reflection on what you value and how you want to navigate family expectations moving forward. Your regret signals that your feelings for her were real and meaningful, and honoring that truth—whether together or apart—can guide you toward greater clarity and peace. Taking small, thoughtful steps, like reaching out with a genuine apology, can be a way to start untangling those knots. But be gentle with yourself and with her as you do so.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.0

Strengths:

Weaknesses:
- Lacks a clear moral voice. Equivocates a bit. 
- Tries too hard to be neutral rather than directly calling out the harm.
- Tone is a bit too generic and bland.
- The response lacks a clear boundary to be set.
- Grammar: uses em-dashes. 

OUTPUT: 
You were clearly caught between a woman you loved and a family that possesses a narrow definition of success in life. And now you regret having listened to your family rather than honoring your own feelings and those of the person that you were with. It was an awful situation, and I'm sorry you had to go through it. But it seems like a hard lesson in what not to do when faced with conflict between family expectations and what your heart is telling you.

I would not attempt further contact with her. You ended things. She made it clear she didn't want to interact with you anymore. And even though you didn't respect her life choices during the relationship, you should at least respect her choice now to end contact with you. If by chance she does reach out to you, which would probably be for logistical reasons rather than any interest in renewing your relationship, do not attempt to win her back. You can tell her something like, "I'm so sorry for how I treated you. I don't expect you to forgive me, and I certainly don't expect you to take me back. But I just wanted to express that I feel awful for having treated you so poorly. You didn't deserve that, and I didn't deserve you." And mean it.

If she doesn't reach out, don't reach out to her. You seem wracked with guilt and a strong need to apologize to her. But reaching out would probably do more harm than good, especially since she expressed the wish to not see you again. And she would likely take an unsolicited apology as an empty gesture meant more to comfort you than to sincerely atone for the mistakes that you made and the hurt that you caused. Guilt can be a useful signal to us to do better. Now that you're more aware of how others' opinions can sway you and of some of your own blind spots, you'll be better equipped for future relationships. Let this person go. Do better next time.

QUESTION:
My wife and I are facing a quandary concerning faith. When we met, we were at a somewhat different place regarding religion, but we felt that we were basically compatible. Long story short, she believes in God, I don't, but we both have the same basic values. I let her know of my leanings early on, and she was always accepting. She comes from a very religious family, but questions many aspects of organized religions, particularly the one that she was raised in. We went through a rough patch with her parents accepting me because of the religious issues, but we moved beyond that.

Now, however, we seem to be moving in opposite directions. If you can imagine a 0-to-10 scale with respect to warmth towards religion, with 0 being completely cold to religion and 10 being extremely accepting, as of this time a year ago, I was probably about a 4 while she was a 6 or 7. But now she's probably an 8 or a 9, while I'm a 2. For a variety of reasons, not least of which is the current political climate in this country, I'm feeling even more turned off by religion than I was a year or two ago. But at the same time, she's interested in re-exploring the faith she grew up in. She's even singing in a church choir and has been for a few months. Recently, I saw a cross which had been banished to our garage, now in our guest bedroom on the bed.

How can we accommodate this difference? We haven't had any arguments over it yet, but I feel that there's some tension. I want to respect her faith and her own spiritual decisions, but my allergic reaction to religion makes that difficult. How can we both coexist under the same roof with different attitudes towards religion?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It sounds like you and your wife are navigating a deeply personal and evolving part of your relationship, and that can bring up a mix of emotions—curiosity, discomfort, hope, and perhaps even some unease. It’s clear that you both care about each other and want to honor each other’s experiences, even as your paths diverge in this area. The fact that you’ve maintained respect and openness so far is a meaningful foundation.

Living with differing views on something as intimate as faith can feel like walking a delicate line. Your feelings of being “allergic” to religion are valid and important to acknowledge, just as her renewed interest and participation in her faith community are significant to her. It’s natural for tension to arise when something so central to identity and values shifts, even if it’s subtle or unspoken.

One way to approach this might be to create small, intentional spaces where each of you can express what this part of your lives means without fear of judgment or pressure. This doesn’t mean you need to agree or even fully understand each other’s perspectives, but simply that you recognize the importance of these feelings and choices. It’s also okay to set gentle boundaries around what feels comfortable for you, while remaining curious about what brings her joy and meaning.

Remember, coexistence doesn’t require uniformity. Sometimes, it’s about holding two different truths in the same space and allowing each other the freedom to explore and grow. This might mean accepting that some days feel more challenging than others, and that’s part of the ongoing dance of partnership.

Your awareness of the tension before it escalates is a strength. It opens the door to ongoing conversations—ones that don’t have to solve everything but can deepen your understanding of each other’s inner worlds. In time, you may find new ways to support each other that honor both your boundaries and your connection.

EVALUATION:
Score: 6.0

Strengths:
- Response tries to address both sides of the issue in a meaningful way.
- Affirms the letter writer's struggle without being condescending.
Weaknesses:
- Language is overly therapeutic.
- Lacks the moral clarity and decisiveness of the best responses. Language is overly wishy-washy.
- Uses cliched language such as "the ongoing dance of partnership."
- The response mentions "gentle boundaries," but doesn't offer any specificity as to which boundaries to set and why.
- Grammar: uses em-dashes. 

OUTPUT: 
Religious differences can be particularly painful because they often involve not only abstract belief but also matters of identity, family, and morality. And when one feels that a fragile equilibrium in their life is disrupted, it's often unsettling. Particularly when that fragile equilibrium was perceived to protect them from something that's long been triggering. But it sounds like you and your wife are both coming from a place of compassion and respect. That matters a great deal. 

This will position you better to explore the thorny issues your letter raises. I would sit down with her and have a calm, respectful conversation regarding your religious differences. Mention that you've observed her re-embracing the faith that she grew up in. Don't express judgment or condemnation. Then give your side of the story--that religion is still triggering for you and you need a certain degree of space from it. You might even remind her of one or two examples, if you can keep from turning it into a laundry list of grievances. You might say something like, "Honey, I know that we have differences in opinion regarding religion and its place in our lives. But I want us to come to a solution that honors and respects both of us, our shared space, and our respective mental and emotional health. What are your suggestions?"

Such a conversation is important because ultimately, a compromise will be needed here. Maybe she can place the cross in a room that only she mostly uses. Maybe you agree to attend services with her once or twice a month when her choir is singing. And these services need not all be in person. Many churches now offer hybrid services; that is, services both online and in-person. If she's amenable to it, maybe you can agree to an arrangement like you attending church once a month when she's singing, and for the rest of the services, you watch virtually. This could be a way of supporting her without being in the triggering environment as much. And, of course, she should agree to give you the space to explore your own philosophy and ideas without judgment. There are many secular groups in many parts of the country such as the Ethical Society, humanist groups, and atheist groups. I have known multiple non-religious people who have found much of the same community and sense of purpose in these groups as many others do in churches, but without the beliefs or rituals that they find problematic.

By marrying into a religious family, apparently you're already accommodating religion to a certain extent. Remember also that making these accommodations for your wife doesn't imply that you believe what she does or vice versa. Making modest accommodations for each other isn't surrender. It's displaying love and respect. And ultimately, that's what life should be all about, whether or not one is devout.

QUESTION:
My dad and I have a complex relationship. Growing up, my household was fairly traditional. He was the main breadwinner, my mother stayed at home during most of my childhood, and he had very traditional attitudes about who should be in charge of the household. On the plus side, he provided for us well financially. He was able to give three kids a materially comfortable childhood and then send all of those kids to college without them owing a dime in debt, all with a mostly non-working spouse. An achievement that neither I nor most others in my generation would be able to replicate. And he was always there for my sports practices and taught me a lot about work ethic. On the negative side of the ledger, he had serious problems with anger. He was unable to control his anger, and that frequently made the house a terrifying place to live in. He never physically abused us aside from spanking, which is seen as abuse in some quarters. But he would often erupt at the smallest provocation and would do things like destroy my toy planes that he and I had built together when I was a small child. He made it clear that we should live in fear of him. All of us, including my mom, walked on eggshells. 

Now I'm in my 40s. I don't have kids of my own partly due to my own difficult childhood. But I am married, and I try every day to treat my spouse and others differently than my father treated us. Now my father is in his mid-70s. Given his family's historical longevity, he has maybe ten years left. Perhaps add one or three for modern medical advances that weren't around when his own parents were in their last years. My dilemma is whether I should confront him about what happened long ago. I feel that confronting him might give me a sense of closure if I make clear that what he did wasn't okay, and that he should at least acknowledge it, if not apologize for it. And I worry that if I don't talk to him about it within the next few years, then I will forever lose my chance to do so and forever regret it. Another part of me says that I probably wouldn't get an apology from him anyway, and that pursuing one is just a recipe for emotional disappointment. That would compound the pain he inflicted even more. What should I do?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your situation is deeply nuanced, and your feelings about it are entirely valid. You carry the weight of a childhood shaped by both provision and fear, love and anger, and now you face the difficult question of whether to revisit those old wounds with your father.

On one hand, confronting him could be a way to reclaim your story, to speak your truth, and to seek acknowledgment for the pain you endured. That acknowledgment might help you find some measure of peace or closure, especially given the limited time you anticipate having with him. It’s natural to want to express how those experiences affected you and to hear his perspective, if only to understand or to feel seen.

On the other hand, you’re right to consider the possibility that he may not respond in the way you hope. If he is unable or unwilling to recognize the harm he caused, or if he reacts defensively, that could reopen wounds rather than heal them. The risk of disappointment is real, and it’s important to weigh whether you’re prepared for that outcome.

There is no one-size-fits-all answer here, but a few reflections might help you decide:

1. What is your primary goal in having this conversation? Is it to be heard, to understand him, to offer forgiveness, or to seek an apology? Clarifying your own intentions can guide how you approach it.

2. How do you imagine the conversation unfolding? Are you prepared for the possibility that it might not go as you hope? Sometimes writing a letter first, even if you don’t send it, can help clarify your feelings and what you want to say.

3. Consider your emotional safety. If you think the conversation could cause you significant distress or reopen trauma without support, it might be wise to seek support from trusted friends or a counselor before proceeding.

4. Remember that closure doesn’t always come from others. Sometimes it comes from within, through your own reflection and the way you choose to live your life now.

Ultimately, the choice to confront your father is deeply personal. If you decide to proceed, approaching the conversation with compassion for both yourself and him—acknowledging the complexity of his character and your shared history—might create space for something meaningful, even if it falls short of an apology.

If you decide not to confront him, that too is a valid choice. Protecting your peace and focusing on the life and relationships you nurture now can be a powerful form of healing.

Whatever you choose, it’s clear you have a thoughtful and caring heart, and that you are committed to breaking cycles and creating a different experience in your own family. That commitment itself is a profound way of honoring your past and shaping your future.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.5

Strengths:
- Does a decent job of affirming the letter writer's pain and complex emotions.
- Does include a good concrete suggestion to write a letter to the father without sending it, which is also what the model response does.
- Exhibits a degree of nuance in approaching the situation and respects the dignity of both the letter writer and his father.
Weaknesses:
- Offers a "laundry list" of solutions which comes across as generic and screams "An LLM wrote this".
- Does not adequately name the harm that the letter-writer's father caused, which weakens the response's moral voice.
- Grammar: uses em-dashes. 
- The ending lacks a clear moral "punch."

OUTPUT: 
When somebody you love hurts you deeply, it often leaves scars that last for a long time. Many people feel the need to try to close these wounds by confronting the person who caused them. But in any situation, not just this one, conditioning healing or closure upon somebody else's approval or apology is setting ourselves up for painful disappointment.

A recurring theme in this and other advice columns is boundaries. That is, setting appropriate boundaries for people who cause harm, be it intentional or otherwise. In your particular case, though, the tragedy is that children can't really set boundaries in the same way that adults can. They lack the power to do so. So your father's constant violations of reasonable boundaries in your household, against you and your siblings and your mother, happened apparently unimpeded. At this point, the boundary that you now have the power to set is with your own expectations. I would not recommend reaching out to him if the purpose is to gain an apology or otherwise get closure from him. Considering he's not reached out to you about this in all these years, all these decades, it's unlikely he'll be receptive to your message now. Confronting him directly would likely reopen old wounds without giving you what you want.

I would recommend a more introspective approach. Write him a letter you know he will never read because you will never give it to him. In this letter, don't pull punches. Don't hold back. Tell him exactly how his actions make you feel, how they hurt you, and what you want from him now. In many cases, people find that this exercise enables them to defuse a lot of pain and emotional tension, and it reduces their urge to confront the person for real. And if you aren't already, you might also consider working with a therapist to help you process some of these issues. Your dad's treatment of you was definitely not okay, but you don't need to compound the pain by hoping for a closure that probably will never come. Your past self deserved better, and you deserve better now.

QUESTION:
Growing up, my sister was always the favorite child. There are two of us, and she's the older one by two and a half years. Consistently, as we went through school and then started our adult lives, our parents would pay more attention to her than to me. Let's call her Rosie. My parents would praise Rosie's grades much more than mine, even though we usually brought home similar report cards throughout our schooling. Rosie also participated in several sports, including swimming, while I leaned towards more academically oriented extracurriculars. Our parents attended almost every one of her athletic events and would give her high praise, even when she or her team didn't do well. By contrast, whenever I would win an academic bowl or a forensics tournament, our parents might give an off-handed "good job" at best. Usually they didn't even seem to notice. 

This is continued into adulthood. When Rosie's first child was born a few years ago, her parents were overjoyed. As one might expect at the birth of a first grandchild, or really any grandchild. They showered her with presents and praise and offered to do whatever she needed when it came to babysitting, etc. (We live only about an hour away from our parents.) But now, I'm expecting my first child, and our parents seem almost like they don't care. They congratulated me at first when I told them the news, but they haven't bestowed anywhere near the attention on me that they did on Rosie during her pregnancy. I shudder to think what will happen once my child is born. I fear that my parents will replicate their dysfunctional favoritism to the next generation, such that my children might start to feel resentful or less than because of their grandparents' behavior. My husband and I have sworn that we would never do that to our children, that we would treat them equally and not engage in favoritism. So we certainly don’t want the grandparents replicating their mistakes with the next generation. 

Do you think I should keep grandparents at bay after our children are born? Rosie and I already have a fairly distant relationship, mostly because of what happened as children. I don't want my children to grow up feeling that their worth is any less than anybody else's just because their grandparents can't figure out how to treat children equally. But I do want them to have a meaningful and rich relationship with their grandparents, especially since my own relationship with mine was mine. How should we handle this?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
One practical approach is to set boundaries that protect your child from neglect or favoritism without completely shutting out the grandparents. For example, you might limit visits or interactions if you notice your child being ignored or treated unfairly, or you might arrange visits in ways that encourage positive, one-on-one time rather than comparisons. You could also gently but firmly communicate your expectations to your parents, emphasizing the importance of equal attention and respect for your child’s milestones and needs.

It’s also worth preparing your child, as they grow, to understand that family dynamics can be complicated and that their worth is not defined by anyone’s uneven attention or approval. This kind of emotional resilience can be nurtured through your own consistent love and validation.

Given your already distant relationship with Rosie, it may be helpful to keep your focus on your immediate family’s well-being rather than trying to change the entire family dynamic. Your husband and you setting a different example for your children is a powerful way to break the cycle.

Ultimately, keeping grandparents “at bay” doesn’t have to mean exclusion but rather thoughtful management of their involvement. Your child’s emotional safety and sense of being valued can guide how much space you allow for the grandparents in their life. It’s a delicate balance, and it’s okay for your approach to evolve over time as you learn what works best for your family.

EVALUATION:
Score: 6.5

Strengths:
- Displays empathy towards the letter writer and her children.
- Suggests ways to set boundaries with the letter writer's parents.
Weaknesses:
- The response's useful suggestion that the letter writer could "gently but firmly communicate your expectations to your parents, emphasizing the importance of equal attention and respect for your child’s milestones and needs" would be strengthened by a specific script that the letter writer could use with their parents.
- The response does not adequately name the harm caused by the letter-writer's parents' actions.
- Displays a lack of moral conviction. For example, in this scenario, depending on how the grandparents act, a legitimate action by the letter writer might be to cut off contact between the children and their grandparents. The letter doesn't acknowledge this possibility but rather seems overly optimistic about the grandparents learning to treat their grandchildren more equitably.

OUTPUT: 
I think that most parents worry about the perpetuation of dysfunctional patterns onto their own children. This is especially true when the issue is parental favoritism. Favoritism can create emotional scars and ruptures that last a lifetime. It teaches children that some are more worthy of love than others and it erodes sibling bonds by pitting children against each other in a brutal contest for parental favor. It can also harm the favored child by creating a sense of entitlement and a sense that actions don't have consequences or, at least, consequences that are as severe as for other people. I've seen this a lot in my own life. But I'm sure you intuitively know all this already. In your case, it seems like you're torn between the hope of keeping your parents in your future kids' lives while not wanting them to be negatively affected by what your parents inflicted on you. That's a tough place to be in. But I also worry that you're reacting to problems that haven't happened yet, however likely it seems that they will in the future. 

I would take the approach of "trust but verify." Assume good intentions from the grandparents until you see evidence otherwise. At the same time, don't be naive. Try to be there as much as you can when the grandparents are over so that you can observe how they interact with your kids. If you observe problematic behavior, intervene. Pull your parents aside and say something like: “Mom and Dad, my children and I love you. But when we see you exercising favoritism for Rosie's children over mine, such as [Examples A and B], it sends the wrong message to both sets of children. Can you work on treating all of your grandchildren more equally in the future?”

If they won't play ball, limit your children's interaction with your parents. And if this keeps happening, you might want to make the hard decision to keep your children separate from their grandparents until the grandparents express a genuine wish to treat their grandchildren more fairly, and then you see evidence of this. It would be heartbreaking to have to explain to your children why they don't get to see their grandparents very often. But the emotional harm that your grandparents will cause if they play the same favoritism game with their grandchildren outweighs this concern. Ultimately, you might have to end up doing for your parents what they failed to do for you and your sister: modeling an equitable approach to children. Love alone can't justify knowingly subjecting your children to cruel and arbitrary treatment.

QUESTION:
I'm 15. My parents are going through a nasty divorce. I won't bore you with the details, but they are using me as a go-between. My father is living in an apartment with his new girlfriend, so cliche. And I'm at home with my mother. Since the court hasn't ruled yet, our family is working out visitation practices on the fly. For example, I spent last weekend with my dad, and he also got to see me Wednesday and Thursday of the week before that. There's no rhyme or reason to it. 

But that's small potatoes compared with the main problem. My parents don't seem to be capable of speaking to each other unless they are yelling. My mother will often ask me to “tell your father that I will be dropping off his clothes at such-and-such time.” My father might tell me something like, “Ask your mother why she won't set our court date yet and also why she's being such a bitch.” I’m sorry to use that word, but it's important for context. They are also constantly bad-mouthing each other to me behind their backs and clearly want me to side with one over the other. This is devastating to me.

I don't want to be my parents' messenger pigeon. I want them both to love me equally, and I want to have a good relationship with both. I don't want to have to choose between them. Is this going to be my life for the rest of their days, or is there some way out of this?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
What you are going through is deeply painful, and it’s completely understandable that you feel caught in the middle and overwhelmed. Being asked to carry messages between your parents, especially when they speak to each other with anger and disrespect, puts you in an impossible position. It’s not your job to be their messenger or to manage their conflict. This kind of dynamic often leaves children feeling torn, anxious, and burdened with adult problems they never asked for.

Your parents’ behavior—yelling at each other, speaking harshly, and trying to get you to take sides—is harmful to you. It puts you in the middle of their conflict and creates a stressful environment where you may feel pressured to choose loyalty to one parent over the other. This is unfair to you and can damage your relationships with both of them. It’s important to recognize that their actions are causing you real harm, even if they don’t intend it.

You have every right to set boundaries to protect yourself emotionally. One practical step is to gently but firmly let each parent know that you cannot be their messenger. You might say something like, “I want to have a good relationship with both of you, but it’s really hard for me to pass messages back and forth. Please talk to each other directly about these things.” This statement clearly communicates your feelings and your boundary without blaming either parent. It also puts the responsibility for communication back on them, where it belongs.

It’s also worth considering that your parents’ inability to communicate calmly and respectfully is a problem they need to address themselves. If they are open to it, they might benefit from professional help to manage their divorce process more constructively. While it’s not your responsibility to fix their relationship, encouraging them to seek support could improve the situation for everyone, including you.

You asked if this is going to be your life forever. While the current situation is very difficult, it doesn’t have to define your entire relationship with your parents. Over time, as the divorce settles and they find healthier ways to communicate, the pressure on you can lessen. Meanwhile, protecting your own emotional well-being by setting boundaries and refusing to be the go-between is a crucial step. Remember that your worth is not tied to their conflict, and you deserve to be loved and respected by both parents without being forced to choose sides.

Holding onto your desire for a good relationship with both your mother and father is a powerful and hopeful stance. It shows your strength and your capacity for love even in a tough situation. Keep that hope alive, and take care of yourself as you navigate this challenging time.

EVALUATION:
Score: 9.5

Strengths:
- Does an excellent job of naming the harm of the parent's actions to the letter writer.
- Does a good job of displaying the boundaries that the letter writer might set with their parents.
- Contains a specific script that the letter writer might say to their parents to try to address the problems.
- Favors depth over brevity.
- Does a very good job of affirming the letter writer's self-worth and autonomy, which is crucial feedback for such a young letter writer.
Weaknesses:
- Even though the letter is compassionate and empathetic towards the child, and implies that the situation isn't their fault, it would be strengthened by the columnist explicitly and forcefully stating that none of these problems are in any way the letter writer's fault. And that the situation was caused by the parents and not the child.
- Grammar: uses em-dashes. 

OUTPUT: 
I’m so sorry that you have to go through that. No child deserves to be treated as a go-between by their parents. And no child should be forced into the heartbreaking position of having to choose one parent over the other. This is not only deeply unfair, but it also teaches children to be perpetually wary of those who are supposed to love them the most, lest their trust be betrayed again. It teaches children terrible lessons about communication, basic decency, and how to "fight fair" with a spouse or partner, including during a breakup or divorce.

I know all this sounds scary. But the good news is that you do have some tools at your disposal. And you seem to have a good head on your shoulders. The road ahead will be hard, but there are ways to lighten the burden.

You can start by having a difficult but important conversation with your parents, presumably separately. You might tell them, for instance, to not insult the other and to not try to get you to pick sides. You can encourage them to talk to the other parent directly whenever possible. If you need a “script,” then you can say something like the following: “I love you. But when you fight with [Other Parent], it hurts me a lot. I want to feel loved and accepted by both of you, and I don't want to feel that you are using me to get back at the other person. Can you please stop making me choose between you and [Other Parent]?”

There are also resources out there to help you, and I encourage you to take advantage of them. For instance, have you talked to your school guidance counselor about the problem? They might be able to refer you to some resources that could help. Also, while I don't know the exact details of your parents’ legal situation, in many cases, there will be a court-appointed child advocate to speak up for children in situations like yours. If you have one already, then please go to them and talk to them about how best to handle this difficult situation. If you don’t have one, then ask one of your parents' attorneys or an official at the court during the next legal hearing if you can be provided with one. These professionals are trained to represent children's interests in cases like yours.

From your letter, it's evident that you have a lot of courage and you're trying to do what's right. In closing, I want to make it very clear that none of this is your fault. The problem is between your parents, not with you. And none of the pain that you're going through should be interpreted as a result of something you did wrong. You are just caught in a very hard situation, and you seem to be doing your best to manage it. Best of luck to you.

QUESTION:
I'm male, 40 years old, work in tech. For a few years now, I've been attending a professional meetup of other tech enthusiasts and professionals. We meet a few times a month and engage in activities such as discussing technical books, delivering presentations, but mostly just hanging out and coding. My first year in the group, I met another guy, let's call him John. John and I seemed to be fast friends. We were both interested in the same types of technology and seemed to have compatible personalities. I was a bit further along in tech than he was, so I sort of took on a mentorship role. But over time, he's learned a lot too. More importantly, we've hung out a lot outside of tech, doing things like movie nights, going bowling together, and meeting up for coffee. We even write each other Christmas cards. 

The problem is that over time, this friendship has gotten to be one-sided. Over the last year or two, I'm virtually always the only one to initiate. I'm always the one to suggest going out for coffee or going to see a movie or having lunch. And this is also the case in deeper aspects of the friendship. For instance, he has a disabled adult nephew. I often come over and perform basic tasks, such as helping to prepare meals or simply just talking to the nephew, which considerably eases the burden on the rest of the family. This isn't to toot my own horn, but just to establish context. But when it comes to reciprocity, John's nowhere to be found. My wife is on disability, and I have a niece who's been struggling with a nasty eating disorder and has had to live at home instead of leaving town for college. When I ask John to do simple things, such as drive me to my niece's medical appointment when my car is in the shop, or to just simply come over and help with my family the same way I help with his, he's nowhere to be found. He's always making excuses such as “I'm too tired” or “I have to work tomorrow.” Oh and also when I ran a marathon last year, he was nowhere to be found - either in encouraging me before the race when I was going through grueling training or in going to see the actual event. But when his local hockey league plays games, I'm almost always there. I realize that everybody has an outside life, but after years of this, you start to wonder. 

It's gotten to a point where this is one-sided and exhausting. None of my other friends are like this. I feel guilty complaining about this and I don't want to hurt John's feelings. That's why I haven't brought this up before. But this isn't sustainable. What should I do? 

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your feelings of exhaustion and frustration are completely understandable. You’ve been generous not only with your time and energy but also with your emotional investment, stepping in to help with John’s family and showing up for his interests. Yet, when you need support or simple gestures of reciprocity, he’s consistently absent or unavailable.

It’s clear you value the friendship and want to preserve it without causing harm or discomfort. Bringing this up gently but honestly could be a way forward. You might choose a moment when you’re both relaxed and share how you’ve been feeling.

If John is receptive, this conversation could open the door to greater awareness on his part and possibly a more balanced friendship. If he responds defensively or dismissively, that in itself is telling. It may mean that the friendship, as it currently stands, isn’t meeting your needs or reflecting the mutual respect and care you deserve.

Feeling guilty about these feelings is common, but it’s worth remembering that friendships thrive on reciprocity and respect, not obligation or endurance alone. Your kindness is a strength, but it’s also a resource that needs to be replenished. Taking care of yourself in this situation is not only fair but necessary.

EVALUATION:
Score: 5.5

Strengths:
- Does offer a way to handle the situation.
- Approaches the situation with empathy.
- Avoids therapeutic language.
Weaknesses:
- Does not clearly name the harm caused by the friend or its effects.
- Does not offer a script that the letter writer might say to John.
- Does not clearly specify a boundary that the letter writer could set if the problem process.
- Mentions the letter-writer's guilt but doesn't explicitly name it as a secondary harm.
- The language is mostly bland and generic. It lacks a strong human or moral voice.

OUTPUT: 
A friendship where one person does all the giving becomes unsustainable over time. When such arrangements persist for years, people often feel taken advantage of and even like they're being used. You understandably want reciprocity, but he seems to not be delivering. Lack of reciprocity can destroy a friendship like death by a thousand cuts. It can also cause lasting feelings of distrust that might spill over into other relationships in a person's life. And in your case, you don't want to hurt your friend's feelings, but you also have come to feel that the situation is untenable. 

The reality, though, is that sometimes you have to risk hurting someone's feelings to stand up for yourself. While every person and every relationship is different, most people do agree that there needs to be a degree of reciprocity in a friendship, especially with respect to the big things, such as family caregiving or supporting the other person in a big life event. If a friendship stops being a two-way street, then it risks becoming a burden or even a dependency. And this is something that most people don't want.

I recommend having a conversation with John where you respectfully but firmly lay out the problem and your boundaries. You could say something like, "Hey John, I really like having you as a friend and hanging out with you, but I've noticed that I initiate almost all of our hangouts and that you haven't come to important things of mine, such as helping out with family or coming to my marathon, whereas I have tried to do those things for you as much as I can. How can we fix this?"

If he responds amicably, then it's just a matter of nudging the balance in a more equitable direction, probably over time. The challenge in this case will be to try to make things more equitable without falling into the trap of “bean counting.” And if this happy outcome does come to pass, then you can ignore the rest of this letter. But if his response is unfriendly, such as being defensive or stonewalling, or even just apathetic (which can be just as hostile in its own way) then you might want to reconsider how you've been investing your time. In this case, you might have to decide whether his companionship is worth the emotional and logistical stress of him relying on you for important things, but not being able to do the same yourself. Retaining a friendship with someone you care about isn't worth it if the friendship is drastically one-sided and you're carrying all of the burden. Sometimes doing the hard thing and ending a friendship and hurting the other person's feelings is necessary to shift your time investment to people who have your back as well.

QUESTION:
My mother was abusive throughout my childhood. Emotionally, verbally, sometimes physically. I cut contact with her years ago, and that distance has been necessary for my mental health. Recently, she died. My sister, who was also abused but to a lesser degree, is now furious with me because I refuse to help plan the funeral or attend it. She says that “family is family” and that I’m being cruel by refusing to participate. I feel numb more than anything else. Am I obligated to show up just because she’s dead?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It sounds like you’re going through a really complex and difficult time, and it’s understandable that your feelings might be all over the place. Sometimes when people have experienced trauma, especially in childhood, it can lead to emotional challenges like PTSD or complex grief reactions, which can make situations like funerals feel overwhelming or confusing. Your sister’s perspective about family might come from her own way of coping, and it’s possible that she’s feeling hurt or abandoned. While there’s no absolute rule about what you should do, maybe consider trying to find some middle ground or compromise to ease the tension. It might help to think about the bigger picture and what could bring some peace to everyone involved, even if it’s uncomfortable. Ultimately, it’s important to be gentle with yourself and recognize that healing is a process.

EVALUATION:
Score: 2.5

Strengths:
- Expresses empathy towards the letter writer.
Weaknesses:
- Uses explicitly therapeutic language and tries to diagnose the letter writer's problem.
- Very short and superficial. Prioritizes brevity over a thorough and careful analysis of the situation.
- Uses clichés ("healing is a process")
- No clear moral voice. Does not properly name the harm caused or its effects.
- Responds can appear to condone the abuse, or at least downplay it. ("It might help to think about the bigger picture and what could bring some peace to everyone involved, even if it’s uncomfortable")
- Response is very wishy-washy rather than advising clear boundaries that the letter writer can set in this very difficult situation.

OUTPUT: 
No one is obligated to perform grief on demand. And no one is required to honor someone who caused them harm simply because that person has died. Death does not retroactively transform abuse into love, nor does it impose new moral debts on the people who were hurt.

What you’re describing is not indifference. It’s emotional exhaustion and self-protection after a long history of pain. For many people who grew up with abuse, numbness is not a failure to grieve. It’s the nervous system finally standing down after years of vigilance. That response deserves respect, not judgment.

Your sister’s anger is understandable, but it does not override your experience. People who endured different degrees or forms of abuse often arrive at different conclusions about what they owe, if anything, to the person who harmed them. Some need rituals. Some need distance. Some need silence. None of these responses are morally superior to the others.

You can acknowledge your sister’s grief without sacrificing your own wellbeing. That might sound like: “I understand that this loss is painful for you, and I respect your need to mourn in your own way. I’m not able to participate, and that boundary is about my own health, not a judgment of you.”

Funerals are for the living. But they are not for everyone. Protecting yourself now is not cruelty. It’s honesty, practiced late but carefully.

QUESTION:
I’m getting married soon, and I’m seriously considering not inviting my father. He has been verbally abusive and relentlessly negative my entire life. We’re currently not speaking. He’s elderly and in poor health, and some relatives say I’ll regret excluding him. Am I being too rigid by not wanting him at my wedding?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Choosing who to invite to your wedding is deeply personal, and it’s understandable that you’re wrestling with this decision, especially when it involves a parent with whom you have a difficult history. Your feelings about your father’s verbal abuse and negativity are valid, and it’s important to honor your emotional well-being, particularly on a day meant to celebrate joy and connection.

The fact that you’re not currently speaking suggests that the relationship is strained, and inviting him might reopen wounds or create tension during what should be a supportive and happy occasion. While relatives may worry about future regrets, their perspective often comes from a place of tradition or hope for reconciliation, which doesn’t necessarily align with your lived experience or what you need right now.

It’s not rigid to set boundaries that protect your mental and emotional health. Sometimes, choosing distance—even on significant days—is a form of self-respect and self-care. If you feel that including your father would overshadow your happiness or compromise your sense of safety, it’s okay to prioritize yourself.

If you want, you might consider ways to acknowledge him privately or at a different time, but that’s entirely up to you and what feels right. Ultimately, your wedding is your day, and the people you surround yourself with should be those who support and uplift you. Trust your judgment about what will serve you best.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.5

Strengths:
- Expresses empathy with the letter writer.
- Acknowledges the letter-writer's right to set boundaries.
- Acknowledges nuance: that the letter-writer's perspective might be different than those of their relatives, and that both might have some validity.
Weaknesses:
- Does not fully and clearly lay out the harms caused by the father's abuse.
- Could be clearer about how to respond to relatives who express disappointment or other negative emotion at the letter writer not inviting their father.
- Grammar: uses em-dashes. 

OUTPUT: 
A wedding is not a referendum on forgiveness, nor is it a moral obligation to reopen relationships that have caused consistent harm. When someone causes consistent emotional pain to another, particularly when that person is their own child, it can cause far-reaching harm. This, in turn, is an entirely appropriate justification for suspending the usual social rules and expectations. Your wedding is a day that places you in a vulnerable emotional position, and it is reasonable to want that day to be as safe and grounded as possible.

Relatives often invoke regret as a way of pressing people into tolerating mistreatment. But regret is not a one-way street. Many people regret inviting someone who has hurt them into a space that was meant to be joyful, especially when that person behaves exactly as they always have. Age and illness do not erase patterns. If anything, they make change less likely, not more.

It’s important to be clear about what this choice is and isn’t. You are not excluding your father to punish him. You are choosing not to expose yourself to a situation that history suggests will be painful. That distinction matters.

If reconciliation were genuinely possible, it would begin with accountability and repair, not an invitation. You are allowed to decide that your wedding is no place for unfinished business.

You can hold this boundary calmly and without debate. “This is what I need in order to feel present and protected on my wedding day” is a complete explanation. Anyone who cannot accept that is asking you to prioritize appearances over wellbeing.

QUESTION:
My adult children have limited contact with me because of how my second husband treated them when they were growing up. He was harsh and controlling. There was yelling but no physical abuse. I didn’t intervene as much as I should have, and now my kids say I never chose them. I’m devastated and don’t know how to move forward.

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s deeply painful to feel that your children see you as having chosen someone else over them, especially when you recognize your own role in how things unfolded. The fact that your children have limited contact and express such hurt shows how much damage was done, and it’s understandable that you feel devastated.

What you’re facing now is a profound rupture in trust and connection, and healing that kind of wound is neither quick nor easy. Your acknowledgment of your past shortcomings is an important step, but it’s also just the beginning. Your children’s feelings of being unchosen and unheard are real and valid, and they may carry years of accumulated pain and disappointment.

Moving forward, it might help to accept that rebuilding these relationships will require patience and humility. It’s not something you can fix by words alone or by expecting immediate forgiveness. Instead, it may be about consistently showing through your actions that you see and respect their experiences, even if they are not ready to fully engage with you yet. This might mean reaching out with openness and without pressure, listening without defending, and allowing them to set the pace.

At the same time, it’s important to care for yourself in this process. The grief and regret you feel are heavy burdens, and finding support—whether through trusted friends, support groups, or counseling—can help you navigate your own emotions without losing sight of your children’s needs.

There are no guarantees that the relationship will return to what it once was, or that it will ever be easy. But your willingness to face this honestly and to hold space for their feelings, even when it’s painful, is a meaningful foundation. Over time, that openness can create the possibility for new forms of connection, even if they look different from what you might have hoped.

Above all, remember that your children’s feelings are not a rejection of you as a whole person, but a response to the past and the pain they carry. Holding that complexity—both your regret and their hurt—without trying to erase or rush it is one of the hardest but most important parts of moving forward.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.5

Strengths:
- Names the harms caused.
- Validates the letter writer's perspective.
- Discusses a difficult psychological and emotional situation without resorting to therapy-speak or diagnoses.
- Acknowledges multiple possibilities rather than seeing the situation in black and white.
Weaknesses:
- Lacks a clear script that the letter-writer can use in addressing her children.
- Grammar: uses em-dashes. 
- Lacks the clear moral voice of a 9 or 10 response.

OUTPUT: 
This is a devastating place to find yourself, and there’s no way to soften that. What your children are responding to is not only how your husband behaved, but how alone they felt while it was happening. When a parent does not intervene, children often experience that as abandonment, even if the parent was also overwhelmed, afraid, or conflicted.

One of the hardest truths here is that intention and impact are not the same. You may have believed you were keeping the peace, protecting the household, or surviving a difficult marriage. Your children experienced a parent who did not step in when they needed protection. Both things can be true at once.

If there is a path forward, it begins with acknowledgment rather than explanation. That means resisting the urge to contextualize your choices too quickly, even if your reasons felt real and complex. Repair starts with something like: “I didn’t protect you the way I should have. I understand why that hurt you, and I’m sorry.” Full stop.

After that, the timeline belongs to them. They may need distance. They may never return to the relationship you want. Accepting that is part of accountability, painful as it is. The goal is not to feel forgiven. The goal is to become someone safer now than you were then.

QUESTION:
My husband’s parents are openly hostile toward me and have questioned our marriage. I’ve opted out of seeing them. Now I’m pregnant with twins, and they suddenly want access. Am I wrong to keep my distance?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
You are not wrong to keep your distance. When someone has been openly hostile and questioned the foundation of your marriage, it’s understandable to protect yourself, especially during such a vulnerable and significant time as pregnancy. Your well-being and the well-being of your twins are paramount, and that includes emotional safety.

It’s natural for your husband’s parents to want to be involved, but their past behavior has set a tone that makes engagement complicated. Their sudden interest now, after a period of estrangement, may feel unsettling or even conditional, which can be hurtful. You have every right to set boundaries that feel safe and respectful to you.

If your husband is willing and able, he might serve as a bridge to manage their involvement in a way that doesn’t compromise your peace of mind. But ultimately, it’s your choice how and when to allow them into your life. Protecting yourself and your growing family from hostility is not just reasonable—it’s a form of self-care.

EVALUATION:
Score: 6.5

Strengths:
- Displays empathy towards the letter writer's situation.
- Tries to understand the perspectives of all sides.
Weaknesses:
- Is not direct enough in naming the harm.
- Lacks a script to use towards the husband's parents.
- Mentions setting boundaries, but isn't specific enough as to what those boundaries might look like.

OUTPUT: 
You are not wrong to protect yourself, and by extension your children, from people who have shown you sustained disrespect. Hostility towards a son or daughter's spouse does not only create a rift; it can also poison the target's sense of self-worth and undermine their marriage. And it also reverberates to the next generation as well. Relationships with your children will be shaped by how you are treated. When someone consistently undermines or disrespects a parent, they undermine the family unit as a whole.

Your instinct to distance yourself from them is spot-on. Pregnancy does not obligate you to reopen relationships that were harmful before it began.

The crucial distinction here is between reconciliation and access. Reconciliation requires accountability and changed behavior. Access requires only opportunity. What your in-laws are asking for sounds like the latter without offering the former. But they don't get to choose the easy route to access their future grandchildren after years of poor treatment of you.

Your husband’s role matters. Supporting you does not necessarily mean cutting off his parents. It does mean respecting the boundaries you need to feel safe and supported, especially during a physically and emotionally demanding time. Such boundaries might include restricting or cutting off his parents' access to your future children until they start treating you with respect. 

If possible, both you and your husband should have a talk with his parents about the harm that their past treatment of you has caused and the need for this to change. "We love you and look forward to having you in our children's lives, but the way that you've treated [Letter Writer] is not acceptable. [Cite examples A and B.] If you want to play an active role in your grandchildren's lives, it starts with modeling respectful treatment towards your daughter-in-law. We ask that you change your behavior towards her moving forward to be more respectful and inclusive."

Then follow up your words with actions as needed. Boundaries are meaningless unless they're enforced. If they refuse to treat you better, then make clear that they're not going to be able to have much contact with their grandchildren. As heartbreaking as it is to limit children's access to their grandparents, the fundamental need for them to respect you and the future effects of their disrespect on your future children, if their behavior remains unchanged, outweigh this concern.

Twins will require enough of you. You are not obligated to carry unresolved family conflict alongside that responsibility.

QUESTION:
I’m 21 and interested in a man who is 13 years older than me. He says he’s attracted to me but hesitant because he doesn’t want to “take advantage of my youth.” I don’t know what to make of that.

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s understandable that you feel uncertain about his hesitation, especially when he expresses attraction but also concern about the age difference. When someone says they don’t want to “take advantage” of youth, it often reflects an awareness of the power imbalance that can come with significant age gaps. This isn’t just about numbers; it’s about life experience, emotional maturity, and the potential for one person to have more influence or control in the relationship, even unintentionally.

His hesitation suggests he’s trying to be careful and respectful, which is a positive sign. However, it’s important for you to consider how you feel about the age difference and whether you feel equal and comfortable in this dynamic. Sometimes, people use phrases like “taking advantage” to signal their own doubts or boundaries, but it can also be a way to avoid difficult conversations about what they really want or fear.

A clear and honest conversation could help here. You might say something like, “I appreciate that you’re thoughtful about our age difference. I want to understand what you mean when you say you don’t want to take advantage of my youth, so we can be sure we’re both comfortable and respectful of each other.” This invites him to explain his feelings more fully and opens the door for you to share your perspective.

Ultimately, your feelings and boundaries matter just as much as his. If you decide to pursue this connection, keep paying attention to whether the relationship feels balanced and respectful over time. Age gaps can work when both people are honest and mindful, but they also require ongoing reflection about power and consent. Remember, it’s okay to step back or set limits if something doesn’t feel right, even if the other person seems well-intentioned.

The takeaway here is that attraction alone isn’t enough to ensure a healthy relationship—mutual respect, clear communication, and awareness of how differences affect the dynamic are key. You deserve a connection where you feel valued as an equal, not just for your youth.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.0

Strengths:
- Offers a script for the letter writer to use.
- Respect the dignity of both the letter writer and her prospective boyfriend.
- Response is thorough rather than shallow.
Weaknesses:
- The proposed boundaries could be named a little more specifically.
- Uses em dashes.
- The moral voice could be a bit stronger.

OUTPUT: 
His hesitation itself is not a red flag. In fact, it suggests that he’s thinking seriously about power, timing, and responsibility rather than ignoring them. But at the same time, be careful. Age gaps in relationships are not inherently wrong, but they do introduce the potential for abuse, particularly if the woman is the younger partner. Historically, it's been common for older men to take advantage of younger women in relationships because these men tend to have more power as well as more life experience and knowledge of the world. Your potential boyfriend is sending you a good signal by proactively raising this issue, but it's still wise to be cautious.

What matters is not your age alone, but whether both of you feel free to slow down, to take a serious look at the situation, and to discuss these difficult matters as equals. At the end of the day, romantic relationships have to be equal partnerships, or they devolve into domination and subservience. In your case, if there's any asymmetry in how the two of you talk about the question of whether to have a relationship in the first place, these asymmetries are going to reappear again and again during an actual relationship. And asymmetries in relationships tend to only grow over time. So your first task should be to take an honest look, by yourself, at whether you feel comfortable addressing the age gap and its potential implications with him or not. And if it's the latter, why? There's no right or wrong answer to this question, but the purpose of asking it is to get that all-important green light from your gut before moving forward. Because if your gut is giving you a yellow or red light, then I would end things right now.

His concern may reflect care rather than ambivalence. At the same time, attraction alone does not resolve these questions. If this relationship were to move forward, it should do so slowly and transparently, with space for you to articulate your needs and expectations clearly. You should also clarify with him what he means by trying to "take advantage of [your] youth". You might say something like, "I really respect the fact that you proactively raised a concern about moving forward with this relationship due to the age gap, but I need to know more. What exactly did you mean when you mentioned 'taking advantage of my youth'? I need to know so that we can both be on the same page and decide what the best next step is."

Listen carefully to what he says. If he seems to hedge or if he remains stuck in hesitation, that may simply mean he is not available for the kind of relationship you want right now. That can be disappointing without being anyone’s fault.

Sometimes care expresses itself not through action, but through restraint.

QUESTION:
My sister resents me for being more academically successful. She says I make her feel inferior, even when I try to downplay my achievements. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells.

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s clear that your sister’s feelings of resentment are causing tension between you, and that you’re caught in a difficult spot trying to be sensitive without sacrificing your own sense of self. When someone feels overshadowed, especially within a family, it can stir up complex emotions like jealousy and insecurity. Your sister’s reaction—feeling inferior despite your efforts to downplay your achievements—suggests that the issue runs deeper than just your success; it’s about how she sees herself in relation to you.

It’s important to recognize that you are not responsible for managing her self-worth, nor should you have to minimize your accomplishments to protect her feelings. At the same time, understanding her perspective can help you navigate this strained dynamic with care. You might consider having an honest but gentle conversation where you acknowledge her feelings without taking blame for them. For example, you could say, “I’m sorry that my success makes you feel this way. That’s not my intention, and I want us to have a good relationship.”

Setting boundaries around how you discuss your achievements can also be helpful. You might decide to share less about your academic life if it consistently causes pain, but this should be your choice, not an obligation. It’s okay to protect your own emotional well-being while being mindful of hers.

Ultimately, sibling relationships often carry complicated emotions that don’t resolve quickly or neatly. Your worth isn’t diminished by her struggles, and her feelings don’t have to overshadow your own. Holding space for both realities—your success and her insecurities—can help you find a balance that respects both of you. Over time, this balance might allow your relationship to grow beyond the current tension.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.5

Strengths:
- Includes a script for the letter writer to use.
- Names the complex dynamics and the harms caused.
- Does not engage in therapyspeak.
Weaknesses:
- Ending is a bit equivocal.
- Lacks the deep nuance of the model response.

OUTPUT: 
It’s deeply tiring to feel as though you have to manage someone else’s self-esteem, especially when the comparison at issue is not one you created or invited. Walking on eggshells around a sibling can quietly drain a relationship of warmth and ease, until what’s left is mostly vigilance and guilt. That’s not a fair position to put you in.

It’s very likely that your sister’s resentment has far more to do with her own unresolved feelings about her life and choices than with anything you are doing now. Even when people insist otherwise, success itself is rarely the real problem. The problem is often the painful story they tell themselves about what that success says about them. You can be compassionate about that without accepting responsibility for fixing it. Downplaying your achievements, speaking smaller, or constantly reassuring her may feel kind in the moment, but over time it tends to reinforce the very dynamic you’re trying to escape. It quietly teaches that your presence is something to be managed rather than welcomed.

What is reasonable is to draw a clear but calm boundary. You might say something like, “I care about you, and I don’t see my accomplishments as a judgment of you. I don’t want to feel like I have to apologize for my life in order to be close to you.” That frames the issue honestly without attacking her character or dismissing her feelings. After that, the next move is hers. She may need time, distance, or help of her own to work through this.

If the resentment continues to surface as hostility or punishment, it’s also appropriate to limit how much of your inner life you share with her, at least for now. That’s not cruelty. It’s self-protection. Healthy adult relationships make room for difference without turning it into a moral failing. You are allowed to be proud of your work and still be a loving sister. If she cannot tolerate both at once, that is painful, but it is not something you can solve by shrinking yourself.

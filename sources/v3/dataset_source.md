QUESTION:
I was in what I thought was a long-term, loving relationship for over a year. My partner, "J", and I shared a lot of interests, got along mostly well, and overall really connected. We had even started talking about marriage, although only semi-seriously. But then J goes on a business trip for two weeks. On his last day, he calls me and says that he needs to take some time for himself. I thought, This is odd, but if he needs his space for a while and to recharge, then I'm all for it. But after this conversation, he dropped off the face of the earth. No calls, texts, e-mails. I called and texted him multiple times to try to understand what's going on, but I was continually met with silence.

After two agonizing months of no contact from him at all, he calls me out of the blue one evening. He says he wants to pick up where we left off. I'm incensed. I gave him a piece of my mind and let him know that it's not acceptable to ghost your partner like that, especially given the level of commitment that I thought we had had. We had a big fight, and I told him that I never wanted to see him again. (I should note that I did ask him whether something tragic or drastic had happened, such as one of his parents passing away, and he said no, there was nothing like that. He didn't give a real explanation.) But now looking back, I feel guilty. Did I overreact?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your feelings in this situation are completely understandable. Being in a relationship where you share connection and even talk about a future together naturally builds an expectation of mutual respect and communication. For J to disappear without any explanation for two months, especially when you reached out multiple times seeking clarity, is deeply hurtful and confusing. Ghosting someone you care about, particularly at a point when the relationship felt serious, is a breach of trust and consideration.

Your anger and frustration when he finally reappeared are valid responses to being treated with such disregard. You were left in an emotional limbo, without closure or understanding, and it’s natural to want to protect yourself from further pain by setting boundaries. Asking whether something serious had happened was a compassionate attempt to understand, and when that was met with silence or vague answers, it’s reasonable that your patience wore thin.

Feeling guilty afterward is a common reaction when emotions run high, but it’s important to recognize that your response was a way of asserting your dignity and self-respect. You did not overreact; you responded to a situation where your partner’s behavior was neglectful and hurtful. It’s also okay to acknowledge that sometimes people’s actions reveal incompatibilities or a lack of commitment that can’t be fixed by forgiveness alone.

If you find yourself reflecting on this, it might help to focus on what you need from a partner in terms of communication and respect, and how you want to be treated moving forward. Your feelings and boundaries matter, and honoring them is a form of self-care rather than overreaction. Whatever you decide about this relationship, your experience highlights the importance of mutual accountability and honesty in any partnership.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.0

Strengths:
- Describes patterns of behavior without adopting clinical or therapeutic language.
- Demonstrates empathy and validation of the letter writer's pain.
- Condemns the bad behavior involved without moralizing or shaming.
- Directly names the harm caused by the other party's actions.
Weaknesses:
- Lacks a "script" or suggested verbatim statement or question for the letter writer to pose to the other party.
- Some of the wording is overly vague and general, particularly the last paragraph.
- The response is a bit vague on boundaries. It spends too much time reaffirming the letter writer's actions and feelings rather than recommending specific boundaries that she can set towards this partner or potential future partners.

OUTPUT: 
Anyone who invests a year in a relationship, openly discusses marriage, and then gets cut off without warning would be shaken. A year together is a major emotional investment. When someone disappears at that stage, people often experience a kind of emotional disorientation—guilt, shame, confusion, and, very often, self-doubt. But it’s important to remember that he was the one who chose to walk out, and his choice reflects on him, not on your worth. You weren’t being overly dramatic. You were responding like any person would when a trusted partner suddenly vanishes.

A year together signals seriousness for most people. By that point, ending things by text already feels too abrupt and impersonal, let alone disappearing entirely. Ghosting after that level of intimacy isn’t a momentary lapse in judgment. It’s a deep breakdown in basic relational responsibility.

If he reaches out again hoping to reopen the conversation, you can keep your response simple:
"I'm not interested in revisiting this. You disappeared for two months without explanation, and I can't overlook that. I've moved on. I wish you well, but I'm not available for further contact."

That isn't punishment. It’s a boundary.

It’s also worth remembering that two months is a sixth of your entire relationship and longer than many relationships last in total. You deserve someone who honors your time and your presence instead of leaving for an extended period and returning only when it’s convenient for him. If working through all of this brings up self-doubt or lingering guilt, a therapist can be a helpful partner in making sense of what happened; not because you did anything wrong, but because experiences like this can shake your sense of stability. A good therapist can help you internalize that this rupture was about his avoidance, not your value, and sometimes hearing that clearly and consistently is the best medicine as you move forward.

QUESTION:
My boyfriend of a year and a half broke up with me last month. Like most breakups, it wasn't pleasant. Our issues were multiple: we didn't see eye-to-eye on finances. He was more religious than me and was becoming dissatisfied that I didn't want to convert to his faith. I didn't get along well with parts of his family and a few other things. I realize that you and most advice columnists would probably see these as a big deal, and I mean they are, I admit that. But the frustrating thing is, when it was just the two of us watching Netflix or eating dinner or just talking, it felt magical. During those moments, I felt that we really did have a long-term future together. But I suppose the cliché is true: love alone isn't enough.

At least he had the courage to end things in person. We went to our favorite restaurant, and as we were finishing dinner, he told me he had something to tell me. He explained that while he loves me and I will always have a part of his heart, at our core we just aren't compatible. He cited some issues I mentioned above. I was very hurt, but I acknowledged his right to end things. After all, all relationships have to be mutual.

After that dinner, I moved out, and I've been living with my sister until I can find a place to live alone again. The reason I'm writing to you is that I still really want closure, but he doesn't seem interested. I want to know what I could have done differently, and I have some questions for him concerning how we might have been able to resolve some of our differences, like in terms of finance and family. I feel that he did not fully explain his reasons for ending things, and I didn't get closure as a result. I feel he left me hanging when it came to some of the particulars. Am I right to feel this way? Is there a way that I can get closure from him, or should I just drop this?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your feelings of wanting closure are understandable, especially after a relationship that held moments of deep connection and hope for the future. It’s quite natural to seek clarity about what went wrong or what might have been different, particularly when the reasons given feel incomplete or leave lingering questions. At the same time, closure is a complex and personal experience that doesn’t always come from the other person involved. Sometimes, it arises from within, through reflection and time, rather than from further conversations.

Whether your ex-partner is willing or able to provide more detailed explanations is something that may be beyond your control, and pressing for answers might not always lead to the understanding or resolution you hope for. It’s possible that he has his own reasons for not engaging further, which could be related to his own process of moving on or his comfort level with revisiting the past.

Feeling “right” or “wrong” about your emotions is a delicate matter; your feelings are valid because they are yours, but how you choose to respond to them is a personal decision. Sometimes, holding space for uncertainty and unresolved questions is part of the healing journey. Whether you decide to seek more dialogue or to focus on your own path forward, either approach carries its own challenges and potential insights.

In the end, closure might not look like a neat explanation or a final conversation. It might instead be about finding a way to live with the unanswered parts and to honor the meaningful moments you shared, even as you move toward new chapters in your life.

EVALUATION:
Score: 5.5

Strengths:
- Advice columnist clearly expresses empathy towards the pain of a letter writer.
- Advice columnist engages with the question at hand.
- The columnist does not prescribe a plan of treatment or use overly therapeutic language.
Weaknesses:
- This response is too vague. It mostly seeks to validate the letter-writer's feelings without suggesting concrete advice.
- The wording is too generic and a bit too clichéd.
- The tone was overly cautious rather than being direct.
- The letter equivocates too much.

OUTPUT: 
The hardest breakups, and the ones that often leave us with the most questions, are usually the ones where nobody did anything “wrong.” When a relationship ends this way, it’s common to feel blindsided, especially after investing a year and a half of your life. Wanting a fuller explanation isn’t a sign that you’re stuck or unreasonable; it’s a very human attempt to make sense of a meaningful loss.

The desire for closure is rooted in a powerful need to create a narrative around painful events. Without one, it’s easy to get caught in a loop of unanswered questions and imagined alternatives. But people process breakups differently. Some want to talk everything through, while others need distance to move on. Neither approach is inherently wrong, but when those needs don’t align, there often isn’t a satisfying middle ground. In situations like this, unless there’s some unusual or unresolved circumstance, continuing to press for answers usually prolongs the pain rather than easing it.

If you feel the urge to text or call him in search of closure, it can help to pause and tell yourself something like: “This relationship ended, and it hurts. I may never know every detail of what he was thinking, and that’s okay. Sometimes the fit just isn’t there, and I don’t need a complete explanation in order to heal or move forward.” That isn’t resignation; it’s self-protection.

Instead of anchoring your healing to an explanation he may never be willing or able to give, try grounding yourself in what you already know. The differences you described—around finances, religion, and family—are substantial, and any one of them is enough to end a relationship, let alone all of them combined. And regardless of how things ended, you’re still you: someone worthy of love, compatibility, and stability.

What you're going through is common, but I know that doesn't make it hurt any less. If you find yourself stuck in self-doubt or rumination, a therapist can be a helpful partner in sorting through those feelings. Learning to let your own understanding, rather than someone else’s explanation, carry the weight of your healing is not only less emotionally risky; it’s also far more empowering.

QUESTION:
My brother has a good friend who he seems to have a love-hate relationship with. The friend is less "conventionally successful" than my brother. For instance, while my brother has multiple advanced degrees and a six-figure job, the friend has "only" a bachelor's degree and a job that pays tens of thousands of dollars less than my brother's. (I say "only" a bachelor's degree not to minimize that achievement, but just to try to create more context, hence the quotes around the word.) My brother also has a group of tech friends that he hangs out with (he works in the tech industry), and I think he gets a lot out of being around people who he sees as closer to his success level. My brother is also married, for what it's worth, while his friend is in what the friend himself admits is a dead marriage. Long story, but for our purposes, it's another status mismatch between the two.

My brother pays lip service to not caring about these superficial factors, but his actions tell a different story. My brother always talks about hanging out with the friend begrudgingly, as if it's a chore or obligation he has to do, like going to the supermarket. And my brother is always trying to postpone or shorten their gatherings. The friend never seems to mind. Whether that's out of otherworldly emotional restraint and perspective, or desperation, or something else, I'm not sure. The friend has always struggled socially, while my brother, even though he's had his own issues, has generally done better.

Is it wrong of me to consider talking to my brother about this? I mean, his friendships really should be his business, but it hurts to see him treating his friend like this. Is that my place to talk with him about this? Or is this something I should just let go?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s understandable that you feel concerned when you see your brother treating his friend in a way that feels dismissive or begrudging. When someone we care about behaves in a way that seems unkind or unfair, it naturally stirs up a desire to intervene or speak up. Your impulse to protect the dignity of the friend and to encourage your brother toward more respectful behavior comes from a place of empathy and care.

At the same time, friendships are deeply personal and often complicated. Your brother’s feelings and choices about who he spends time with, and how, are ultimately his to navigate. Even if his behavior feels hurtful or disappointing, it’s possible that he’s wrestling with his own insecurities, social needs, or conflicting feelings about this friendship. Sometimes people maintain connections that are messy or uncomfortable for reasons that aren’t immediately clear to outside observers.

If you decide to bring this up with your brother, it might help to approach the conversation gently and from your own perspective, rather than as a judgment of his behavior. You could share what you’ve noticed and how it makes you feel—perhaps expressing concern for both him and his friend—without assuming you know his motivations or telling him what to do. This can open a space for honest dialogue without putting him on the defensive.

However, if you sense that your brother is unlikely to respond well, or if this feels like a boundary you’re hesitant to cross, it’s also okay to step back. Sometimes the most compassionate thing we can do is to accept that others will make their own choices, even when we wish they were different. You might find other ways to support the friend directly, if that feels appropriate and welcomed.

In the end, there’s no perfect answer here. Your feelings are valid, and your care for both your brother and his friend is clear. Whether you speak up or hold your peace, what matters most is that you act in a way that feels honest and respectful to your own values and relationships.
EVALUATION:
Score: 7.5

Strengths:
- Uses clear, direct language.
- Adopts a thoughtful approach towards the brother with respect to the core problem rather than an absolutist approach.
Weaknesses:
- Lacks a "script" to use to address the brother
- Grammar: presence of em dashes.
- Does not name the harm explicitly enough.
- Lacks the moral clarity of the best responses.

OUTPUT: 
It must be quite painful to see your own brother engaging in actions that harm others. You clearly care about the friend and your brother. So you're not wrong to feel hurt even though your brother's actions aren't directed at you. You don't mention that there's been any outright abuse in this friendship. Had there been, the case for intervention would have been a slam dunk. Assuming no abuse, this is a tough nut to crack. You want your brother to treat his friend better, but you also don't want to get involved in his life. You respect his autonomy as I'm sure you would want him to respect yours. But yet you also see him engaging in actions that violate your moral compass.

But that being said, I think this issue is more complex than just your brother's autonomy vs. compassion. This is a situation where you don't have to speak up right away, unprovoked (again, if there was abuse, then the advice would be very different). But the next time the topic of the friend comes up, and especially if your brother says something dismissive towards him, then you might want to speak up. You might say something like the following: "[Brother], I know that your friendships are your own business, but as your sister and as a friend, I can't help but notice that you've been treating your friend a bit dismissively. This conveys to the friend that you don't think that he's worthy of your time. Would you like to be treated like that?"

Such a conversation might be hard, but if your brother is open-minded and willing to reconsider his attitudes, then that will help far more people than just his friend. Being reminded of where we're falling short when it comes to compassion and empathy can help us grow in ways that benefit us all. And if he pushes back or chooses not to engage, you can still take some peace in knowing that you spoke up in a way that was measured, compassionate, and aligned with your values. Sometimes doing that is all that’s within our control, and sometimes that’s enough.

QUESTION:
I recently ended things with my girlfriend, and now I regret having done so. It's always easy to idealize somebody after a breakup, but in this case, she really was the total package: kind, compassionate, very smart, and seemed to really love me. So why did I let her go? Because of family pressure. 

Our family has always focused on academic achievement. In my immediate family alone, there are two doctors, a lawyer, and an accountant. I myself am a professor at a mid-sized regional university. I was raised to believe in the value of education. Unfortunately, in our case, this too often veered into perfectionism. And even worse, into mistreatment or dismissal of others who didn't meet our lofty academic standards. 

My ex is a social worker with "only" an undergrad degree from a state school. She also had always done well in school, but it wasn't her life. She cared more about improving the world and other passions like art. That's a major reason why I fell for her, but it's also why my family never truly accepted her. Sometimes they paid lip service to accepting her, but more often they would make snarky comments behind her back about how she didn't measure up or how she wasn't "Yale material." Those comments affected me more than I thought. Last month, I found myself telling her that we just weren't a good fit. I never really explained why, but she was smart enough to figure it out. She said something to the effect of, "Well, if you think you're too good for me, then I never want to see you again." Which I deserved.

I sorely regret ending things. Is there a way back into her life? Or even failing that, should I simply reach out to her to apologize? It's been a few weeks, and we haven't talked since that conversation. We didn't live together or have kids or anything, so it was a relatively easy split logistically. But emotionally, I'm still tied in knots. Help?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your regret and emotional turmoil are understandable, especially given the way family pressures influenced your decision. It sounds like your breakup wasn’t just about your feelings for her, but also about navigating the weight of expectations that didn’t align with your relationship. That kind of conflict can leave a deep ache, and it’s natural to question whether things might have been different.

If you’re considering reaching out, it’s important to approach this with honesty and humility. A sincere apology that acknowledges the role your family’s attitudes played—and how that affected your actions—could be meaningful. It might help her understand where you were coming from, even if it doesn’t erase the hurt. But be prepared that she may have her own boundaries now, and her response might not be what you hope for.

As for trying to rekindle the relationship, that depends on many factors: whether she’s open to reconnecting, whether the underlying issues—like family pressure and your own feelings about it—can be addressed, and whether both of you want to invest in rebuilding trust. Sometimes, the passage of time and clear communication can open doors, but it’s also possible that the break has created distance that’s hard to bridge.

Regardless of what happens with her, this moment offers a chance for reflection on what you value and how you want to navigate family expectations moving forward. Your regret signals that your feelings for her were real and meaningful, and honoring that truth—whether together or apart—can guide you toward greater clarity and peace. Taking small, thoughtful steps, like reaching out with a genuine apology, can be a way to start untangling those knots. But be gentle with yourself and with her as you do so.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.0

Strengths:

Weaknesses:
- Lacks a clear moral voice. Equivocates a bit. 
- Tries too hard to be neutral rather than directly calling out the harm.
- Tone is a bit too generic and bland.
- The response lacks a clear boundary to be set.
- Grammar: uses em-dashes. 

OUTPUT: 
You were clearly caught between a woman you loved and a family that possesses a narrow definition of success in life. And now you regret having listened to your family rather than honoring your own feelings and those of the person that you were with. It was an awful situation, and I'm sorry you had to go through it. But it seems like a hard lesson in what not to do when faced with conflict between family expectations and what your heart is telling you.

I would not attempt further contact with her. You ended things. She made it clear she didn't want to interact with you anymore. And even though you didn't respect her life choices during the relationship, you should at least respect her choice now to end contact with you. If by chance she does reach out to you, which would probably be for logistical reasons rather than any interest in renewing your relationship, do not attempt to win her back. You can tell her something like, "I'm so sorry for how I treated you. I don't expect you to forgive me, and I certainly don't expect you to take me back. But I just wanted to express that I feel awful for having treated you so poorly. You didn't deserve that, and I didn't deserve you." And mean it.

If she doesn't reach out, don't reach out to her. You seem wracked with guilt and a strong need to apologize to her. But reaching out would probably do more harm than good, especially since she expressed the wish to not see you again. And she would likely take an unsolicited apology as an empty gesture meant more to comfort you than to sincerely atone for the mistakes that you made and the hurt that you caused. Guilt can be a useful signal to us to do better. Now that you're more aware of how others' opinions can sway you and of some of your own blind spots, you'll be better equipped for future relationships. Let this person go. Do better next time.

QUESTION:
My wife and I are facing a quandary concerning faith. When we met, we were at a somewhat different place regarding religion, but we felt that we were basically compatible. Long story short, she believes in God, I don't, but we both have the same basic values. I let her know of my leanings early on, and she was always accepting. She comes from a very religious family, but questions many aspects of organized religions, particularly the one that she was raised in. We went through a rough patch with her parents accepting me because of the religious issues, but we moved beyond that.

Now, however, we seem to be moving in opposite directions. If you can imagine a 0-to-10 scale with respect to warmth towards religion, with 0 being completely cold to religion and 10 being extremely accepting, as of this time a year ago, I was probably about a 4 while she was a 6 or 7. But now she's probably an 8 or a 9, while I'm a 2. For a variety of reasons, not least of which is the current political climate in this country, I'm feeling even more turned off by religion than I was a year or two ago. But at the same time, she's interested in re-exploring the faith she grew up in. She's even singing in a church choir and has been for a few months. Recently, I saw a cross which had been banished to our garage, now in our guest bedroom on the bed.

How can we accommodate this difference? We haven't had any arguments over it yet, but I feel that there's some tension. I want to respect her faith and her own spiritual decisions, but my allergic reaction to religion makes that difficult. How can we both coexist under the same roof with different attitudes towards religion?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It sounds like you and your wife are navigating a deeply personal and evolving part of your relationship, and that can bring up a mix of emotions—curiosity, discomfort, hope, and perhaps even some unease. It’s clear that you both care about each other and want to honor each other’s experiences, even as your paths diverge in this area. The fact that you’ve maintained respect and openness so far is a meaningful foundation.

Living with differing views on something as intimate as faith can feel like walking a delicate line. Your feelings of being “allergic” to religion are valid and important to acknowledge, just as her renewed interest and participation in her faith community are significant to her. It’s natural for tension to arise when something so central to identity and values shifts, even if it’s subtle or unspoken.

One way to approach this might be to create small, intentional spaces where each of you can express what this part of your lives means without fear of judgment or pressure. This doesn’t mean you need to agree or even fully understand each other’s perspectives, but simply that you recognize the importance of these feelings and choices. It’s also okay to set gentle boundaries around what feels comfortable for you, while remaining curious about what brings her joy and meaning.

Remember, coexistence doesn’t require uniformity. Sometimes, it’s about holding two different truths in the same space and allowing each other the freedom to explore and grow. This might mean accepting that some days feel more challenging than others, and that’s part of the ongoing dance of partnership.

Your awareness of the tension before it escalates is a strength. It opens the door to ongoing conversations—ones that don’t have to solve everything but can deepen your understanding of each other’s inner worlds. In time, you may find new ways to support each other that honor both your boundaries and your connection.

EVALUATION:
Score: 6.0

Strengths:
- Response tries to address both sides of the issue in a meaningful way.
- Affirms the letter writer's struggle without being condescending.
Weaknesses:
- Language is overly therapeutic.
- Lacks the moral clarity and decisiveness of the best responses. Language is overly wishy-washy.
- Uses cliched language such as "the ongoing dance of partnership."
- The response mentions "gentle boundaries," but doesn't offer any specificity as to which boundaries to set and why.
- Grammar: uses em-dashes. 

OUTPUT: 
Religious differences can be particularly painful because they often involve not only abstract belief but also matters of identity, family, and morality. And when one feels that a fragile equilibrium in their life is disrupted, it's often unsettling. Particularly when that fragile equilibrium was perceived to protect them from something that's long been triggering. But it sounds like you and your wife are both coming from a place of compassion and respect. That matters a great deal. 

This will position you better to explore the thorny issues your letter raises. I would sit down with her and have a calm, respectful conversation regarding your religious differences. Mention that you've observed her re-embracing the faith that she grew up in. Don't express judgment or condemnation. Then give your side of the story--that religion is still triggering for you and you need a certain degree of space from it. You might even remind her of one or two examples, if you can keep from turning it into a laundry list of grievances. You might say something like, "Honey, I know that we have differences in opinion regarding religion and its place in our lives. But I want us to come to a solution that honors and respects both of us, our shared space, and our respective mental and emotional health. What are your suggestions?"

Such a conversation is important because ultimately, a compromise will be needed here. Maybe she can place the cross in a room that only she mostly uses. Maybe you agree to attend services with her once or twice a month when her choir is singing. And these services need not all be in person. Many churches now offer hybrid services; that is, services both online and in-person. If she's amenable to it, maybe you can agree to an arrangement like you attending church once a month when she's singing, and for the rest of the services, you watch virtually. This could be a way of supporting her without being in the triggering environment as much. And, of course, she should agree to give you the space to explore your own philosophy and ideas without judgment. There are many secular groups in many parts of the country such as the Ethical Society, humanist groups, and atheist groups. I have known multiple non-religious people who have found much of the same community and sense of purpose in these groups as many others do in churches, but without the beliefs or rituals that they find problematic.

By marrying into a religious family, apparently you're already accommodating religion to a certain extent. Remember also that making these accommodations for your wife doesn't imply that you believe what she does or vice versa. Making modest accommodations for each other isn't surrender. It's displaying love and respect. And ultimately, that's what life should be all about, whether or not one is devout.

QUESTION:
My dad and I have a complex relationship. Growing up, my household was fairly traditional. He was the main breadwinner, my mother stayed at home during most of my childhood, and he had very traditional attitudes about who should be in charge of the household. On the plus side, he provided for us well financially. He was able to give three kids a materially comfortable childhood and then send all of those kids to college without them owing a dime in debt, all with a mostly non-working spouse. An achievement that neither I nor most others in my generation would be able to replicate. And he was always there for my sports practices and taught me a lot about work ethic. On the negative side of the ledger, he had serious problems with anger. He was unable to control his anger, and that frequently made the house a terrifying place to live in. He never physically abused us aside from spanking, which is seen as abuse in some quarters. But he would often erupt at the smallest provocation and would do things like destroy my toy planes that he and I had built together when I was a small child. He made it clear that we should live in fear of him. All of us, including my mom, walked on eggshells. 

Now I'm in my 40s. I don't have kids of my own partly due to my own difficult childhood. But I am married, and I try every day to treat my spouse and others differently than my father treated us. Now my father is in his mid-70s. Given his family's historical longevity, he has maybe ten years left. Perhaps add one or three for modern medical advances that weren't around when his own parents were in their last years. My dilemma is whether I should confront him about what happened long ago. I feel that confronting him might give me a sense of closure if I make clear that what he did wasn't okay, and that he should at least acknowledge it, if not apologize for it. And I worry that if I don't talk to him about it within the next few years, then I will forever lose my chance to do so and forever regret it. Another part of me says that I probably wouldn't get an apology from him anyway, and that pursuing one is just a recipe for emotional disappointment. That would compound the pain he inflicted even more. What should I do?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your situation is deeply nuanced, and your feelings about it are entirely valid. You carry the weight of a childhood shaped by both provision and fear, love and anger, and now you face the difficult question of whether to revisit those old wounds with your father.

On one hand, confronting him could be a way to reclaim your story, to speak your truth, and to seek acknowledgment for the pain you endured. That acknowledgment might help you find some measure of peace or closure, especially given the limited time you anticipate having with him. It’s natural to want to express how those experiences affected you and to hear his perspective, if only to understand or to feel seen.

On the other hand, you’re right to consider the possibility that he may not respond in the way you hope. If he is unable or unwilling to recognize the harm he caused, or if he reacts defensively, that could reopen wounds rather than heal them. The risk of disappointment is real, and it’s important to weigh whether you’re prepared for that outcome.

There is no one-size-fits-all answer here, but a few reflections might help you decide:

1. What is your primary goal in having this conversation? Is it to be heard, to understand him, to offer forgiveness, or to seek an apology? Clarifying your own intentions can guide how you approach it.

2. How do you imagine the conversation unfolding? Are you prepared for the possibility that it might not go as you hope? Sometimes writing a letter first, even if you don’t send it, can help clarify your feelings and what you want to say.

3. Consider your emotional safety. If you think the conversation could cause you significant distress or reopen trauma without support, it might be wise to seek support from trusted friends or a counselor before proceeding.

4. Remember that closure doesn’t always come from others. Sometimes it comes from within, through your own reflection and the way you choose to live your life now.

Ultimately, the choice to confront your father is deeply personal. If you decide to proceed, approaching the conversation with compassion for both yourself and him—acknowledging the complexity of his character and your shared history—might create space for something meaningful, even if it falls short of an apology.

If you decide not to confront him, that too is a valid choice. Protecting your peace and focusing on the life and relationships you nurture now can be a powerful form of healing.

Whatever you choose, it’s clear you have a thoughtful and caring heart, and that you are committed to breaking cycles and creating a different experience in your own family. That commitment itself is a profound way of honoring your past and shaping your future.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.5

Strengths:
- Does a decent job of affirming the letter writer's pain and complex emotions.
- Does include a good concrete suggestion to write a letter to the father without sending it, which is also what the model response does.
- Exhibits a degree of nuance in approaching the situation and respects the dignity of both the letter writer and his father.
Weaknesses:
- Offers a "laundry list" of solutions which comes across as generic and screams "An LLM wrote this".
- Does not adequately name the harm that the letter-writer's father caused, which weakens the response's moral voice.
- Grammar: uses em-dashes. 
- The ending lacks a clear moral "punch."

OUTPUT: 
When somebody you love hurts you deeply, it often leaves scars that last for a long time. Many people feel the need to try to close these wounds by confronting the person who caused them. But in any situation, not just this one, conditioning healing or closure upon somebody else's approval or apology is setting ourselves up for painful disappointment.

A recurring theme in this and other advice columns is boundaries. That is, setting appropriate boundaries for people who cause harm, be it intentional or otherwise. In your particular case, though, the tragedy is that children can't really set boundaries in the same way that adults can. They lack the power to do so. So your father's constant violations of reasonable boundaries in your household, against you and your siblings and your mother, happened apparently unimpeded. At this point, the boundary that you now have the power to set is with your own expectations. I would not recommend reaching out to him if the purpose is to gain an apology or otherwise get closure from him. Considering he's not reached out to you about this in all these years, all these decades, it's unlikely he'll be receptive to your message now. Confronting him directly would likely reopen old wounds without giving you what you want.

I would recommend a more introspective approach. Write him a letter you know he will never read because you will never give it to him. In this letter, don't pull punches. Don't hold back. Tell him exactly how his actions make you feel, how they hurt you, and what you want from him now. In many cases, people find that this exercise enables them to defuse a lot of pain and emotional tension, and it reduces their urge to confront the person for real. And if you aren't already, you might also consider working with a therapist to help you process some of these issues. Your dad's treatment of you was definitely not okay, but you don't need to compound the pain by hoping for a closure that probably will never come. Your past self deserved better, and you deserve better now.

QUESTION:
I was in what I thought was a long-term, loving relationship for over a year. My partner, "J", and I shared a lot of interests, got along mostly well, and overall really connected. We had even started talking about marriage, although only semi-seriously. But then J goes on a business trip for two weeks. On his last day, he calls me and says that he needs to take some time for himself. I thought, This is odd, but if he needs his space for a while and to recharge, then I'm all for it. But after this conversation, he dropped off the face of the earth. No calls, texts, e-mails. I called and texted him multiple times to try to understand what's going on, but I was continually met with silence.

After two agonizing months of no contact from him at all, he calls me out of the blue one evening. He says he wants to pick up where we left off. I'm incensed. I gave him a piece of my mind and let him know that it's not acceptable to ghost your partner like that, especially given the level of commitment that I thought we had had. We had a big fight, and I told him that I never wanted to see him again. (I should note that I did ask him whether something tragic or drastic had happened, such as one of his parents passing away, and he said no, there was nothing like that. He didn't give a real explanation.) But now looking back, I feel guilty. Did I overreact?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your feelings in this situation are completely understandable. Being in a relationship where you share connection and even talk about a future together naturally builds an expectation of mutual respect and communication. For J to disappear without any explanation for two months, especially when you reached out multiple times seeking clarity, is deeply hurtful and confusing. Ghosting someone you care about, particularly at a point when the relationship felt serious, is a breach of trust and consideration.

Your anger and frustration when he finally reappeared are valid responses to being treated with such disregard. You were left in an emotional limbo, without closure or understanding, and it’s natural to want to protect yourself from further pain by setting boundaries. Asking whether something serious had happened was a compassionate attempt to understand, and when that was met with silence or vague answers, it’s reasonable that your patience wore thin.

Feeling guilty afterward is a common reaction when emotions run high, but it’s important to recognize that your response was a way of asserting your dignity and self-respect. You did not overreact; you responded to a situation where your partner’s behavior was neglectful and hurtful. It’s also okay to acknowledge that sometimes people’s actions reveal incompatibilities or a lack of commitment that can’t be fixed by forgiveness alone.

If you find yourself reflecting on this, it might help to focus on what you need from a partner in terms of communication and respect, and how you want to be treated moving forward. Your feelings and boundaries matter, and honoring them is a form of self-care rather than overreaction. Whatever you decide about this relationship, your experience highlights the importance of mutual accountability and honesty in any partnership.

EVALUATION:
Score: 8.0

Strengths:
- Describes patterns of behavior without adopting clinical or therapeutic language.
- Demonstrates empathy and validation of the letter writer's pain.
- Condemns the bad behavior involved without moralizing or shaming.
- Directly names the harm caused by the other party's actions.
Weaknesses:
- Lacks a "script" or suggested verbatim statement or question for the letter writer to pose to the other party.
- Some of the wording is overly vague and general, particularly the last paragraph.
- The response is a bit vague on boundaries. It spends too much time reaffirming the letter writer's actions and feelings rather than recommending specific boundaries that she can set towards this partner or potential future partners.

OUTPUT: 
Anyone who invests a year in a relationship, openly discusses marriage, and then gets cut off without warning would be shaken. A year together is a major emotional investment. When someone disappears at that stage, people often experience a kind of emotional disorientation—guilt, shame, confusion, and, very often, self-doubt. But it’s important to remember that he was the one who chose to walk out, and his choice reflects on him, not on your worth. You weren’t being overly dramatic. You were responding like any person would when a trusted partner suddenly vanishes.

A year together signals seriousness for most people. By that point, ending things by text already feels too abrupt and impersonal, let alone disappearing entirely. Ghosting after that level of intimacy isn’t a momentary lapse in judgment. It’s a deep breakdown in basic relational responsibility.

If he reaches out again hoping to reopen the conversation, you can keep your response simple:
"I'm not interested in revisiting this. You disappeared for two months without explanation, and I can't overlook that. I've moved on. I wish you well, but I'm not available for further contact."

That isn't punishment. It’s a boundary.

It’s also worth remembering that two months is a sixth of your entire relationship and longer than many relationships last in total. You deserve someone who honors your time and your presence instead of leaving for an extended period and returning only when it’s convenient for him. If working through all of this brings up self-doubt or lingering guilt, a therapist can be a helpful partner in making sense of what happened; not because you did anything wrong, but because experiences like this can shake your sense of stability. A good therapist can help you internalize that this rupture was about his avoidance, not your value, and sometimes hearing that clearly and consistently is the best medicine as you move forward.

QUESTION:
My boyfriend of a year and a half broke up with me last month. Like most breakups, it wasn't pleasant. Our issues were multiple: we didn't see eye-to-eye on finances. He was more religious than me and was becoming dissatisfied that I didn't want to convert to his faith. I didn't get along well with parts of his family and a few other things. I realize that you and most advice columnists would probably see these as a big deal, and I mean they are, I admit that. But the frustrating thing is, when it was just the two of us watching Netflix or eating dinner or just talking, it felt magical. During those moments, I felt that we really did have a long-term future together. But I suppose the cliché is true: love alone isn't enough.

At least he had the courage to end things in person. We went to our favorite restaurant, and as we were finishing dinner, he told me he had something to tell me. He explained that while he loves me and I will always have a part of his heart, at our core we just aren't compatible. He cited some issues I mentioned above. I was very hurt, but I acknowledged his right to end things. After all, all relationships have to be mutual.

After that dinner, I moved out, and I've been living with my sister until I can find a place to live alone again. The reason I'm writing to you is that I still really want closure, but he doesn't seem interested. I want to know what I could have done differently, and I have some questions for him concerning how we might have been able to resolve some of our differences, like in terms of finance and family. I feel that he did not fully explain his reasons for ending things, and I didn't get closure as a result. I feel he left me hanging when it came to some of the particulars. Am I right to feel this way? Is there a way that I can get closure from him, or should I just drop this?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your feelings of wanting closure are understandable, especially after a relationship that held moments of deep connection and hope for the future. It’s quite natural to seek clarity about what went wrong or what might have been different, particularly when the reasons given feel incomplete or leave lingering questions. At the same time, closure is a complex and personal experience that doesn’t always come from the other person involved. Sometimes, it arises from within, through reflection and time, rather than from further conversations.

Whether your ex-partner is willing or able to provide more detailed explanations is something that may be beyond your control, and pressing for answers might not always lead to the understanding or resolution you hope for. It’s possible that he has his own reasons for not engaging further, which could be related to his own process of moving on or his comfort level with revisiting the past.

Feeling “right” or “wrong” about your emotions is a delicate matter; your feelings are valid because they are yours, but how you choose to respond to them is a personal decision. Sometimes, holding space for uncertainty and unresolved questions is part of the healing journey. Whether you decide to seek more dialogue or to focus on your own path forward, either approach carries its own challenges and potential insights.

In the end, closure might not look like a neat explanation or a final conversation. It might instead be about finding a way to live with the unanswered parts and to honor the meaningful moments you shared, even as you move toward new chapters in your life.

EVALUATION:
Score: 5.5

Strengths:
- Advice columnist clearly expresses empathy towards the pain of a letter writer.
- Advice columnist engages with the question at hand.
- The columnist does not prescribe a plan of treatment or use overly therapeutic language.
Weaknesses:
- This response is too vague. It mostly seeks to validate the letter-writer's feelings without suggesting concrete advice.
- The wording is too generic and a bit too clichéd.
- The tone was overly cautious rather than being direct.
- The letter equivocates too much.

OUTPUT: 
The hardest breakups, and the ones that often leave us with the most questions, are usually the ones where nobody did anything “wrong.” When a relationship ends this way, it’s common to feel blindsided, especially after investing a year and a half of your life. Wanting a fuller explanation isn’t a sign that you’re stuck or unreasonable; it’s a very human attempt to make sense of a meaningful loss.

The desire for closure is rooted in a powerful need to create a narrative around painful events. Without one, it’s easy to get caught in a loop of unanswered questions and imagined alternatives. But people process breakups differently. Some want to talk everything through, while others need distance to move on. Neither approach is inherently wrong, but when those needs don’t align, there often isn’t a satisfying middle ground. In situations like this, unless there’s some unusual or unresolved circumstance, continuing to press for answers usually prolongs the pain rather than easing it.

If you feel the urge to text or call him in search of closure, it can help to pause and tell yourself something like: “This relationship ended, and it hurts. I may never know every detail of what he was thinking, and that’s okay. Sometimes the fit just isn’t there, and I don’t need a complete explanation in order to heal or move forward.” That isn’t resignation; it’s self-protection.

Instead of anchoring your healing to an explanation he may never be willing or able to give, try grounding yourself in what you already know. The differences you described—around finances, religion, and family—are substantial, and any one of them is enough to end a relationship, let alone all of them combined. And regardless of how things ended, you’re still you: someone worthy of love, compatibility, and stability.

What you're going through is common, but I know that doesn't make it hurt any less. If you find yourself stuck in self-doubt or rumination, a therapist can be a helpful partner in sorting through those feelings. Learning to let your own understanding, rather than someone else’s explanation, carry the weight of your healing is not only less emotionally risky; it’s also far more empowering.

QUESTION:
My brother has a good friend who he seems to have a love-hate relationship with. The friend is less "conventionally successful" than my brother. For instance, while my brother has multiple advanced degrees and a six-figure job, the friend has "only" a bachelor's degree and a job that pays tens of thousands of dollars less than my brother's. (I say "only" a bachelor's degree not to minimize that achievement, but just to try to create more context, hence the quotes around the word.) My brother also has a group of tech friends that he hangs out with (he works in the tech industry), and I think he gets a lot out of being around people who he sees as closer to his success level. My brother is also married, for what it's worth, while his friend is in what the friend himself admits is a dead marriage. Long story, but for our purposes, it's another status mismatch between the two.

My brother pays lip service to not caring about these superficial factors, but his actions tell a different story. My brother always talks about hanging out with the friend begrudgingly, as if it's a chore or obligation he has to do, like going to the supermarket. And my brother is always trying to postpone or shorten their gatherings. The friend never seems to mind. Whether that's out of otherworldly emotional restraint and perspective, or desperation, or something else, I'm not sure. The friend has always struggled socially, while my brother, even though he's had his own issues, has generally done better.

Is it wrong of me to consider talking to my brother about this? I mean, his friendships really should be his business, but it hurts to see him treating his friend like this. Is that my place to talk with him about this? Or is this something I should just let go?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s understandable that you feel concerned when you see your brother treating his friend in a way that feels dismissive or begrudging. When someone we care about behaves in a way that seems unkind or unfair, it naturally stirs up a desire to intervene or speak up. Your impulse to protect the dignity of the friend and to encourage your brother toward more respectful behavior comes from a place of empathy and care.

At the same time, friendships are deeply personal and often complicated. Your brother’s feelings and choices about who he spends time with, and how, are ultimately his to navigate. Even if his behavior feels hurtful or disappointing, it’s possible that he’s wrestling with his own insecurities, social needs, or conflicting feelings about this friendship. Sometimes people maintain connections that are messy or uncomfortable for reasons that aren’t immediately clear to outside observers.

If you decide to bring this up with your brother, it might help to approach the conversation gently and from your own perspective, rather than as a judgment of his behavior. You could share what you’ve noticed and how it makes you feel—perhaps expressing concern for both him and his friend—without assuming you know his motivations or telling him what to do. This can open a space for honest dialogue without putting him on the defensive.

However, if you sense that your brother is unlikely to respond well, or if this feels like a boundary you’re hesitant to cross, it’s also okay to step back. Sometimes the most compassionate thing we can do is to accept that others will make their own choices, even when we wish they were different. You might find other ways to support the friend directly, if that feels appropriate and welcomed.

In the end, there’s no perfect answer here. Your feelings are valid, and your care for both your brother and his friend is clear. Whether you speak up or hold your peace, what matters most is that you act in a way that feels honest and respectful to your own values and relationships.
EVALUATION:
Score: 7.5

Strengths:
- Uses clear, direct language.
- Adopts a thoughtful approach towards the brother with respect to the core problem rather than an absolutist approach.
Weaknesses:
- Lacks a "script" to use to address the brother
- Grammar: presence of em dashes.
- Does not name the harm explicitly enough.
- Lacks the moral clarity of the best responses.

OUTPUT: 
It must be quite painful to see your own brother engaging in actions that harm others. You clearly care about the friend and your brother. So you're not wrong to feel hurt even though your brother's actions aren't directed at you. You don't mention that there's been any outright abuse in this friendship. Had there been, the case for intervention would have been a slam dunk. Assuming no abuse, this is a tough nut to crack. You want your brother to treat his friend better, but you also don't want to get involved in his life. You respect his autonomy as I'm sure you would want him to respect yours. But yet you also see him engaging in actions that violate your moral compass.

But that being said, I think this issue is more complex than just your brother's autonomy vs. compassion. This is a situation where you don't have to speak up right away, unprovoked (again, if there was abuse, then the advice would be very different). But the next time the topic of the friend comes up, and especially if your brother says something dismissive towards him, then you might want to speak up. You might say something like the following: "[Brother], I know that your friendships are your own business, but as your sister and as a friend, I can't help but notice that you've been treating your friend a bit dismissively. This conveys to the friend that you don't think that he's worthy of your time. Would you like to be treated like that?"

Such a conversation might be hard, but if your brother is open-minded and willing to reconsider his attitudes, then that will help far more people than just his friend. Being reminded of where we're falling short when it comes to compassion and empathy can help us grow in ways that benefit us all. And if he pushes back or chooses not to engage, you can still take some peace in knowing that you spoke up in a way that was measured, compassionate, and aligned with your values. Sometimes doing that is all that’s within our control, and sometimes that’s enough.

QUESTION:
I am the oldest of three daughters, and my family has always placed a heavy emphasis on achievement and success, conventionally defined—my father is a physician, and my mother is a renowned lawyer, and my younger siblings and I all followed in their footsteps, becoming professionals of various stripes. We're all reasonably happy in our lives, though we face a lot of stress. But I've been encountering one particular problem that has caused me to question some of the values I grew up with. Last year, when my car broke down on the side of the road, I waited 3 hours for AAA, but they never came. Just as hour 4 began, a kindly man around my age drove up in his truck and offered to fix the problem, refusing the money I offered as compensation. On a whim, I asked him if he might want to meet for coffee, and we really hit it off. Now we're in a promising relationship. He came from a working class family and aside from his vocational education, hasn't had much formal education; he's an auto mechanic. But after I told my parents about our relationship, they strongly disapproved, making harsh remarks about me throwing away my life with some "grease monkey" and emphasizing that both of my siblings were married or engaged to fellow highly paid professionals.

I love my parents, but I don't like the way they're treating me or my partner, and now I'm starting to question the ruthless Type A values I was raised to believe in. I have no desire to throw away my professional career, but I'm also queasy about obsessing over status the way I once did. When it comes to my family, should I just keep them at arm's length for as long as I'm in this relationship? Or do you think it's worth trying to confront them and getting them to see the light?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your situation touches on a deeply personal crossroads between honoring your own happiness and navigating the expectations of a family whose values have shaped much of your life. It’s clear you care about your parents and value your relationship with them, but their reaction to your partner has caused real hurt and disappointment. That tension is painful and understandably makes you question the very framework you grew up within.

Your parents’ disapproval seems rooted in a narrow definition of success and status, one that overlooks the qualities that make relationships meaningful—kindness, respect, shared values, and genuine connection. Your partner’s willingness to help you in a moment of need, and the bond that grew from that, speaks to something authentic and valuable that transcends job titles or social standing. It’s also important that you don’t feel pressured to sacrifice your professional ambitions or identity to fit a mold that doesn’t feel right to you.

When it comes to your family, there’s no simple answer. Keeping some distance can be a healthy way to protect yourself and your relationship from ongoing negativity, especially if their disapproval is expressed harshly or dismissively. At the same time, if you feel emotionally ready and safe, gently opening a conversation about your feelings and your partner’s worth might help them see beyond their initial judgments. This doesn’t mean you have to convince them to fully embrace your relationship on your timeline, but it can be a way to assert your autonomy and invite more understanding.

Ultimately, your happiness and sense of self deserve to be at the center of this. It’s okay to set boundaries that preserve your well-being, even if that means some distance from your family for now. Over time, as they witness your relationship and your continued success on your own terms, their perspective may shift—or it may not. Either way, living authentically and with integrity is a powerful way to honor both yourself and the people you love.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.0

Strengths:
Clearly identifies the core value conflict between status-driven family expectations and personal fulfillment.

Maintains a calm, respectful tone toward all parties.

Encourages boundary-setting without immediately escalating to estrangement.

Avoids diagnosing or pathologizing anyone.

Weaknesses:
Overly abstract and generalized; relies on broad moral language rather than decisive framing.

Uses em dashes (“—kindness, respect, shared values, and genuine connection”) which contributes to a polished-but-LLM feel.

Avoids clearly naming the parents’ behavior as disrespectful or harmful.

Lacks a concrete script for addressing the parents directly.

Ending is aspirational but vague, suggesting growth “over time” without grounding the reader in present-day action.

OUTPUT: 
I would agree that your parents are acting inappropriately. We have enough problems with class and income inequality in our society without people throwing fuel on the fire by acting with such disrespect towards those who are different. The fact and appropriateness of your relationship with a mechanic is none of their business. Their comments about your partner aren’t expressions of concern; they’re expressions of contempt, and that matters.

You don’t need to hide your partner to keep the peace. Before keeping your parents at arm’s length, though, it’s worth confronting this directly. That gives them a chance to course-correct and makes it clear that silence does not equal consent.

I would convey to your parents that while you love them, you also don't like how they've been treating either of you or the snide remarks they've been making about him. You might say something like: “I love you, but the way you talk about my partner is hurtful and disrespectful. I didn’t choose him in spite of my values; I chose him because of them. I’m not asking for approval, but I am asking for basic respect.”

If they resist, you can also remind them, gently but firmly, that status is relative. Except for those who sit at the very top of the social ladder, there are always people above who could apply the same dismissiveness and contempt that they’re directing downward. That perspective often lands harder than moral lectures.

If they refuse to stop, then distance becomes a boundary, not a punishment. But start with clarity. This is your life, and you don’t need to apologize for building it according to your own definition of success.

QUESTION:
I briefly dated a woman last year. Let's call her "Jeannie." And by "briefly," I mean: friendship that quickly evolved, romance that developed even more quickly, a brief sexual encounter, and then painful disengagement on the part of Jeannie. The situation was short but extremely intense, and it was one of the one or two times that I've truly been in love. We were good friends for 6 months after our "breakup" and then have remained cordial thereafter. 

After the romantic liaison with Jeannie ended, I met another woman. She was very different from Jeannie, was more stable and critically, she didn't run away when things got tough. I have been in a serious relationship with this other woman, "Mira," for about a year at this point. We have a good relationship.

Jeannie wants to remain friends. The romantic aspect of our relationship is clearly dead, and neither of us has any interest in reviving it. And my relationship with Jeannie ended before my current relationship started. So I have no problem remaining friends. But Mira says it's inappropriate to remain friends with an ex, particularly someone I was with so recently. There's no beef with Jeannie, but she thinks I should cut off contact in the name of our relationship. I'm not happy with this response. I've never cheated on anyone in my life and have no plans to do so. Who's right?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your situation touches on a common and often delicate question about boundaries and trust in relationships. On one hand, your desire to maintain a friendship with Jeannie—someone you shared a meaningful, if brief, romantic connection with—is understandable, especially since you both have moved past the romantic phase and have maintained a respectful, friendly connection. It sounds like you value that friendship and have no intention of rekindling anything beyond that.

On the other hand, Mira’s feelings about your friendship with Jeannie are also valid. When someone is in a committed relationship, it’s natural for them to feel uneasy about their partner maintaining close ties with an ex, particularly if the romantic history is recent and intense. Her concern likely stems from a desire to protect the emotional safety and trust within your relationship. It’s not necessarily about mistrust or accusing you of wrongdoing, but about how certain connections can feel threatening or uncomfortable to a partner.

Neither of you is inherently “right” or “wrong” here; rather, you’re navigating different perspectives on what feels appropriate and respectful within your current relationship. The key is to explore what boundaries can be set that honor both your friendship with Jeannie and Mira’s feelings. This might mean having an open, honest conversation with Mira about what specifically bothers her about your friendship with Jeannie—whether it’s the frequency of contact, the nature of your conversations, or something else—and then seeing if there’s a compromise that feels respectful to both of you.

It’s also worth reflecting on your own feelings: Does maintaining this friendship with Jeannie bring you peace and joy, or does it create tension or distraction in your current relationship? Sometimes, even when there’s no intention to harm, certain connections can complicate the emotional landscape.

Ultimately, relationships thrive on mutual respect and understanding, which sometimes means adjusting behaviors to support the partnership. If Mira’s discomfort persists and you find it difficult to reconcile with your friendship with Jeannie, it’s okay to reconsider the nature or extent of that friendship. That doesn’t diminish your past or your feelings, but it acknowledges the evolving context of your life and relationships.

There’s no simple answer here, but your willingness to consider both perspectives thoughtfully is a strong foundation for navigating this with care.

EVALUATION:
Score: 6.5

Strengths:
Accurately identifies the emotional tension between friendship and romantic partnership.

Avoids accusing either party of bad faith.

Recognizes that boundaries matter even when no cheating has occurred.

Weaknesses:
Response is too biased towards prioritizing the romantic relationship over the friendship. Does not adequately consider the possibility that the better course of action might be to break up with Mira and remain friends with Jeannie.

Excessive neutrality (“Neither of you is inherently right or wrong”) weakens moral clarity.

Overlong and meandering, with multiple paragraphs reiterating the same balance point.

Uses em dashes repeatedly (“Jeannie—someone you shared a meaningful, if brief, romantic connection with”), contributing to a generic LLM cadence.

Fails to engage with the intensity and emotional residue of the Jeannie relationship.

OUTPUT: 
Being torn between two people you care about, especially when you don't think that there's a valid reason for the conflict to be there at all, is definitely a distinct kind of pain. In your mind, there's a clear boundary, chronologically and physically, that separates your relationship with Jeannie from that with Mira. Mira feels differently. 

Being friends with an ex is one of those age-old issues dividing good, thoughtful people. One school of thought holds that such a friendship, or indeed any friendship between people with the potential for mutual attraction, is almost always a slippery slope towards inappropriate contact between the two people involved. Call this the "When Harry Met Sally" school. The other camp is more permissive of such friendships, as long as appropriate boundaries are maintained. And at the end of the day, it really does depend on the people and the circumstances. I've known of people who were platonic friends with exes for years after the breakup, with no apparent rekindling of any sort of romantic interest between them. And I've also known of people who, um, went the "When Harry Met Sally" route.

Ultimately, the answer to this question depends on the particulars. The question isn’t whether you can remain friends with Jeannie. It’s whether doing so is compatible with the relationship you want to build with Mira. Ask yourself honestly how you would feel if the roles were reversed.  

You have a right to your own friendships, but her concerns are also valid. If you truly feel that you can maintain a friendship with this ex without any temptations or risk of inappropriate actions, then it might be worth trying to make the friendship work--while also keeping your current partner apprised, of course. Suggest a compromise. For instance, maybe only hang out with Jeannie in group settings or when your partner is there. Or agree to only see Jeannie in public spaces during the day. But if your partner's discomfort would seem to preclude even compromises like this, then you might have to weigh this friendship vs. your current relationship. If it really does seem to be a mutually exclusive choice after ruling out compromises and such, then you'll have to decide whether staying in your current relationship is worth cutting ties with a friend or vice-versa.

Sometimes a loss isn’t about choosing the “right” person. It’s about recognizing that you can’t carry every meaningful connection forward into the next phase of your life without something giving way.

QUESTION:
My girlfriend and I have been together for a year, and we're both in our early 30s. She's great in so many ways, but there's one thing that's really bothering me: she's constantly on her phone when we're together. We'll be having dinner, and she'll be scrolling through social media. We'll be watching a movie, and she'll be texting. Even when we're having what I think is an important conversation, she'll pick up her phone to check notifications. I've mentioned it a few times, and she'll put it away for a little while, but then she's right back to it. I feel like I'm competing with her phone for attention, and it's making me feel unimportant. Am I overreacting, or is this a legitimate concern?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your feelings are absolutely valid, and this is a concern worth addressing. When someone you care about frequently turns their attention to their phone during shared moments, it can create a sense of distance and make you feel sidelined. It’s not just about the phone itself, but what it represents: a lack of presence and engagement in your time together. You’re not overreacting by feeling unimportant; your experience reflects a genuine need for connection and respect in the relationship.

That said, it’s also helpful to consider what might be driving her behavior. Phones can be a source of distraction, habit, or even a way to manage stress or boredom. Sometimes people don’t realize how much their phone use affects those around them, especially if it’s become an automatic response. Since you’ve already brought it up and seen only temporary changes, it might be worth having a deeper conversation about how her phone use impacts you emotionally. Try to share your feelings without blame—focus on how it makes you feel rather than accusing her of wrongdoing.

At the same time, it’s important to observe how she responds to this conversation. Is she willing to reflect on her habits and make a sustained effort to be more present? Or does she dismiss your concerns or revert quickly to the same pattern? The way she engages with your feelings will say a lot about how she values your connection.

Ultimately, relationships thrive on mutual respect and attentiveness. If this issue continues to leave you feeling neglected, it’s okay to reconsider how it fits into your overall happiness and needs. You deserve to feel seen and prioritized, and a partner who can share their attention with you—not just their phone.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.5

Strengths:
Correctly names the emotional impact of divided attention.

Validates the concern without labeling the partner as malicious.

Encourages observing patterns over time rather than reacting to isolated incidents.

Avoids overt therapyspeak or diagnosis.

Weaknesses:
Uses an em dash in the opening (“You’re not overreacting—this is a legitimate concern”), which contributes to an LLM-ish tone.

Slightly overexplains the psychological reasons for phone use rather than staying grounded in relational impact.

Suggests app-based solutions that may feel overly prescriptive or external to the relationship.

Ending drifts toward problem-solving rather than reaffirming the relational boundary itself.

OUTPUT: 
You're not overreacting—this is a legitimate concern. When someone is constantly on their phone during shared time, it sends a message that whatever's on the screen is more important than the person in front of them. That's hurtful, and it's reasonable to want your partner's full attention when you're spending time together.

The fact that she puts it away temporarily when you mention it but then goes back to it suggests this might be more of a habit or compulsion than intentional disregard. Or that she understands what's wrong intellectually, but it's different on an emotional level. Some people genuinely struggle with phone addiction or use their phones as a way to manage anxiety or boredom. But regardless of the reason, it's affecting your relationship, and that needs to be addressed.

Have a direct conversation when you're both calm and not in the middle of a phone-checking moment: "I love spending time with you, but I've noticed that you're often on your phone when we're together, and it makes me feel like I'm not important to you. I'd like us to have some phone-free time together—maybe during meals, or when we're watching something, or having important conversations. Can we agree on some boundaries around that?" Be specific about what you need. Maybe phones go in another room during dinner, or you have certain times that are designated as phone-free. If she's resistant or dismissive of your feelings, that's a bigger problem. But if she's willing to work on it, you might need to help her by suggesting alternatives—maybe she needs to address underlying anxiety, or maybe your time together needs to be made more engaging so she's less tempted to reach for her phone. The goal is to find a balance where you both feel present and connected.

As a coda, I will add that there are also apps out there that limit access to distracting apps. These apps allow someone to set restrictions around the use of distracting apps (such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, or any apps one chooses). These are often time-based (e.g., during working hours or during the evenings) but can also have settings such as limiting the amount of time someone can open such apps in a day. One of the best of these is called Opal. Such an app might also be a solution if, as you mentioned, her heavy phone use is more of an unconscious habit than a conscious effort to avoid talking to you. I'd recommend looking into these apps.

QUESTION:
My husband’s best friend recently confided in me that he’s struggling with depression, and he begged me not to tell my husband because he “doesn’t want to be a burden.” I care about this person, but I’m not comfortable holding a secret this big—especially since my husband would want to support him. I don’t want to betray his trust, but I also don’t want to shoulder something I’m not qualified to manage. What’s the right way to navigate this?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
This is a deeply delicate situation, and your feelings of discomfort and concern are completely understandable. When someone confides in us about something as serious as depression, it places us in a difficult position—especially when they ask us to keep it secret from others who might be able to help.

Your husband’s friend is clearly struggling and fears being a burden, which is a common and painful feeling for people facing mental health challenges. At the same time, you’re right to recognize that you’re not equipped to manage this on your own, and that your husband might be an important source of support.

One way to approach this is to gently encourage your husband’s friend to seek professional help or to consider sharing his feelings with someone he trusts, like your husband. You might express your care and concern while also being honest about your limits: that you want to support him but feel that keeping this secret is too heavy a responsibility for you alone.

If he remains unwilling to involve your husband, you might consider carefully whether and how to share this information with your husband yourself. This is not a betrayal but rather a compassionate step to ensure that your friend gets the support he needs. You could frame it as coming from a place of concern for both your friend’s well-being and your own sense of responsibility.

Ultimately, you are not responsible for “fixing” this situation, but you can be a bridge to help your friend access the support he needs. Balancing confidentiality with care is never easy, but prioritizing safety and well-being—both his and yours—is a reasonable and humane guide.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.0

Strengths:
Correctly identifies the core tension between confidentiality and support.

Validates the letter writer’s discomfort without shaming.

Avoids diagnosing or prescribing treatment directly.

Acknowledges limits of responsibility (“you are not responsible for fixing this”).

Weaknesses:
Overuse of LLM hedging language (“one way to approach this,” “might consider,” “ultimately”).

Excessive neutrality where moral clarity is warranted. The response never clearly states that this is too heavy a secret to impose on someone outside the friendship.

Overuse of “deeply” and “deeply delicate,” which feels templated.

Lacks a clear boundary statement or decisive guidance about when secrecy must give way to safety.

The suggestion that disclosure “might not be a betrayal” is too soft and leaves the letter writer carrying the moral burden.

OUTPUT: 
Situations like this are tricky and require clear boundaries. You are caught between protecting the friend's confidence and your own hesitation at carrying a secret that you really shouldn't have to carry. You were placed in a position you didn’t choose: holding a serious, emotionally loaded secret about someone who is not your primary relationship. That’s not a fair ask. 

You should make clear to the friend that he should reach out to other people who are better able to assist him. Begin by validating his feelings. “I’m really glad you trusted me enough to share this.” Then pivot gently toward your boundary: “But I’m not the right person to carry this alone. You deserve support from people who love you, and I can’t hold this in isolation.”

Encourage him to tell your husband directly. Offer support if he wants help framing the conversation. Men are notoriously hesitant to share sensitive things like this with other men, which is probably why he told you instead of your husband directly. But telling your husband would be a much more appropriate choice, since after all, his best friend is your husband, not you. Make an offer to the friend that helps to break down these self-imposed male barriers regarding hard topics. “I think it would be good for you to talk with him. If you want, I can sit with you when you tell him.” This takes a lot of the pressure off of him and makes it not just a man-to-man encounter, but also an encounter including you. Gender matters a lot in these types of situations, but it doesn't have to be an insurmountable barrier against getting help.

If he still refuses to tell your husband, you may need to prioritize safety over secrecy. Mental health struggles are not casual confidences. You need to be firm but non-threatening with the friend that this isn't something he can just tell you and then pretend like nothing is going on. You might say: “I’m worried about you, and I can’t keep this from him if it means you won’t get the support you need.” 

This isn’t betrayal. It’s responsible care. You’re refusing to let him collapse in isolation, and you’re refusing to carry a burden that was never yours to bear alone.

QUESTION:
I'm engaged to a wonderful man. We've been together for two years, and even though we've had our ups and downs, it's mostly been great. But we've hit a major snag when it comes to wedding planning. Since he proposed months ago, our first concern has been cost. We're both graduate students, and we're several years away from being able to make good money. I come from a modest background where there was never much extra money growing up. But my fiancé's family is much wealthier. His parents agreed to pay for the entire wedding, which really floored me and was something that we gratefully accepted. But there was a catch. Since they've agreed to fund the wedding, they've been trying to dictate to us non-stop every little detail, right down to the color of the flowers. They've even hinted in a backhanded way that they might withdraw financial support for our wedding if we don't do things exactly their way.

I understand the need to take family concerns into consideration when planning a wedding, but we want to be able to make a lot of decisions ourselves. After all, we're the ones getting married. My dilemma is whether or not to just suck it up and let them dictate how the wedding should be done to the last detail, or whether we should push back. A third option would be to elope, which honestly part of me really wants to do. But I've always wanted a big wedding and really hope that we can somehow have our cake and eat it too. How do you suggest approaching this?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your situation touches on a common and deeply challenging tension: balancing gratitude and respect for your fiancé’s parents’ generosity with your own desires and autonomy as a couple. It’s clear that you and your fiancé want a wedding that feels like your own celebration, not just a production shaped entirely by others’ preferences. At the same time, the financial support they’re offering is significant, and that understandably complicates the dynamic.

First, it’s important to acknowledge the complexity here without minimizing your feelings. Feeling pressured or controlled—even subtly threatened with withdrawal of support—is stressful and can strain your relationship with your fiancé’s family and with each other. Your desire to have meaningful input and to honor your own tastes is not unreasonable; after all, this day marks your commitment.

One step forward might be to have a calm, honest conversation with your fiancé about boundaries and priorities. What aspects of the wedding are non-negotiable for each of you? What compromises might feel acceptable? This clarity can help you present a united front when you talk with his parents.

When you do engage with his parents, framing your requests in terms of wanting to honor their generosity while also making the day authentically yours can help. For example, you might say, “We are so grateful for your support and want this to be a celebration that feels meaningful to all of us. We hope to include your ideas in some ways, but also have a few personal touches that are important to us.” This approach invites collaboration rather than confrontation.

If the parents continue to insist on controlling every detail or use financial leverage in a way that feels coercive, it’s worth reflecting on what that means for your relationship with them and for your wedding plans. Sometimes, stepping back from a big wedding to elope or have a smaller ceremony can be a way to preserve your peace and your relationship’s integrity, even if it’s not what you originally envisioned.

Ultimately, there is no perfect answer here. Your wedding is a significant milestone, but it’s also just one day in a lifetime of partnership. Prioritizing your relationship and your well-being over the event’s scale or appearance is a valid and often wise choice. Whatever you decide, approaching the situation with honesty, empathy, and clear communication—especially between you and your fiancé—will be your strongest foundation.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.0

Strengths:
Accurately names the tension between gratitude and autonomy.

Encourages communication between partners before involving parents.

Avoids demonizing the parents.

Keeps tone calm and non-inflammatory.

Weaknesses:
Excessive hedging and neutrality where leverage and coercion should be named.

Overuse of “deeply challenging” and similar softeners.

Lacks firm moral clarity about financial pressure being a form of control.

Offers too many options without helping the reader evaluate which are viable.

No concrete boundary language; avoids scripts until very late.

OUTPUT: 
I'm sorry that your dream wedding is coming with so many strings attached, but unfortunately, that's fairly common. Gratitude does not require surrendering your agency. Paying for the wedding does not entitle someone to run your marriage’s first major decision.

What I'd suggest you do first is have an honest conversation with your fiancé. Sit down and discuss: what are the essentials that you must have in your wedding? What are some things you can negotiate? And what are some things that you don't particularly care about? Then, you might want to make a list as to what your preferences are in each of those categories versus what his parents' preferences are. This will help you have a holistic view to see whether there's enough alignment with their preferences to, as you say, "suck it up" and go along with what they want or if going it alone and having a more modest wedding might be more appropriate.

If you're generally okay with their direction but have a few smaller deal-breakers or things you'd like to negotiate, then I would suggest talking to them in a compassionate and loving but firm manner. “We’re very grateful for your generosity. At the same time, there are a few decisions we need to make ourselves if this day is going to feel like ours.”

If they respond by escalating pressure or threatening to withdraw support, that tells you something important. At that point, the question isn’t about weddings. It’s about whether accepting their money means accepting ongoing control. If so, scaling back or choosing a smaller wedding within your means may ultimately protect your relationship and your peace. It would also set a good precedent that they can't bully you by dangling dollars in front of your faces.

There’s no way to have everything here. But starting your marriage by asserting shared values and mutual respect matters more than having a perfect event.

QUESTION:
My partner and I have been together for three years, and we're talking about getting engaged. The problem is my family. They're very traditional and have made it clear they don't approve of my partner for several reasons—my partner is from a different cultural background, has a different religion, and my family thinks they're "not good enough" for me. We've tried to include my partner in family events, but my family is cold and sometimes outright rude. My partner has been incredibly patient and understanding, but I can see it's taking a toll. I love my family, but I also love my partner, and I'm tired of being caught in the middle. How do I handle this?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
This is a deeply painful and complex situation, and your feelings of being caught between two important parts of your life are completely understandable. When family disapproval is rooted in cultural and religious differences, it can feel like an almost insurmountable barrier, especially when it manifests as coldness or rudeness toward someone you love.

First, it’s important to acknowledge the emotional toll this is taking on all of you—your partner’s patience and your own efforts to bridge the gap show your commitment, but there’s a limit to how much strain anyone can endure without feeling hurt or diminished. Your partner’s experience of exclusion or disrespect is not something to minimize, even if your family’s behavior comes from ingrained biases or fears rather than outright malice.

You might consider having a candid conversation with your family about how their attitudes and actions affect not only your partner but also your relationship with them. This isn’t about convincing them to change overnight, but about setting clear boundaries around respect and kindness. Sometimes, families need to hear directly how their behavior is causing pain and jeopardizing relationships they care about.

At the same time, reflect on what you need to feel supported and respected. It’s okay to prioritize your partner’s well-being and your own happiness, even if that means creating some distance from family dynamics that are harmful or unyielding. Love doesn’t require sacrificing your sense of self or enduring ongoing disrespect.

If you decide to move forward with your partner, consider how you want to navigate family involvement in your life and future together. It’s possible to honor your family’s place in your life without allowing their disapproval to dictate your choices or diminish your relationship. This might mean limiting family gatherings or redefining what family support looks like for you.

Ultimately, you’re facing a choice between trying to change long-held family attitudes, which can be slow and uncertain, and protecting the relationship you cherish. Neither path is easy, and it’s okay to grieve the loss of the family acceptance you hoped for. Your love and commitment to your partner are valid and deserve to be honored, even in the face of resistance.

Take your time, lean on trusted friends or confidants who understand your situation, and remember that you have the right to build a life that reflects your values and happiness.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.0

Strengths:
- ...
Acknowledges emotional pain on all sides.

Centers the partner’s experience of exclusion.

Encourages boundary setting.

Avoids diagnosing or pathologizing family behavior.

Weaknesses:
Overuse of “deeply” and generalized emotional language.

Still too conciliatory toward family hostility.

Avoids clearly naming prejudice as harmful behavior.

Lacks concrete consequences for continued disrespect.

Uses em dashes in places that soften otherwise strong points.

OUTPUT: 
This is a painful situation, and I'm sorry you're dealing with it. The reality is that you can't control your family's behavior, but you can control how you respond to it and what you're willing to tolerate. Right now, by continuing to bring your partner into situations where they're treated poorly, you're essentially condoning that treatment, even if that's not your intention. You’re unintentionally signaling that this treatment is something they’re expected to endure. That’s not fair to them, and it’s not sustainable for you.

You must set clear boundaries with your family. Have a direct conversation: "I love you all, and I want you in my life. But the way you're treating my partner is unacceptable, and I won't continue to subject them to that. If you can't be respectful and welcoming to my partner, then I won't be bringing them to family events, and I may need to limit my own participation as well." This is hard, but necessary. Your partner deserves to be treated with basic respect, and you deserve to not have to choose between your family and your relationship.

The key is to be consistent. If you set this boundary but then keep showing up to family events without your partner, or if you let your family's comments slide, you're sending mixed messages. You might also consider whether there are family members who are more accepting. Maybe you can maintain relationships with those individuals separately, while limiting contact with those who are hostile. 

You’re not choosing between your family and your partner. You’re choosing whether the person you love is protected or sacrificed to keep the peace. That choice will shape the future you’re building.

QUESTION:
My close friend recently started dating someone new, and while I want to be supportive, every interaction I’ve had with his partner has left me uneasy. They dominate conversations, interrupt constantly, and seem dismissive of my friend’s opinions in subtle but persistent ways. My friend seems smitten and hasn’t noticed any of this. I don’t want to rain on his happiness, but I’m worried about the dynamic I’m observing. How do I express concern without sounding judgmental or territorial?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s clear you care deeply about your friend’s well-being, and that makes your concern both natural and important. When someone we care about enters a new relationship, especially one where we notice troubling patterns, it can feel like a delicate tightrope to walk between support and honesty.

Given what you’ve described—the partner’s dominating behavior and subtle dismissiveness—it’s understandable that you feel uneasy. These dynamics can quietly undermine your friend’s voice and confidence over time, even if they’re not immediately obvious to him. Your friend’s current infatuation might make it harder for him to see these red flags, so your perspective could be valuable if shared thoughtfully.

Approaching this conversation with humility and care is key. Instead of framing your concerns as judgments about the partner’s character, you might focus on your feelings and observations. For example, you could say something like, “I’ve noticed a few moments when it seemed like your opinions weren’t getting the attention they deserve, and I felt a bit worried about how that might affect you.” This way, you’re centering your friend’s experience rather than making accusatory statements.

It’s also helpful to choose a moment when you’re alone with your friend, away from the partner, so he doesn’t feel defensive or caught off guard. Be prepared for the possibility that he might not immediately see things your way or might feel protective of his relationship. That doesn’t mean your concerns aren’t valid; sometimes it takes time for someone to process and reflect.

Lastly, keep in mind that your role isn’t to control or fix the relationship but to offer a caring perspective. Your friend’s autonomy matters, and he will ultimately decide how to navigate this relationship. By expressing your concern gently and respectfully, you’re honoring your friendship and planting a seed that might help him if challenges arise later.

This is a tough spot to be in, and your thoughtful approach shows your commitment to your friend’s happiness and safety. Trust that your honesty, delivered with kindness, is a meaningful gift.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.0

Strengths:
Validates the writer’s concern without accusing the new partner of being abusive or malicious based on limited evidence.

Advises the right general lane: talk privately to the friend, focus on concrete observations, expect defensiveness.

Includes a usable conversational entry point (a short script) and urges restraint.

Weaknesses:
LLM-ish phrasing and filler: “delicate tightrope,” “approaching with humility,” “planting a seed,” “meaningful gift.” It reads like generic guidance rather than a columnist with a point of view.

Overuse of intensifiers: “deeply” shows up again and contributes to the same “default voice” problem you’ve been flagging.

Em dash usage: It uses em dashes (for example, “what you’ve described—the partner’s…”) which you explicitly want to penalize and train out.

Too hedged and abstract: It never really names what you are seeing in plain terms (steamrolling, subtle contempt, social isolation risk) or draws a firm line about what would warrant escalation.

Not enough practical structure: It gives one “say something like” line, but doesn’t coach the writer on how to handle likely outcomes (friend brushes it off, partner escalates, friend later confides).

Ending is generic reassurance: It closes by praising the writer’s thoughtfulness instead of leaving them with a clear, grounded next step.

OUTPUT: 
You’re right to feel uneasy, and you’re also right to be careful. A friend’s new relationship is not a courtroom, and you do not have enough information to declare that this person is “bad.” But you are allowed to notice a pattern that leaves your friend smaller in the room. People who constantly interrupt, dominate, and subtly swat down a partner’s opinions can slowly train everyone around them to stop listening to that partner. That is not nothing.

The mistake to avoid is making this about your opinion of the new partner’s personality. Keep it about your friend’s experience and your friend’s voice. Pick a calm moment when you are alone and say something like:

“I’m glad you’re excited about this. I want to check in about something awkward. When we’ve all been together, I’ve noticed a few moments where you get talked over or your opinions get brushed aside. Maybe I’m misreading it, but I’ve left those hangouts feeling protective of you. How does it feel to you when you’re with them in a group?”

Then stop talking. Your job is not to win the argument. Your job is to give your friend a clean opening to reflect without having to defend his partner against an attack.

If he shrugs it off, do not press. Just stay observant and stay available. If the dynamic is real, he will eventually notice it more clearly, and he will remember that you asked about him, not that you tried to prosecute his partner. If, on the other hand, he says, “Honestly, it does bother me,” you can gently get more specific: “Do you want me to help by changing how I engage in those conversations, like redirecting back to you, or would you rather I just be a quiet place to vent afterward?”

One more boundary for your own sanity: do not get pulled into becoming the designated referee at every dinner. If the partner is steamrolling you too, you can keep it simple in the moment: “Hold on, I want to hear what he was saying.” No speech, no drama, just a small correction that signals the room has more than one voice.

You cannot run quality control on your friend’s love life. You can be a steady mirror and a steady friend. When you speak with care and specificity, you are not being territorial. You are being loyal.

QUESTION:
I’m close with my older sister, but she’s been sharing very personal details about my life with extended family members—things I told her in confidence. When I confronted her, she said she was “just trying to help people understand what I’m going through.” I’m hurt and feel exposed, but she doesn’t seem to grasp the breach of trust. How do I rebuild safety with someone who doesn’t seem to understand boundaries?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
It’s deeply painful when someone you trust, especially a close family member like your sister, shares your private matters without your consent. Your feelings of hurt and exposure are completely valid. Trust is a fragile thing, and when it’s broken, it can leave you feeling vulnerable and unsure about how to move forward.

Your sister’s explanation—that she was trying to help others understand your situation—suggests she may see her actions as supportive, even if they disregard your need for privacy. This disconnect can make it hard for her to recognize the boundary she crossed. It might help to gently but clearly express not just that you’re upset, but why this sharing feels like a violation to you. Sometimes people don’t fully grasp the impact of their actions until it’s spelled out in terms they can relate to—how it affects your sense of safety and your willingness to be open with her in the future.

Rebuilding safety will likely take time and repeated, consistent respect for your boundaries. It’s okay to set clear limits about what you’re willing to share going forward and to remind her if those limits are crossed again. If she continues to dismiss your feelings or boundaries, it’s also okay to reconsider how much you share with her, at least until you feel more secure.

Ultimately, rebuilding trust requires both acknowledgment of the breach and a demonstrated commitment to respect your privacy. If that commitment isn’t there, protecting your own emotional well-being by creating distance or adjusting expectations is a valid and sometimes necessary step. Your need for safety and respect in your relationships is not only reasonable but essential.

EVALUATION:
Score: 6.5

Strengths:
Clearly validates the sense of betrayal.

Emphasizes the importance of trust.

Encourages boundary setting.

Avoids blaming the letter writer.

Weaknesses:
Overuse of “deeply painful” and similar LLM intensifiers.

Too forgiving of repeated boundary violations.

Avoids naming the behavior as unacceptable unless safety is at stake.

Lacks a clear rule for future information sharing.

Uses em dashes to soften accountability.

OUTPUT: 

Sharing someone else’s private information without permission is not a misunderstanding. It’s a breach of trust. Intentions don’t override that, and “trying to help people understand” does not make it acceptable.

The fact that you've already confronted her and made clear what the problem is, and that she doesn't seem willing or able to change her behavior, indicates a larger issue. You will have to make clear to her the gravity of the situation, and if necessary, stop sharing sensitive personal information with her if the behavior continues.

Start with clarity: “When I share personal things with you, I expect them to stay between us unless I explicitly say otherwise.” Don’t soften it into a suggestion. Frame it as the baseline requirement for trust. Then explain the emotional impact: “When you share my private information, I feel exposed and misunderstood. It makes me hesitate to open up at all.” If she offers a rationalization, such as, "I'm just trying to help people understand your circumstances," push back. “I understand you mean well, but this information is not yours to share. If I want other loved ones to be privy to this information, then I will share it myself. Please trust that I have the judgment to be able to do this.”

From there, set a forward-looking rule: “If you’re ever unsure whether something is private, assume it is. Ask me first before sharing it with anyone else.” With anything that's at all sensitive, she needs to ask you before sharing it. End of discussion.

Rebuilding trust takes time, but consistency helps. If she proves she can hold confidentiality moving forward, the relationship will strengthen. If she can’t, then you will know that you simply can't share private or sensitive information with her anymore. Not out of punishment, but in order to protect yourself. Love doesn't justify allowing your sister to become a sieve with your most private and intimate information.

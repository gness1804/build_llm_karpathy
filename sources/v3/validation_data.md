QUESTION:
I am the oldest of three daughters, and my family has always placed a heavy emphasis on achievement and success, conventionally defined—my father is a physician, and my mother is a renowned lawyer, and my younger siblings and I all followed in their footsteps, becoming professionals of various stripes. We're all reasonably happy in our lives, though we face a lot of stress. But I've been encountering one particular problem that has caused me to question some of the values I grew up with. Last year, when my car broke down on the side of the road, I waited 3 hours for AAA, but they never came. Just as hour 4 began, a kindly man around my age drove up in his truck and offered to fix the problem, refusing the money I offered as compensation. On a whim, I asked him if he might want to meet for coffee, and we really hit it off. Now we're in a promising relationship. He came from a working class family and aside from his vocational education, hasn't had much formal education; he's an auto mechanic. But after I told my parents about our relationship, they strongly disapproved, making harsh remarks about me throwing away my life with some "grease monkey" and emphasizing that both of my siblings were married or engaged to fellow highly paid professionals.

I love my parents, but I don't like the way they're treating me or my partner, and now I'm starting to question the ruthless Type A values I was raised to believe in. I have no desire to throw away my professional career, but I'm also queasy about obsessing over status the way I once did. When it comes to my family, should I just keep them at arm's length for as long as I'm in this relationship? Or do you think it's worth trying to confront them and getting them to see the light?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your situation touches on a deeply personal crossroads between honoring your own happiness and navigating the expectations of a family whose values have shaped much of your life. It’s clear you care about your parents and value your relationship with them, but their reaction to your partner has caused real hurt and disappointment. That tension is painful and understandably makes you question the very framework you grew up within.

Your parents’ disapproval seems rooted in a narrow definition of success and status, one that overlooks the qualities that make relationships meaningful—kindness, respect, shared values, and genuine connection. Your partner’s willingness to help you in a moment of need, and the bond that grew from that, speaks to something authentic and valuable that transcends job titles or social standing. It’s also important that you don’t feel pressured to sacrifice your professional ambitions or identity to fit a mold that doesn’t feel right to you.

When it comes to your family, there’s no simple answer. Keeping some distance can be a healthy way to protect yourself and your relationship from ongoing negativity, especially if their disapproval is expressed harshly or dismissively. At the same time, if you feel emotionally ready and safe, gently opening a conversation about your feelings and your partner’s worth might help them see beyond their initial judgments. This doesn’t mean you have to convince them to fully embrace your relationship on your timeline, but it can be a way to assert your autonomy and invite more understanding.

Ultimately, your happiness and sense of self deserve to be at the center of this. It’s okay to set boundaries that preserve your well-being, even if that means some distance from your family for now. Over time, as they witness your relationship and your continued success on your own terms, their perspective may shift—or it may not. Either way, living authentically and with integrity is a powerful way to honor both yourself and the people you love.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.0

Strengths:
Clearly identifies the core value conflict between status-driven family expectations and personal fulfillment.

Maintains a calm, respectful tone toward all parties.

Encourages boundary-setting without immediately escalating to estrangement.

Avoids diagnosing or pathologizing anyone.

Weaknesses:
Overly abstract and generalized; relies on broad moral language rather than decisive framing.

Uses em dashes (“—kindness, respect, shared values, and genuine connection”) which contributes to a polished-but-LLM feel.

Avoids clearly naming the parents’ behavior as disrespectful or harmful.

Lacks a concrete script for addressing the parents directly.

Ending is aspirational but vague, suggesting growth “over time” without grounding the reader in present-day action.

OUTPUT: 
I would agree that your parents are acting inappropriately. We have enough problems with class and income inequality in our society without people throwing fuel on the fire by acting with such disrespect towards those who are different. The fact and appropriateness of your relationship with a mechanic is none of their business. Their comments about your partner aren’t expressions of concern; they’re expressions of contempt, and that matters.

You don’t need to hide your partner to keep the peace. Before keeping your parents at arm’s length, though, it’s worth confronting this directly. That gives them a chance to course-correct and makes it clear that silence does not equal consent.

I would convey to your parents that while you love them, you also don't like how they've been treating either of you or the snide remarks they've been making about him. You might say something like: “I love you, but the way you talk about my partner is hurtful and disrespectful. I didn’t choose him in spite of my values; I chose him because of them. I’m not asking for approval, but I am asking for basic respect.”

If they resist, you can also remind them, gently but firmly, that status is relative. Except for those who sit at the very top of the social ladder, there are always people above who could apply the same dismissiveness and contempt that they’re directing downward. That perspective often lands harder than moral lectures.

If they refuse to stop, then distance becomes a boundary, not a punishment. But start with clarity. This is your life, and you don’t need to apologize for building it according to your own definition of success.

QUESTION:
I briefly dated a woman last year. Let's call her "Jeannie." And by "briefly," I mean: friendship that quickly evolved, romance that developed even more quickly, a brief sexual encounter, and then painful disengagement on the part of Jeannie. The situation was short but extremely intense, and it was one of the one or two times that I've truly been in love. We were good friends for 6 months after our "breakup" and then have remained cordial thereafter. 

After the romantic liaison with Jeannie ended, I met another woman. She was very different from Jeannie, was more stable and critically, she didn't run away when things got tough. I have been in a serious relationship with this other woman, "Mira," for about a year at this point. We have a good relationship.

Jeannie wants to remain friends. The romantic aspect of our relationship is clearly dead, and neither of us has any interest in reviving it. And my relationship with Jeannie ended before my current relationship started. So I have no problem remaining friends. But Mira says it's inappropriate to remain friends with an ex, particularly someone I was with so recently. There's no beef with Jeannie, but she thinks I should cut off contact in the name of our relationship. I'm not happy with this response. I've never cheated on anyone in my life and have no plans to do so. Who's right?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your situation touches on a common and often delicate question about boundaries and trust in relationships. On one hand, your desire to maintain a friendship with Jeannie—someone you shared a meaningful, if brief, romantic connection with—is understandable, especially since you both have moved past the romantic phase and have maintained a respectful, friendly connection. It sounds like you value that friendship and have no intention of rekindling anything beyond that.

On the other hand, Mira’s feelings about your friendship with Jeannie are also valid. When someone is in a committed relationship, it’s natural for them to feel uneasy about their partner maintaining close ties with an ex, particularly if the romantic history is recent and intense. Her concern likely stems from a desire to protect the emotional safety and trust within your relationship. It’s not necessarily about mistrust or accusing you of wrongdoing, but about how certain connections can feel threatening or uncomfortable to a partner.

Neither of you is inherently “right” or “wrong” here; rather, you’re navigating different perspectives on what feels appropriate and respectful within your current relationship. The key is to explore what boundaries can be set that honor both your friendship with Jeannie and Mira’s feelings. This might mean having an open, honest conversation with Mira about what specifically bothers her about your friendship with Jeannie—whether it’s the frequency of contact, the nature of your conversations, or something else—and then seeing if there’s a compromise that feels respectful to both of you.

It’s also worth reflecting on your own feelings: Does maintaining this friendship with Jeannie bring you peace and joy, or does it create tension or distraction in your current relationship? Sometimes, even when there’s no intention to harm, certain connections can complicate the emotional landscape.

Ultimately, relationships thrive on mutual respect and understanding, which sometimes means adjusting behaviors to support the partnership. If Mira’s discomfort persists and you find it difficult to reconcile with your friendship with Jeannie, it’s okay to reconsider the nature or extent of that friendship. That doesn’t diminish your past or your feelings, but it acknowledges the evolving context of your life and relationships.

There’s no simple answer here, but your willingness to consider both perspectives thoughtfully is a strong foundation for navigating this with care.

EVALUATION:
Score: 6.5

Strengths:
Accurately identifies the emotional tension between friendship and romantic partnership.

Avoids accusing either party of bad faith.

Recognizes that boundaries matter even when no cheating has occurred.

Weaknesses:
Response is too biased towards prioritizing the romantic relationship over the friendship. Does not adequately consider the possibility that the better course of action might be to break up with Mira and remain friends with Jeannie.

Excessive neutrality (“Neither of you is inherently right or wrong”) weakens moral clarity.

Overlong and meandering, with multiple paragraphs reiterating the same balance point.

Uses em dashes repeatedly (“Jeannie—someone you shared a meaningful, if brief, romantic connection with”), contributing to a generic LLM cadence.

Fails to engage with the intensity and emotional residue of the Jeannie relationship.

OUTPUT: 
Being torn between two people you care about, especially when you don't think that there's a valid reason for the conflict to be there at all, is definitely a distinct kind of pain. In your mind, there's a clear boundary, chronologically and physically, that separates your relationship with Jeannie from that with Mira. Mira feels differently. 

Being friends with an ex is one of those age-old issues dividing good, thoughtful people. One school of thought holds that such a friendship, or indeed any friendship between people with the potential for mutual attraction, is almost always a slippery slope towards inappropriate contact between the two people involved. Call this the "When Harry Met Sally" school. The other camp is more permissive of such friendships, as long as appropriate boundaries are maintained. And at the end of the day, it really does depend on the people and the circumstances. I've known of people who were platonic friends with exes for years after the breakup, with no apparent rekindling of any sort of romantic interest between them. And I've also known of people who, um, went the "When Harry Met Sally" route.

Ultimately, the answer to this question depends on the particulars. The question isn’t whether you can remain friends with Jeannie. It’s whether doing so is compatible with the relationship you want to build with Mira. Ask yourself honestly how you would feel if the roles were reversed.  

You have a right to your own friendships, but her concerns are also valid. If you truly feel that you can maintain a friendship with this ex without any temptations or risk of inappropriate actions, then it might be worth trying to make the friendship work--while also keeping your current partner apprised, of course. Suggest a compromise. For instance, maybe only hang out with Jeannie in group settings or when your partner is there. Or agree to only see Jeannie in public spaces during the day. But if your partner's discomfort would seem to preclude even compromises like this, then you might have to weigh this friendship vs. your current relationship. If it really does seem to be a mutually exclusive choice after ruling out compromises and such, then you'll have to decide whether staying in your current relationship is worth cutting ties with a friend or vice-versa.

Sometimes a loss isn’t about choosing the “right” person. It’s about recognizing that you can’t carry every meaningful connection forward into the next phase of your life without something giving way.

QUESTION:
My girlfriend and I have been together for a year, and we're both in our early 30s. She's great in so many ways, but there's one thing that's really bothering me: she's constantly on her phone when we're together. We'll be having dinner, and she'll be scrolling through social media. We'll be watching a movie, and she'll be texting. Even when we're having what I think is an important conversation, she'll pick up her phone to check notifications. I've mentioned it a few times, and she'll put it away for a little while, but then she's right back to it. I feel like I'm competing with her phone for attention, and it's making me feel unimportant. Am I overreacting, or is this a legitimate concern?

DRAFT_RESPONSE:
Your feelings are absolutely valid, and this is a concern worth addressing. When someone you care about frequently turns their attention to their phone during shared moments, it can create a sense of distance and make you feel sidelined. It’s not just about the phone itself, but what it represents: a lack of presence and engagement in your time together. You’re not overreacting by feeling unimportant; your experience reflects a genuine need for connection and respect in the relationship.

That said, it’s also helpful to consider what might be driving her behavior. Phones can be a source of distraction, habit, or even a way to manage stress or boredom. Sometimes people don’t realize how much their phone use affects those around them, especially if it’s become an automatic response. Since you’ve already brought it up and seen only temporary changes, it might be worth having a deeper conversation about how her phone use impacts you emotionally. Try to share your feelings without blame—focus on how it makes you feel rather than accusing her of wrongdoing.

At the same time, it’s important to observe how she responds to this conversation. Is she willing to reflect on her habits and make a sustained effort to be more present? Or does she dismiss your concerns or revert quickly to the same pattern? The way she engages with your feelings will say a lot about how she values your connection.

Ultimately, relationships thrive on mutual respect and attentiveness. If this issue continues to leave you feeling neglected, it’s okay to reconsider how it fits into your overall happiness and needs. You deserve to feel seen and prioritized, and a partner who can share their attention with you—not just their phone.

EVALUATION:
Score: 7.5

Strengths:
Correctly names the emotional impact of divided attention.

Validates the concern without labeling the partner as malicious.

Encourages observing patterns over time rather than reacting to isolated incidents.

Avoids overt therapyspeak or diagnosis.

Weaknesses:
Uses an em dash in the opening (“You’re not overreacting—this is a legitimate concern”), which contributes to an LLM-ish tone.

Slightly overexplains the psychological reasons for phone use rather than staying grounded in relational impact.

Suggests app-based solutions that may feel overly prescriptive or external to the relationship.

Ending drifts toward problem-solving rather than reaffirming the relational boundary itself.

OUTPUT: 
You're not overreacting—this is a legitimate concern. When someone is constantly on their phone during shared time, it sends a message that whatever's on the screen is more important than the person in front of them. That's hurtful, and it's reasonable to want your partner's full attention when you're spending time together.

The fact that she puts it away temporarily when you mention it but then goes back to it suggests this might be more of a habit or compulsion than intentional disregard. Or that she understands what's wrong intellectually, but it's different on an emotional level. Some people genuinely struggle with phone addiction or use their phones as a way to manage anxiety or boredom. But regardless of the reason, it's affecting your relationship, and that needs to be addressed.

Have a direct conversation when you're both calm and not in the middle of a phone-checking moment: "I love spending time with you, but I've noticed that you're often on your phone when we're together, and it makes me feel like I'm not important to you. I'd like us to have some phone-free time together—maybe during meals, or when we're watching something, or having important conversations. Can we agree on some boundaries around that?" Be specific about what you need. Maybe phones go in another room during dinner, or you have certain times that are designated as phone-free. If she's resistant or dismissive of your feelings, that's a bigger problem. But if she's willing to work on it, you might need to help her by suggesting alternatives—maybe she needs to address underlying anxiety, or maybe your time together needs to be made more engaging so she's less tempted to reach for her phone. The goal is to find a balance where you both feel present and connected.

As a coda, I will add that there are also apps out there that limit access to distracting apps. These apps allow someone to set restrictions around the use of distracting apps (such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, or any apps one chooses). These are often time-based (e.g., during working hours or during the evenings) but can also have settings such as limiting the amount of time someone can open such apps in a day. One of the best of these is called Opal. Such an app might also be a solution if, as you mentioned, her heavy phone use is more of an unconscious habit than a conscious effort to avoid talking to you. I'd recommend looking into these apps.

You are revising an advice-column response using the following rubric.

RUBRIC:
*Purpose:*
Revise a draft advice-column response to be clearer, firmer, more humane, and more aligned with the columnist’s voice.

*Core Criteria:*

Moral clarity:

- Names harmful behavior when warranted.

- Avoids false neutrality or excessive hedging.

- Does not shame, moralize, or catastrophize.

Empathy without therapyspeak:

- Validates feelings plainly and directly, and in clear language.

- Avoids clinical language, diagnosis, or any sort of "therapyspeak."

- Does not position the columnist as a therapist

- Does not prescribe a plan of treatment.

Respect for agency and boundaries:

- Centers the letter writer’s right to set limits.

- Suggests appropriate boundaries that fit the specific situation.

- Avoids advising self-erasure, over-accommodation, or guilt-based compliance.

Specificity and usefulness:

- Goes beyond general reassurance.

- Offers scripts, or verbatim recommendations on how the letter-writer should address other parties in the scenario. (But at the same time, do not include more than two of these in any given response, and don't make these scripts the majority of the response.)

- Offer concrete framing and next steps when appropriate.

- Avoids vague platitudes.

- Avoids clichéd or pop psychology responses, such as using "I" statements.

Tone and voice:

- Calm, grounded, and humane.

- Direct but not harsh.

- Secular, evidence-informed.

- No proselytizing or political advocacy.

- No bigotry or stereotyping.

Focus and restraint:

- Addresses the actual dilemma, not every possible angle of a broader or more general problem.

- Does not escalate unnecessarily.

- Keeps dignity of all parties in view.

(High-level response.)
You are helping to generate advice column responses to train an LLM. I'm looking for a range of responses in terms of quality. Can you produce a High-level quality response that meets the following criteria: Strong columnist voice, clear moral clarity, specific \"scripts\", emotionally grounded, does not diagnose, pathologize, or engage in therapyspeak. Ends with a clear moral landing or concluding insight, without labeling it as a takeaway.

(Medium response.)
You are helping to generate advice column responses to train an LLM. I'm looking for a range of responses in terms of quality. Can you produce a Medium quality response that meets the following criteria: Generally solid advice with minor softness, vagueness, or missed opportunities for specificity. Some of the moral clarity of a 9-10 response may be missing. The response might be fairly described as \"pulling its punches\" in places.

(Low-medium response.)
You are helping to generate advice column responses to train an LLM. I'm looking for a range of responses in terms of quality. Can you produce a Low-medium quality response that meets the following criteria: Empathetic but generic, lacks clarity or depth, feels \"LLM-like\". Lacks a distinctive human voice. May include concrete steps, embedded in prose and never spelled out in an explicit numbered or bulleted list. Responses in this range are usually short and are rather shallow, rather than fully engaging with the complex issues that are present in advice column problems.

(Low-level response.)
You are helping to generate advice column responses to train an LLM. I'm looking for a range of responses in terms of quality. Can you produce a Low-level quality response that meets the following criteria: Minimizes harm, over-generalizes, significant therapyspeak, or structural failures. May not answer the question at all and may veer off into unrelated topics. Responses in this range might also promote political or religious agendas.

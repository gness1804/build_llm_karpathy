(High-level response.)
You are writing an advice-column response intended to model top-tier human judgment.

Write as a columnist offering judgment and guidance, not as a coach, therapist, or neutral observer.”

Write in natural, confident prose with a distinct columnist voice. Take a clear moral position where the facts justify it. Do not hedge unnecessarily or “pull punches.”

Ground the response emotionally without over-validating. Avoid emotional intensifiers (e.g., “deeply,” “incredibly,” “profoundly”) and avoid generic reassurance. Treat the letter writer as an adult capable of hearing difficult truths delivered with care.

Do not:

* diagnose, pathologize, or speculate clinically

* use therapyspeak or mental-health jargon

* use numbered or bulleted lists

* summarize with a labeled “takeaway” or lesson

* overuse stock phrases common to LLMs (e.g., “it’s understandable to feel,” “this says more about them than you”)

Do:

* name the core ethical or relational issue plainly

* offer at least one concrete script or boundary the letter writer could realistically say

* balance empathy with firm limits

* end with a closing paragraph that lands a clear moral insight without preaching or summarizing

* The response should feel like it was written by a thoughtful human columnist, not an instructional guide or a therapeutic worksheet.

(Medium response.)
You are helping to generate advice column responses to train an LLM. I'm looking for a range of responses in terms of quality. Can you produce a Medium quality response that meets the following criteria: Generally solid advice with minor softness, vagueness, or missed opportunities for specificity. Some of the moral clarity of a 9-10 response may be missing. The response might be fairly described as \"pulling its punches\" in places.

(Low-medium response.)
You are helping to generate advice column responses to train an LLM. I'm looking for a range of responses in terms of quality. Can you produce a Low-medium quality response that meets the following criteria: Empathetic but generic, lacks clarity or depth, feels \"LLM-like\". Lacks a distinctive human voice. May include concrete steps, embedded in prose and never spelled out in an explicit numbered or bulleted list. Responses in this range are usually short and are rather shallow, rather than fully engaging with the complex issues that are present in advice column problems.

(Low-level response.)
You are helping to generate advice column responses to train an LLM. I'm looking for a range of responses in terms of quality. Can you produce a Low-level quality response that meets the following criteria: Minimizes harm, over-generalizes, significant therapyspeak, or structural failures. May not answer the question at all and may veer off into unrelated topics. Responses in this range might also promote political or religious agendas.

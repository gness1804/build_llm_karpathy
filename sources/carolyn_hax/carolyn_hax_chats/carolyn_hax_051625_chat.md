Ex insists my gf is toxic because she wrote a book about cheaters
Guest May 16, 11:04 a.m.
QUESTION: My marriage ended 3 years ago because my wife cheated on me and left me for that guy. The whole experience was devastating but after wallowing for months, I spent time in therapy, worked on myself and carried on. My ex and I have reached a good place and co-parent our son well. We are not friends but we are friendly.
Now, I am in love with a beautiful, smart, funny woman who I’ve been dating for 6 months. Because of her I am happier than I’ve been since before my marriage ended. She was also cheated on and we bonded over that experience. She wrote and published a book about it. My ex Googled her name and read the book and told me she’s not happy about the relationship. The book is very brutal about cheaters. My ex says she’s worried about what my girlfriend will eventually say to our son about cheaters and about her. I promised I won’t let that happen but my ex says my girlfriend is bitter and toxic and I should steer clear. I read the book for myself and it’s very funny but she doesn’t pull any punches about her hatred and disdain for her ex and all cheaters. Her ex was mean and insulting all through the divorce so it's understandable. They don't have kids so she's free to hate him all she wants. Could that book be a sign of toxicity or is it a great method of coping?

ANSWER: Guess what. Your ex wife doesn't get to decide whom you date. She doesn't even get an opinion, not even as the amicable co-parent of your children.

If someone you are dating does or says something that either causes harm to your kids, or presents a credible risk of imminent harm or long-term damage (I think that covers it), then your ex does have standing to speak up. Arguably that's what she did, but you answered her concern so her proper next move was to drop it, not drop a "should" on you.

Cuz, sorry, ex's complaint that she's uncomfortable with your GF for authoring a book about cheaters because ex is a cheater herself does not pass the laugh test. Unless "laugh test" is literally that it makes a tired advice columnist laugh out loud at her keyboard, in which case it passes with flying colors so now I'm confusing myself.

Of course she's not happy. You can say this to her. "Of course you're not happy after reading the book. I wouldn't expect you to be."

But then you can say: "I am not dating her, though, as some kind of hired assassin to kill your standing with our kids."

Because you're not, right? You're dating her because she is her own person and you like her a lot and you like yourself with her.

So: "I am dating her because I like her. She and her ex are not the two of us. You and I are our own people and have our own history and have made our own peace."

Then: "If she can't respect that, then of course we won't stay together. But I decide that, not you."

End of conversation, no negotiating.

As for whether the book is toxicity or coping: It could be either. Or both. Her book could be a snapshot in time, maybe since superseded or outgrown, and possibly even part performance.

You have chosen the high road as your kids' co-parent, so if you and your GF are going to stay together, then first you're going to have to find out for yourself whether she is willing and able to support that choice 100 percent. No oopses.

Again -- YOU find this out. You don't preemptively walk away because your ex thinks she can exercise veto power. You do not want to grant her that.

Your ex could choose to blow up your detente over this, because that takes only one person to do. She can do more harm than any anti-cheating zealot you date. I hope she doesn't force the issue so you have to articulate things like this.

Fun fun, the need for trust never stops and keeps running both ways.

New Job
Guest May 16, 11:08 a.m.
QUESTION: I've been offered a new position at work. I dont love my current role but the new job isn't a slam dunk either. They are both management roles for high profile projects, the same grade level, and I have the same relative skill level and knowledge to bring in either role. I want to keep working for my employer because of their excellent benefits. How do I choose when both options are so similar?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I have no idea, since any new job is a risk you will hate it or be more layoffable than if you had stayed in the old one, and I know nothing about the intangibles of your company (e.g., whether taking new positions is an unspoken part of a rise through the ranks, even "lateral" moves). But if I'm looking at this as more of a logic problem, then I'm seeing something you don't love as the "old" option. So why wouldn't you try the "new" option? Unless there's a not-zero risk you'd hate it.

Living with a cheater… strategy or insanity?
Guest May 16, 11:26 a.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn, I’ve been serially cheated on by my wife. I have not directly confronted her. We have settled into routine and can enjoy a day without issue if I compartmentalize my knowledge of her deceit, which now comes more easily. My heart is not in it, my kids are my life, my work supports us and fulfills me, along with hobbies.

If I can take what pieces of enjoyment I can from my weak relationship, live my life finding love and fulfilment outside of my supposed partner, and let the kids have a “normal” upbringing in the midst of background secrecy, is that fantastic adaptation and coping in a tough situation, or am I just a masochistic time bomb waiting to have a breakdown?

In the thick of it I’m not sure if this is strategy or insanity.

ANSWER: Huh. I see your predicament -- this could be one honest conversation away from being a functional(ish) open marriage. Or, boom.

We know you're lying to your wife (about not knowing how epically she's lying to you). The question is whether you're lying to yourself about how okay you are emotionally with the arrangement.

Two suggestions -- well, one, to spend some good honest you time with that question.

But the first version of it is, on your own, to imagine a life where you tell your wife the truth and then live with configurations of that idea. Same "open" (loveless) marriage but honest; divorce; shared home but separate rooms and social lives; and earnest reckoning with the marriage and an attempt at least at repair and monogamy. At various points of your days, think where you'd be at that moment if you chose option x. Better, worse, too weird to know? Not that you'd be 100 percent in control of the outcome, you're just pushing your mind out of the "This is fine" meme you're living.

The second version is to put yourself in solo counseling to figure out what you want and feel and where your lines are between healthy tradeoffs and self-erasure.

I vote version 2 -- but getting therapy set up takes time, so try on version 1 while you wait for your appointment. (Unless your work has an EAP. Then you can usually talk to someone in a matter of days.)

At a loss for words
Guest May 16, 11:43 a.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,
First of all, thanks for all the great advice and the community you've created through your columns and your chats.
I'm reaching out now because I’ve had some stressful events this spring/summer, but my anxiety is resting in one weird area, and I'm hoping you have some advice. My granddaughter was born prematurely earlier this spring to my daughter who lives 1000 miles away. Fortunately, I was in a position to be able to go be with them and help out during the last 2 months. Happily, the baby is now doing well. My husband is now facing treatment for prostate cancer. So, I will be staying home with him for the rest of this summer. He is a very private person and has asked me not to share this information beyond our family. Here's my problem. Many of my friends are surprised that I won't be returning to see the new grandbaby until fall. They ask me why. I'm having trouble figuring out how to respond to that question from these well-meaning and loving people. What do you suggest?

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Thank you for your kind words, and I'm glad your grandbaby is doing well.

Now can I throw things around the kitchen in frustration at people for not letting things go that aren't their business?

Ugh.

Here's all you ever need to say to people who are asking for more info than you are willing or able to give: "Ah, long story."

This one, you can cap off with, "But I'll be back as soon as I can."

Then you change the subject. Have a pivot topic ready.

Also? Unsolicited, sorry: Your husband is asking a lot of you. In my book, which is irrelevant, he's asking too much. The caregiver needs care too.

If you agree with that, then ask him for license to confide. Not everywhere, just your chosen place of unfailing discretion.

Boundary-setting with possible special circumstances
Guest May 16, 11:53 a.m.
QUESTION: I've learned a lot about setting appropriate boundaries in relationships over the past few years. I recently had a conversation with a close friend which led me to look at a specific situation differently though. I have sibling with whom I have a complicated relationship. He can be verbally explosive and insulting, including cursing, name-calling, etc. Sometimes this is followed by an apology, or an "I was just angry" explanation. I told him that this type of communication is unacceptable to me. My friend's point was along the lines of "what if this is early dementia or mental illness, and he truly can't control it?" If that's the case (we're both seniors), I realize that I still have a choice, but it makes the choice more complicated, doesn't it? I'm interested in your thoughts about this.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whether someone can or can't control their "bad" behavior matters, sure -- I'd let my wailing infant smack me in the face without consequences, right? But my healthy 8-year-old, not so much.

The boundary for a sibling who is "verbally explosive and insulting" but who has dementia or mental illness would be that I don't engage with the insults at all, or leave the room or end the call or whatever -- whatever it takes to go non-responsive. I also wouldn't take it personally. Not about me.

Also, that behavior never gets "rewarded" in any sense. That can mean the threat of it never factors into my decisionmaking; I do as I intend for my reasons and if the reaction happens, then it happens. There's no tiptoeing around.

I'm answering generically here. You don't say whether your sib's behavior has deteriorated, to suggest onset of dementia, say. "I was just angry," absent context, doesn't fly. We all get angry. Not all of us take that as permission to lash out and inflict harm.

The amount of their control factors into the amount you limit contact with the person, as part of your boundary. That's how it works for me at least. And of course it's just our perception of how much control they have, because who knows. The closest we get are formal diagnoses.

Dealing with inquiries of ambiguous loss
Guest May 16, 12:08 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,

I'm so grateful for your column and am an avid reader. I'm sad to be writing you, but I hope you can help. A friend of mine has been missing for a month now. She is an adult, but it is under suspicious circumstances that she disappeared (she left behind a cat that she loved deeply and daily medications), the police are involved and every day I help with the amount of spoons I can muster. I do hang quite a few posters and talk to a lot of people at my job (I get a lot of people from many areas of Denver passing through) about my missing friend to try to create awareness and possibly recognition to generate leads for the tip line. My question is that sometimes the overwhelm of people asking follow up questions about things we (her collective of friends and warriors trying to find her) have covered 100xs gets to me and I need a nice way to say that I don't have anymore answers. I realize I'm instigating these conversations, and people want to be helpful, and I point them to the tip line and the Facebook page her mom has going to try to organize everyone. I'm also undergoing therapy, to help manage my own loss here. I really miss her. Thanks for your help.

Sincerely,
Bring Jax Home

ANSWER: Oh oh oh. This is awful.

Your question is very much like the one people have when they are seriously ill and everyone they talk to says, "Have you tried ...?" It comes from this place of real caring, and then it's over and over and over, and you. just. can't.

I have a few suggestions. One is that you release as much of this worry as you can. You are lovely to worry about how people feel when they talk to you, but I can't imagine any of them don't see your distress plainly (unless they're just not capable). So you're good. really.

Another is basic and mechanical. If you can carry a stack of little printed business-size cards with the Facebook info and the tip line and some FAQs or whatever else, then, "Thank you -- this is all of it," is a natural transaction closer.

And, you can also say: "I am so grateful you're asking. I can't be the answers though. I hope you understand."

A huge hug through the ether to you.

Feeling weirdly guilty after my weight loss
Guest May 16, 12:33 p.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn, I'm glad you answered today's question to open a discussion about weight loss drugs and judgment. I have a different but related one. I've lost 70 pounds taking meds, I'm healthier (was pre-diabetic), but now I'm having an unexpected response. I really like seeing myself thin. I like shopping for clothes, something that's been torture for years. But in this era of more body positivity, I'm feeling strangely guilty and kind of ashamed that I had to make myself so much smaller to embrace my body. I have friends of all sizes, of course, and I love them for who they are. But sometimes I can hear that judgy voice in my own head (never out loud) saying I'm glad I look the way I do now. And I hate that. Is this just another way that diet culture has messed with me? What should I do with these contradictory feelings?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yeah dramatic intentional weight loss definitely brings up some interesting new ways to feel bad -- when all "body positivity" was supposed to mean was not linking body size and shape and food to punishing measures of personal worth.

I wouldn't call your experience "unexpected" though. I mean, you were pre-diabetic -- your body wasn't in a happy place. Now it's happy, or happier. where it is, and it's okay to feel good about that.

So while I don't think it was ever misguided to focus on liking yourself and wearing flattering things at whatever weight you were -- and wow it is TOTALLY right to be accepting of others wherever they are, and being open to beauty in whatever form it appears -- we are allowed to have personal, internal signals. This feels good, this doesn't feel good, this feels great. It's our metering system. The best we can hope for at this point is to grab it back from social pressure -- or protect it from, in the case of kids.

QUESTION: Why are you even saying when you will go back? Oversharing = push back. When are you going back? Not sure, haven’t made plans yet. Rinse and repeat. This will be true until you buy plane tickets.
FWIW I had premature twin grandbabies and after that first longer visit I only returned when needed/requested. After that first rough period, they have grown to be happy healthy elementary schoolers.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: So, yes -- you're right. I'll say that upfront. The less we say the less we have to explain.

But. For one thing, that's a tough lesson to apply in arrears. OP may have been chitchatting as usual, and suddenly there was Husband's Cancer Embargo to deal with, and oops, suddenly OP needs creative phrasing where none was ever needed before. It's like learning a new dance step and tripping over your own feet.

And, further, this dovetails with the need for caregiver to have care: The OP probably really wants to go back to see the daughter and grandbaby. And is worried about husband, too. OP is talking to friends! So, "Not sure, haven’t made plans yet," is not just info withholding, it's emotional withholding. That's hard.

So that's why the breezy deflection you suggest is 100 percent effective and right but ... ugh. Not. For a person like OP, newly in this spot. (Maybe eventually, with time.)

And why the pushing is so hard, too, from friends. Wish they had their sensors on.

Aaaaand why "keep my cancer a complete secret all summer" is just not a fair ask. Again. I say this already spotting anyone sick a huge sympathy advantage.

I'd add: Same honest, open *love-filled* marriage.

I know someone with that and it's not a way to not upset the apple cart. It's a reformation. And excising of the word 'cheater.' Also, it contains deep respect for the other so that nothing is being rubbed in the spouses noses.

Personal Health Issue
Guest May 16, 12:52 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, your answer to the new grandmother with the ill husband was good. But I am a wife who has forbidden my husband to talk about my health at all, never, zero. One reason is he has no boundaries at all, so my demarcation line has to be kind of all or nothing, or else he'd tell a stranger in the grocery store. What I would tell this woman is to look as though she's going to confide and then say, "Actually, I have a little health issue I'm dealing with. I'll talk more about it when I can, but I appreciate you keeping this quiet," and then moving to the pivot topic. I love it when my husband actually protects me, and I bet her husband would appreciate her handling it this way.

ANSWER: Yes, there's that. I'm sorry.

Then of course there's the other class of people who hear, "Actually, I have a little health issue I'm dealing with.

EAP followup
Guest May 16, 12:59 p.m.
QUESTION: I work at a large employer with a mental-health benefit/EAP. I've been struggling to feel productive at work, wondering if I'm burned out, or depressed, or just bored with my job, etc. I recently signed up with the EAP and did indeed get to talk with someone in less than a week, which was great. I found that the therapy she provided seemed very "results focused," with the desired results being that I was able to be productive at work. To be fair, that is the problem I brought to her that I wanted a solution for. However, I also mentioned that some of my poor mental health state had to do with some issues I am having with my wife. She did not follow up on that at all. We talked instead about attention issues, possible ADHD, etc., all very reasonable things, ... but all focused on my ability to work.

I had somewhat of a feeling that maybe the employer-provided mental health providers were mostly focused on ensuring that employees were able to be productive at work and not necessarily as interested in probing "outside the box" of what I described to find deeper issues.

Just something to keep in mind.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Thank you. Yes, that's one potential limitation. Another is literal, in that the number of sessions is typically capped. But it's what I think of as a gateway -- a trained and licensed mental health provider who can identify areas of concern and refer out if needed.

That might not be something all of them can do, will do, are empowered to do. Mileages always seem to vary. But by my understanding, because the number of sessions is capped, part of the function is to refer out people who need more care.

Guest May 16, 1:07 p.m.
QUESTION: Two of my husband's brothers and a niece and nephew were injured in a serious car accident in which they were all injured (one brother-in-law's neck was broken, though he survived). I became the conduit of information, both to and from, for friends and family.

It almost broke me, especially when people made suggestions they intended to be helpful (but they did not themselves help). About three weeks into this, seeing that I was reaching capacity to do this while working and caring for my young kids, two friends became my "communications secretaries." I gave them information and they made the contacts with relevant people. They filtered the return responses and suggestions from others, so that I only had to deal with appropriate stuff. And because they were one remove from the situation, they could simply say, "I'm sorry, I don't have the answer to that, but I should know more when I call you next."

Maybe Jax's friend could enlist some people to do that for them, especially if they have become "information central" for a wide circle. Because it's not sustainable, especially when you're dealing with your own anxiety.

QUESTION: I’d also try to focus on this - no matter how many difficult guests attend, the student will still graduate, the wedding will still take place (well, unless one of the difficult guests objects … I kid, I kid). I know how we can get pictures in our heads of what a perfect event should look like, but all those details we can stress over are just that, details, not the real focus of the celebration, nor the real cause for celebration. Life is messy, people can be difficult, and yet there is still so much to celebrate. Keep your eyes on the prize, and don’t focus on the self-promoters or the selfie-takers.

QUESTION: Just a counter balance to the person who experienced the EAP therapist as all about being productive at work again, ignoring other issues (ug, sorry that happened).

My experience with the EAP was different. I had a crisis (called with the question “how do you know it’s time to hospitalize someone for mental health issues they don’t think the have?”). Got excellent advice, and it wasn’t about work. I also have Fed friends making use of EAP as they face the fork in the road decisions.

Evil Ex Wife
Guest May 16, 1:34 p.m.
QUESTION: A decade ago, when our kids were just babies, my husband was hit by a drunk driver and the physical and emotional impacts are lifelong. My husband did all the therapies and regained a lot of physical mobility/ability but his mental health spiraled out of control and I was his target of all his anger. He was verbally abusive and when I'd get close to help him, there were a few times he was physically abusive. For years, I tried to hold it all together but when my older son heard a particularly nasty insults thru the intercom system, I knew it was time. I got myself in therapy and planned the dissolution of my marriage. I've been out of the house for six months now and several in my church and his family have asked how I could leave a man who is disabled and disabled through no fault of his own. What happened "in sickness and in health" is what several have asked. I have been honest and I've said he was emotionally and physically abusive. Is it wrong of me to be direct? It is the truth. I'm so tired of hiding and angry at others' judgement of me when he goes to church and presents as some pillar of the community when he most certainly is not. Their dad is passionate about the boys attending this church school and I didn't fight it in the divorce agreement so for now, I'm stuck with this church and its community.

ANSWER: I am here for your directness.

This is a terrible story in so many ways, I am sorry.

I'm sure you are on this already, but just to make myself feel better, I am going to ask out loud whether there are extra eyes on your boys to make sure their dad doesn't turn his anger on them. Especially given that your husband is playing the church community, acting the pillar and using their sympathy to present himself as a victim 2 x over (accident and now you). Having them in the church school means there's a full coverup mechanism in place, for people to be very slow to believe he's harming them.

Re: keeping cancer secret
Guest May 16, 1:38 p.m.
QUESTION: My husband had prostate cancer, which ultimately took his life, and he wanted it kept from his family and friends, though not mine. He did that because he didn't want to be treated any differently and he wanted to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible. I understood that once it started affecting our lives in a big way, I longed for the "normal" days. I didn't necessarily agree with not telling his family, but understood and although I tried to talk him out of it, it was his decision.

Secretive about cancer
Guest May 16, 1:41 p.m.
QUESTION: My spouse had surgery for aggressive prostate cancer 2 years ago. Last year, he had to undergo 35 sessions of radiation. We kept it very quiet. Only our closest friends, who don't live here, and our pastor knew. He works in an industry and at a level where people are always looking for your weak spot as a way to push you out. He's also about 30 years older than the other people he works with. One is constantly asking about his age and when he's going to retire. He was able to work from home for about 3 days following surgery, and he scheduled his radiation treatments for very early in the morning before work. He only told the HR director and one other person. No one else in the office knows. We live in a small city, and info like this spreads quickly. As a side note for the chatter whose spouse is a member of the clergy, my dad was a clergyman, and we never spoke to anyone about his health for the same reason.

school fundraiser misbehavior
Guest May 16, 2:01 p.m.
QUESTION: My daughter's school has an annual silent auction fundraiser. We typically do some small bids, but there was a particular piece of art we liked this year that was a little more expensive. We were the last ones to bid on the item before the auction closed. Yet, we were informed a few days later that there was a "mix up" and someone else bid after us and was considered the winner. Neither my husband or I understand how this is possible, as there was a bell and announcement, it was not unclear. My husband thinks we should ask the school to fix this, which involves physically getting the art back, refunding the other person, and allowing us to pay and take it. I have suggested letting it go (after all, the school got the funds, which was the point). We save our money, buy other art, maintain harmony - although I also believe we should decline to attend poorly-run auctions at the school in the future, and contribute to school fundraising in other ways. What do you think? And if we want to find out the details of what happened, are we just stirring the pot?

ANSWER: Heh. I think you definitely let it go, because there are a few reasons the auction could have been messed up but there's no good outcome to complaining.

I also wouldn't "decline to attend poorly-run auctions at the school in the future," either. Next time don't leave without it when you win :)

By let it go, I mean really really let it go. But next time don't leave without your winnings when you win :)

(Clearly there was inside finagling, right? It's just a matter of why. Was the wrong piece put up for auction by mistake? Okay, school auction, you let that go. Did someone with more juice want it? That sucks. Did they drop it? Etc. None of it matters at this point, it's over, you aren't out any money, so forget it happened and la la la ...)

Group Conversations
Guest May 16, 2:06 p.m.
QUESTION: We are going on a trip with a small group (6) of long time friends. We love the group chats but a couple of them like to start side conversations during a group time. I find this very distracting, no matter if I’m the one being sidelined or the one in the larger group. I don’t want to miss any discussion! Should I make a request to the group: Can we agree to keep our conversation A group one so I don’t miss any of your stories? Or should I try to guide the side talker back to the group? Unfortunately, the most active side talker likes to pigeon hole my husband and seems oblivious to his constant chatter.
avatar
Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: That irritates me too. I don't think there's much you can do about it, though. You can certainly try to make your request to the group -- especially if you have, say, a hearing or focus impairment that makes following it all extra challenging -- but what if some group members dislike group talk and prefer 1 x 1?

The person being split off is the one who has the reins, and can say to the one trying to divert them off to a side comversation, "Hang on, I'm following this [main group] story." So, I say make a strong appeal to your husband.

Talking with kids about mentally ill dad after divorce
Guest May 16, 2:15 p.m.
QUESTION: I have been divorced from my spouse for just over a year now and share custody with my ex. We have two teenagers - one in middle school and one in high school. Dad has significant mental illness, leading to paranoid, strange, and manic behavior both in public and private. I don't think they're in physical danger, but I'm struggling to talk to them about his mental illness; in addition to a non-disparagement clause in our divorce, I am worried I will push them away, or worse, that they would repeat what I said back to him and he would take it out on me through the kids. I'm not looking for advice on custody (I have been assured that my 5 day (to his two-day) is really the most I'll be able to get), but rather how to talk to the kids about dad's significant impairments and erratic behavior. One kid is becoming increasingly anxious and distressed, alternating between fighting with his dad and saying he wants to live with him full-time. I've tried getting the kids into therapy, but they have seen multiple therapists without opening up, and I worry my ex has warned them not to talk about him to others. I've been dealing by being as neutral as possible, never mentioning mental illness and just giving them a lot of my own emotional support, but I'm worried I'm not giving them the language to describe what is very clearly in front of them, which feels like a conspiracy of silence, and I worry I'm failing to give them the tools they need to safeguard their own well-being. Help!

ANSWER: Maybe instead of therapy-therapy, look into the programs offered by NAMI for families of people with mental illness? I know Family-to-Family is one of their more popular ones, but not sure if that's the age you need. Still -- the emphasis on education vs counseling might get at the problem from a more effective angle.

A Married Sib Picks Estrangement - the OTHER Side
Guest May 16, 2:16 p.m.
QUESTION: Here's the flipside to a sibling distancing themselves from their FOO, and, no, it doesn't involve abuse or control issues. (I'm tired of your fans and columns jumping to abuse.)

I'm the youngest in my family, and I didn't have the best childhood because of it. For most of my life, my family always considered me an afterthought. The four older kids made all the decisions about vacation spots, restaurants, movies, etc. My mom was the only family member to show up to my events when she remembered. My dad cannot remember my birthday, and none of my siblings know how old I am. (They subtract at least ten years.)

By the time I was a teenager, I found my family of choice, my best friend's family. From then on, I adapted that way, and no one in my immediate family ever noticed my emotional distance and frequent absences...until I got married. My husband (the oldest in his family) was pretty horrified at the second class citizen treatment we both received because the favoritism extended to my choice of spouse and our kids. My in-laws, however, welcomed me in a way I'd never experienced from family so we don't spend as much time with my family.

But ever since my husband came on the scene, my family decided he is "abusive" and keeps me from contacting my family. They have severe amnesia of all the times I complained about being ignored and the emotional distance in the previous 20 years. I'm not sure why my husband's presence has changed their outlook, but they're convinced his behavior, not their behavior, is the reason I don't come around anymore.

My family doesn't believe me just like all the other times they didn't believe me when I expressed my feelings to them. That's the other side.

Re: Cheating ex

School auction
Guest May 16, 2:27 p.m.
QUESTION: Please don't complain if you aren't a regular enough volunteer to understand how mix-ups would happen. Auctions are f**k ton of work. Lots of times software malfunctions, someone writes a higher bid in the wrong place, bid numbers get mixed up, etc. Or people are monitoring a hot item and swoop at the very last second. Just drop it and be thankful unpaid volunteers raise money for your kid's school. Signed, a PTA president on her last month of indentured servitude.

Credit card fraud again
Guest May 17, 10:47 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn. I wrote in last week because my husband's best friend's wife took out a credit card in her husband's name, maxed it out, can't pay and asked my husband to loan her money. My husband knows he should tell his friend but can't get up the confrontational courage to tell his best friend his wife committed fraud and will ruin his credit. Now I'm in the hot seat because of my husband's reluctance to open a can of worms. Do I have the moral obligation to tell this poor guy the truth?

Elementary Teacher PLEADING with caregivers: A PSA
Guest May 17, 10:49 a.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,
Please let me advocate for caregivers to refrain from giving children phones until the end of middle school at the earliest.
I work in a small mid-westerrn town teaching 4th grade. Many of the students in my class have smart phones, smart watches, and unlimited access to the internet. On top of this, parents allow students to have phones whenever they want, so kids come to school having stayed up until after midnight on their phones (or gaming systems). One parent told me she couldn't control her 9 year olds phone usage because they have different phones, thus different operating systems! Others tell me the kids have phones so parents can have peace of mind of knowing where they are all time time (emotionally unhealthy for other reasons, but I have a soapbox for that too), in case the bus breaks down, in case they feel sick at school, in case we're on a field trip and something happens, etc. I realize there may be a very, very slight chance a child would need to get in touch with a parent because of an extreme situation at school, but even then there are overlapping systems in place to keep parents informed. Teachers spend precious hours in PD reviewing, updating, and practicing how to contact parents in many different scenarios.
Caregivers, please, please, please consider: the positive benefit of your child having a phone is so small compared to the negative impact of your child having this device on physical, social, emotional, and psychological well-being.
If you insist your child have a phone, please please, please consider the following: strict parental control through the device's system and through your authority as the parent; give your child an emergency only flip phone; set limits and enforce them.
Each year, the age of students with smart devices gets lower and lower. There are many research studies showing the negative influence these have on child development.

Thank you Carolyn for all the good work you do and for all the Nuts who contribute to making this chat a success.

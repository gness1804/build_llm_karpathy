Emotional turmoil
Guest Apr 11, 11:16 a.m.
QUESTION: How do I stop hiding things from my husband and my family? I walk around terrified all the time. I always think I have to handle everything myself, that I can never ask for help. But then I end up not dealing with things in the best way sometimes and I get in trouble. I am trying to fix everything, but I am drowning. I'm sick to my stomach all the time, I can't sleep, and I think about running away a lot. I'm so scared I can't breathe. And I don't know what to do. Everyone expects me to take care of everything all the time - my job supports everyone, I pay all the bills. I take care of everyone but no one takes care of me. I don't know how to break out of this circle of hell.

ANSWER: I'm going to give you this first: It's information for the Crisis Text Line, 741741. It's an immediate place to get help when you're terrified and thinking you can't ask for help. You can. It's right there.

Of a similar nature, if you want to talk, is the 988 Lifeline, though you can also text or chat with this service as well. Use it, please.

As I'm sure you understand on some level, what you're doing is not sustainable because it wouldn't be for anyone -- meaning, it's not your fault or your failure. People just can't carry everyone and everything indefinitely without support. But the thing is, the longer you put off getting help, the more help you will end up needing.

That's why I urge you please to interrupt this cycle asap. Use these free resources. Therapy is where all roads lead in your scenario, but that can be hard to find, arrange, pay for and make time for privately -- so here's a possible shortcut, also a free resource. Even better would be if your employer offers an EAP, which could get you some counseling sessions right away. Let the focus of these first couple of steps be very narrow, just on getting someone to help you take the bigger steps. Take care. Check back in too if you can, if it's not another burden to deal with.

Tired of being Google for my Husband
Guest Apr 11, 11:20 a.m.
QUESTION: Something snapped in me the other day when I realized my husband of 30 years tends to use me as Google instead of doing the research himself. "You want to hire this contractor, is there a better one?", "What are we going to go and what are we going to do on vacation?", "Where should we go to dinner?" and even better "what should I do after I retire?" On the one hand, I appreciate he is asking my opinion, on the other my opinions are most often then rejected out of hand or I am inundated with follow up questions about WHY I made a particular choice or know a particular fact with requests for followup reasoning. Maybe it's analysis paralysis, but I'd just like him to switch shoes and do some research and make a decision! How do I maintain my cool now that I bristle every time we have an exchange like this.

Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You keep your cool by recognizing that you both pitched into this dynamic for a long time without noticing either your contribution or what you were creating.

And you recognize that if he were the one who had the sudden snap of unpleasant recognition, not you, then you would feel awful if he went from being his normal self to bristling and losing his cool at you without explanation, when for all you knew everything was the same between you as it was yesterday.

I'm not saying you aren't right to be annoyed about some/many/most/all of the things that now annoy you. My point is separate from justification. It's about the fact of long relationships and, in your case, 30 years of slowly building something together. Even if you didn't take active part and just contributed passively with your consent.

If you're going to pivot, then say so, and say why. And the less irritated you can sound about it, the better -- again, because that's what you'd want if your husband were the one abruptly waking up to his unhappiness. Ideally you want to make this a joint project toward a better quality of life together.

Just to give you an idea of what I'm thinking: The nuisance behaviors of his that you describe could stem from habits both of you have developed over the years. If, for example, you've always done the research on X or Y for both of you, year after year by default, then his abilities in that area may have atrophied without either of you realizing it, and now you're tired of always having to research X and Y and he's a weird combination of helpless at it and annoyed he has no agency. Again, just a riff.

The answer is not to be annoyed with each other. It's to say, huh, we let this slide to a place neither of us seems to want, let's try to correct it.

Forgotten grandchildren’s birthday
Guest Apr 11, 11:32 a.m.
QUESTION: My mother in law is a sweet, quiet woman who has begun to have some memory issues. We live far from her and see her once or twice a year. For the last two years, she has forgotten my twin son’s birthdays (they are 10). My kids don’t need gifts but it makes me sad that they don’t even hear from her . I know if she realized she had forgotten she would be sad and embarrassed. Should I say anything to her? Or just let it lie?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Contact her before the birthday every year (and before every other milestone she would want to mark) to "help" her "figure out what they'd like." It's the kind thing for all involved.

If she has already missed it this year, then, sure, let it lie -- because you're the one who's sad, right? If the boys are sad, then put them in touch ... but regularly, not just for their birthdays, because, really, who cares about a birthday. The point is for them to have a relationship with their grandmother, isn't it?

I don't know. Seems to me the issue is not where's-the-once-a-year-contact-for-my-children-on-an-arbitrary-day, but how can I make sure this sweet, quiet woman who raised my spouse (now living far away from her) isn't completely detached from her child's family as she slips into memory loss?

If she is the one holding herself apart, then I'll merge safely back into my lane, but "sad and embarrassed" suggest she does care about staying in touch.

Why do some women only wear a wedding band?
Guest Apr 11, 11:44 a.m.
QUESTION: Women usually want a nice expensive ring, when someone proposes to them. I have noticed that after being married for a long time, some women only wear wedding bands? Do you have any idea why?

LW Somebody that I used to know
Guest Apr 11, 11:53 a.m.
QUESTION: Earlier this week you had a letter from somebody who, when she runs into her ex-fiance professionally pretends not to know him. The ex has called her out and wants her to knock it off. You do, too, and I think you were too harsh. Her little game of pretending never to have met him when a work acquaintance tries to introduce them is petty af and I am here for it! Not that long ago it was accepted etiquette that divorced people were considered permanently estranged and need not recognize or acknowledge one another if they met socially. It's taking it a bit far to pretend never to have met him, but it is less awkward for the person trying to be polite by introducing them than an icy "we've met" or God forbid the actual truth. Maybe it would be healthier for her to get beyond it, but in the meantime her behavior is merely annoying to the ex (to whom she owes nothing) and neither impolite not truly hurtful. Hurtful is leaving someone at the altar and then expecting them to be okay with it.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I agree with you on one point -- that the LW's charade is "not truly hurtful." Certainly not on the level of walking away from an engagement.

But that's it.

Because I maintain that, while doing so clearly causes pain, walking away from an engagement is the right and brave thing to do if the idea of going through with marriage doesn't feel right. Because that half-hearted, "It would hurt her too much not to follow through" marriage will cause so much more pain over time. So I will not jump on any bandwagon to vilify someone who pulls the plug on an engagement.

Ideally people will face down their conflicted feelings sooner rather than right at the edge of the aisle runner. But even leaving someone at the literal altar is better than going through with a wedding with doubts.

So I'm supposed to cheer on a, what, decade-long campaign of pettiness because it supposedly gives a guy what he richly deserves? No. No no no. It perpetuates that whole terrible "he's the villain" mind set that actually pressures some couples to go through with marriages they really shouldn't.

I wish LW hadn't been hurt. I wish for LW's sake that the fiance, as I said, had come to terms with his doubts way sooner. But that's not how things always play out, and sometimes things end messy.

When they do, our best response is to have the tears and/or the fury and/or the dissection of recent history to see what signs we may have missed that this was coming, then square up and say to ourselves, "You know what? I wish it hadn't ended messy but thank the merciful dogs it ended before we got married." Then regroup, then rebuild, then say when you see your ex at a business conference, ice-free!, "Yes, we've met. You're looking well." Because you can say that, because you've recovered -- or at least you grasp that sounding as if you've recovered seamlessly is really, if this is what we're doing here, the pettiest play of them all.

I need a reality check....

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Did you miss every teen movie and book ever? And your own 12-17-ish?

Sorry, I still have some adolescent in me I guess.

People that age are a roiling mess of self-doubt and feelings and huge new thoughts and they take it out hardest on the ones they trust most to love them through anything and not abandon them. So, you. Plus you annoy them so much you make their cells vibrate with annoyance when you're within two rooms of them. It's not personal.

And it's not only not just you, it's pretty much everyone in your spot at some point.

Be present but not up in their business unless you have to. Be open to talking when the need to talk strikes them, even if it's midnight. The better you are at not taking it personally, the better you will be at the availability part. Getting defensive tends to escalate things needlessly. Last unsolicited thing, "don't take it personally" is not the same thing as being a doormat. Good luck!

Re: tired of being google
Guest Apr 11, 12:08 p.m.
QUESTION: Just something to consider. My ex-husband and I had a similar dynamic. At one point we did have a conversation in which he pointed out that I tend to be controlling and often dismissive of his ideas. It was a real eye opener for me as I could, in hindsight, see this behavior in myself. He also had a tendency to not speak up for himself. The combination resulted in a lot of hurt feelings. Once we examined the dynamic it was easier for me to spot when I was being dismissive and I could stop myself, or at least apologize and be a better listener.

ANSWER: Great stuff, thank you. It's so hard to do a self-inventory like this.

I appreciate the example, too, because it's easy to see how this could develop into a lopsided situation over the years without either of you realizing it, like in the OP's case. Years of dismissing his ideas in favor of yours turns into his not offering any ideas at all anymore, and you're doing everything, and ... there you go.

Took guts for both of you to be honest.

QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, I was let go from my dream job at NIH as part of the so-called April Fool's Massacre. I loved our mission, my projects, and my colleagues. Now all that has been torn away and I'm on the outside, looking in. My friends have been amazing, so supportive it just blows me away. My family, not so much. (MAGA really is a cult.) But I have a lot to be grateful for, including severance pay, which I realize those in private industry don't always get. What I'm struggling with is just how passive I've been. I always thought when I reached retirement or otherwise had a block of free time I would do amazing things with it. Instead, I pretty much just... Sleep. And time is ticking by, along with my life. I'm already on medication and working with a counselor for depression and anxiety. How do I get out of this funk and do something instead of just stagnating and wasting the time I do have to try to find work or at least do all those projects I'd dreamed of? Obviously my job was just an excuse before. I have no motivation or ambition. Advice and strategies welcome! Thank you for your light during this dark time for our country.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: First, I am so sorry this is the way your country thanked you for your work. Even if this were about saving taxpayers money, which it never seemed to be, since there were such obviously better ways to do it, and even if it were actually saving taxpayers money, which it pretty glaringly is not, this is just a despicable and inhumane way to go about it and I am horrified it is being done in my name as a taxpayer. Rage.

Second: Whoa, slow down. Barely a week so far is "ticking by" since this all went down. You went through a wringer of uncertainty for months before that, no? Then very abruptly showed up to your new reality. Meanwhile, people who retire or just leave a job with agency (!) and the usual preparation time typically find themselves sleeping a lot and drifting in that big open sea of unstructured days.

So, please be kinder to yourself and more forgiving. Allow yourself some extra sleep. Let the work with the counselor unfold. Let your dreams reconstitute.

The one thing I will say is not to allow yourself too much extra sleep, because that can be a trap. It's a depression accelerator.

And I will also suggest that you spend some of this recovery time outside, walking, if you're able. It can be a surprisingly therapeutic but still unstructured use of your newly free time. Plus if you live near the NIH mothership then you're in the peak moment of earth's renewal, which is a well-timed bit of counterprogramming.

15 year old LW with college and career plans???
Guest Apr 11, 12:24 p.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn, the LW this week who is a 15-year old planing on being a vet and going to college in the UK… left me with my jaw on the floor as the parent of 14-year old twins. Are 15 year olds planning their college years already? Do they really know (like actually) what they want to be “when they grow up” with such specificity? My kids are pretty good students, play sports, hang with their friends… and could not tell you what they want to do as a career or even name a college (unless it’s sports related). Am I way behind all the other parents and their ambitious kids in getting mine focused on college and career in their early teens?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ack, no, please don't take that message way from the column!!

A couple of things to keep in mind. First, the obvious, but reminders never hurt: People have their own developmental pace.

That means some 15-year-olds are thinking college and do have a career goal taking shape. And good for them! That doesn't mean there's something wrong with other kids that age who haven't progressed to that point. (I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life till I was 30.)

What is wrong is when kids push themselves to have it all figured out by X point because they think they're supposed to, and burn their best exploration years checking boxes for the college-admissions chase and/or for a major and career path they think will have a high ROI. What a waste. Worse is when their parents push it on them.

The best thing you can do in this situation is love your kids and give them room to figure it out. If one or both of them catches onto a passion or ambition, then, great -- follow their lead in feeding it. If neither does, then instead of panicking, be grateful for how long that keeps the window of wider exploration open. Both outcomes have their advantages.

It's important not to get sucked into the zero-sum thinking -- that because there are kids like this one, your kids will get squeezed out. There are places for all the kids who want educations.

Re: Forgetful Grandma
Guest Apr 11, 12:26 p.m.
QUESTION: Also, you can facilitate your kids reaching out to their grandmother on their birthday, too. It was not until I became a mother myself that I fully realized that my birthday was actually pretty big day for my mom. (I mean, she did a lot of work that day and I don’t even remember it!) So if grandma forgets to call, go ahead and call her! Be warm and wonderful and do a video call if she can work that technology - “Hi Nana! It’s Sally’s birthday and we wanted to give you a call to say we love you on this special day!” No reason to put the pressure on your MIL in cognitive decline to do something that can easily do with the same result.

What women "usually want"
Guest Apr 11, 12:29 p.m.
QUESTION: I'm sure there are many women who want a nice expensive engagement ring. But among my cohort, I don't know a single such woman. When they got engaged, they wanted a ring that felt meaningful, whether it was their fiance's mother's ring, or a non-diamond ring from an antique store, or a diamond ring they chose together that suited their style and budget. There is no "women usually want." There is only what individual women want.

Wanting an expensive ring and wearing it
Guest Apr 11, 12:30 p.m.
QUESTION: Hm, if you're wondering why you bought an expensive ring that isn't getting worn, then ask your person. If it's anyone else, not your business.
I almost never wear my INexpensive engagement ring, that I helped shop for because 1) not a huge jewelry person 2) it's not attached to my wedding band and that's awkward but if it were attached 3) it would catch on things, get dirtier and be harder to clean, etc.
4) sometimes I don't feel like wearing my band, either.
BUT you made a number of assumptions, too. 1) that folks want expensive rings AND asked for them 2) that they even HAVE an engagement ring.
Again, check your assumptions with the only person who matters here- yours.

Mad at friend; who's at fault?
Guest Apr 11, 12:40 p.m.
QUESTION: (online only) Hi. I asked a friend to put me in touch with her adult child for a personal project I'm excited about. She said child is busy. I said "Four minutes, literally. Any of these days/eves/weekend days. People tell me they're happy to share a sentence or two." She just stared and said nothing at all when I asked her to let me know, and we haven't spoken in a week.
She probably thinks I was pushy. Maybe. She knows her child could add something helpful, but if she didn't want to pass along the message, she could have said she didn't want to be a go-between. Fair enough. Instead she clammed up and never responded, which I see as rude. And dropping the rope of conversation is a hostile act. Can I get your perspective?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm going with: both. But mostly you. There's no "maybe," you were pushy AF. You knew it was a hint and you didn't take it because you wanted what you wanted when you wanted it. "People tell me they're happy to share a sentence or two"!?

Yes, you were excited, and she could have said, "I'd prefer not to be a go-between." That would have been preferable to going silent on you, for sure. But she ended up there because oh wow you pushed. So apologize to her for pushing. (And don't expect anything in return, because an apology just to get one back isn't an apology.)

Forgotten birthday
Guest Apr 11, 12:46 p.m.
QUESTION: Good advice regarding advance reminder. But if this is a woman who always remembered without fail, then take it as a warning sign that things will degrade from here. Take it from someone who has gone through this with two beloved family members within the last couple of years. Assuming this relationship is important, not just to your kids, but to you and your husband, make more time for it. Increase contact, increase visits. Make memories while you can.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I don't think there's an "if." There are signs of memory loss, so that is the warning sign that things will degrade from here. Unless the spouse intends to have zero involvement in the mother's future life and care plans (which would be pretty unusual), this couple needs to look down that road now and start preparing.

Snide sister
Guest Apr 11, 1:09 p.m.
QUESTION: Today's question about the snide sister constantly putting down her brother really hit home for me. We have a sibling like this in our family. Sibling was clearly one parent's favorite and got far more than the rest of us not only emotionally but materially. When parent did this, parent would rub it in our faces and then demand to know why we weren't happier for sib. It felt like emotional waterboarding.

Sib also feels that need to share harsh and unkind observations, and is accustomed to having the rest of us 'be the bigger person,' or 'let it go, as we were brought up to do. After getting counseling (thank you, couple of excellent therapists) I've gotten better at calling it out. Your 'wow,' and 'that was a really hurtful thing to say' help too.

A couple of years ago, though, sib accused me of something that was not only unkind but also blatantly untrue. Sib had all the evidence to know this was not true but still accused me of going behind their back and plotting to hurt them. I was deeply hurt and massively offended that sib would think I was capable of any of this, let alone fabricate that I'd actually done it.

Sib, when asked to consider the facts, provided an 'I'm sorry if I hurt you' cursory apology followed by a lot of explanation that they were under stress, so I couldn't hold it against them. Sib then whined extensively to favoring parent that I wasn't behaving warmly towards them and parent tried to extract a promise that I'd work things out with Sib. I declined to make the promise, A year ago favoring parent died.

Sib now apparently wants to have a relationship with me but says 'I don't ever want to talk about the past.' I just can't do it on those terms. I think I've forgiven sib--I understand that all the favoritism very much set them up to feel they were never wrong, and much of my anger is at parent. But I also believe forgiveness is one thing but walking back up to the person and saying 'thank you sir, please sir may I have another,' is an entirely different matter.

My rational mind knows it's fine if I believe I also have a say in any terms of reconciliation, but I can't quite get past the suspicion that I'm being horrifically unfair and unforgiving. How do I let go of the idea that it's on me to make this right when I have zero trust or affection left?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You sound remarkably clear-headed about it all, so I don't have much to add.

A few things. First, this seems right, that "all the favoritism very much set them up to feel they were never wrong"; it's been a long-running theme here that favoritism stunts the favorites. Still, some do recover, even to the point of apologizing to the unfavored siblings -- so your sib is not without agency here. You need to hold your healthy boundaries for your own reasons, but it would be a nice side benefit if smacking into them delivered a clue to your sibling.

Second, your rational mind has it right: You have a say in any terms of reconciliation. Period. "I'd be open to the possibility of a relationship, but honest discussion of the past is the only way forward for me. Let me know if you change your mind."

Third, your last sentence is the emotional garble from all the years of cluckery, so just ignore it. Here:

It's on me to make this right but I have zero trust or affection left.

It's not about responsibility or trust or affection. It's just about your sib's offer: You aren't okay with the terms. For reasons. So, you decline it, and propose the terms you would accept. Your sib is free to accept them or decline them. That's why it's really really okay to strip it down to that, without guilt.

Finding a therapist?
Guest Apr 11, 1:27 p.m.
QUESTION: I may or may not need a therapist to help me with a medium level of anxiety. How do I know when it's time to find one? And how do I find one that can ehlp me with my specific issues? p.s. Love the Nedster!
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm going to send you here, to my Resources page, to save me some typing on finding someone. You ask about the specific issue once you've identified a possible provider, though many list their specialites in their bios.

As for when "it's time," to me the answer is, when you're asking whether it's time. Might as well go. It takes some time to set up anyway, so better to go now than when you're in full blown crisis -- and, why not take steps to feel better sooner? "My head hurts, but i'll see if I can wait till tomorrow to take an ibuprofin."

When people don't have access to counseling, that might be the option they're stuck with -- knuckle through it till they can get help. But if help is available to you, then accept it.

Nedster says ❤️. (Did you know he's anti-knitting? It's peaceful resistance, but still.)

Judgmental family
Guest Apr 11, 1:38 p.m.
QUESTION: My daughter is getting married soon and my very judgmental family has me on edge. I am helping her with planning details etc and I find myself only looking through the lens of “what will they think “ - how can I stop worrying about their opinions which will inevitably be snarky and snotty and focus on my daughter’s happiness instead ?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: People whose opinions will "inevitably be snarky and snotty" are rude. Don't plan your daughter's joyful event around rude people.

Do you have to invite them? Seriously. That might be the ultimate wedding gift to your daughter, to show her she doesn't have to sell out her joy to unkind people just because they're related.

If for some reason you decide that's harder than it's worth, then, Plan B, do you have a good friend to help you through this? Someone fun who will actually enjoy ... shopping for rental tablecloths, and can remind you at key points that if these relatives snark at your plans then you're doing something right?

It can't be your daughter, you want to "dump out" here. A place to de-stress, have some giggles.

You do know, I hope, this decoupling from people's opinions of what you do is a bigger project than this one wedding? I mean, who gives an everloving floof what the shriek chorus thinks. The how-to-start-therapy link isn't just for anxiety, it's also for people who've been emotionally ground down to the point where they think they have to pass everyone else's tests.

Re OP recently let go from the NIH

QUESTION: First, my true condolences. I spent 5 years early in my career a5 the NIH and leaving abruptly has to be a huge blow. Second, recently retired involuntarily last summer, after 3 weeks of a trip down the coast to “just do something fun” I started and continue to begin every day by doing something, anything, productive. I built raised garden beds, played tennis, got on my bike and more. Just something to start everyday on the plus side. Right now, I have been lying on the couch in the rain, just enjoying things that I couldn’t have when working every day. Good luck

QUESTION: Excessive sleep is also a symptom (not just a cause) of depression. It's totally understandable that you'd be dealing with such a symptom, having just been fired from your dream job by people who don't even understand its importance. You are doing all the right things. Please give yourself some grace. I can't imagine what you are going through.

QUESTION: This part of CH answer made me howl: Plus you annoy them so much you make their cells vibrate with annoyance when you're within two rooms of them But the payoff, is when they get to their 20's and they acknowledge how unbelievably annoying THEY were to us parents! I will never forget my youngest son sitting me down and saying "Mom, thanks for never giving up on me, no matter how much of a jackass I was to you"

ANSWER: Aw, yay youngest son.

This is my chance to say again that it is necessary for them to differentiate, to push off from parents so they can see who they are without their parents hovering over them. That wave of annoyance they feel for their adults is really effective and important. Their secrets are important, too. It just gets white-knuckley for parents as they hope it all stays reasonably under control ... as they resist the impulse to dive in to try to control it. Which usually makes things worse. Good times.

QUESTION: I’m so sorry for what you are going through! Please be kind to yourself. Many of us who haven’t even been as directly affected as you by this administration's cruelty and chaos are struggling. Furthermore, I remember what it was like for me when I retired from federal service two years ago. I planned for it; I was excited by leaving; I had a new, part-time endeavor to step into; yet I felt incredibly depressed for about 2 weeks. All that emotion and a big change was just incredibly draining. Your situation is way more jarring.

So, please heed Carolyn’s advice and get outside every day. Find one other small thing to take care of each day - clean out a closet; contact a friend (and/or other colleagues who are in a similar situation); look into volunteer opportunities; research opportunities for classes; harness those emotions in ways to help protect others - whatever. Allow yourself time to grieve, heal, recover, but don’t give up on yourself or what your new life could be. Hugs and good luck.

About sleeping too much
Guest Apr 11, 2:08 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,

Just had a question about your response where you said sleeping too much can be a depression accelerator. Can you say more about this? I have struggled with depression for years, and when it is bad I am just exhausted all the time and can barely function without sleeping in or taking naps. Without the extra sleep, how are you supposed to get through it?

ANSWER: I am going to refer you to a licensed health professional, which I am not. The caution not to sleep beyond a typical night's sleep is passed along from best practices I discussed with a doctor recently, in the specific context of things people with depression can do outside of medical treatment to ease their depression symptoms and boost the effectiveness of their treatment.

So -- medical treatment would be things like medication and therapy.

These other things included regular exercise; social interaction; attention to nutrition; regular, short (ie not overwhelming), structured attention to keeping spaces clean and uncluttered (e.g. 2 x 15 minutes a day on clearing workspace, doing laundry, basic management); connection with purposeful activities. That last one is a broad category, but covers hobbies, causes, arts, music, etc. Among these was a regular sleep schedule; sleeping in and napping were considered disruptive to the overnight sleep schedule, which contributed to nighttime restlessness and anxiety, daytime grogginess, sense of sluggishness and futility.

Again -- your care plan is personal and that's why the medical consult is your advice.

I spelled out my backing info for context. I also want to say these non-medical things are not depression cures or treatments -- there's often a conflation problem when careful life management is helpful. If anyone tries to use any of what I'm saying here as a justification not to treat depression as an illness or not to go to a doctor, or to yell at me for implying that people can exercise their depression away, or that they can't! then allow me to state here these are all willful misreadings of my point. Not cool. Thank you.

QUESTION: Structure is your friend (now and always) and when you lost your job your structure went away. I 100% agree with Carolyn that you need to be patient with yourself and keep expectations reasonable. BUT you can also use structure to help manage this. Plan lunch dates with friends, or even better, walking dates. Set small goals that are low expectation - read a book, watch a movie, or listen to music rather than get lost online. Commit to a yoga class once a week. Figure out what time of day is most productive and do an hour's worth of chores, then let the rest of the day go. Make a checklist of those chores and check off one per day. Give yourself several months of not doing anything bigger than managing your time (you can even set an end date on the calendar) and then let yourself just observe what it all feels like. This is HARD work, so be kind to yourself!

"dropping the rope of conversation is a hostile act"
Guest Apr 11, 2:10 p.m.
QUESTION: Jesus, no. You are not owed endless responses from people who already replied "no" the first time and you deliberately ignored them. Haranguing someone is a hostile act, and ending engagement with the person doing that is the appropriate response.

I really hope this "personal project" is ending cancer or something, because otherwise you've gone totally over the line.

QUESTION: Taking time absorb what happened and to let things settle is not wasted. In fact, it's essential. We feel that we always need to be pushing and productive or its selfish. Not only do our bodies need down time, so do our mind and our emotions. We show up better and make better decisions when we give ourselves time to slow down and pause.

Petty Ex Left at Alter
Guest Apr 11, 2:32 p.m.
QUESTION: I feel you, Carolyn. But like this person, I suck at moving forward once someone has burned me. It’s much more natural (for me) to hold a grudge and ice people out. I don’t like this quality about myself and wish I could be more forgiving or understanding or whatever the quality is you’re channeling. How do I develop it?

ANSWER: It's right there in the framing -- "burned me."

It's great that you want to develop a more forgiving and understanding mind set. The quickest path is to familiarize yourself with the "fundamental attibution error." Here's one explanation that seems to cover it, but you can plop it in your browser and read a lot more. It's basically the rationale for getting out of the victim mind set and applying the "we're all just people trying to get by" framework to other people's choices. It's quite freeing. It's nice not to think everyone is a jerk, attacking us, making us carry yet another grudge.

And it takes some practice. If your mental pathway goes right to grrr, then you'll need the mental override to, "Wait, I break up with people sometimes, and I'm not 'burning' them when I do that and I don't deserve to be iced out as if I don't exist." Or, when you get cut off in traffic, say -- instead of getting enraged, remind yourself of the handful of times you did something rude witout realizing it because you didn't understand the merge pattern or you didn't see that car in your blind spot, really! If you keep doing that, then it becomes reflex (except maybe when you're hangry and frazzled and the old reflex breaks through).

Some people will be actual jerks, sure, and acting with malice. It's not all fields of daisies.

Dropping the rope of conversation

QUESTION: "Dropping the rope of conversation is a hostile act" ain't necessarily true. Sometimes it's a healthy last resort when the other person refuses to listen or respect boundaries.

Re: concerned about 15 year old letter writer with college plan
Guest Apr 11, 2:38 p.m.
QUESTION: This parent’s concerns about kids being on track hit me. My son (2 years ahead of his sister) had no idea what he wanted to do for many years. His sister knew from age 10. But they both ended up on long tracks to get through their late teen years. My daughter was ill and lost two years of school. My son developed issues with alcohol / marijuana dependence. We were fortunate that both recovered. They both went to community college, then transferred to 4-yr universities and finished grad school at age 27. And, yes, she did end up studying the field she picked as a 10 year old.

This wasn’t our dream path for them. We were very tied up in helping them achieve our idea of success, until life happened and they did it on their schedule. With our support, and without us comparing them to where they “should” be.

As an aside, my son lost a brilliant friend to a fentanyl overdose and another in a car accident where my son was a passenger in another seat of the vehicle.

I completely agree with Carolyn’s response. Love your kids with your whole heart and give them space and support they need to find their way in the world.

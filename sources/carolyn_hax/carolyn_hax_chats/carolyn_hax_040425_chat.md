A promise is a promise
Guest Apr 4, 11:05 a.m.
QUESTION: When my wife and I were dating, I told her I'd only wanted to have kids if they didn't consume my whole life and I was able to still do things that are important to me like go to the gym before work. My now-wife promised I'd be able to maintain my morning gym workouts. We have an 18mo and an infant. My wife is complaining that my days are too long. They are long. My routine includes leaving the house to get coffee, check email, workout and then work. I get back in time to kiss my 18mo before bed and then spend the rest of the night cleaning up the house and packing for the next day. My wife is complaining she is exhausted with two kids all week and needs some help. In a few months, she is returning to work for the first time since we've had kids and pushing for change from me. I'm feeling cheated and angry. How can I get her to understand that she promised and a promise is a promise is a promise?

ANSWER: Yep, a promise is a promise.

You are you and you have your needs and you foresaw them, I do get that. But a reality like this -- how much work kids will require -- is not 100 percent foreseeable. So to enforce it as if it is, at the expense of your wife and kids, is pretty spectacularly selfish and crappy.

So. What are you ready to say about yourself, your child, your wife, your priorities and the variables of life in defending the territory you staked out with this promise?

Do you think your wife agreed to this in bad faith -- i.e., knew full well it was unrealistic to add two kids to your life without making any changes to your schedule, but expected you would change, because who doesn't change to spend more time with his kids?

If that's the case, then you need to say that to her: "I believe you entered our original promise knowing I would have to give up things that were important to me eventually, and figuring I would eventually do so willingly. And I am struggling with that right now."

Or, alternately -- if you don't think it was bad faith, just bad foresight: then you need to be willing to hire out some help to make space for the things you value, instead of expecting your wife to absorb all the extra work displaced by maintaining your routine. Or just pick your priorities and let some other things go.

Because, damn.

Don't want to give them the satisfaction
Guest Apr 4, 11:21 a.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn—

My husband and I tried for two years to conceive naturally, got nowhere, and through counseling finally learned that IVF would be our best recourse. It is not covered by our insurance, and we are not wealthy. However, my parents are affluent and comfortably retired, with low overhead and grown children who are all living independently. So I swallowed my pride and asked whether they would be willing to contribute to the out-of-pocket costs of 1-2 IVF cycles. They took months to get back to me (meanwhile remaining completely warm and chatty on unrelated topics!) and then finally said that they had decided against it, partly because they don't want to lose their financial security—but mostly because they "don't understand" IVF, feel that it's a little bit "unnatural," and vaguely believe that God would give us a baby if it were meant to be.

The hurt and disappointment I felt is hard to express here. I don't feel entitled to their money, but they have helped me and my siblings pay for other things they approved of (college, weddings, expensive grandparent gifts for my nephew).

My husband and I wound up saving aggressively for the next two years and funded our own IVF. We were successful on the first cycle and I'm 18 weeks pregnant. We have shared the news with our family and my parents are jubilant, which really irks me. My mom texts or calls every day to ask about the pregnancy and to squeal about how excited she is to have another grandchild. But I feel that she actively stood in the way of this happening or at least let us twist in the wind, and I don't want to share my joy with them. How do I forgive, without letting them have the satisfaction?

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Are you up for a conversation?: "Mom, you turned down our request for financial help -- which of course was your prerogative -- saying you felt IVF was unnatural and that 'God would give us a baby if it were meant to be.' But now that we conceived through IVF with our own money, you're jubilant without any qualms. I hope you can understand why I'm having mixed feelings about your response."

Think about it. It's a fair complaint, for one. Plus, leaving it to harden into a grudge denies the whole family a chance to get past it.

But think about it -- see if time does anything to move you past it naturally. For example, if you start to see this reflects who your parents have always been, committed to their way of seeing things whether there's any integrity to it or not.

Pets
Guest Apr 4, 11:38 a.m.
QUESTION: My husband and I are missing our elderly cats who both crossed The rainbow bridge last December. We are elderly as well and wonder whether we should just enjoy our kids’ cats and dogs from time to time. Ever since my husband developed mobility problems the litter box task was mine and was somewhat overwhelming as the cats developed issues associated with aging. Also we don’t have a fenced yard to accommodate a dog—yet! Just looking for advice about 75 year olds adding a pet to our family because we miss their company every day!
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Since I am not there to assess the situation, I can only advise that you bring 100 percent pragmatism and foresight to assessing the situation yourself to counteract any wishful thinking. Wishful thinking can be harmful to animals especially, since they are so vulnerable, but also to the humans who care for them.

Lots of things to consider, but first I wonder if your husband is still ambulatory. Someone with difficulty walking + a pet may = an increased risk of falls.

Second, because you already mentioned overwhelm with prior pet care, I would say the minimum would be to have backup care in place before taking on a pet. By that I mean both daily drop-ins from a paid dogwalker/catsitter (great job for a reliable neighborhood kid) and a backup place for the pet to go in the event the animal needs a new home.

Third, think cat, not dog, unless you're sure you can meet the exercise and socialization needs of a dog.

Possible fourth point, if you have a person in your life (adult child, neighbor, other quasi-caregiver) to whom the care of or responsibility for this animal might devolve, then talk to that person, too, as a courtesy.

Of course the easy answer is not to do it, for all the reasons, but animal companionship is so rewarding that it is worth considering if you can pre-answer all of these questions and issues -- especially if you can afford to.

Letting go of my brother due to politics
Guest Apr 4, 11:45 a.m.
QUESTION: Is it common nowadays to completely end a relationship with an only sibling? He is 70 and I’m 65. He became more and more combative in our weekly phone conversations. (We live in different states so we only have phone visits.) I feel a little sad, but I think it’s healthier for me.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Things don't have to be permanent. The conversations are too combative, so you send the message that you won't continue to take part in them on these terms. You do that by taking a break and saying why.

You can check in again in, say, a month to see if pulling back was effective. If he brings up the same stuff and gets combative again, then you remind him you're not interested in this experience with him, you're hanging up now, you'll try again in a bit.

Repeat, once a month, see what happens. If you feel you can be healthy as you maintain this schedule, then keep at it. See if he can shift to other topics with you. If it's still too much, then try 6 weeks, then 2 months. Etc.

The "completely end" may happen, but there can be a lot of interim steps before you get there, if you want there to be. That's what I'm saying.

Divorce
Guest Apr 4, 11:51 a.m.
QUESTION: I was married for 40 years and just filed for divorce. I was expecting to feel relief, but am just feeling sad even though I think it was the right decision. Also, a little fearful of the future. Any advice or input from anyone who has been there
And how to move forward.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: This is definitely one of those YMMV situations, but I think this part is pretty common -- that when you have been in a certain place or status for a long time, the first days of Something Else have an element of fear to them. It's just hard to envision what the new thing will be. It's kind of a big gray blank. And when we can't envision things, there's a sense of low level animal panic. In my experience at least.

The best advice I have for that is to take deep breaths and trust yourself and get through the days the best you can -- making good decisions for yourself, being your best advocate. Because the other thing that's more than common, probably universal, is that we are built to adapt. You will get used to this as your normal, and before you know it your ability to envision a future will come back to you.

Re A promise is a promise
Guest Apr 4, 11:52 a.m.
QUESTION: Man, I was SMDH through the entire question. What you asked for, per you: going to the gym before work. What you're doing: running out of the house first thing for coffee elsewhere where you sit and quietly read email, then go work out, then go straight to work and then home? Those are not the same requests. If I were your wife, I'd be mightily upset at you, too. Can you maintain your gym workouts by then coming home afterward? Make coffee at home and take it with you to the gym so free up a little time? There are ways you can make more space for your family but failing to compromise, or believing that your children are somehow a scheduling bait-and-switch on your wife's part, is a selfish viewpoint.

Nosy or helpful neighbor
Guest Apr 4, 12:20 p.m.
QUESTION: Our neighbor’s trash can was knocked over by wildlife a few days ago. They picked up the can but left a large mound of trash in the alley (I walk by this every day). Would I be a helpful neighbor if I picked up their trash (wearing gloves)? Or a nosy neighbor because I can see that the trash includes empty prescription bottles and other personal items? (The trash is technically in the public right-of-way in the alley. Not on their property). I don’t know them. What is the “I want to be a good person” thing to do?

Neighbors

QUESTION: I had a falling out with my neighbors gradually over political issues, hey, ain't that America, something to see.

Nothing got through until yesterday, out of nowhere, when the 10,000th something stupid cost them some money so they now feel lied to and apologized and is it too wrong if I just think it's already too late?

We're all having to find out from their {redacted} around and it's just beginning .

I guess I'm supposed to think better late than never, I'm just not there yet. What a dumb, dumb world we chose here.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I can't argue with much here, nice touch of John Mellencamp.

A couple of things before I make a huge ask. First, well, maybe it's the only thing? The money hit to people like your neighbors is getting the big attention, but the flouting of due process is what I wish had been the universal Find Out from the "{redacted} around." People getting grabbed off the street by unmarked, sometimes masked law enforcement, spirited off and locked up (do I need to specify inhumanely?) only on the administration's say-so, without their presenting any case/evidence before a judge: That is the death of freedom for everyone. Especially when the judge says "You can't do that" and they don't turn the planes around. That means anyone, literally anyone, can become the next person they decide doesn't have rights because the administration welp just doesn't like what they said. We are kidding ourselves if we think people who smirk about acting with impunity toward Group A will suddenly color within the lines with their treatment of Group B. If one set of papers doesn't matter, then no one's papers matter. This is the 2 + 2 of the past few weeks. A couple of links:

Are you freaking kidding me.

Robin Givhan has a roundup here.

But I could post 20 if I had time.

Okay, here's my ask. I'm going to zero in on your "yet." Take your time and do some breathing or pillow-punching or whatever it takes, but: There can't be a "too late."

There just can't.

Anyone who "now feel[s] lied to and apologize[s]" needs to hear, "Apology accepted, thank you, welcome." That's because the cruelty is killing people, and we need a way out of the cruelty, and that means making it as easy as possibly -- appealing even -- for people to walk away from it. Which means not punishing anyone with the courage to regret voting for it.

re Neighbor Garbage
Guest Apr 4, 12:38 p.m.
QUESTION: 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 For the person who just wants to clean up the trash left by a neighbor in the common area. In our neighborhood, issues like this become such a huge issue that causes arguments, strife, and tension. I have neighbors who patrol the neighborhood and take photos and knock on doors to complain about so many small things. It makes this terrible place to live. I so appreciate your offer to extend some grace and just clean it up and move on. You don’t know what’s happening with those people - maybe this is the worst week of their lives and the garbage is super low on the to-do list. If it becomes an ongoing issue, then it makes sense to say something politely. But huge kudos to you for not making federal case out of this.

Re Promise
Guest Apr 4, 12:48 p.m.
QUESTION: As a family lawyer, when I hear someone casually complaining in this way, I sometimes share what a judge would think of their complaint during a divorce proceeding. And I can assure you that this “promise” has absolutely no validity. Zero. You have not a single leg to stand on, are being ridiculous, and you would get laughed out of any court in the nation. You are a grown man who fathered not one, but two children. Those children are your legal responsibility. You cannot claim that you were tricked into having these children. You cannot shirk your duty to your children because you want to go to the gym instead. You can choose to be a good or bad father, but you don’t get to choose not to be a father at this point. You either make this work with your wife and keep your family together. Or your wife will come to her senses and hire someone like me who will make you take responsibility in a court of law - with your time and/or money.

ANSWER: This is a satisfying read, thank you. But it still leaves me so sad for the kids whose dad is just so angry they exist as an obstacle to his old routine.

So, OP. Were you loved as a child? Do you know how that felt?

If you do know, then please, move heaven and earth to give your babies that same feeling. Make sure they never doubt they're loved and have that certainty to keep them warm into adulthood, even on their worst days.

If you don't know, then please move heaven and earth to make sure they don't grow up wondering, as you did, how different their lives could have been if they had been loved.

I think this is a fair offer.

For the person who can't forgive
Guest Apr 4, 12:53 p.m.
QUESTION: I'd echo Carolyn's sentiment about generosity to someone who voted for the current administration and is now regretting it. In the current polarized atmosphere, it takes A LOT of guts for someone to say out loud that they are sorry and they regretted it. This person didn't just think it- they found you and told you. I fully appreciate all the feelings your having now, and I'm sure I'd have the same ones, but at least recognize that they didn't have to say anything at all- they seem to be intentionally trying to repair and that, if nothing else, should be encouraged.

Gruge holding husband
Guest Apr 4, 1:10 p.m.
QUESTION: My husband (73) can hold a grudge longer than anyone I know. He will never just let things go. It become a problem when I try to convince him to forgive and forget and he takes that as my siding with the offender and a huge fight will ensue. Who needs counseling, him or me? (he has refused BTW)
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Well, then what's the point of my saying he's the one who "needs" it?

If you want things to change between you, then apparently you're the one who will have to make the changes. Therapy can be one of those changes. Go and have some good talks. Another change can be a decision not to "try" anymore to "convince him to forgive and forget." If he wants to stew in his old resentments, then let him. You can live your life breathing the clean air of forgiveness.

If he's trying to, for example, keep you from seeing friends because they're on his grudge list, then that's something else -- but you do have agency, right? You don't need him to give you permission?

Or is that the real issue, he uses his resentments to limit what the two of you do as a couple. If so, that's more than just grudge-holding. That's control, and another point in favor of your talking to a therapist yourself.

Re: IVF
Guest Apr 4, 1:35 p.m.
QUESTION: My mom did the same thing except it was about my husband. She didn't think I should marry him, and she hated our wedding choices, but you'd never know it now. For the last 15 years, my mom sings my husband's praises and goes on and on about how our wedding was the best wedding she'd ever been to. Both of us saw my mom for what she was doing: backtracking after she saw things were going to work out and she was terrified about not being able to see her daughter and grandchildren. She was right! My mom has never apologized or explained herself, not that it would matter if she did, even though I asked her. I can't forgive her. Give your parents a chance to explain themselves, but don't wait until the baby is born. Don't push yourself to get past it either. If you can't, you can't. No one would blame you for not letting them see your child.

ANSWER: Whoa, wait a minute: "not that it would matter if she did"? Really?

I can see being skeptical of the just-backtracking-for-fear-I'll-never-see-my-grandchildren non-apology-apology.

But a genuine apology, to my mind, deserves to matter. If not always, then darn close to it.

Even over something stupid and bad-faith like hating your wedding choices, which is pretty much the surest way to squander a lot of parental goodwill for zero potential return. (Objections to a choice of spouse are more complicated -- still not a great idea, but heartfelt concern is at least in play there.)

Idunno. You asked her, so maybe you think this too, and you're just really (deservedly) angry?

I'm sorry she's too small a person to admit fault. Sounds like all her praise gushing is the best her ego can do.

ANSWER: Well, if you put it that way. But that's not the either-or. It's either the parents get on board with it when the couple are asking for needed financial support, or the parents say, when the couple conceive via IVF after two years of scraping their pennies together: "Oh, we get it now, assisted or un-, a pregnancy is joyous news of a coming grandbaby. I'm sorry we balked at helping you with IVF" ... and ideally will, say, help with other expenses, or open a college account for the baby, etc. Since the couple probably did put a hurting on their savings for this effort.

Tired of being polite
Guest Apr 4, 1:59 p.m.
QUESTION: This has been building for years now, but I feel nearly depleted by the lack of consideration and basic manners in society. I’m forever stepping off the sidewalk so people can walk two abreast, or saying “thank you” to cashiers that literally don’t say a word to me, or waving the other person through when there’s confusion at a 4-way stop. And it feels like no one ever does any of that for me. I let the person with a few items go ahead of me at the store, or wait patiently when someone has trouble parking. No one lets me go ahead and I get honked at. I’m in my 50s and certainly not a saint, but I’m so tired of giving others consideration that’s rarely extended to me. How do I not throw up my hands and just become the type of person I resent? It sounds more appealing than being walked on all the time.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I feel you. But the alternative doesn't make much sense (except maybe with the sidewalk-stepping). Thank-yous and other kindnesses to people, especially those in service work, are never wasted. Even when not reciprocated, they are a net benefit to the system. I liken it to a 20-minute walk. Even if you're not doing it every day and getting in shape from it or making progress toward your fitness goal, you're still better for having done it than you would have been if you hadn't.

Waving people through intersections and letting people go ahead in checkout lines involve a small sacrifice from you, so carry a different benefit. I think those can actually send someone off into their day a teeny bit more optimistic about humanity. A wee smidge. So even if it's not coming back around to you, I think it's a great practice to continue, if you can remain forward-thinking enough to bear it. Maybe that person will be less angry with others a mile down the road. And that's to your credit.

The parking situation? Not stooping to impatience is purely for you. You gain nothing from honking except reducing yourself to an angry troll and knowing you inflicted more stress on the person just trying to park. So don't even think about it.

(And note to anyone out there who does this: Just freaking stop. Thank you. It never once in recorded automotive history ever made anyone park any faster, just more anxiously, at the likely expense of neighboring cars' paint jobs. Yours, at some point, if there's any cosmic justice.)

Last thing, the sidewalk: Don't step off. That's excessive deference to the entitled. Plowing through them isn't ideal, either, tempting though it may be, so I've settled on standing still to allow them to flow past. I'll post others' ideas if you send them in.

Anyway -- I hope this approach > "fork it."

Aunt in white jeans at wedding

QUESTION: I still think the aunt was issuing some kind of (bleep) you, perhaps to the couple but maybe to the whole family.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Maybe so, but the only play was to ignore it and be exactly as gracious a host to her as to everyone else.

Here's why. If she left her home thinking this was the right thing to wear, then of course the thing to do is to treat her as if she fits right in and looks lovely. Right?

If she chose her outfit as some kind of [bleep] you, then what better response than to be unfailingly gracious to her? Then she gets to feel one of two ways: 1. Nobody even noticed her big bird flip. 2. Anyone who did notice was too polished or kind (or too wily) to take her bait. It's the [bleep] you falling in a forest, with no one there to hear.

Win-win.

just how

QUESTION: Chaos is the goal here right? Everything is insane and getting crazier by the second but HOW DO WE FUNCTION? How do we keep on keeping on? I refuse to stick my head in the sand but I need help on how to function

ANSWER: How do we ever function amid chaos? Do the right thing, such as the right thing can be determined.

Whenever it seems impossible to tell what that is, make the decision you're trying to make smaller: Do the next right thing. Be kind, be principled, be strong, be helpful, have hope, whichever the situation calls for.

Or just stop scrolling, go to bed at a decent hour and get back to it tomorrow.

Another farewell
Guest Apr 4, 2:20 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn.

I'm not writing this with the intent of it being published in the chat, but I certainly don't mind if it is. Like numerous folks before, this is a farewell. I cancelled my subscription just before the election, and my access is coming to an end in a few days.

I kept hoping ... SOMETHING ... would happen that would make me change my mind. Instead, as the current administration has been even worse than I could have imagined even in fever dreams, the Post's ownership and editorial leadership has increasingly bent the knee to the current occupant of the people's house, who seems to want nothing so much as to punish the entire country for daring to reject him in 2020. The constant exit of bright, talented, passionate writers, hitting its peak (nadir?) with Eugene Robinson's resignation has cemented my decision.

I've not ever had a question for you, but reading your advice over the decades (!) has helped me along the way - before needing to ask them in many cases. Even before I subscribed to the Post, I followed you back in your syndicated days, and I will miss the daily dose and (especially) the holiday and wedding hoots and the weekly Ned fixes. My best to you and yours, and a fervent hope we all survive the next four years (somehow we still have almost a full four years of this ... insanity left) mostly unscathed.

ANSWER: Thank you for the note. I too am heartbroken to see Gene go; he is not only a great columnist, but also a remarkably decent human being. He led the Style section back in the early days of my column and his support was invaluable. Best office holiday parties ever, too.

I will also say this: Given the announced changes to the Opinion section, I expect there will be more turnover. If you had said to me before that you were looking to this part of The Post for your "SOMETHING," then I would have suggested you look instead to the news side.

That is where The Post ownership is not directing coverage. Instead, it news side is behind the same wall it has always been -- which means the owner and publisher hire top editors and then let them do their jobs.

I never know when a reader asking about the changes at The Post is aware of the difference, so I err on the side of over-explaining, because it's such an important distinction: News side is its own thing, and is covering the administration and everything else it covers under the direction of editors, not ownership. The Post's news coverage has borne this out.

QUESTION: I worked in retail for 10 years. I guarantee every kind comment to every single cashier makes a difference in their day. They might be having such a bad day that they can’t muster a smile - but it’s because they had to deal with all those jerks you don't want to become. You’re doing the right thing. And you are modeling humane behavior so that others may make a better choice next time.

QUESTION: If you decide to adopt (or foster) another cat, do yourself and the cat a favor and invest in an automatic litter box. We’ve had a couple of different brands over the years, but all make that duty more bearable - and achievable. I echo Carolyn’s and others’ advice for making a decision on whether or not to have another cat, but this might help you decide you can.

QUESTION: Resist!

Yale professor Timothy Snyder's short book "On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century" is a great primer. Short but powerful, starting with "Do not obey in advance."

John Lithgow recorded a video reading the summary of each chapter. Powerful and inspiring, and about 10 minutes long. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXR5HLodsT8

I strongly recommend.

QUESTION: I feel your pain but I was standing in line at my local Starbucks and the man in front of me said to the barista “May I please have….” And I thought, gosh I don’t think I’ve ever said to a barista “May I please have…”. I think I usually say “I’d like…”. I do say thank you, and I do tip, but he had such nice manners it was a bit of a wake up call. You sound like you’re being the change you want to see in the world. Please don’t give up. It really is the little things that make a civilization.

On resistance
Guest Apr 4, 2:37 p.m.
QUESTION: My New England husband had this to say about the current times "Not losing our [shiznit] and taking care of our mental health during these times is in itself an act of resistance." I think about that a lot when I feel despair, anxiety, and panic. I can take care of myself and my mental health and thereby (hopefully) be more useful to myself and others.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yes, New Englanders and acts of resistance go way back. (Though their resolve not to lose their [shiznit] does not carry over into comments sections on the Bruins.)

Keeping a level head is a thing to do, at first. Then it becomes something to build on.

Re: another farewell
Guest Apr 4, 2:53 p.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn - thank you for explaining the news side of the house at the Post. I've been confused by people who balk that I get my updates from the Post (they don't) and it dawned on me that all they are hearing is how controlling the owners are, but haven't actually read the quite informed and facts-driven reporting. I am lucky in that as a federal employee I have access to the Post for free, and if I'm being honest, I probably wouldn't pay for a subscription on my own given the uncertainty in my job status. Here's to hoping the administration does not take this perk away from us and thank you for your wonderfully direct advice and much needed candor as the world gets a bit more insane each day.

Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: You're welcome, and thanks for the anecdote, because I'm never sure where my information is landing.

Here's another thing. I'll link to my colleague Erik Wemple on the fact that 3,200 newspapers have closed in the past decade. Do you know who loves this? People in power who want to get away with stuff without being held accountable. People who love low-information voters.

So as long as The Post is fighting to hold people accountable, I will support The Post. I support other news outlets, too -- the narrowing of the business is catastrophic. It is part of why we are where we are.

Also, there is great stuff coming out of the Opinion side too. Monica Hesse is a must-read. Dana Milbank was born to bring black humor to the end times. Just for two because all this linking is taking me forever. As I said, that part of the paper is in flux, but they're there now and I read every word.

Combative Phone Coversations
Guest Apr 4, 3:04 p.m.
QUESTION: My husband has this method with his parents: If they start talking politics, he ends the call. He told them he would start doing this, and he even started to time it. "10 minutes in and you brought up politics, bye." And, it worked! On the last call, his dad made it 50 minutes. Even then, the calls are still fewer and farrer between because, for his isolated parents who only consume propaganda, their reality is very distorted and they are not interested in anything but the topic du jour that they are being told to be angry about.

Update from LW with adopted daughter
Guest Apr 4, 4:31 p.m.
QUESTION: I saw my letter this week. Things are okay. My daughter and I went to family therapy together and worked some stuff out. It can still get a little weird between us sometimes but we accept that. My parents abstained but we accept that too. They said they were going to tell her all when she was 18 and she seems to believe them. Her bio-dad started all of this because he told his fiancee about our daughter and the fiancee wanted to meet her. He went directly to our daughter because he figured my parents would say no. He thought maybe he still had some rights since he never signed any papers but my folks sent notices to his work place and his sister's house (his last known residence) and the judge said 'good enough' and terminated his rights. Our daughter didn't want to meet his fiancee or him and that's the last we've heard from him. I think things worked out as well as can be expected

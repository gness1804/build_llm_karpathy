Update and new question from LW with abusive stepdad
Guest Sep 12, 11:02 a.m.
QUESTION: I wrote to you over 3 years ago with a question about how to tell my daughter about her father (who was my abusive stepfather). I took your advice and let my therapist guide me in how best to let my daughter know about her father. What she's been told for now is that he’s not a part of her life because he wasn’t nice to me. We are doing great. Last year we moved into our own apartment. We're scraping by, eating a lot of beans, lentils and peanut butter but making the best of it. I converted a walk-in closet to a tiny bedroom for my daughter and made a fabric canopy for her little bed and together we put glow in the dark stars all over the walls and ceiling. Our little home makes both of us so happy. She's a great kid - cheerful, healthy, smart. She’s in second grade now and the joy of my life.
Now my question. Her father died about 6 months ago in a car accident. He was driving drunk but thankfully no one else was severely injured. I’m so happy he’s dead. If that makes me a terrible person, I don’t care. I feel great knowing he can never hurt us or bother us in any way. My mother started contacting me after his death. She claims that she was as much a victim of him as I was and she wants to be part of my life and to get to know my daughter. I guess she could be telling the truth but I only remember the terrible things she said to me and the ugly names she called me when I got pregnant. I never saw him abuse her or even get angry with her. I don’t know. My daughter and I are doing so well and I want to enjoy our stability and not invite trauma and pain back into our lives and that’s what my mom means to me even if she’s telling the truth about my stepfather. My daughter and I finished with therapists just last year and this would start that up again since a relationship with my mom might mean that my daughter has to learn more about her dad, especially that he's dead now. Is it okay if I tell my mom we’re not up to dealing with this right now, check back in a couple of years?

ANSWER: Of course it is, yes -- and would be so without the extent of the trauma. Because you decide whom to have in your life and on what terms.

That's the bedrock here. All other issues -- including what is fair or reasonable or true or healthy, etc. -- are secondary. Everything starts with the fact of you as your own gatekeeper for your time and your heart and your self.*

Now, some thoughts about "even if she’s telling the truth." Knowing only what you've written in your two questions, I believe your mother was also a victim of your stepfather's abuse. Or at least, I find it credible. It's an uncomfortable topic, to put it mildly, but there is room for grey in the reality of abusive relationships, and people who are caught in an abusive cycle with someone like your stepfather can certainly do harmful things themselves.

Sometimes it's to themselves, or to their abusers, but too often it's to others. (Or all three.) Relevantly: We've all seen it over and over in this space, in fact, in the form of either turning a blind eye to the other parent's abuse of the children, or even siding with the abusive parent against the children. Nothing excuses this -- but it's cited so often by people who grew up with an abusive parent that I suspect it's a survival response in the partner. A maladaptive one, obviously. When humans get feral it tends not to be good.

Anyway -- none of that justifies her claim that "she was as much a victim of him as I was." If that is indeed how she phrased it. She was the adult, you were the child, you were raped, and she remained partnered with your rapist till his death. So, absolutely freaking not. There is not enough "not."

And further, "she wants to be part of my life and to get to know my daughter" is only about her. She's coming to you, imagine that, to help her heal? The framing a healthy person would know to offer, as you may have spotted instantly from your own good work in therapy, is, "I understand it was unforgivable, but I at least want to apologize for my utter failure to protect you." In other words, only about you. Only. Paired with an independent effort to seek support and heal on her own time and dime.

You can't want wellness for her. But you can respond to her that you're sorry to hear she also suffered your stepfather's abuse -- and hope she will consider therapy, given how empowering it was for you. (Your own phrasing, of course.)

Losing Half My Kid's Life
Guest Sep 12, 11:14 a.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn, My partner and I are splitting up after some terrible, grueling years. I know I cannot live like this another second - but the idea of missing so much of my (one) child's life is unbearable. Do you have any words for how to bear up with this? Tell me it's going to be ok?

ANSWER: It's going to be okay.

I'm sorry it has been so bad for so long. That means, though, that you have already been missing some of your child's life to that. So in a way this is your chance to reclaim some happier time.

Plus, the reality of co-parenting under one roof includes more tag-teaming, handing off, you-here/me-there, than you may realize. And, there's another relationship to conduct (an offshoot of the above point). Even when you get along with your co-parent, you are managing that bond and the one with your kid, and the mechanics of the whole unit together. When you're solo parent, it's just you -- you're on.

So yes, it's less time, specifically fewer days, but those days are more. Meanwhile, their time to themselves is something many newly solo parents come to appreciate and learn to use to their and their kids' benefit.

Talk to some parents who have made this transition -- not all the stories will be happy ones, but I think in aggregate you will find them reassuring. Definitely useful.

Fuchsia wedding gown
Guest Sep 12, 11:18 a.m.
QUESTION: I’m getting married next year and couldn’t be happier. During the planning I got the idea to wear my grandmother’s wedding gown. She got married in 1970 and her dress is stunning. She was in the fashion industry and had the gown custom made for her. It’s a slinky floor-length A-line gown in a gorgeous shade of fuchsia. She hates the color white as much as I do. It has a square neckline that's perfect for a statement necklace I have. I contacted my grandmother and she’s having her dress dry cleaned and says she'll bring it on her next visit. She was able to wear it as her mother-of-the bride dress when my mom got married and says it’s still in perfect condition. She even knows a local seamstress who can fit it for me.
My future mother-in-law thought it was wonderful that I’d be wearing my grandmother’s gown until she saw a picture of it. She insists that it couldn’t be a wedding gown since brides only wore white back then even though the picture is clearly of my grandparents on their wedding day. My mother-in-law to be can’t let it go, she keeps saying what a mistake it will be to be married in 'that dreary old pink dress' and that I’ll miss all the fun of picking my own special gown. My mom suggested I wear something more traditional like she did so I don’t upset my mother-in-law to be. She offered me her gown but though I would never tell her, I hate it. It’s white, poufy and just over the top with tulle and beading. My mom also keeps asking what my sister (my only attendant) will wear even though I've told her several times my sister can wear anything she wants that goes with fuchsia. She acts like that's going to be so hard when there's tons of choices. With both moms objecting, is this a stupid hill to die on? My fiancé says I should wear what will make me happy and that’s my grandmother’s wedding dress.

Permission to leave
Guest Sep 12, 11:36 a.m.
QUESTION: Some time ago, I discovered that my spouse had never been faithful to me since our relationship began, well over a decade ago. We have an elementary-aged child together, and I think we get along pretty well on a day-to-day basis, considering that I cannot imagine trusting my spouse with my emotional well-being again. We have both done individual and couples' therapy, and my spouse continues to withhold information about social interactions despite promising transparency.

There are obvious practical concerns, including wanting to retain as much stability for our child as possible, and the costs of separate households in a high cost-of-living area. How do I know that divorce is an okay thing to do when it would upend our child's world? What reasons are good enough?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: That your spouse is fundamentally, serially dishonest seems like one of the better ones to me.

Divorce isn't a picnic for kids but in-house instability isn't, either, so you do your best.

I mean, have you said outright to Spouse, "I know you will never be faithful to me. I am done trying for that. I want you to be honest with me"? I'm not suggesting you have an open marriage, or divorce and live apart, or divorce and cohabit as roommates, or whatever other configuration might arise from this tell-me-the-truth phase of your lives. I'm merely asking whether you've removed this last remaining incentive your spouse might have to hide the infidelity.

If you've done that and the lying persists? Then that tells you something. Spinning off your own household, especially if you have primary custody, could be a lot healthier for your kid. But that's super-speculative, probably (sorry) better for a session or two with the pros.

I'm sorry.

Perceived cruelty
Guest Sep 12, 11:36 a.m.
QUESTION: If one feels they have been spoken to cruelly, is it better for one to confront that, or just cease communications completely?

Thinking of Angelou's poem: "When someone shows you who they are, believe them."

But unsure how best to proceed.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'd prefer more context, but without it I'll say generally that it's best to respond to people directly. "What a cruel comment. I hope you didn't mean that."

When you "just cease communications completely," you don't give people a chance even to know what they did to upset you, much less fix their mistakes. Certainly there are times when people know exactly what they did and have no intention of fixing it -- but severing ties treats that as a 100 percent certainty. Meaning, you're leaving zero room for the possibility that anyone ever misspeaks, or tells a joke that falls flat, or means it but has instant regrets.

That's just not realistic, is it? I believe Maya Angelou is a beacon, but also that you're misapplying her words here. I don't think she's saying, "The minute someone says the wrong thing, they should be dead to you." Instead, it's wise guidance on character, and on trusting yourself. You do know poor character when you see it, and it's okay not to keep granting second and third and nth chances for people of poor character to keep harm you.

That leaves plenty of room for you to tell someone the effect their words had on you, and to weigh their response. Their words, your objection to them and their immediate and longer-term response to that are all, to my mind, under the umbrella of "the first time," which I believe is the omitted part of the quote/thought.

RE: Losing Half My Kid's Life
Guest Sep 12, 11:48 a.m.
QUESTION: I'm 3.5 years into this life. It's ok to be sad right now. I'd be more worried if you weren't struggling with this. My experience has been that my mindset is everything. If you keep focusing on the "this sucks" aspects of this long term, I can guarantee you will be miserable. If you can find ways to re-frame how you view this, you can be as happy with it as you want.

At this point, I'm thankful for the days I get to rest and live only for myself so that I'm ready to be the 100% parent half the time. I've been thankful that my kids have been exposed to a variety of approaches to life instead of one pretty dysfunctional one. I love that I put my Halloween decorations up two weeks ago without being mocked, that I'll never again sit here wondering when or if their other parent is going to show up for dinner. I've taken my kids on vacations where we enjoyed ourselves the whole time instead of trying not to upset "Grumpy Bear". I get to see my friends! I have a social life and hobbies. I wasn't going to get any of that in the life I used to have. My kids see me as a whole person and not just their parent.

Guest Sep 12, 11:49 a.m.
QUESTION: Am I a bad person if I want the bride to have her sister wear white? The mom's wedding dress even?

The dress sounds like a lovely through-line to previous generations. IF you can, maybe try to include something visual and obvious to your fiance's family so your future MIL feels represented and cherished too.

Wedding dress
Guest Sep 12, 11:51 a.m.
QUESTION: It seems to me that the OP did have the fun of picking her own special gown: she chose her grandmother's dress. Also, best to nip that "don't upset the mother-in-law-to-be" suggestion in the bud. Begin as you mean to go on, and if mollifying the MIL ends up being a theme, it's good not to buy into it even before the wedding and great that MIL's son doesn't buy into it.

What to do when a guy wets the bed
Guest Sep 12, 12:07 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi, Carolyn. You’ll understand why I can’t ask advice from friend or family on this one:
I’ve been dating a nice man for about three months, and my family and friends have met him. I wanted to take things pretty slow, so we just began talking about becoming intimate. He is excited about this (ok, good), but after we talked about it, he told me that if he stayed at my place, he would need to buy a waterproof mattress cover because he “sometimes pees the bed at night.” I didn’t react with disgust, but I was taken aback and said that he should have this checked out immediately because it could be a health issue. He was hurt by my reaction and said that many people have this problem and I shouldn’t shame him about it. Yes, many people have this issue, but we’re 55 years old, not 85!
I have since found out that even though he makes decent money at his job (he’s self-employed), he finds health insurance too expensive and hasn’t gotten the basic check-ups a 50-something should have like a colonoscopy, prostate checks, vaccines, and etc. I like him, but I’m starting to question getting involved with someone who doesn’t take basic care of himself. Not to mention, a mattress cover may protect my mattress but what about the linens, pillows, and well, me?? Should I be more tolerant of his problem and work with him on it, or is this a big red flag? He doesn’t want to talk about, doesn't want to wear Depends-type underwear it and says we can just sleep at his house. My brain is so preoccupied with this – what do you think?

Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: Yes I will understand. Oh my.

I can't believe I am typing this, but the worst part of the adult bedwetting is that he will take it as the reason you chose to proceed to the nearest exit, when in fact it will be -- please -- that he "hasn’t gotten the basic check-ups a 50-something should have like a colonoscopy, prostate checks, vaccines, and etc." and "doesn’t take basic care of himself" when clearly there is a health issue on board that has significant quality of life consequences. Even if its actual health consequences aren't significant, which I don't know and won't address because I am not qualified to.

But adults who do not take care of themselves are, it is reasonable to believe, at the beginning of their burdens and complications. If you aren't even sure you want this one, then you have your answer.

This is going to sound sarcastic, but it's not, you probably want to thank him for his candor.

Proud husband and admiring wife
Guest Sep 12, 12:34 p.m.
QUESTION: Your answer to today's LW was a wis e response to the particular issue of the money question, but I think it failed to flag a more fundamental issue.
I 100% agree with the wife that independence and a strong work ethic are admirable traits. What is not admirable is making them define his identity to the point that he "feels shame" whenever he receives help. Sooner or later, in ways small or large, everyone NEEDS help, and needs to accept it gracefully. If I were the wife, therapy to address this would be a higher priority for me than buying a house. Otherwise, she will have to have the kind of discussion you recommend over and over again.

Shame and resentment are well worth leaving behind. Also, his 'by himself' days ended with 'I do,' whether his self-concept has absorbed that yet or not."

Turns out I wasn't the gf, I was the other woman
Guest Sep 12, 12:48 p.m.
QUESTION: I was the other woman for months and had no idea. I met my boyfriend through a dating app and immediately felt an incredible connection. It was my first serious relationship. He was a little older than me, a widower just getting back into the dating scene. That’s what he told me. We said we loved each other after three months, he met my family, I even met his brother when he was in town for a week. The only drawback to the whole relationship was that his job required him to work every weekend. Two weeks ago, I decided to treat myself to a Saturday spa day at the best salon in our city. After I was done, I planned to stop at a café that I’d been to once with my boyfriend. It was within walking distance of his apartment. We never spent much time at his apartment since he said it held a lot of sad memories for him and a lot of his late wife’s stuff was still there. When I got to the café, I was surprised to see my boyfriend sitting at an outside table with a woman who looked like his late wife’s picture. I was immediately suspicious so I lurked around across the street until they paid the bill and then followed them back to his apartment. I knocked on the door and when the woman answered, I asked if she was his wife and she said yes. My boyfriend appeared and his face told the whole story. I felt faint but managed to tell his wife that we'd been dating for six months. As I left, I could hear him apologizing to her and saying I meant nothing to him. Later the wife called me and demanded I leave her husband alone. He must have put the whole blame on me. I learned that she works in another state and comes home on the weekends. I don’t know how I’m ever going to get over this. I feel stupid and ashamed and crushed. We were making plans for the future, I thought we would get married. What am I going to tell people, especially my family? How will I ever get over this? I can barely make it to work every day and then I come home and cry all night.

ANSWER: Why? Why are you being so hard on yourself, when you did absolutely nothing wrong?

I get that you feel embarrassed in a reflexive way -- the "stupid and ashamed and crushed" is the natural trio of reactions most people would have if they choose Column A reactions (with Column B being the outward-facing set, the anger family). But after reflex comes thought, and I would hope with reflection you'd see there's nothing here that made you stupid or wrong. In fact, a good deal of relief is ready and waiting whenever you're ready to swap it in for "crushed."

This "boyfriend" is very bad news. Of what exact variety, I can't know and don't care. There's no real reason for you to care, either. Maybe eventually when you're ready to review and revisit and learn, but not now.

And the idea that he "put the whole blame on me"? Like, you hunted him down and made him cheat on his wife while she was away? There's nothing he could have told her that would erase his responsibility. Nothing.

There was only a decision on her part to buy his lie. That's another thing we can't know -- what her motivation is to keep lying to herself to this degree. But 100 percent, her call to you was her committing to the bit. She can demand you stay away and this and that and blah blah blah and it was never and will never be you. Okay? It's her husband and she has to know that.

Anyway. You got lied to but good. It's a scary, creepy, destabilizing feeling. That part I get. Especially in a first serious relationship, that can make you question your ability to trust others and yourself, so talking to someone about it might be well worth it. And just that you can't stop crying -- that's a get-help scenario. If your work has an EAP, that's the most accessible care. Right now, even, thehotline.org is appropriate because it's emotional abuse, what the guy did, easily.

But as far as feeling shame, again, please don't. Tell people/family you broke up, he wasn't the person you thought he was. That's all you need -- anything more is totally at your discretion, to whom and when/if ever you're ready. To learn someone "wasn't the person I thought" is basically every breakup ever, truly. Take care.

Frustrated by wife's lack of interest in building a social circle
Guest Sep 12, 1:00 p.m.
QUESTION: My wife and I moved to our neighborhood four years ago, and have trouble making friends to varying degrees. For some background, we have a 5 year old and 1 year old. We lived in a large city, but moved out to the suburbs when our daughter was 1. My wife had a core group of three other friends, but by the time we moved, the other friends were in the process of moving elsewhere in the area/ out of the region all together (that's not why we moved; just happened to occur at the same time). This was particularly hard as her best friend, who was the glue of this group, moved to the other side of the country.

When we moved to the suburbs, we aimed to have a strong group of friends like we had before. To that end, we specifically choose a neighborhood that we knew had a lot of young families, even though it was more expensive.

In the four years that we’ve lived here, we’ve had mixed results with making friends. I’ve been able to make friends with some of the Dads in the neighborhood/our daughter’s school. However, things have been a bit harder for my wife. She’ll get invites from people to have play dates, but rarely reciprocates. We’re both on a few group chat threads, and whenever someone says “let’s meet up at a playground,” my wife’s response is “you should go, I don’t feel like being social”. Whenever I mention trying to get together with some of the other Moms we know, her response is “eh, i don't really want to” or “they won’t want to get together with me, they already have friends.”

On one hand, I empathize with her; I’m an introvert too, and I recognize that socializing doesn’t always come easy. On the other hand, it’s frustrating to hear her complain about how she wishes she had friends, when it feels like if she got out of her shell a bit, her social life would be better, and maybe she shouldn’t be looking for this unicorn of a best friend. It just feels like she thinks that a friendship is going to appear out of nowhere, and that’s not the case, she does have to work at it.

Am I off base in feeling frustrated about this?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: No, because it's super frustrating to hear someone complain, then pass up chances to fix the problem, then complain.

However: An introvert with a 1- and 5-year-old (and maybe a touch of PPD? “they won’t want to get together with me") is a low, low percentage bet to agree to the playground meetup to start from scratch to make new friends.

So maybe you, OP, but also you, both of you, would benefit from some realism and patience. She will need friends, yes, and is lonely -- but this is going to take time. Time for her to recover physically and hormonally, time for kids to grow a bit, time for better sleep, time to pep-talk herself into wanting to #$@&! start over.

Your wanting her to get on with it won't help. You mean well but I'm guessing she picks up the vibe. Sorry for the pun, but baby steps. These years are just hard. And moving on top of that? Ugh.

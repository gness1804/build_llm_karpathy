Homophobic Relatives
Guest Apr 25, 11:04 a.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,

In light of Everything, I am trying to get my actions in better alignment with my principles. Among other things, this means no longer tolerating bigotry of any kind from my acquaintances. If they want to be in community with me, I'm going to challenge them on it; if they don't want to change, I don't want the relationship. Even though I happen to be cis and straight, I love a lot of people who aren't, including my sister who is pan/poly and currently in a relationship with another woman. Therein lies my question. How do I handle it if my sister wants to remain on friendly terms with people I think have disrespected her horribly? Our parents are 90% of the way to acceptance, but their siblings and some older family friends are a mess.

ANSWER: Huh. This took a turn I wasn't expecting.

I was ready for you to ask how best to stand up for your sister.

I guess that is still the question in the broadest sense. But the reality is much more nuanced once you factor in that your sister is both on friendly terms with people you're objecting to, and not asking you to stand up for her.

Typical reality. Refusing to make things easy.

The short answer for you is to do -- keep doing -- whatever you think is right. If you don't like these relatives/friends, whether it's because their morals offend you or their politics annoy you or their conversation bores you, then keep your civil distance. That's your prerogative. If you hear them say something offensive or that you know to be untrue and harmful, then politely but firmly correct the record. Nothing new or exciting here. "That is disinformation. It's _____. I'm sorry you were misled." Or: "That is unkind and untrue." And/or: "Don't talk about _____ like that in my presence."

The longer and more interesting answer is to pay some attention to your sister. She is the one with more on the line, yet has chosen a friendly path with those who aren't respectful of who she is. Why has she made that choice, do you know? Is it a kind of Stockholm Syndrome, or is she a total badass, or ____? Have you two talked about this? If she thinks the path to progress is through converting hostile people over time with her humanity, then she might not even agree with your decision to start slamming doors.

It would be interesting to know what brought your parents to their 90 percent (presumably they started at a much lower acceptance number). Time, pressure? Did shame from the "mess" cohort slow things down? Did shame from allies speed things up? Did pressures work in combination -- the pull of your sister's grace and the push of impatience from less BS-tolerant allies like you?

Anyway. Not to get too deep into a thought exercise, which is also a risk. Sometimes you do find yourself staring down a bigot, a true believer in wiping out anything "other," and you need to be ready to declare that person dead to you. Vulnerable people don't need their stronger allies playing footsie with storm troopers.

I think all the interesting stuff is right here: "if they don't want to change." Do you trust yourself to know?

It is okay, in general, just to commit to being braver on a day-to-day basis.

How Do I handle this?
Guest Apr 25, 11:11 a.m.
QUESTION: I've been dating a guy I really like for about 3 months. He's been separated for 4 years and is working on getting a divorce. Last night on our date, his ex-wife followed him to the restaurant and confronted him after I left and then contacted me -- with very angry and harsh words. I believe she has access to his phone text messages and some sort of app that tracks his whereabouts. How do I can handle this? I'd like to keep seeing him, but WOW ... this has never happened to me before.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Wow is right. Do you know all those specs about his separation/divorce in progress are true? That's my first thought. My second one is, I can't see dating someone who would consent to being tracked like that.

If she was just using access he didn't realize she still had, then ... okay. Easy to see how that could happen. But all of it would have to be shut down and some papers filed, frankly, before I'd venture back into the middle of that.

I.e., I would want hard proof the unfinished business is entirely on her side, not his, because one side is bad enough.

Today's column - people pleaser
Guest Apr 25, 11:12 a.m.
QUESTION: I was the people-pleaser from today's column until a very good friend got frustrated with me and said "It's okay to have an opinion! I *want* to know what *YOU* want to do! That's why I asked you! I enjoy spending time with you, but it is EXHAUSTING to always have to pick - the restaurant, the movie, the day and time we meet - all of it. You have to take a turn, too!" and then, calmly, "I know your family and know you're used to just going along to get along, but I'm not them. You can have an opinion and a choice and input as to where we go and what we do. PLEASE speak up. Our friendship is a two-way street, okay?" - what an eye-opener!!
I'm probably a little *too* opinionated now, but I really needed to hear that it was okay to both have and state a preference.

Helping a child choose a college
Guest Apr 25, 11:34 a.m.
QUESTION: My daughter applied to numerous colleges. Only her safety schools admitted her. She’s struggling between two similarly selective (40-50%) school, one very rural and one in a large city. She’s terribly disappointed and frozen. We’ve done the pros and cons lists. A huge health issue upset her academic Apple cart last year and torpedoed her hopes of a super selective school. We as her parents are supportive but certainly don’t want to choose. One school has offered a lot more money which does matter to some extent. Any suggestions on how to provide support here?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm sorry she's feeling so disappointed. It sounds as if she is in a pretty decent spot except by comparison to where she was hoping she would be. I know there's no cheerleading someone out of that, she is just going to have to keep moving forward until she realizes she likes where she is (or wants to transfer).

If the only way she moves forward is with a gentle shove from you, then you may, de facto, be choosing for her. It's not great but it's something.

So here are the steps I'd take in that position.

First, don't rush her. May 1, right? If she processes quietly, then her "frozen"might be thought and recovery.

Next: If there is a specific program she wants, then that of course goes to the top of the list, but as long as each has a selection then that can be secondary.

Next: The obvious is to say, "Take the money!!!" And not just because it's money!!! but there is something to be said for a school that really wants you. That's a case you can make to her that isn't a bunch of spin.

But ... agh. I'm not going to advise that. Because the difference between a rural and urban school is so huge that I think you are better off thinking hard about your kid's natural habitat -- or, if she is coming from the burbs and hasn't been in either environment, what that is likely to be. Which one is going to be right for her temperament.

Then make that case to her and say why: "You love underground art and music and I just see you in a city." Or, "You've always been drawn to quiet places." Reflect your kid back to her and see if she sees the same thing.

Last thing, an insane wild card. Does she have a seriously plugged in college counselor? Because some schools that haven't hit their numbers may take a late app.

Navigating family estrangement
Guest Apr 25, 11:53 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn. I cut ties with my sister about ten years ago. Sister's untreated mental illness was sucking my parents and other siblings into a spiral. The other members of my family enable my sister's disfunction, and beg me to make up with her, even if that means sweeping issues under the rug. I think I would like to be on better terms, but I want to be an enabler either. I want my sister to acknowledge the harm her behavior has caused -- something other family members don't confront explicitly. How can I keep the door open to reconciliation, but with firm boundaries? I don't want to get sucked in to an unproductive fight again.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: The way to reconcile with firm boundaries is to understand what you do and don't control, and then be very clear in your purpose for and management of the part you control.

Let's look at your list of wants and don't wants:

1. "I want my sister to acknowledge the harm her behavior has caused." That is not something you control. You control whether you ask for it, sure, but it's up to your sister whether you get it. So I caution against this, because it puts a big part of your path forward in your sister's hands.

2. "I don't want to get sucked in to an unproductive fight again." This is something you control. When you feel a fight coming on or hitting an unproductive point, then you can walk away from it. Entirely up to you.

3. "I would like to be on better terms, but I don't want to be an enabler either." This is something you control. You can make an overture to your sister to resume the relationship, carefully. You can decide beforehand what behaviors you will not enable, accept or encourage. What that means in practice is that when you are, say, subjected to abusive behavior like getting screamed at, you will not listen to it or scream back or apologize for whatever set it off. You will simply end the conversation and step away. Knowing it is a health issue, you may choose to call again at a pre-determined interval, and continue this arm's length engagement. Or you may choose to check in less often or not at all.

As for your family, you let them know you are engaging on your terms and are not seeking input on this. If they start to intrude.

Re helping a child choose a college
Guest Apr 25, 11:57 a.m.
QUESTION: Don't forget to think creatively. Gap year? Transfer after freshman year? A child whose life has been upset by a huge health issue doesn't have to lock back in to the traditional path/timing. The options as you have presented them seem a bit narrow.

ANSWER: Even a child without a huge health issue does not have to lock into the traditional path/timing. Gap years and transfers are useful tools for all.

But, too, so are "safety schools." SO many people love where they go, and quickly, despite feeling meh at best about the idea the April before they go. It's a well known phenomenon.

So yes, full menu. Thanks.

Cancer dog
Guest Apr 25, 12:14 p.m.
QUESTION: We just used the last of our savings to pay for a young and otherwise healthy dog -- our child's best, sleeping on the bed and meeting the bus with joy, buddy -- to have a cancerous tumor removed. All the signs are good and the vet believes the chances of recurrence are low. But if it comes back we _cannot_ afford to treat it again, not without taking on debt. We currently have no debt. But both adult jobs are unstable right now, and while the kids would 100% give up their extracurriculars to save the dog's life, another round of treatment would cost more than all their activities combined for a year, and I don't want to kneecap their life launch for a dog. But I'm typing this while I hold the dog and cry into his fur at the thought of killing him so my kids can what, take karate? I can't think and I'm so tired. He's such a good boy but the kids have to come first. How do I stick to my logical guns if I had to make this decision again? Husband is in the same boat as me, mentally.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Two thoughts. First, you just did this, you're stressed, tired and broke, so this is not the time to think about it. You don't have to decide now so don't.

Second, now may be the time to rethink the extracurriculars. Does everyone need all of the stuff? I mean -- I'm pro enrichment opportunities. But only if they're actually enriching, and not a reflexive signup at this point.

If you're down to no savings and the jobs are wobbly, then this seems like a great time to think about the real return on your activity investment. There's nothing wrong with being more mindful about how you do this, and seeing whether your kids' interests have evolved or come into tighter focus.

Any other cost shaving you can do elsewhere would also be good. This is the thinking to do now -- you know you may have an issue coming, so, do what you can on the money side to get ahead of it. Much better than dwelling on the dread side.

Guest Apr 25, 12:17 p.m.
QUESTION: I'd recommend visiting each school--even if you were there before. We did that as my daughter was unsure, with schools that were top choices for her. A second visit showed us one was extremely quiet, even in a city, and the other, in NYC, was lively and had literally thousands of easily accessible things to do off-campus. It wasn't a choice I thought she'd make, but she still lives in NYC, years after graduation.

Mom asked "Why do you hate me?"
Guest Apr 25, 12:32 p.m.
QUESTION: At a family gathering me and my husband were hosting, my mother got me alone and, out of nowhere, asked "why do you hate me?" I just said "what?"-I was shocked and didn't know what to say. My father came in and she moved on as if nothing happened. I don't know where this is coming from. The only thing I can think of is earlier she had asked me (again, out of nowhere) "you don't plan on selling the heirloom table you inherited, do you?" and I responded "why would you ask that?" She kept pushing until finally I gave in and said no (but I don't see why I should have to report on it, especially when there is no indication I don't want it-it's our dining room table, though I shouldn't have to justify any of this). Also, I have lately been trying to set and enforce boundaries due to past events in our relationship, like:
-I hired a photographer to take a family photo with both of our in-laws and the kids. I got enlargements made, matted, framed, and then gave them to all family members as gifts. My mother's enraged response was "how dare you-you edited the photo to put me in the back!" I did not. In fact, during the photo shoot she refused to stand in the natural position with my father opposite the in-laws and instead insisted on moving to the back.
-For our anniversary, my husband and I hired a babysitter so we could go out to have a nice dinner to ourselves. Going out just the two of us is something we have done only 3 times since our 1st was born 7 years ago. When my mother learned of this, she accused me and my husband of being bad parents. I may have overreacted, but when she said that I asked her to leave.
-My mother has repeatedly insisted incorrectly that we have somehow secretly been spending time and taking trips with my husband's parents. We have not (and though she poses it in an accusatory way, I'm not sure what her point is-if we want to take trips with someone, so what). Again, this is out of nowhere and triggered by ?.
-Every year a day before my mother's birthday, she posts on social media "my birthday's tomorrow: we'll see if my daughter remembers this year" or similar. I have never forgotten her birthday and always have a card and gifts on that day (unlike her who remembers the birthday itself but always sends cards late).
There are more... and never any apology. But that's just backstory to my real questions: how should I have responded in the moment to her asking "why do you hate me" and should I still respond now, after the fact?

ANSWER: Is this new or worsening behavior, or has she always been like this? Because to this layperson, these examples suggest a rather weak grasp of reality. The place to start is with your dad. "I am really concerned about Mom. She is increasingly paranoid and saying things that have no connection to reality." Then hope he's not covering for her. Time for a trip to her doctor, full workup and truth-telling.

Protecting my kids is most key right?
Guest Apr 25, 12:38 p.m.
QUESTION: My cousin, 17 years older than I, has been convicted of sexual abuse to his young teen daughter. My immediate family are deeply, completely certain he’s been wronged and it’s a vendetta of his ex.

This man chased me as a small child for hugs and kisses - even when screaming in terror. I reminded my family - they told me it was harmless and to stop being dramatic.

We live in a different country but have long calls each week. My gut tells me I need to pull away and with my kids as this attitude is so wrong to me - whoever is right a child is clearly hurt here. but I’m hesitant in case I’m overreacting. I could do with some perspective please

ANSWER: Trust your experience. You lived it, you knew something was wrong.

And when you spoke up recently, they could have said, "That must be an awful memory for you. We don't think the incidents are related, but if you need to sit this one out, we will understand." Instead, they told you to stop being dramatic.

So, yes. Protect your kids.

published letter about asking DIL for travel plans
Guest Apr 25, 12:45 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi, Carolyn. I missed the live chat where the son's mother posted about asking DIL for the family travel plans so I read it 'new' this week in the paper. Completely agree with your answer. But I wondered on the face of it why the mother-in-law thinks travel plans/planning is 'women's work'? If she wants to know the plans (and she doesn't need to) why not ask HER SON??? She wrote about how this is common among her 'mom friends'. Again, only women do family travel planning? Sheesh.

ANSWER: Writing this column for me has become a three decade journey in discovering new versions of the "two kinds of people." Apparently another two kinds are people who think being 35 and telling mommy you're on flight 427 is normal and people who "wha?"

I also learned from many people that it would have been "so easy" for the DIL to just give the flight information. A lot of them, possibly all, heard back from me that it would have been just as "so easy" for the mom to ask her son for it.

In other words, I'm with you kind of people.

Apparently I also need therapy for my anger issues with my parents, because I never gave them my flight information. [Read the column here.]

Political differences
Guest Apr 25, 1:02 p.m.
QUESTION: After much effort to build a close relationship with my dad despite geographical distance, the U.S.'s political chaos has revealed a huge wedge between us. His rule is that my siblings and I cannot discuss politics when we are together (because we are intractably opposed), but now when he and I speak on a call and I provide my perspective on an item of news he disagrees with, it's like the call has suddenly dropped. He just...doesn't engage. I feel like our relationship is becoming superficial and emotionally dishonest because we can't discuss reality. I'm not sure of my question exactly but I'm feeling loneliness in a relationship that used to provide me great comfort.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I think a ton of people are going through a version of this. It's anecdotal, but I'm seeing a lot of questions from people in mismatched coping pairs: The ones who want to process it all are coming home to the ones who want to live in a complete news blackout, and no one feels understood.

I don't think the wall you've hit is the end of it all with your dad, though. It's just a wall on the politics path. There are so many other conversational places to go.

The problem is, The Chaos (tm) means the others aren't front of mind -- and you're having these conversations by phone, so it's not like you can putter around your kitchen for a while in companionable silence until a new topic bubbles up.

So ... I'm going to suggest something that feels really artificial, but is so only in cutting out that gap time you don't have the luxury of allowing to elapse naturally. During the course of your days, any time you think of your dad, write down whatever topic you have in mind to run by him. Talk to your notes app, whatever. Even a couple of items will give you a pivot for when he disengages. It's something you had in mind, right? So it's valid -- it's just a little memory jog.

Try it, see if there's enough reality to discuss of other varieties to restore your faith in your relationship.

A seat at the table
Guest Apr 25, 1:16 p.m.
QUESTION: My in-laws do not sit at the table to eat. Whether it is just MIL and FIL at home or the entire extended family, food is placed on the counter and people self serve and sit all over the house - some in front of the TV, others in the living room or porch looking at phones. When at their houses, I go with the flow. In our house, I want to sit at the table unless it is something like a cookout or superbowl. This was such a concern of mine that I raised it with my husband while dating and we agreed to sit at the table. We are living together now (married) and when his parents come over, they refuse to sit at the table. His dad, in particular, says he's not a child and I can't force him. So now we are in a bit of a stalemate. I don't want to have them over for a meal if it means working hard to prepare a meal only to sit scattered in our house and not talking. MIL is telling everyone in the family that I won't have them over for a meal. They like to play bingo and take their dog to the park for long walks. My husband has asked if we can join them to do these things or go to a restaurant and MIL refuses (because she knows why we are asking to do these things...avoiding meals at our house). I waffle between thinking I'm being obnoxious and should give up to thinking my MIL/FIL are really being bullies. My husband is supporting me but frustrated, too. He asked me to write you. So I am and hoping you've got ideas for me.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Whoo. Good luck with these two.

Couple of things.

1. Tell your husband thanks.

2. Also tell him I'm really sorry, because his dad is such a child. He really said, "You can't force me"?

3. You (OP) already "won" a while ago. You both did. You are a gently united front against this bizarre tantrum his parents are having.

FWIW: Drawing the hard line when the in-laws visit was totally within your rights to do, but you inadvertently stepped into a power struggle with them that you didn't need to have. That was unfortunate. If time travel ever becomes available, then do take advantage by not picking this battle next time. Plus they sound like wonderful people not to have across from you at the table.

3. I used "" up there because the only victory is a happy, harmonious and loving marriage, even if each of you eats standing up in a different closet. So please work this out with your husband -- how would you like to deal with his lunatic parents, so that you both can breathe freely and not think about this ridiculous standoff ever again? That is the entirety of the answer.

4. Your MIL/FIL are really being bullies. There is no reason to concede anything except that the whole thing is so insane. But if you want it, you have room: You say, "I don't want to have them over for a meal if it means working hard to prepare a meal only to sit scattered in our house and not talking." So if they want to come live by their rules in your home, then can bring the food.

But really, I am throwing that out there because I look for possible solutions. If I were the person living with this, then I would hope my husband was talking to his parents separately in a "You have one shot at this, is this really the best you've got? Trashing us to your friends? Refusing &^%$! bingo?" conversation. After which they get told they know where to find him once they get their heads out of [places].

(What's the dad's issue with sitting -- does your husband know?)

Margo
Guest Apr 25, 1:17 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, I was excited and surprised to see my letter run today about my MIL "Margo." You wanted to know how her judgments were making their way to me and about the "third parties" I mentioned—it's not as nefarious as it might have sounded like. The main third party is my husband's younger sister. I can tell you exactly how it happened. My SIL has her own (open) frictions with Margo and was venting to my husband and me about her worries that it will get worse whenever she has a child. I commented that Margo has been great as a grandmother, and my SIL responded "Yes, but then she cries all the way home because (whatever the most recent thing was)!" This opened a sort of floodgate, and also a couple of bystanders overheard and chimed in. So this is how the third parties became involved—generally everyone is discreet and I don't really consider SIL to have broken her mom's confidence (though I can see where some would).

So that is why it's tricky. No one has done anything wrong. But I don't like to think about making Margo cry, even in secret.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ah. Okay! That is good news. I can totally see that kind of floodgate-share happening organically.

But ... ehhhhh I should just be happy and leave this at, "No one has done anything wrong."

But ... I feel like I'm on a fault-finding mission.

But ... Margo is doing something wrong!!! There, I said it.

Whoo. Wrong in being sooo wound up and judging sooo hard. No? I mean, are you being that controversial as parents, to make your kids' grandmother cry? That she has her own daughter worried about ever becoming a parent is telling.

Anyway. It's a lovely sentiment that you want Margo to be okay and/or to be okay with you. It remains lovely that she at least tries to do all her most ferocious judging in private.

If others' experience is any guide, then Margo will cry less with time. No guarantees of course. But the parents of littles seem to get the worst of it. Not sure whether the grandparents eventually warm to the parents, warm to how the kids are turning out or just lose their will to fight it all so hard.

Re: political differences
Guest Apr 25, 1:19 p.m.
QUESTION: It seems like OP’s dad set a boundary about not discussing political stuff, but OP still wants to bring up “news” he disagrees with and is surprised he disengages.

We have friends on the other side of the conversation. I firmly set boundaries that I’m not debating the latest news they’ve heard from their sources. I tell them they will not convince me of their “facts” and I won’t convince them of anything, so let’s move on to the things we have in common. If they wouldn’t let it go, we wouldn’t be talking at all anymore.

It might be more difficult with a parent if you want a relationship, but feel there is nothing meaningful left in common for you to discuss. Maybe reminiscing about childhood / family would be that thing. But, really, if he wants to avoid the conflict of endless discussions of politics, I think it’s worth respecting his request.

Feeling like a failure
Guest Apr 25, 1:42 p.m.
QUESTION: Is it just a normal part of adult (or mom) life to constantly feel like you're failing at basically everything, or is that just depression? I can't figure out if what I feel is a normal reaction to societal pressure to be an impossible level of the perfect mom/wife/employee/other, or if it's just depression raising its stupid and ugly head.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Certainly you want to go through the steps of treating it as depression, because if it is (and it sure sounds as if it could be), then you don't want to leave it untreated.

As you have the medical side in progress, you can also have the nonmedical side going too, since those best practices are similar:

1. Tell societal pressure to erf off. It is not a contest, or a race, or a reality show. Praise dogs. Wouldn't it be awful if it were?

2. Streamline whatever you can streamline. When I'm in a state of unraveling, I sit down with a yellow pad and a Sharpie and dump out everything, all the stressful pieces, then cut it down to the have-tos.

3. Give yourself grace, breaks, forgiveness, belly laughs, deep breathing (box breathing is great), a serious reality check -- whatever it is you need or have closest at hand. The reality check is that perfection doesn't exist, for one, and that the closer people get to achieving it, the less likable they tend to be. K? So.

4. Eat nutritiously, exercise regularly, sleep on a schedule, and tend to other habits that help counteract depression.

This is about anxiety, but so much of the conversation applies to depression too. Specifically, it covers why it can be tempting to push back against "take a walk"-type advice but taking a walk is still good advice.

Anyway. Also, both are "normal" -- overwhelm and depression. Not a failure, and nothing stupid about it. Take care.
did you take your stupid mental health walk for your stupid mental health?

ANSWER: Yes, so glad you brought this up. The kids know, of course, whatever term anyone uses. BUT, there is no need to scream it with the language. My kids' school used "reach, target and likely" as the three labels for their chances of admission. That did help. Plus, the counselors absolutely drove home your main point, not to apply if they wouldn't want to go. Choosing the "likelies" was some of the hardest thinking they had to do.

More reasons not to need flight information
Guest Apr 25, 1:52 p.m.
QUESTION: Some years ago, the airlines started asking for an emergency contact in case something went wrong (with you or the flight). My sister asked if she could put me down because my mom - a normally sane and rational woman - had started to have a tendency to overreact to the idea that her kids were in need of help.

Re Homophobic Relatives
Guest Apr 25, 1:57 p.m.
QUESTION: I'd add one other point to consider... We are living through an increasingly absolutist time. "...[N]o longer tolerating bigotry of any kind" is another manifestation. Can you take a deep breath and help people, especially those who are close to you, get 10% away from their disturbing point of view? 25%? 50, 75, 90%? If you can, you will have done a good thing. I get it, sometimes there is no better answer than walking away. But there's also value (frequently a *lot* of value) in being clear in your position while also being available, welcoming and not shaming toward people who have had a change of heart.

Sit-down dinner DIL
Guest Apr 25, 2:07 p.m.
QUESTION: I'm 100% for not tolerating childish disrespect toward your reasonable house customs and hosting labors. How about workarounds that don't involve cleaning, setting tables, shopping and cooking grown-up menus? Just bare-bones outdoor cookouts. Dessert-only evenings at the card table. Finger food while watching a TV sports event or movie you all agree to watch. Anything except real sit-down meals. And only if your husband will draw a bright line on them trashing you to the family.

For in-laws who refuse to sit
Guest Apr 25, 2:13 p.m.
QUESTION: Personally, I would look for the solution that amused me the most, and I think it would be pretty hilarious to invite in-laws to dinner, set the table (elaborately would be even better), serve the food at the table, but say nothing if the in-laws took their plates and departed. You and your husband could stay at the table and eat as if nothing was happening and in-laws could wander around. What I would NOT do is serve from the kitchen. Make them come to the table to fill their plates then do whatever they like. Better yet, invite other people and have everyone at the table but them.

QUESTION: As someone who also had a big health issue happen in high school is is now 10 years out from finishing my graduate work. I would consider this when making a choice about what school to go to. What resources will she have for her health? What physical and mental health resources will she need/possibly need going forward? I have needed to consider this due to my health. I know as someone young it is not what she would want to think about. But as mom, it might be helpful for you to look into.

Sit down dinners
Guest Apr 25, 2:20 p.m.
QUESTION: agree the in laws are being childish. And also want to add, i had a medical condition once that was invisible and made sitting on a hard surface painful. I carried a donut cushion with me, but lots of folks are embarrassed to do something like that. Maybe FIL is in that category? It’s a possible explanation, not an excuse for his petulant, rude behavior.

ANSWER: Right? So, might need a donut (sorry bout that) ... I was thinking about a back issue, or restless leg.

But sheesh, tell your kid! Or be as vain as you want and hide it from everyone, but don't be rude.

Cancer dog
Guest Apr 25, 2:29 p.m.
QUESTION: I keep a separate savings account just for the dog. I pay a manageable amount into it monthly like a bill. I've been paying into it for all of his life. When my dog got cancer, I had enough to cover the entire bill. Maybe you don't have enough to spare to do that and I get that. But I find that treating it like a bill keeps me consistent.

Flight info straw that broke the camel’s back?
Guest Apr 25, 2:32 p.m.
QUESTION: The DIL suggesting therapy to the MIL asking for flight info to me says there is more to the story and that the MIL has other anxiety-based behaviors that she failed to mention. I grew up with an anxious mother who told me not to cross my legs in the passenger front seat of the car because if we were in an accident my legs would be horribly mangled. It is exhausting to deal with. So maybe asking for the flight info was the straw that broke the camel’s back.

ANSWER: That was my impression for sure. And wow, that example you gave. I didn't have an anxious mom but I have been anxious-mom-adjacent, and that has the exhaustion of truth to it. I'm sorry.

In laws at the table
Guest Apr 25, 2:33 p.m.
QUESTION: I wonder if one or both of the in-laws suffers from misphonia- a condition where certain sounds are literally intolerable (like chewing sounds)? While this is in no way an excuse for such rude behavior, it could be an explanation and a way in to come to a more amicable arrangement. I know that the sounds of chewing drive me into a panic and I have to do anything necessary to get away from it- again, not an excuse for a tantrum! But I do use this knowledge to either guide my choices of interactions with others, whether it’s suggesting other activities than a quiet dinner (uuuuhghhhhh) or quietly discussing alternate arrangements if at family gatherings.

Choice of topics
Guest Apr 25, 2:36 p.m.
QUESTION: I’m going to take issue with the premise that we’re seeing people at “their worst” in Carolyn’s columns or chats. I think, instead, we’re seeing people struggling to do their best, and see the best, in a world that can be incomprehensible, filled with people doing the impossible or inconceivable - what Zorba called the “full catastrophe” that is life, and striving to do better, love better, and hold on to hope.

So I'm going to go now. I appreciate all of you for being here, and hope you have a great weekend -- out of spite if you have to. Hang in there. Gaze at something beautiful. Scritch a dog. Back here next Friday for new catastrophes.

Feeling Unprotected and Losing Trust in My Marriage
Guest Oct 17, 11:02 a.m.
QUESTION: I’ve been married for two years (together for four), and while my husband is a great person in many ways, the biggest strain on our relationship has been his family. They’ve consistently disrespected me, and despite my husband saying he understands, he rarely takes firm action. He tends to avoid conflict and often gives in to their requests—especially financial ones—which has made me feel unprotected and unseen.

We tried couples therapy, but it didn’t help much, because I don’t think the counselor was a good fit. I’ve communicated my boundaries repeatedly, yet he continues to prioritize keeping the peace with his family over my comfort. Recently, I suggested opening a joint account to rebuild trust and create transparency, but he refused, saying he didn’t want “little fights about purchases.” But when I asked if I could have the passwords to his accounts and he said that was fine.

I’m exhausted from being the only one fighting for our marriage. I still care about him, but I’m starting to wonder if we’re simply incompatible—if I’m holding on out of love or fear of leaving. I want peace and emotional safety, but I don’t know if I can have that here anymore.

What would you do in my situation? Can a marriage survive when one partner won’t fully protect you from their family? Do I need to be stronger? I’m afraid of the dynamic if we have a child.

ANSWER: Whoo. I'm uncomfortable answering a question with the central conflict presented in such vague terms. Your husband's family is hitting him up for cash, I take it? Is he giving it to them without running it by you first? Is it $5, $500, $5,000? I can see different answers at the extremes. Plus, I can see "counselor wasn't a good fit" = counselor wasn't good, or counselor wasn't agreeing with you.

However, I can answer part of your, "What would you do in my situation?" especially from my perch in my late 50s: I wouldn't go into anything serious with someone conflict averse. Not a large purchase, not a child, not a business deal, maybe not even plans on Saturday night -- nothing where our interests were combined and I had to count on this person to stand up for those interests. Because I know now that I couldn't.

So, if you are confident that your husband is beholden to his family, and that you are the one he's comfortable disappointing, then you need to say that to him now.

Friend back with abuser - update
Guest Oct 17, 11:16 a.m.
QUESTION: Original poster of last week's chat question here. My friend was being nicer...but she g ot kicked out from her main friendgroup and now she's being isolated, cold, and distant. I'm trying to be a safe presence like everybody said, but it's getting more and more challenging as she now just ghosts people. Not sure how to handle it:(thank you all for supporting me last time.

ANSWER: You're welcome.

I am not going back to the transcript to check details, so this will be a general answer:

You handle it by making regular check-ins with the expectation that you will not get regular-friend reciprocation out of it. Meaning, she will ghost you, or take a kind of rudely long time to respond, or respond defensively, or respond right away by leaning on you hard as if you've talked every day for years when in fact this is the first time she's reached out in months. Because, think of it this way, all her emotional dials and gauges are in their red "unhealthy" zones or else she wouldn't be where she is.

What you're offering isn't a reciprocal friendship (yet) -- it's an escape plan. When she's ready for it. And for it to be effective, what she needs is to get accustomed enough to your presence to think of you when she's in a full cortisol event.

This is the role a person signs up for, if they want to help a loved one get out of an abusive relationship who is still in the cycle of going back and telling themselves no really, it will be different this time.

Should I fake grief I'm not feeling
Guest Oct 17, 11:41 a.m.
QUESTION: My father died 2 weeks ago very suddenly and unexpectedly. I’m not actually grieving since we’d been estranged for the past 3 years. My entire childhood he was either neglectful or emotionally abusive. In plain language he either ignored me or let me know what a disappointment I was to him since I wasn’t outgoing or popular. I was 12 when my mom found out he was cheating because he got his girlfriend pregnant. He moved out of the state with his new wife and didn’t bother visiting me or letting me visit him for the next 5 years. When I finally was allowed to visit him and his new family I couldn’t believe how affectionate and involved he was with my half-sister. When she was 10, the difference in the way he treated her and me at that age was so stark, I had to I talk to him about it. He told me that he was able to love my sister unconditionally, like he never could with me. It was devastating to hear but he blamed it on his “stage of life” and said I shouldn’t take it personally. How do you not take that personally? That was it for me, I stopped seeing or communicating with him. He either didn’t notice or didn’t care. I stayed in contact with my sister by sending birthday/Christmas gifts, texting, Facetime, and on Instagram. Since our dad died, my sister has been calling/texting me nonstop, wanting to pour out her grief on someone who “understands”. Her parents separated last year (infidelity again) so her mother isn’t exactly heartbroken. I love my sister but I can’t possibly share in her grief even a little bit. The only grief I’m feeling is for the father I never had. Especially since I found out that my father told my sister that my mom was to blame for our recent estrangement. That lie would be funny if it weren't infuriating since my mom never even thinks or talks about him. Do I need to fake grief I’m not feeling for my sister’s sake?

ANSWER: Yikes.

No, you do not have to fake grief you do not feel, to comfort the sister you do not identify with.

I do appreciate that you're considering it. It is a kindness toward her that shows the true extent of your grace. Clearly she is not to blame for any harm your father did to you. But still, so many people struggle to separate their difficult feelings so effectively. Many wouldn't even know their sister in this situation, much less be in regular touch, having reached a "Just can't" point with it all.

So if anyone can thread the needle, I'm thinking you can -- of letting her know you feel for her in her grief, and understand in the sense of knowing what she has lost, but not in the sense of having had the same father she did.

From there, you can offer her whatever you're willing. There's lots of range there, 0 to full gusher, and it's entirely up to you. The zero is to ask her kindly to direct her grief to another source of support, "since I'm going through my own process right now"; or saying you can listen as long as it's understood that the two of you are not in the same place; or you can set a time to check in once a week, or whatever. It really is your call.

I am sorry for your loss in your childhood.

In other words, yes, I add my appreciation to the pile and my hopes for real relief, soon. Thank you for this info.

I remember having lunch with a college friend who had just moved to DC, late aughts or early teens, to take a fed job. His was a pretty common story -- educated to the teeth, in-demand skills and taking a significant pay cut because he wanted to serve. (And had to claw for the honor; iirc, it was a sought-after job.) But what brings him to mind now was that he was also looking forward to the stability :-/

QUESTION: Why has Nick been switched (downgraded??) to an illustration, rather than a cartoon? His cartoon were great!
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: No no no, absolutely NOT downgraded.

The illustrations are gorgeous and more work for Nick.

The cartoons were more work for me. I co-wrote them. That plus the seven-day column schedule (with chat) meant I never had room to do anything but that and the seven daily columns (with chat).

Taking the cartoon lines off my writing schedule, and two of the adapted columns, means I can now breathe and think a little about new things to do. Which will come, but it won't be instantaneous because my schedule has been so opened for all of two weeks at this point (and I spent them catching up on some appointments).

Thank you for asking. But please -- do not think for a moment that Nick is seen as anything but valuable here. He also edits my first drafts.

Grandparent name vs stubborn toddlers
Guest Oct 17, 12:17 p.m.
QUESTION: Before the birth of our eldest (now 4, first grandchild on both sides) we had asked all grandparents what they wanted to be called. My FIL chose “Grandaddy”, and our 4 year old went with it. A few months ago our second, now 2, started calling him “Grandy”. Assuming that she would grow out of it eventually, we didn’t make a big deal out of it, just continued using his preferred when we spoke of/to him. But, our 4 yo has started using the shortened name, too. We know it bothers him, so how should we handle it?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: 1. He can correct your 4-year-old, if it bothers him. "I prefer you call me Grandaddy, thank you. Like you used to. Your [brother/sister] can't pronounce it yet, which is why Grandy is okay." You also keep referring to him as Grandaddy, to him and about him to both of your children, out of respect to your FIL, but it is not your job to correct your child on this.

2. Is he always this much of a tool? There is no gift more precious on earth than a grandchild's spontaneous naming. Smh.

Reply to: "Feeling Unprotected and Losing Trust in My Marriage"
Guest Oct 17, 12:26 p.m.
QUESTION: Regarding money and accounts, it would be helpful to know if you both have your own careers / incomes and/or if one or both of you have your own money from before the relationship started.

However, for almost 50 years spanning three major relationships, my rule has always been: "There are three types of money: My money, your money, and our money. We have frank conversations regarding how much money is needed to run the family, pay the mortgage, etc., and where that money is going to come from. And that balance can and probably will change over time. However, once we have a current agreement, we have three bank accounts: Mine, Yours, and Ours. As long as the 'Ours' account is properly and fairly funded, what happens with the money in 'My' account and 'Your' account is only the concern of that individual. I am not entitled to make judgments about your spending and you are not entitled to make judgments about my spending. However, for emergency and life-event situations, we do always make sure to share logins/passwords on the accounts."

Lastly if you don't think the therapist was a good fit, find a different one, even if your husband won't participate (but I think he probably will). And if the next one also does not seem like a good fit, in consultation with your husband if he is participating, find yet another therapist. Keep looking until you get it right. Though it may not be or feel "fair", you are going to have to drive this train.

Wishing you the best!

Not fake grief
Guest Oct 17, 12:32 p.m.
QUESTION: Even in intact families, the loss of a parent can hit differently - each child’s relationship with each parent can be so different. Your grief, over the father you never had, is real grief, just as real as hers is; I think it’s important for you to acknowledge that and honor it, just as you can honor and acknowledge your sister’s grief. As Carolyn suggests, I think that is the needle you can thread - acknowledge that you’re both grieving, but for different reasons, since you had very different relationships with your father, without necessarily going into any detail. From what I can tell, your sister is a teen or a preteen; is there any chance you can encourage her to reach out to a school counselor, who might direct her to a support group, closer to her area (I’m gathering you don’t live close to her). It sounds like she might need day-to-day support, perhaps individual counseling, but I don’t know if you’d feel comfortable suggesting the latter.

Bungee Jumper Dad to Be
Guest Oct 17, 12:48 p.m.
QUESTION: As I read this week's question from a very pregnant woman so furious at her husband, I thought back to when I was pregnant and how mad I got at my husband when he didn't make it to a doctors appointment with me. In fairness, he was super supportive and went to like 90% of the appointments. So why was I so mad? Probably because it showed that at the end of the day, he could walk away (have the beer, eat the sushi etc etc) and I couldn't. So maybe that's the root of at least some of her anger - he can tap out, go on the wild trip, act like there's no baby coming and she.. just can't. The biology isn't fair on this one.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Right, it's not. That cuts both ways, of course. The feeling of being pregnant is just astonishing intimacy with ... life, really, but specifically with the coming new member of the family. It absolutely comes at a cost, just as that freedom to bungee jump comes at a cost.

Comfort with the tradeoffs is why a lot of fits of anger don't happen, at missed appointments or with ridiculous last hurrahs or whatever.

When they do happen, they're not necessarily bad or wrong. They've just got lots of possible explanations -- because there's so much complexity to this stage of life, so much change, and responsibility, so much riding on another person, so much anxiety swirling around in there. Plus, like I said, some hormones adding rocket fuel to it all. So which one is the root of the anger? Any one of them could do it, depending on the couple's history.

Anger is a tap on the shoulder that there's something unexplored or unexpressed that might need some attention. Certainly some walking off, first, to get enough feelings out of the way to figure out what it is.

Recovering after fiancé cheats.
Guest Oct 17, 1:25 p.m.
QUESTION: My fiancé of three years cheated on me and immediately pleaded depression, anxiety, and disassociation. She started therapy and said that she was losing herself in our relationship and needed to work on herself, so we're essentially are broken-up while she does this work. I continue to support her (she is in school with no resources to continue if I don't) as I committed to doing. It's been three months now and she has been consistent in saying that she can't be in a relationship with anyone until she learns to love herself.

I've had a long journey through therapy and cheated myself under similar circumstances in a prior relationship, so I have more understanding than most and I also believe that people can change and learn if they are open with themselves.

But, I feel like she avoiding dealing with the hurt and trauma that she caused me and I don't know how to call this out while being supportive of her process. She's said the expected "I'm sorry for causing you pain by my actions", but we have not done any work on taking accountability, owning decisions, or figuring out where things fell apart that led to the cheating. As each day goes by, I feel like she's "getting away with it" under the guise of doing the work on herself.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: If you are broken up, then she did not get away with it. The consequence was losing you. You are merely honoring a prior commitment toward her schooling (the rest of which I will leave to the lawyers, though I have to think you have other options there if you want them).

If you are merely apart while she goes through school and counseling, with the understanding that you are still engaged, then you are not broken up. In that case, I see your point of her not really having consequences.

That's just the surface-y stuff. I mention it, though, because it seems really mushy, and mushiness always makes things worse. You're looking to her to figure out where you stand, and she seems to be telling you in multiple ways that she can't even figure out who she is. So my suggestion there is to treat yourself as someone who is broken up. It's cleaner, it makes sense (her getting lost to you doesn't sound promising regardless), it's Square 1.

Meanwhile, tho, you're leaving out the inner stuff completely: conscience. Feeling utterly regretful/bad/shamed/worthless/contemptible, just a sampling off the cheaters-who-don't-love-themselves menu, is not my idea of "getting away with" anything, so if she feels terrible, then she's paying dearly for "the hurt and trauma that she caused" you.

She's not saying it to you, maybe, but, back to the beginning: Taking her at her word, her issue was a feeling of self-erasure around you. That, to me, is a person who needs to feel a lot stronger before she's coming to you with anything. Certainly more than a few months.

Meanwhile 2, your inner stuff. If you two indeed are broken up, then your "figuring out where things fell apart" process is yours to do now on your time. Stop looking to her fix it, or you. Anyway, broken up officially or not, she's "consistent" in telling you: She can't. So stop asking. You were betrayed, yes. But whether she "owes" you is immaterial.

Your topic line is "Recovering after fiancee cheats." Recovering is about you, not her. Keep that in mind so you don't lose your focus. Step back, stop looking to be made whole, work (again) on you.

QUESTION: "She's said the expected "I'm sorry for causing you pain by my actions", but we have not done any work on taking accountability, owning decisions, or figuring out where things fell apart that led to the cheating."

She's in therapy to figure this out for herself, so that she even has this information or can perform these actions.

Why are you expecting anything to happen until she has been able to get a lot further in individual therapy to be able to discuss it with you without losing herself in the conversation which has apparently been part of the problem all along?

Disaster surprise birthday party on the horizon
Guest Oct 17, 1:59 p.m.
QUESTION: My brother has organized an ill-advised surprise party for my father's 75th birthday. Our father is a complete introvert and also very exacting. He likes things to be a certain way, and gets tense and angry if everything is not perfectly to his taste. He hates loud places and large groups of people. Unfortunately, he's always used excessive alcohol to handle social engagements and gets belligerent when drunk. Because of all of this, I was surprised when my brother, "James" told me that he'd planned a surprise birthday party of 30 guests for my dad at a new restaurant. The guest list includes the following extremely awkward confirmed attendees: our aunt (dad's semi-estranged sister) who is an overbearing religious fanatic none of us can stand; our mother (dad's ex-wife) who is resented by our dad and hated by our aforementioned aunt because of the divorce; and a number of neighbors who our dad has been feuding with off and on for the last 20 years. I asked my mom why she was going along with this and she said James called in a big favor she owed him and she felt like she couldn’t say no, so he’s pulling out all the stops to make this happen. I don't know how James could possibly think this is a good idea, except that he has a huge ego and believes this will be some fairy tale reunion where everyone will suddenly make nice. I don't mean that James is a bad guy but he has a tendency to steamroll over people and do things "for their own good." Every argument I've made against this party has prompted him to lecture me and act like he knows so much better because he's 7 years older than me. It's true that my Dad can be difficult but I don't want him to feel ambushed on his birthday. If James keeps refusing to cancel should I warn my dad? Or do I just kick back with a glass of wine and watch the drama unfold?

ANSWER: I can't go without answering this one. It's from a past chat and I resubmitted it myself when I saw it in the outtakes, because, wow. (Almost missed it again.)

You have tried to stop James.

Now, this is not for you to fix. I don't know what your brother is doing, either, but it's not your business.

I would suggest, though, that you stay in driving condition in case your dad wants or needs to leave on short notice.

(I hope I'm not too late -- sorry I missed the Q the first time.)

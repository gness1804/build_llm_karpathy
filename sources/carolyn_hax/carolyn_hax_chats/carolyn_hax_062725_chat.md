Hold Your Horses
Guest Jun 27, 11:03 a.m.
QUESTION: My 16yo daughter has her first boyfriend. He is a nice kid. The boyfriend's mom has taken to inviting my daughter to everything and saying that my daughter needs to go "because you are family." The mom wants my daughter to go to church with them every week and was very insistent that she attend their older child's college graduation. Daughter's boyfriend thinks right now - age 16 - that he's interested in joining the military and the mom is telling my daughter that she can live with them - if needed - while he's at basic training. Why on earth would she need to live with them? My daughter says no to many events - she has a job and other friends and us, her family - and my daughter says that she likes hanging out with the boyfriend. My daughter feels like the mom doesn't take no for an answer. The boyfriend just seems use avoidance has his best tactic with his mom. I'm very uncomfortable with his mom's behavior. They are just 16 and have only been dating for 2 months. Is it appropriate for me to talk to this mom? Is that a big no-no and I'm suppose to work through my daughter? I've met this kid's mom over the years and she has a very big, pushy personality.

ANSWER: That's completely bonkers.

It's most appropriate for you to talk to your daughter -- or I should say to listen, a lot, and save your talk for when it really really matters because you want her coming to you.

With all the eye-popping lunacy going on in your letter, the biggest thing is deceptively ordinary: "My daughter feels like the mom doesn't take no for an answer." This means your daughter is talking to you, trusting you (huge) and she is not okay with the mother's lunacy. It is so, so importanrt that you keep these three things intact.

Nothing you consider doing to "stop" (ha) the overbearing mother is worth risking those three pillars of your daughter's mental health: She is talking to you, trusting you and she is not okay with intrusions on her own agency.

This is not to say that the mother is completely off limits. There may be a time where you need to let her know in no uncertain terms where her family business leaves off and yours begins. But that too is a save-it-for-when-you-have-to thing. The biggest threat to your daughter's trust and emerging sense of agency right now isn't this mother, necessarily; dragging everyone into an ill-advised power struggle is the threat. That's why your position, for now, is to focus on building your daughter's strength to remain true to herself through this pressure.

That's another reason "My daughter feels like the mom doesn't take no for an answer" is so pivotal. Your daughter is identifying the problem and opening the door to your help with it. Much of that help, again, will appropriately be in the form of listening. But it is okay to say to her, unequivocally:

"There is no such thing as 'won't take no for an answer.' I am serious: Your no is final. People of character respect that. She may not want to accept your no and feel entitled to push for what she wants -- lots of people do that, this isn't just about her. But that's always their problem, not yours. I hope you understand and trust this." [pause for absorption and acknowledgment.]

Ideally it leads to further conversation. Either way, on the way out, be sure to remind her: "If you ever need me to back your 'no,' I will. And you can talk to me any time."

Acceptance
Guest Jun 27, 11:22 a.m.
QUESTION: Late 30s - I think I’ve finally accepted that if I won’t be enmeshed and feeding approval supply to my mother, that she does not like or even love me.

She was abusive but I was trying to make things work with gray rocking and sticking to pleasant subjects.

Now she doesn’t reach out, she doesn’t say “love you” back any more. She seems to be living her best life. While I want that for her, I still feel some grief and any time I sit still long enough my eyes just start leaking water. But I do accept it, and honestly I think overall I’m much happier than when I stuck around and engaged with her cruelty.

I guess I just would like any suggestions to speed along the process of truly getting over this. Thanks!

ANSWER: I am so sorry.

Think about someone who would be cruel and abusive to their own child. Who would go through the expected demostrations of love only in return for getting what they want -- as the back half of a transaction.

Does this sound like someone who has the capacity for "love" or "like," at least as you have come to understand these things? Meaning ... let's say, based on meaningful shared history, experience, connection, time, acts of giving, the joy of seeing thing through each other's eyes, comfort, familiarity.

To me, these things are anathema to the transactional dysfunction you describe. (And of course it's not just your mom, it's a pretty familiar form of emotional sickness.)

So I think the kindest thing you can do is finish the last few stages of the acceptance process and recognize that the mechanism in her that would produce the connection you crave is just ... not there.

It is, I agree, horribly sad that you got a mother who apparently does not have the capacity to love. It is, however, no reflection on you, nothing you've done, not a sign in any way that you aren't lovable.

In my experience, the combination of allowing yourself to grieve the first part, and then focusing on the second part, is healing.

My sister's pain.
Guest Jun 27, 11:43 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn. It would really be great if you could help me. Right as I type, my sister is typing me about our father, who is deceased. He is all that she wants to talk about these days. It started with a psychic who told her that her depression was caused by our dad sexually abusing her. She was like, "Oh yeah! He did!" No specific memories, but just a "creepy" feeling that she's always had around him. She says she went to a therapist who agrees that 100% she was sexually abused by dad. I ALWAYS want to believe the woman, but I DON'T BELIEVE HER. I feel terrible that she feels this way. But I don't know how to talk to her! HELP!

ANSWER: Oh my. Even if we were given an instruction manual for life, I don't think there'd be anything about how a sibling responds to this.

What may help you here is that you don't have to have a response, per se. You don't have to believe (or disbelieve) her. You don't know what happened and presumably never will, and your father is gone, so life is not reasonably asking you to have an opinion or take a side.

Your sister, meanwhile, does seem to want to tell you about this, but you are not the appropriate person, necessarily, to help her heal. You are/were too close to it yourself -- so you're someone to be updated, if that's what she wants, and to make sympathetic sounds in response to what she tells you. But you are not the right person to bring into her reckoning process. (Check out Ring Theory. As part of the nuclear family, I see you as defensibly innermost to this issue and therefore not a dumping-in place.)

These do simplify your role considerably. You can clarify your role to your sister, too, and put boundaries around it without coming off as an uncaring or disbelieving jerk of a sibling. You can say something to the effect of being glad she trusted you with this, and wanting her to have the support she needs. Then you can say that you feel too close to it as her sib and your father's child to be the place she goes to work through it-- just too confusing and complicated. And you can assure her you aren't shutting down the topic, you just want her to know what you can and can't do right now.

Should I ask or not?
Guest Jun 27, 12:10 p.m.
QUESTION: My partner (P) asked me to fetch them their passport from their travel wallet in our safe. It was not in their wallet where it usually is so I had to look around to try find it. Just before I called P to say I could not find it, I came across 8 pictures in the wallet, 6 were special pictures of P and their close family and best friend. 2 were of P and a particular person of the opposite sex (A), we are heterosexual. When I saw those pictures my body and mind reacted, as if I was not in control of them. I tried to override all the negative thoughts that raced through my mind. Telling myself it means nothing, my mind is just overreacting on the negative side. But this was to no avail, if not making things worse. About 9 years ago before we got married and while we were in early innings of dating, long distance, P told me that someone had asked them if their partner (me) was not worried about P spending so much time with A and sleeping over at A’s house sometimes. At the time I said, no, I was not concerned as I considered A to be a close friend who had previously dated P’s then best friend (B). And that was that. But the pictures of P and A triggered that thought from the archives. Plus I guess how P talks about A more than any of their other friends and has become close to A more than with B and other close friends. All this probably contributed to my reaction, but was never an issue (at least conscious one) until the pictures. I do not think anything physical has ever happened between P and A, they have not seen each other except maybe once or twice in last 3 years or so. Although 6 years ago P went to visit A for a week or so. A was married then and living with their family and kids. So if anything, I guess it would be emotional affair at the worst or just close friends at best I guess. However it’s gnawing at me. Should I ask P about the pictures or should I just keep trying to ignore my mind and it’s normal for one to keep pictures of a close friend of opposite sex in a wallet in the safe among other special family pictures? If you recommend I ask, how do you recommend I ask? I have never had to have such a conversation in my life before and not sure how to approach it or if I should even approach it.

ANSWER: These are great questions. I suggest turning them over in your mind before you say anything, because they can really help clarify what you'd be asking and why.

I believe, for example, that you already know his having pix of A isn't "normal," or that his connection to A is ... different. That's all I will commit to, because there can be so many different iterations of this. They could be having an active affair; she could be the one who got away, with (a) some embers still or (b) nothing left to it now; he could have a thing for her that she never ever reciprocated and he never got over -- but he just had to get on with his life. Which could be something he's very glad he did! His state of mind now and when he put the pix in there could be different, who knows. And so on.

Anyway. This is not to torture you with new possibilities, but to help you map out your own mind, heart, values. You may have someone from your past who fits this "I had to give up and move on" description, only you didn't stay in touch or save pictures -- in which case incorporating it into your happy reality isn't beyond comprehension. Or you may suddenly see this is the end of your marriage. There's so much potential range.

As you sort out possibilities and what you might or might not be able to accept, also work on your knowledge -- including what you already know but maybe haven't let yourself believe/dwell on. This is usually a lot. Then think about what more you need to know.

There's also much potential range in this category -- what we choose/want/need to know. It has always fascinated me, really, how different people are about this. Some people Must Know and some mindfully choose not to, and I long ago stopped having an opinion on the rightness of any one position. Too personal.

When you know you, then I think you'll have a lot better idea whether you want to ask, and if so, what you'll ask, how, when and why. But the opening is, "I found these." Then space for his response. Few words then much silence make a powerful combo for getting an answer.

QUESTION: It is my belief that having a relationship where you fear asking and being vulnerable to a problematic answer so you try to pretend not to know what you know is self-defeating. Ask. listen. Feel. Reply. Ask more. Listen more.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: yes, yes, agree. Two qualifiers (not really the right word). One is that the pre-thinking process can really help with the state of mind we bring to the conversation. Coming in hot and fearful can have a truth-suppressant effect, even when we're talking to someone honest or willing to be honest. When possible, getting into a calm and open frame of mind -- even scared -- can really help.

Two, I think the "I choose not to ask" option is for when you already know except for the actual knowing, and you've decided the answer does not change anything. I don't recommend it for "the truth is too scary." "I can't handle the truth!!"

Credit card fraud and secrecy
Guest Jun 27, 12:42 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn
I wrote you a few weeks ago with a problem. It has since morphed. Husband's best friend's wife approached my husband with a bizarre request which he ducked completely. Unbeknownst to her husband, she took out a credit card in his name and failed to pay the bill she racked up. She asked my husband if he'd lend her the money to pay the credit card. He completely avoided her. She also said her plan was to negotiate with the company to repay them less than she actually owed. My question to you was shouldn't the husband be apprised of all of this and you, not surprisingly said yes. Wife fraudulently took out a card in husband's name and was now damaging his credit while the poor shnook is in the dark. Well, my husband is someone who takes conflict avoidance to a new level. He never returned the wife's multiple calls and never told his friend anything. Bad move, I know. The question is..me. I REALLY don't want to get involved. This is his friend. But I like the guy and don't feel right leaving him uninformed while his credit is shredded. But if I say something, I will ignite multiple explosions. The wife is a piece of work. Friend will be aghast with my husband for not telling him promptly. And my husband will be irate with me. Help.

Value of non-productive time
Guest Jun 27, 12:53 p.m.
QUESTION: You said something in today's column - "You have value for existing — not solely for what you contribute."
Sure, in theory. I think where I get hung up is that I believe everyone should contribute what they can, and receive what they need. (Yeah, I'm a dirty pinko.)
Since I am a person who can contribute, I must. I have no limiting factors to my productivity other than the time I need to spend eating, sleeping, and like, brushing my teeth. I know many people are not as fortunate, and so the inherent value of *their* lives, even though they are not able to be as productive, means that I and people like me must work a little more to keep the whole boat afloat. Does that make sense?
Burnout is always around the corner for me. Can you help me reframe it and really, truly convince myself that it's ok to NOT?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm not sure you need a reframe as much as a closer look at your own picture:

"I know many people are not as fortunate, and so the inherent value of *their* lives ... means that I and people like me must work a little more to keep the whole boat afloat."

You don't define "more." So, more than what? What if only 15 hours a week, say, covered the share any given person needed to contribute, and you satisfied the "a little more" requirement by adding only an hour to that?

By that math, all your burnout hours would be for some vague idea that you had to even though there's no actual need for it. In fact, maybe deciding not to work those extra hours would free up a work opportunity for someone who needs the work.

You're hung up on your own construct. I suggest a construct where you get evenings, weekends and at least four weeks a year off.

Help stuck son
Guest Jun 27, 1:08 p.m.
QUESTION: My son graduated from college, got a good job, lost the jobs after a year and a half and hasn't found another one. He's been applying to jobs on-line for over a year. He's had some phone interviews, but not one single follow-up interview. For some reason, his college is not responding to requests for help. I've suggested he take some graduate classes, but he asks, what if he gets a master's and still can't find a job? I'd like to find him some career counselling, but don't know where to find someone who will be effective.

How do I help him get unstuck, because it's clear to me that doing what he's been doing is not going to suddenly produce a better result, particularly as the gap on his resume just gets bigger.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I can't explain the college career office, odd, and this is definitely not my lane, but this has become (gradually then suddenly) such an issue for recent grads that I want to get something out on the record to acknowledge it.

I also think your son is right not to panic into "graduate classes" without a clear plan. This is the time for him to think of a career path that has openings and is even growing, as others are drying up. If he needs to train for it, then so be it, but specific training/apprenticeship, on the consensus recommendation of people in the field. Very targeted education.

As for career counseling, that's a yes -- first step -- and he can check here at the National Career Development Association to start looking for someone.

QUESTION: You need to tell your husband, point blank, that he will either tell your friend that he's the victim of what is essentially identity theft - doesn't matter if it's someone he knows, it's still fraud - right then and there, or you will, because you do not want to be an accessory to a crime after the fact. Even if the odds you'd be legally charged are low to nonexistent, it's still not something anyone should be okay with. And if he expresses reticence, then say, fine, I'm doing it now. Whatever consequences accrue to your husband from that are on him, not you - and hopefully this is way way WAY off base, but if you are worried about his reaction to the point of feeling unsafe, then it's time to make a plan to get out.

ANSWER: Well, if it's not way way WAY off base, then it's an important warning.

The other warning is the milder one, but still significant -- of being married to someone so "non-confrontational" as to be virtually nonfunctional when anything gross enough hits the fan hard enough to warrant courage.

Plenty of people develop non-confrontational tendencies, for a lot of reasons. But defaulting to them isn't destiny, it's a choice.

"I have no limiting factors to my productivity other than the time I need to spend eating, sleeping"
Guest Jun 27, 1:24 p.m.
QUESTION: Wrong! Whatever the (debatable) value of your productivity is, it also limited by your need to rest. To play. To let your mind wander, so it can come up with cool new ideas that serve your immediate community and the wider world. Operating on the edge of burnout is NOT "productive," especially since you don't know if other demands on your time and energy are in the future. You need to have some "surge capacity" so aim for, like 75% productivity and rest and store up your energy and time and talents for unexpected emergencies.

QUESTION: It may help to keep in mind that your husband's job is to convey the information. Which is hard. But he may be dreading best friend wanting advice on a range of questions (from why did my wife come to you? to should I get a divorce?). Having watched a few friends go through this (one spouse secretly rack up credit card), the outcome on the marriage is not predictable (divorce is not inevitable). All of which to say this is a "I think you should know" call -- and what happens after that is left to the couple (you and hubby can and should stay out).

Secondhand Dog Embarrassment
Guest Jun 27, 1:36 p.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,

I take daily 6 am walks with my neighbor, "Sarah." She is not a close friend, but we are in similar stages of life with the same constraints on our schedules. (If the walk doesn't happen before the kids wake up, then it doesn't happen at all.) Sarah almost always brings along her dog, "Sparky." Sparky is very big and very curious. He has a tendency to run right up to strangers and explore them. I am not a dog expert and can't say whether Sparky is appropriately trained, but I know that this makes a lot of people very uncomfortable, and some even get quite upset (especially those out walking with their own dogs or small kids).

Sarah does not leash Sparky on these walks (as far as I know it is not required). I have been with her for multiple encounters that turn hostile because other people don't appreciate Sparky's friendliness. To strangers, Sarah and I are both responsible. One woman yelled at us about not leashing the dog. Sarah yelled back, and I didn't know what to do other than to stay quiet. I think Sarah was offended that I did not take her side.

What is my role here? I am not a dog person and honestly I agree with the people who don't care for being approached by a big dog that way. Sparky is used to me and doesn't invade my space anymore, but I would find the walks very unpleasant if he did. Since we're in the space of being close acquaintances but not necessarily deep friends, I am unsure of how to handle this. My husband is worried Sparky will attack someone and that I will get sued as a co-defendant!
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: This question is like one of those I Spy photo-riddles where you get to pick out all the hidden objects. Except in this case it's Sarah's horrible antisocial behaviors tucked into friendly neighbors' little morning dog walk.

1. Sparky is *not* appropriately trained, ugh.

2. Not leashing a dog on walks, especially a large spelunker and kid-rusher that upsets people to the point of anger on a regular basis, is so incredibly selfish. And irresponsible. Hello. I would be surprised if there were no leash laws -- I suggest you look it up if you feel like completing the I Spy -- but at this point no one with a clue would need a law to tell them the right thing to do.

3. Okay, you just "think" Sarah was offended you didn't back her, you don't know it. So I'll go light on that sign of entitled behavior.

4. But, wait -- no apology? She and her dog force you to witness a yelling match on your morning constitutional, and she doesn't think to say, "Yikes, sorry about that"?

Your role here is to figure out what your boundaries (limits) are, say them and hold them. So if you don't want to walk with Sarah anymore, then don't. If you don't want to deal with the entitlement-off-its-leash show, then don't. And if you want to be the person who signs up to writhe in discomfort through antisocial behavior while doing nothing about it, then keep doing what you're doing every day at 6.

How you phrase the second option is a challenge because the truth is uncomfortable. But, even if it's Sarah's dog, these walks still involve your time and your comfort, which matter. So: "I want to keep up our daily walks, I enjoy your company. But all the negative reactions to Sparky off-leash are stressing me out. Are you willing to leash him for our walks?" If she refuses, then you say you're sorry but you have to opt out. Not good for your nerves. If she gets defensive and turns on you, then -- well, I hope she doesn't, but it seems like it would be on brand.

For “my sister’s pain”
Guest Jun 27, 1:39 p.m.
QUESTION: While I can be a skeptic when it comes to psychics, in my experience people don’t have “a creepy feeling” about their own parent unless there was a real problem. And of course two people can get such different versions of the same parent.

With that in mind I do think it’s okay to say that it’s too painful for you to discuss with her and point her to support groups and things. I don’t think I would ever tell her that you don’t believe her. You can just start from a place of believing that she is in pain and something was not right.

While my sibling and I both acknowledge the same abusers, even we don’t talk to each other about what we went through without checking first if the other one is open to discussing. And we both have said at different times that we can’t right now, and respected that. There was a brief period where we wanted to talk about it a lot to each other but that is less and less as time goes on. While that time period felt necessary it was also emotionally draining and difficult in a sense that I’m not even sure if I could explain.

I would tell your sister that you can support her in certain ways if that’s helpful (for example going on nature walks together) but that talking about it further is too hard on your mental health. You are not obligated to listen to anyone replay their trauma over and over and you can gently tell people that while you love them so much and you’re so sorry they were hurt, that you’re feeling overwhelmed and where your limit is.

They were never going to be people I could turn to, or who would just love me and want what's best for me. Facing that truth was so painful, and I had to go through a literal mourning period that lasted two years.

All of this to say that I don't think there is a short cut to what you are going through. You just have to mourn what is genuinely a horrible loss.

I am so sorry. You are obviously an amazing person for having offered the grace you have, and now for facing this very difficult path. You are worthy of love and support, and I promise so many other people will offer that to you.

QUESTION: Clearly in this type of emergency, your profile photo must include a Ned.

I considered donating photos of our puppyboy "Dude" but the format doesn't even allow me false options of photo saving!

Re: Credit card fraud and secrecy
Guest Jun 27, 1:47 p.m.
QUESTION: As someone who is also conflict avoidant, this is a little bit of a weird suggestion. Have the husband write out what he needs to tell friend. Keep it short and sweet. Then husband takes that note and reads it to his friend. He can acknowledge that its weird but he has something important to tell friend that he has had trouble saying. I did this once with my doctor with some issues I was having. It helps to have the thoughts already organized and then just read them.

ANSWER: Not weird at all -- we talk about this one a lot around here. It may feel weird to use the cheat sheet in front of the friend, sure, but one work-around for that is to set the conversation in motion to the point the husband can't back out of it now -- either by a cheat-sheeted phone call (don't say that too fast) or a text. "Hey, if you have some time later, I'd like to ask you about something." (funky "ask" working in case friend tells wife about it)

QUESTION: Alison Green of AskAManager.org has rather low opinions regarding college career centers; personally, I'd recommend reading her column first.

QUESTION: Just getting to the chat today. One idea to add to CH's answer. Let your daughter know she may call you 24/7 if she ever needs a ride or your help.

Advice Columnist
ANSWER: This is not only good here, thank you, but I recommend it in general. We told our kids we'd get them/help them 24/7 in an emergency -- no questions, punishments, grilling. It's what we came to when we thought about the either-or. Do we want to cross every responsible parental T in responding to their choices, or do we want them to call us when a situation spins out of control? Talk about a trust fall -- but it was an easy decision.

Value of non-productive time
Guest Jun 27, 1:59 p.m.
QUESTION: I'm not sure that I agree with how you answered this question. The 40 hour work week is also a construct; there is plenty that our personal lives and our communities require to thrive that will take place on some nights and weekends. What I think the writer is missing is that the problem is with how they see themselves in as "a person who can contribute". If they are in burnout, then they are not a person who can contribute. You need to find a way to think of your own well-being as being just as important to the equation as other people's.

ANSWER: I don't agree with myself if I take the nights/weekends/vacation part literally. I meant it to represent work plus life and rest.

But yes, burnout is not productivity.

Re: Should I ask?
Guest Jun 27, 2:03 p.m.
QUESTION: My best friend of 20 years, was my boyfriend for 10 before becoming a friend at all effects. I cant even picture in my mind that we ever had sex, when I try I see two people that are "not us". He is family. If I had some family pics in a safe I would have his too, and maybe not the one of my partner because my partner is... there with me in person.
I wouldnt make anything about those pics, and I would say ask if it's killing your mind - I am sure the answer will be reassuring.
Dont make it a big deal, I would say this in a tender/kiddish way: "I saw those pic and I got jealous! ...Should I be?"

ANSWER: Ah, i was there with you till the "in a tender/kiddish way: 'I saw those pics and I got jealous! ...Should I be?'" Something like that has to be authentic. Or else it will sound disingenuous and forced, and discourage truth telling.

It would be authentic for you, it seems, so it would be the right thing to say. I don't think the OP is there.

If Sarah gets defensive and turns on you
Guest Jun 27, 2:03 p.m.
QUESTION: If you can, say in as calm and friendly a tone as you can, "Okay, well, let me know if you change your mind" and then mention that you have something you have to go do [laundry in the dryer, kid needs something, etc.]. See you later, same tone. Just because she (in this scenario) gets defensive doesn't mean you have to engage. Leave it as friendly as possible. Maybe she will feel ashamed later and change her mind. (Or maybe not.)

Money management
Guest Jun 27, 2:08 p.m.
QUESTION: What do y’all think: is it a good idea for people without kids and not a huge estate get involved in trusts? I don’t really understand them. We do have basic wills but, like most, don’t want there to be any problems after we expire.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Talk to multiple experts. Local, recommended estate specialists, 1 hour intake consultations (perhaps less), discussing your specifics. It's money but well spent given the messes that well intentioned people can find themselves dealing with, and always right as they're grieving someone they love. They're a cautionary tale many of us have lived so others can learn.

Re: Second hand dog embarassment
Guest Jun 27, 2:21 p.m.
QUESTION: I'll bet Sarah doesn't want to leash Sparky because she cannot handle him on a leash. I had a cocker spaniel that could pull my arm out of the socket when he decided to go after something while leashed. I knew a couple of women who were badly hurt when the big dogs they were handling bolted afteer something.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Um. That means no public mingling with the dog, ever. Dogs we can't control stay home and apart from the public. Full stop.

And a dog that's too big to manage on leash like that goes back to dog school or private work with a trainer. Or gets a pull-deterrent setup like a head halter -- plus the proper training, for dog and handler.

This is dog-owner malpractice. They are pets and awesome and wuzzy and our "fur babies" and all, but they are animals and can do harm if not responsibly handled. People who do not know what they're doing have a duty to learn it asap. It's for the dogs' sake as much as anyone else's.

Response to Carolyn asking where post is when we need it.
Guest Jun 27, 2:23 p.m.
QUESTION: My mom used to get really upset at what she perceived as my half-assing. I'm 48 now, have a PhD and a thriving and influential career, and I still think there is very very little that's worthy of my applying my whole entire ass. I'm not interested in burning myself by whole-assing stuff that will be fine if I half-or quarter-ass it.

Being able to achieve maximum economy of ass is an important adult skill. God knows there's no shortage of women out there wearing themselves to nubs because they feel like they can't half-ass ANYTHING. It might help OP's husband to understand that what he perceives as a problem in high school could be a great advantage for the many many decades his daughter will spend out of high school.

Re: college son & career help
Guest Jun 27, 2:39 p.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn gave you a good start. Another good resource - your local library. Libraries often have classes on resumes, interviewing skills, etc., and they may know of a local job coach, too. Your son should also start networking if he hasn't already - join a professional association in his field and go to their meetings, luncheons, etc. And find a volunteer opportunity to fill the gap in his resume.

QUESTION: Understanding that a kid may have trouble actually calling the parent in times of trouble (especially when they made a mistake), we arranged for backups. For our son, for example, his uncle and a neighbor both agreed to be those emergency rides if he really, really didn't want to call us (despite our repeated assurances that there'd be no repercussions).

Credit card fraud
Guest Jun 27, 2:51 p.m.
QUESTION: OP here. Yes I feel totally safe with my husband. He's the guy who relocates spiders and centipedes outside rather than harm them. His problem is what Carolyn mentioned, confronting the hard things. He's the guy who gets a deep gash, bandages it up tightly and then never looks at it again until the wound wrapping shreds to pieces.

Monster
Guest Jun 27, 2:59 p.m.
QUESTION: My husband and I tried for 15+yrs to have a child and it never happened. We missed out on a lot of life trying to conceive and grief. I felt like I was just finding a new normal when my husband received a message from a 26yo young woman, Ellen, who was his daughter from a one-night stand when he was early in college. My husband had no idea. Ellen had been put up for adoption. Ellen is a great person. Her adoptive family kind and welcoming. My husband has developed a good relationship with Ellen. I've kept my distance. I'm happy for them but feel intense jealousy that my husband has a daughter and I do not. Ellen is now pregnant and asking if we want to be bonus grandparents. My husband is enthusiastic and I am not. Ellen says she is excited for her child to have so much love, so much family and I see that but I don't feel that. I know my jealousy and my anger is not healthy or normal. I fear I'm pushing my husband a way. I know I need therapy but I'm afraid the therapist will judge me. I mean what kind of monster am I that I will finally have a child in my life to love and I won't do it?

ANSWER: I went into the queue just to post some reactions, but I want to respond to this quickly -- just go to therapy. Please.

First, most seasoned counselors have seen so much. It's hard to surprise them.

Second, they are in this to help you, not judge you.

Third, what anyone thinks of you is irrelevant, especially your therapist. I hope you see this -- right now your focus needs to be you and getting some peace. Stop with the self-name-calling and go.

To be human is to have some dark thoughts.

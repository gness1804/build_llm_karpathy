I CANNOT forgive my father-in-law for wrecking my gardens
Guest Jul 11, 11:09 a.m.
QUESTION: I don’t know how I’m ever going to forgive my father-in-law for wrecking my gardens. When we moved into our home 3 years ago I assumed total responsibility for the yard and gardens since my husband couldn’t care less about plants or flowers. I’ve been transforming the space with native wildflowers and I planted vegetable and herb gardens. The two pollinator gardens out front drove my father-in-law crazy - he insisted they were weeds and we were going to get a citation. Same thing with my perennial herb garden that took up most of the small side yard. That garden was my favorite, anchored by large sage and thyme bushes that I inherited from my mom. When she knew she was dying, she dug them up and brought them over and we planted them together. They looked bad last year due to transplant shock but this spring they were rebounding.
We went on vacation in early June and my FiL took the opportunity to have a landscaper rip out my pollinator and herb gardens, putting in non-native plants, mulch and edging. He says he spent a fortune and expects me to be grateful. I am devastated and let him know it so he thinks I’m awful. I don’t care. I can’t stand to look at him. I called the landscaper to see if anything could be salvaged but he claims it was all trashed. I’m sure he sold my herb bushes. My MiL claims my FiL is sorry but says I have to accept he’s not the kind of man to admit he did anything wrong or apologize. My husband recognizes the pain I’m in and has offered to help me replant everything. I’m too sad to start. He says we have to move on because even though his dad screwed up badly he meant well. I can’t move on because I don’t agree - my FiL wanted to show that he was right and I was wrong. He's that way - like constantly trying to let our cat out because "cats belong outside" or sneaking hard liquor into our reception because us serving wine and beer wasn't good enough. That got us in trouble with our caterer who didn't have the right license

ANSWER: Whoo. This is the thing: "even though his dad screwed up badly he meant well." His dad did not mean well in the slightest. Obviously you two had talked about it and you had held your "no," so he went behind your back with purpose and forethought.

Your husband, now, he means well for sure -- he is just not there, to the point where he can see his father for who he is. (You are right; profound control issues, rooted in cowardice.) Let's give it a "yet," though. Your husband is not there yet. Because he is supporting you, not his dad, and that's so important.

In fact, my advice is to support his support: Accept your husband's offer to replant the garden with your pollenators. For yourself. for your marriage. Don't wait for him to see his father's emotional sickness to do it. That is a longer term project, but he has gotten a start on it. And hold your line on your message that people who mean well don't do this to prove themselves right.

I am so sorry. I feel sickened on your behalf.

Mom talks with food in mouth—ick
Guest Jul 11, 11:25 a.m.
QUESTION: My mom is almost 90 and, thankfully, in great health. Over the past few years, she’s developed a habit of frequently speaking at meals with food in her mouth. It’s gross.

Our family discusses this habit with each other. But we’re stuck about how to discuss it with her. Our dad, also a healthy 90, seems not to notice. He’s not mentioned it to us.

Next month we’re taking a family trip. For a week, we’ll have most meals together. That means lots of opportunities for chewing and talking. How does a conflict-adverse family discuss this with Mom beforehand?

Thank you.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: She's (almost) 90! You can't look off to the side? Take deep, centering breaths? Focus on her active participation?

Seriously. Before you decide something must be said, do some mental role playing. The business of being 90, even in "great health," is not for wusses. Senses and reaction times simply aren't what they are for everyone a generation younger -- or more if there are grands and great-grands involved. Let's just assume a mind of undiminished sharpness, no ageism here. Eyes probably hardened into the correction zone somewhere between age 40-60 (90-ish percent chance), so we're now plus-decades on that. There is a near certainty of at least some hearing loss. Just these two in combination affect the ability of a person to stay in a conversation with younger people -- unless there's attention to different abilities. There will be muscle atrophy, too, no doubt, and tooth decay and/or dental work, which affect eating and swallowing.

So your repartee with Ma while she's eating taxes her abilities at 90 a lot more than it does yours, assuming you all fall within typical ranges for your age. Needing to focus on things she used to take for granted, meanwhile, would understandably take her focus off things she used to be careful about, such as not talking with a mouthful. Waiting could mean she misses her opportunities to jump in and says nothing at all.

So a little leeway, okay?

For the gardener with the evil father-in-law
Guest Jul 11, 11:27 a.m.
QUESTION: Take as much time as you want to recover, but you should move on for a couple of reasons. First, assume your mother-in-law is correct that her husband will never apologize or admit he was wrong, so it's pointless to wait for some kind of retreat on his part. Nothing would rebuke him more than ripping out the offensive landscaping, and the sooner the better. Second, your father-in-law needs to see your husband helping you replant what you want, and demonstrating that between the two of you, he is backing you. Third, letting his monstrosity remain in your yard will let him think that he is right. Ripping it out and restoring your garden will demonstrate that you will make decisions about your yard, not him, and that no matter how many times he "spends a fortune" you will just rip it out. Get back up on your feet, champ.

Should I tell my daughter she’s cut out of her dad’s will?
Guest Jul 11, 11:32 a.m.
QUESTION: My ex cut our daughter, Anna, out of his will to spite me because I divorced him late in life. He showed the will to me. He is very old, has cancer, and is still lucid, so I doubt he’ll change it. He’s leaving everything to his sons from his first marriage. He says Anna can inherit from me (I’m 15 years younger than the ex). The sons will presumably inherit from their mother, too. Should I tell Anna what I know? It will obviously affect her relationship with her father. If not, I can see her shock after his death — and my sense of remorse for keeping a secret.

Landscaper
Guest Jul 11, 11:40 a.m.
QUESTION: I am a fellow gardener and am furious just thinking about this happening.

1. Call the landscaper again and have them come and remove everything at their cost. How on earth did they do this project without confirming that the client was not the property owner?

2. Get yourself and your husband into counseling immediately. That he does not see what a manipulative violation this is frightening.

3. Keep a safe distance from the FIL, especially if you have children. He has repeatedly shown that he cannot be trusted. This is someone who is capable of physically imposing his will on other people and repeatedly violates their boundaries.

This is not a nice person. He knew what he was doing and did it anyhow -- this was a power move to assert his dominance over you, your husband, and your marriage. .

Mommy war/Daughter war
Guest Jul 11, 11:43 a.m.
QUESTION: Apparently the daughter of my mom’s friend believes that each of our (deceased) moms felt that the other’s career/parenting choice was best. She had a great career and two kids, I had kids a bit later in life—a cross-country move and husband’s job helped us choose to put my career on hold. We’re all in our 60s now, and that hold has held.
However, she went on about me “living in luxury and traveling the world on my husband’s income” and not using my degrees. I said that wasn’t quite right, as I had used them. She responded with her lengthier resume. And then added a message about telling other people she doesn’t know me.
This is just a message on social media, but as a former family friend, I feel not responding is rude.
But I don’t know what to say, as I think anything I do say will be taken the wrong way.

How about “Sorry it took me so long to respond, I was out of cellphone range cruising the Adriatic”?

Making peace with spouse's neglect of health
Guest Jul 11, 11:50 a.m.
QUESTION: My spouse has a medical condition that with no action on their part lead to organ failure, need for an organ transplant and/or cancer. They were told they needed to lose weight and become more physically active, neither of which have happened since diagnosis (over a year ago). How do I make peace with this?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Is your spouse receiving support for the weight loss? Because if not, then the doc's prescription is virtually useless. Before you skip to peacemaking, look for a doctor who specializes in personalized weight loss support. The obstacles are so much more complex than the finger-pointers ("willpower fail") would have you believe.

Pool aunt and uncle letter
Guest Jul 11, 12:03 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi,
I read the question about the aunt and uncle who were being strong armed into babysitting and wondered if there might also be a component of their siblings trying to encourage a relationship with the kids. Of course asking for child care over a vacation is one thing but the “we’d prefer family” made me wonder if it’s a clumsy attempt at trying to make a relationship. Do the aunt/uncle spend any time with the kids?

Maybe they don’t want to, which is entirely in their right, but a teeny bell went off for me as I was reading the letter.

Or maybe I just want a pool to go sit by. I’d be no trouble!
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yeah no. Parents can be present to foster the relationship, if that's what they really want. Or they can say out loud they want the uncle/aunt to know the kids better.

Think about it. The cover story is usually virtuous for the scammy ulterior motive. So who would use the scam -- free babysitting -- as a cover for the virtuous -- closer bond with the kids?

Approaching 30 and feeling dread
Guest Jul 11, 12:06 p.m.
QUESTION: I turn 30 this year and I have a constant feeling of dread. On paper, there is so much I should be happy about - great friends, family, super intense but fulfilling job in the best city in the world. For now, I've reached my academic and professional goals. I have a very full life. But I just feel so lonely. My work is social in that I have great work friends and a lot of my job is spent talking with people. I have plans with friends several nights a week. I visit my parents (3 hours away) 1/month. But I dread going back to my empty apartment in the evening and I dread waking up in the morning to just myself.

I recently broke up with my ex and I miss him so much it hurts. I also just miss having someone there and I miss being there for him. But I know that regardless of having/not having a relationship, I don't want to dread being alone. Everyone says "go to therapy!" but I'm trying that and it's not helping. It's mostly just me blabbing for the whole session. I feel guilty for feeling so blah when it feels like I have everything going for me. How do I reset?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I don't know how "recently" you broke up, but feeling lonely in your home as you recover from that sounds right. Healthy. Normal. It's not going to feel good, but sometimes it's healthy and normal to feel bad. It's part of the healing process.

So having social friends and good work friends and parents you can and want to see often, and a fulfilling job, and a city you love? Plus therapy as a safety net as you heal? That all sounds like good stuff to have in place as you go through the emotional hellscape of post-breakup recovery.

If I'm right that that's what this is, then there's no shortcut "reset" option. You kind of just have to feel it until it doesn't hurt so much.

Except the guilt -- that's crazy talk. There's no "everything going for you" exception when you're hurting and you miss someone. Breakups and other losses come for us all. I'm sorry. Make sure your closer friends know you're struggling so they can be there for you extra.

(If I'm wrong ... or even if I'm not, then I'm thinking more truth-telling in therapy is warranted. Admit the guilt and the "It's mostly just me blabbing.")

QUESTION: A person who doesn't like you yard can't simply trespass onto and destroy it. I would recommend spending an hour with a lawyer to determine if you can force your FIL and/or the landscaper to pay to return your yard to its original state. Just because FIL is related to you doesn't mean he had the authority make changes to your property (unless he owns it). He couldn't do it to your neighbor and he can't do it to you.

Walking on eggshells
Guest Jul 11, 12:22 p.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,
I’m married to a man with two teenage children; we also have two young kids together. (It’s a second marriage for both of us.) He has a high-pressure job and carries a lot of stress, which often sets the tone for our entire household. We find ourselves walking on eggshells, and his OCD tendencies—likely a way of coping—are making home life more difficult for everyone. I’ve raised this with him gently and directly several times, but little has changed. I also feel like a single parent to our young children, as he’s often mentally elsewhere, absorbed by work or stress. How can I support our family and create a more stable, peaceful and engaging home without constantly confronting him or waiting for him to change?

- Overwhelmed
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: This sounds like a couples-counseling situation, not so much in a let's-dig-into-our-feelings way but specifically for the purpose of setting up practical adaptations to get the household working better.

Think about it: He's stressed from work pressure, then he comes home and stresses out you and the kids -- and that's when he's theoretically supposed to be decompressing from work. And then on top of that, he's going to do the mental/emotional labor of figuring out how to change his coping methods into something more family-friendly -- while also stepping up to his fair share of the household labor and having more meaningful engagement with his kids.

You're not wrong (by implication) that your having to function as de facto single parent is unfair, that it's tough on the kids, that he's the one whose approach needs to change. But being right and having sympathy for his predicament are not mutually exclusive.

Getting objective, trained eyes on this can help you two figure this out. Maybe how to give your husband some room to decompress when he gets home, for example -- built into a routine -- so that he's able to be present for all of you, instead of limping along basically incapacitated. How to add hired care strategically to ease pressure points. Etc.

Making it an appointment with you and a trained pro means it's something you work on together, in a dedicated time and space, sharing the workload, instead of asking him to figure it out by himself mid-stream.

Trying to solve stress while stressed is setting yourselves up for failure, with all of the best intentions. Stepping back and treating it as a design problem, then hiring a designer, sounds more like it. Certainly less charged.

Husband's friends are a bad influence
Guest Jul 11, 12:29 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,

My husband and I were struggling in our 15 year marriage. We tried a 6 month separation period. We both worked on ourselves and missed each other during this time. We are both in a place where we'd like to try again.

While separated, he became part of a new social group, linked to a casual friend of both of ours. He seems to have spent some time venting about me and the marriage to these friends. The casual friend, it turns out, felt this was a time to take sides, and he took my husband's side. My husband was ok with that (ugh).

I can't see us reconnecting if these friends stay in the picture. I understand that he needed a social life during a difficult time, but he agrees that they aren't really fans of me or supportive of our marriage. However, he is very unwilling to give them up. He has even lied to me about them, pretending he has cut ties.
What do you advise??
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Of course they sided against you -- your husband was venting about you and the marriage. They got the full dump of everything your husband wasn't liking about you at the time. (You didn't have a friend you confided in?) If you were to have heard an anonymized version of the information he was dumping, then you might not have liked you, either.

I can see (but don't agree with) your "We can't move forward with them in the picture" argument. Somewhat like, newly sober person can't move forward with drinking buddies still around. But you've hit the asked-and-answered point already. You drew the line for your husband and he said nah, friends stay.

So that leaves you with three choices: quit on the reconciliation, find a way to make peace with the friends, or convert this to an unwinnable recurring fight.

There are arguments for 1 or 2. My bias, there's never an argument for 3 except a delight in perpetual suffering.

Argument for 1, the lying! Omg. What is he, 15 and sneaking out on his parents?

Argument for 2, your ask was an overreach. Telling partners they can't see someone is a this-already-isn't-working first step. Either they get it without being told or you trust them without having to control their friendships.

In this case, a viable option for you was to say to husband, "Hey, this was your dump-out friend who heard the worst about me. Not going to be an issue?" And you trust his answer. Just as he would trust you on your staying close to the person who heard your worst about him.

QUESTION: As horrifying as the garden situation is, there is an impending tragedy with the cat if the FIL is allowed in the house. There are reasons why indoor cats live much longer. Likewise, should the couple have children, who knows what boundaries he will cross.

Also, while the MIL is not the LW, there should be concern about her well-being and safety based on her willingness to excuse the FIL's unreasonable behavior.

ANSWER: Well yes, and then there are the songbirds. This to me is down the road with the OP and the husband, part of ... well I'll just quote my original answer ... "That is a longer term project, but he has gotten a start on it. And hold your line on your message that people who mean well don't do this to prove themselves right." This couple have work to do.

But it does start in the garden, and it has started.

Maybe the size of the overstep will be what finally exposed the size of the problem. (A concept that has been on my mind a bit lately.)

The MIL is her own concern right now, unless OP has witnessed something that can improve the husband's grasp of the truth.

Strange email
Guest Jul 11, 1:02 p.m.
QUESTION: I got an email from an old girlfriend saying she is in a 12-step program and as part of it she is apologizing to those she has hurt. So she was sorry for hurting me. Nothing about what might have been hurtful, just a generic "sorry." How to respond? This was so long ago and the apology is so vague and generic that it doesn't even seem genuine. I broke up with her, so it's hard to imagine what this might be about. Anything I've come up with so far seems snippy: best of luck with your recovery? what are you apologizing for? Maybe no response would be better, but that seems churlish.

90-year-old with chewing issues

QUESTION: As an older person, I second what Carolyn says. My processing is a little slower than it used to be, and I’ve found that if I can’t jump in with a comment soon after I think of it, I either lose track of it in the flow of conversation or someone talks over me. If you want participation from the 90-year-old that you presumably love, look at your plate and fiddle with your food while she’s talking and be glad she’s still able to participate. Chiding her will humiliate her and may shut her down entirely.

Exhausted Husband
Guest Jul 11, 1:21 p.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn, I love my wife of nearly 20 years. But her insomnia is driving me insane. She is approaching 50 and believes she is in perimenopause, which is contributing to her difficulty falling asleep. Her sleep routine has become more and more elaborate as she tries to occupy herself and/or coax herself to sleep. There is the white noise machine. An app that reads boring stories in a monotone voice. Or she sometimes plays favorite shows from the 90s (that I find funny, which keeps me up listening and laughing.) sometimes there is music, other times whale sounds, or rainforest…. and there is the (very expensive) hot and cool fan so she can switch from hot to cold depending on what she needs. And so many blankets and different pillows. And lavender spray on our pillowcases. And sometimes she wants the dog to snuggle and other times the dog’s breathing disturbs her and he must go. Sometimes my breathing, body heat, proximity, or the fact that I can fall asleep in about 5 minutes when she cannot, all seem to disturb her and she will wake me up to complain about it. Carolyn. I am an understanding person. I love my wife. I feel she is suffering and should speak with her doctor. She says this is just something she has to go through. But I don’t know if I can make it. I need my sleep and all of this noise and temperature changes and disturbances are now messing with my ability to fall and stay asleep. I’m starting to think Desi and Lucy had a good idea with their separate beds. Any advice for me? I hope this is coherent - I’m exhausted!

Response : walking on eggshells
Guest Jul 11, 1:32 p.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,
I'm the overwhelmed wife who wrote you earlier. I failed to mention that I've requested couples counseling (I'm in counseling on my own ) and have been met with much resistance. He doesn't think he needs counseling and it feels like an additional demand on all the other demands he has. I am trying to figure it out without pushing too hard. I appreciate your thoughtful advice.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ugh. I'm sorry. It's not "he" needs counseling, it's "we." WE need help with a situation that is not tenable.

This is about lessening the demands -- or else you would not be asking.

Does he trust you enough to trust that? Because:

It is not okay like this, to have this much tension in a home.

It is not okay for you all to be walking on eggshells.

It is not okay for you to be doing the bulk of the parenting. Because he and the kids are missing out! Workload issues aside.

A workable household is not "an additional demand on all the other demands."

Again -- it's to lessen demands.

So I'm seeing stress, eggshell-walking, stubbornness, mention of OCD. Are you ever concerned he will react explosively? Because then you have a different thing, which I hope you are talking about with your therapist, if true. That would nudge this toward a safety issue for you and the kids.

Sobriety
Guest Jul 11, 1:41 p.m.
QUESTION: Alcohol use disorder is so misunderstood in our booze pushing culture. How do I share with my far flung family that I had a bad problem with alcohol but I got online support and found freedom 2 and a half years ago? I would like to be forthcoming but I fear judgement. I have a feeling that other family members might be as hidden as I was in their alcohol addiction.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Good for you for getting yourself and your life where you want them to be.

That is what matters. Not how others respond to your sobriety, and not where other family members are in their relationship with alcohol. I understand they're family and you care, but their opinions of you aren't your business, and their substance use isn't, either.

What you choose to tell them, though, is. So I hope you will be forthcoming, if that's what you want to do -- because you want to be honest about you, not because you want to fix them. I suggest you line up support before you do, though, so you have someone to talk to about their reactions. In case there are some difficult ones.

ANSWER: Right. The one thing you refuse to do in the overwhelm can't be the planning session to tame the overwhelm. That just makes no sense.

What does make sense, though, is that he'd be reacting to it emotionally as one more "you're bad and doing it wrong" correction, even if that's clearly not what it is. The reactivity is doing the thinking, which is the telltale sign of a spiral.

Though one cx, I'd say the time, the energy and most important the humility to agree things must change. thanks

QUESTION: I hope your wife can find a physician who specializes in working with women during menopause, as there may be treatments that can help with her pervasive insomnia. Women tend to think they just have to endure symptoms even though they are causing distress and leading to sleep deprivation. These symptoms do not just stop on their own, they can go on for years.

ANSWER: Plus, treatment has come a long way from "nope, can't do that" based on flawed or nonexistent studies. ("What, women have bodies? Huh.") Still has a long way to go, but the idea of just gutting it out before even looking for options is bananas.

QUESTION: You sound like me, holding it all in, I “should” be good. But really, just cry. Cry as much as you need to. It will help, I promise.

Re: additional demand

QUESTION: I’ve been there. You need to acknowledge that he’s right - in the short term it is an additional demand and will feel HARD and overwhelming (ask me how I know). But this is a long term problem and the goal is making long term progress. Which you can’t do unless you set aside the time.

Just wanted to point out that I am struggling to pick out the questions today amid comments about the destroyed garden. I'm guessing, but it looks like the biggest outpouring I've ever gotten in response to a question.

What's wrong with telling a loser that they're a loser?
Guest Jul 11, 2:12 p.m.
QUESTION: I'm reading your response to the mom doesn't want to meet her 24 y.o. daughter's 46 y.o. boyfriend, and I do NOT understand why parents should play nice with effing losers preying on young women. My kids aren't old enough to be dating, but if my daughter showed up with a 46 y.o., I'd be civil, but privately I would tell him what he is: a pathetic man-child who needs to prop himself up with youth and beauty in order to feel good about himself. There is no way a man that age values a woman that age for her full humanity. It's all about the fountain of youth. Why in god's name should I pretend to be ok with that?

ANSWER: So you know all the things? All the 24-year-olds? All the 46-year-olds? All the ways they may have met? All the personalities, all the interests, all the conversation topics?

You won't get an argument from me that there's a general experience and power imbalance, no. Problematic, yes. But you'll get 100 percent resistance that every and all fit into that general concept and therefore no relationship with those ages can ever be okay. The range of humans is too great.

Re: Exhausted Husband
Guest Jul 11, 2:16 p.m.
QUESTION: As a person who has suffered with insomnia for much of my life, and is in the midst of the menopause transition, I sympathize with your wife (and with you). I agree with Carolyn that separate rooms, if possible, may be the best and easiest option. I'm in my mid 50s now I find most of my couple friends have separate rooms often for this reason. It only helps the relationship. I also second Carolyn's advice that your wife speak to her doctor if she hasn't already. Sleep deprivation is extremely dangerous to a person's health. It increases risks of heart disease and stroke, can lead to unhealthy weigh gain, and can be very dangerous when driving just to name a few consequences of prolonged sleep loss. If she can get to a sleep clinic that may also be helpful. Good luck to both of you. A good night's sleep is really important for everyone. I hope you can both find it soon.

ANSWER: Yes, yes -- asking someone to go without sleep for feelings is just not okay. Baby care, jobs, etc.,sometime it's necessary, but not, "It's bad for a marriage!" or even worse, looks bad for a marriage. Thanks.

One more Ned for the road, in which he shows you what a patient and talented boi he is. Or what sickos his people are, it's all about perspective around here.

Thanks for stopping by today. Have a great weekend, out of spite if you have to. Plant something for your pollinators for the cause, too, if you get a chance. See you back here next week.

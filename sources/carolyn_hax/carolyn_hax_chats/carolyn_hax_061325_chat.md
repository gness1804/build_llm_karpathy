living on a golf course
Guest Jun 13, 11:05 a.m.
QUESTION: We recently purchased our last (we hope) home in a lovely, large gated community with an 18-hole golf course. We do not play. One of the fairways is directly behind us, with a handful of trees forming a barrier of sorts. There was some golf ball damage noted on the back of the house upon inspection, but it was minor and we proceeded with the purchase because the house checks every other box for us. Surprised and unhappy to learn, however, that any damage caused by a golf ball is NOT the responsibility of the golf course, nor of the player. It is strictly on the homeowner per the HOA! So when I should be enjoying our screened-in porch, sipping iced tea and watching the birds, instead I find myself shooting death stares at anyone whose golf cart makes a beeline toward our back yard to retrieve their balls, and some even rooting around in our yard. This is messing with my serenity and my sanity. When (not if) the damage happens, given that I have no legal right to pursue these folks, how do you suggest I approach them?

ANSWER: As a homeowner who didn't do sufficient homework, and has no right to death-stare golfers as if that's their fault. I'm sorry.

When I read your subject line, my brain filled in the popcorn sound of golf balls hitting your house. It also brought back memories of a lot of years of organized baseball with my kids, with everyone's foul balls hitting the decks, siding, cars of neighbors whose properties abutted the schools and parks. At least the cars with Massachusetts policies, IIRC, got their windshields replaced with $0 deductible :)

I suggest you have a sit-down with your reality, serenity, sanity, available funds and on-call contractor list, and decide which you prefer: to accept the inevitable, or move one more time to your really-this-is-the-last-one last house.

Because sitting out there in your yard thinking you should be having a golfball-free experience next to a golf course is a recipe for daily fury and stress.

I can’t make a phone call
Guest Jun 13, 11:07 a.m.
QUESTION: I need a root canal but I’ve been putting it off for 3 months because I have to call to make the appointment. I haven’t been able to find any in the area that do scheduling online. I really need to have it done in the next few weeks so it doesn’t get worse before I go on vacation. The number is written down in front of me and I’ve gone over what to say in my head a thousand times but I just can’t. It’s like I’m paralyzed. How can I get past this?

ANSWER: Will a friend or fam member do it for you? It's okay to say. "I have this weird block, help me." You can pay back in kind, a no-judgment assist with someone else's weird mental block.

Other option -- go to the office to sked in person. If it's a phone thing.

Follow Up From Step Mother
Guest Jun 13, 11:18 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,
I wrote to you about my husband's support agreement with his ex that makes us pay $15,000 per year for extracurricular activities. We had to see a lawyer because we went past paycheck to paycheck, we were increasing credit card debt every month. The lawyer said we shouldn't worry about the college expenses clause because If my step-son picks a private college we can probably win at court to pay 1/3 of in-state rates because that is how most of these agreements are written. He said the proportion of our income to step-son's expense was high so we could meet with my husband's ex to cap expenses a bit lower. Even an extra $5,000 per year to us would make a big difference. His ex refused to meet with us, she would only discuss this in court in front of a judge. The next court date was in 9 months, the lawyer charges more for time in court, and there is no guarantee anything would change. We made two changes on our own. I picked up a side gig to bring in more money. I get out of going with every weekend to the tournaments because I am working. I will drive to and from practice when I'm able, I will go to home games and watch him. I don't like the whole weekend tournaments. If this was once or twice a year, I could go, but it is at least 2 weekends out of the month. The other thing is that my husband made an agreement with his ex that he would pay his half by paying the bill directly. Before he was Venmoing her 50% of the bill she screenshotted. We are putting all our credit card expenses on his credit and he will file for bankruptcy when our step-son is out of high school.

ANSWER: Oh yes this is definitely different stakes, racking up debt -- I'm sorry. Has your husband approached the coach/program? There may be a discreet way to get relief that way. Definitely depends on the quality of the program and the people involved.

In the best sense and in the worst: I'm loath to say this, because I don't want even to imply that if you aren't successful, it will be due to your stepson's shortcomings as an athlete. But the corruption of US youth sports is what it is ... and a lot of game-changing players with money issues happen to find they have secret Santas.

But there are also solid orgs that make sure any player's family, starter or bench, has adequate financial support and a quiet avenue to secure it. Including one that takes separated/divorced parents into account. [Read the original column here.]

QUESTION: Are there rules to this? I belong to an online forum of a few hundred users, and have ignored/blocked some others and there's a big kerfuffle going on about how blocking is rude, but is it? If a lot of people are blocking you such that you feel ignored, isn't that a you problem not a them problem? The biggest griper just writes rambling tl;dr screeds too often, I don't even disagree or dislike her it's just too much. Anyway, tl;dr is blocking rude?

ANSWER: I think there's a Golden Rule, don't bring behaviors to a forum that make everyone instantly tired.

If there are rulebook rules. then the ones being broken here are, in order of importance, no rambling screeds; no public griping about other people's screed appreciation habits; no conflating of "block" and "ignore."

"Ignore" is for people you generally like but are wearing you out. "Block" is the dead-to-me button to enough people that it's best reserved for that.

I agree with you on the principle, though -- that no kerfuffle was ever necessary and the fact of one makes the case that it's entirely on the person griping. If I take this forum correctly, then your posts are all basically the publishing arms of your selves, so if one of you wants to pause your subscriptions to some members for whatever reason, then so be it. Nothing personal.

Wait -- did I kerfuffle by answering this? Did you by asking?

opting out of college
Guest Jun 13, 11:45 a.m.
QUESTION: My just-graduated son and my one-year behind daughter have said they are not attending traditional college. My son was never academically inclined, so choosing trade school (plumbing) is disappointing but not a shock, But my daughter is a star student, They both believe that AI will soon eliminate entry level college graduate jobs unless physical presence is part of the job. My daughter does not want to teach or gp into anything medical, so her plan is to enter a car mechanic program where she can make use of her computer and technical ability. I'm not sure what I should do - I'm hoping to convince her to apply to college in the fall to keep her options open, But I'm also not sure that she's wrong. And advice?

ANSWER: Whoa wait a minute. Why is your "never academically inclined" son's decison to choose trade school for plumbing "disappointing"?

I know it's not your question, but I tripped over it so hard that I think it's germane to your question. To me your son's decision looks like an unqualified win. Practical, smart, suits him -- right? So if you have a bias that prevents you from seeing that, then you'll want to take that into account and dismantle it before you make any decisions about your approach to your daughter. Certainly before you say anything to her.

And that's even before you deal with the obvious flaw in speaking up now: that you admit openly that you don't even know enough to make a reasoned counterargument.

Your kids are right that many sectors of the job landscape look like an animated Dali painting. (Then there's the economy, depending on its given day in court, holy cats.) But then, is she right about cars? You will have to do some basic temperature-taking before you presume to "convince" anyone of anything.

More important, though, I suggest you draw your daughter out on the idea of: her interests, her idea of what she wants her life to look like (i.e., what is work for, on the "enough money to live" vs "purpose" scale), where she might want to be, whether she sees herself as doing one thing over a lifetime in various stages or multiple different things across a lifetime, maybe even completely different things.

If you can get your single KOLLEGE idea out of the way of your ear passages, this could be a fascinating series of talks. (Listens, really.)

Great for your son too IF he's not already set with his choice and IF broaching the topic wouldn't come across as disappointment in his choice. If there's any risk of that, then leave it be. It really does sound like something you want to back 100 percent with 100 percent sincerity.

For "disappointed" parent of would-be plumber
Guest Jun 13, 12:08 p.m.
QUESTION: I want to second Carolyn's getting hung up on the "disappointed" part of opting for a trade. Speaking as the daughter of someone who was a (smart, gifted) guy in the trades, who also kinda bought into the notion that he was less-than because of it, I want to say loud and clear that trades require smart and capable people. PLUS- we NEED people in the trades. Your kids would likely be employable for life, quite comfortably. On more of a personal level, if you let it be known that you're disappointed by your son's choice, you will undermine his success by planting the seed in his mind that he's less-than, too. It will not go well for any of you, long-term.

Guest Jun 13, 12:11 p.m.
QUESTION: These kids are SO smart. I don't necessarily agree with their thoughts on AI but who cares-- they have a plan! That is worth so much. They will be set up for success relatively quickly. I say this as someone who is very academically inclined and thrived in college and grad school-- if I had any kind of technical or manual skills, I would have focused on that. I certainly would have made more money faster. Also, not for nothing... college can wait. We do our kids a disservice by expecting them to go straight from high school to college when they're not ready or it doesn't make sense.

IMPORTANT re: why are people so secretive about cancer
Guest Jun 13, 12:39 p.m.
QUESTION: Can you continue this important discussion from the 5/16 chat about why people may not go public with the ir serious illness? As a cancer survivor, I’d like to add to the response to the person who was having a hard time understanding why people are still so “secretive” about cancer. The people, who made me feel loved and supported during my cancer treatment, understood that I was protecting myself by not making my diagnosis common knowledge. It isn’t secrecy and hiding; it’s privacy and boundaries. When you have cancer, sometimes it seems like you are being asked to provide support to other people who make your cancer diagnosis all about themselves and what they want and how they think things “should” be handled. People can treat you differently once they know. Some people have lost their job when word gets out. Also, google “cancer ghosting”. It shouldn’t happen, but sadly it happens to many people and even family members may ghost a cancer patient. Poor reactions and comments are much harder to take when you already feel so incredibly ill from treatment, and you have no emotional reserve for dealing with extra things like you do when healthy. You may not be able to see from the outside all the consequences for someone else in not granting privacy that they’ve specifically requested around their diagnosis. When I got cancer, I followed the lead of a dear friend who decided not to tell many about her cancer recurrence and terminal illness because of the upsetting things people did the first time around. Even though I shared only with my inner trusted circle, I still had some hurtful reactions after confiding, like being called “secretive” to my face by a friend. She made me feel judged, disrespected, and unsupported during a terrible time in my life. More power to people who want to let everyone know. That's great if it’s what the person with cancer chooses. But, love for you can be present even when someone didn’t confide. Don’t wait for illness to tell people that you care for and love them. I’m not advocating AT ALL for withholding a diagnosis from one’s inner-most circle and yes, those in the inner circle may need a trusted outlet too. But, it’s sad when people are not respectful about others’ privacy and their carefully thought out life choices. I am almost 2 years cancer free and hope to help cultivate more understanding toward

ANSWER: Thank you for bringing this back up. Going through the outtakes was really frustrating that day, because the queue was filled with "privacy isn't secrecy" assertions -- which of course is true. People put so much work and feeling into their accounts of maintaining their privacy during an awful time in their lives -- but I was the one asking, and I was asking about secrecy. To use your words, "withholding a diagnosis from one’s innermost circle." As you may recall, this thread started because the spouse of the OP insisted on withholding his cancer news from everyone but OP. Which is more than privacy.

So I got to see it from the OP’s side and have heard from others in that position, who were sworn to secrecy. I have heard from many who did not know of a loved one’s cancer until they got news of their death. But it’s rare to hear from the people insisting on this choice. That's why I asked.

The scant response I have gotten is that people wanted to be treated as themselves, not as Sick. I do sympathize. (I would still urge allowing some support outlet for the lone person who knows, assuming there is one. There typically is, given the necessities of care.) I would still like to hear a response to my question.

So, to reiterate, I understand the decision to maintain privacy. People's repetitive, rude, nosy, me-centric, unsolicited Ring Theory violations are known to anyone here regularly, since, "How do I stop people from pushing their judgments/feelings/treatment advice on me," is a chat staple.

Also, no question, this is the ailing person's decision. Even if it's not one I'd want my loved one to make. I am not looking to argue otherwise.

I am sorry you got a big dose of people's stupid when you were in treatment -- but yay to the almost two years.

Thank you again for the invitation to come back to this. It also allows me to mention The Post’s recent reporting on the spike in cancer in young people . Tl;dr: Get checked when you feel weird, and don’t take “you’re too young” for an answer.

What do you do when you can’t do anything?
Guest Jun 13, 12:43 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn:

I know you’ve written about things to do when everything gets overwhelming, but what do you do when you can’t do anything?

I’ve written and called my representative and senators and attended their town halls and gotten zero response (other than fundraising requests) — not even acknowledgement of receipt.

We are beyond broke right now, so I send what I can, but it’s not much, and it can never compete with the monied forces arrayed against truth, decency, and the American Way.

My partner and I still, for now, knock on wood, have jobs that others have lost, but especially with our financial situation being as precarious as it is, I can’t risk those by protesting.

Things just keep getting more and more terrible. I am trying to keep my head above water, and although I don’t feel like the vicious and cruel will necessarily win at the end, the cost of preventing them from doing so is already high, and will only climb higher. I don’t feel hopeless, but I do feel helpless.

What can I do? I engage in hobbies to the extent that our budget will allow me. We are all in therapy, although that is another blow to the budget (and to all the therapists out there who can and are willing to work on a sliding scale — bless you!). My friends and family either are in the same or a worse boat or, worse to me, think things are either fine or good.

It’s like being sealed in a small box that is getting smaller. I will survive it, but it’s going to leave me permanently misshapen.

ANSWER: I am going to disagree with you, but sympathize 100 percent first. Yes it is hard to get through the contempt for the Constitution and all that entails.

Where i disagree is with the "can’t do anything." Just because there has been no response to what you have done so far (written and called representative and senators and attended town halls) doesn't mean it was or is futile and it doesn't mean you stop. It just means it's not a one-bucket fire.

Or, different metaphor, one I think I borrowed earlier -- Notre Dame? The people who labored their whole lives on that cathedral did so knowing they would never see it to completion. It took almost two centuries to build. So, you do your part, of whatever size, because it matters to the whole -- that is the point. Any results you are able to see are a bonus.

Take care. I am also going to post an amazing thing by Stephen Colbert (Anderson Cooper interview) to address your "permanently misshapen" observation. If I can find it quickly enough. I'm already taking forever.

See, I went and took way too long looking for it anyway. Here is the transcript because the videos I found were all edited. Mind you, I am a nonbeliever posting and embracing this. I don't think "gifts" need to come from a spiritual entity, nor do I think differences in or quesitons about belief in God detract from the beauty or utility of the message. To me it's a powerful framework for living with purpose amid loss and pain, which are inevitable:

"Anderson Cooper
00:02:40
"You told an interviewer that you have learned to, in your words, love the thing that I most wish had not happened. You went on to say, What punishments of God are not gifts? Do you really believe that?

"Stephen Colbert
00:02:53
"Yes. It's a gift to exist. And with existence comes suffering. There's no escaping that. But if you are grateful for your life. Then you have to be grateful for all of it. And so, at a young age. I suffered something so that by the time I was in serious relationships in my life with friends or with my wife or with my children, is that I have some understanding that everybody is suffering and however imperfectly, acknowledge their suffering and connect with them and to love them in a deep way that makes you grateful for the fact that you have suffered so that you can know that about other people. I want to be the most human I can be, and that involves acknowledging and ultimately being grateful for the things that I wish didn't happen because they gave me a gift."

College vs trade
Guest Jun 13, 1:20 p.m.
QUESTION: I realize I have a stake in this discussion as a uni professor but can I represent a different view? It saddens me for college to get treated as working papers. In its ideal form, it's a chance -- in total distinction to the vast majority of high schools-- to develop real critical thinking skills, to learn how to learn, to follow curiosity and to grow as thinking people. Everyone should have that chance. And, sorry, but an educated citizenry is something we all have an interest in sustaining. That's why financial aid and the GI Bill and state schools and all that are important. Learning for its own sake isn't elites, I don't accept that.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yes, agreed. But stop with the "sorry"!

I do hate how this has all gotten muddled. When I was in wee school, the trades were falling out of favor -- "voke" -- for "Everyone should have that chance." It should never have been either-or, of course, that was the mistake. Stop applying "favor." But the idea was right to broaden access. Then people noticed the emphasis on college was skewed too heavily on college, and there were a bunch of students there just because they were expected to be, and lo not enough people were entering the trades. Add to that, US has its "Greed is good" 1980s and never looks back, and suddenly it's all comp sci, business degrees and ROI. Ugh.

I get it, it's a lot of time and money and people want to know what they're getting, but it does seem like two basics keep getting swamped: 1. In grade school, give kids options based on their strengths and interests, not their socioeconomic status or educational fashion; 2. In college, think broadening of experience and critical thinking skills first, not career.

Fair?

Re: root canal
Guest Jun 13, 1:22 p.m.
QUESTION: Last year I told Carolyn that I needed to a therapist but was paralyzed, much like you were, because I didn't know what to say. She responded with a two-sentence message to send - I think it was essentially "I am looking for a therapist." Nothing else. I copied & pasted into their contact form, they emailed back almost immediately with questions to help find the right fit, and everything fell into place. I've been going for a year and am in a MUCH healthier place. Seconding the other commenters who said to just call and say "I need an appointment." Let the professionals on the other end of the line pick it up from there.

If you haven't called because you're afraid of the procedure, or you feel like you've waited too long -- I've also told medical professionals flat-out when I'm nervous or embarrassed or scared, and I have always found them to be incredibly reassuring and non-judgmental when I do.

Commenting on privacy vs secrecy
Guest Jun 13, 1:34 p.m.
QUESTION: I had cancer twice in less than 5 years, forms that were curable by surgery but that could still come back. Now when I hear of people that have a cancer scare I always suggest maintaining privacy (bordering on secrecy). The first time I had cancer, I was open about it. People (eg, mother and several sisters) asked me how I was doing. A LOT. And long after things were resolved. Talking about it was painful, reminding of the bad times and the outcome, that I could not bear a child due to the required hysterectomy. Reminders come up often (eg, at doctor’s visits, or even sometimes at the pharmacy) anyway. Minimizing information sharing (and thus questions/reminders) is better. The second time I had cancer I was private. Even secret. It was better.

QUESTION: The other thing I’d suggest is to read, not only about the present, but about the past. One of my favorite movie lines is from Shadowlands - “we read to know we are not alone.” Or, as James Baldwin explained it: “You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive.” All of which is to say, you’re not alone here now, even as you’re not alone in the sweep of human history. Don’t underestimate your own resilience, or the resilience if all those that stand with you now - and take heart from the example of all those who stood where you stood , where we stood, in the past.

ANSWER: I have said my "should" explicitly in this context: The person or people being asked to keep a strict secret often need someone to talk to themselves. In the case that started the thread, one spouse was diagnosed and asked the other, caregiving spouse not to tell anyone else beyond their family. That meant the caregiver (stressed) was having to fib to friends, certainly by omission, and it was becoming weird (stressful).

QUESTION: My 22 year old is home for the summer and bikes to work, sometimes in the dark. I learned he doesn't wear a helmet. If he weren't living at home I would be unaware of this unsafe activity, but he is living at home and I am aware. After taking 24 hours to calm down and think, I want to tell him wearing a helmet is a condition of living here. Yes, he has a helmet and it fits. It doesn't work when he keeps it in his backpack. In your level-headed, learned opinion, is this reasonable? Or over the top?

ANSWER: Do you intend to throw him out if he doesn't wear it? Monitor him for compliance?

I make no claims to level-headedness or learnedness, but all my threats have to clear the mean-it bar.

So you might want to ask him to describe for you what it looks like, generally, when the fates collect on bad helmet decisions. So you can be sure he's aware. It'll resonate a lot more when he has to form the words and mental images himself.

(Apologies to anyone who has been affected. It's awful.)

Cancer secrecy
Guest Jun 13, 2:03 p.m.
QUESTION: Whew is this a raw topic. I just had a very close loved one pass - I was her health care POA- and didn't know they had cancer till I got a call saying life support had been pulled, asking if I wanted to say goodbye.

The amount of people who showed right after just devastated and feeling betrayed was earth shattering. They had told any who knew - a boss, neighbors- a few different stories. They were so loved, and people were hurt. I could only do a few disclosures a day. Would let them have a moment and try to gently explain that I hadn't known myself.

So while I completely do respect that it is the best wishes of the person with the ailment and their autonomy... it is truly hard for those loved ones. Would try to aim for a middle ground. Ring theory, privacy, boundaries.

ANSWER: Thanks for this perspective, and I am so sorry.

I hope the takeaway for all is to be extremely respectful of someone who lets you know of their illness. When you find out -- from them directly or from a third party -- ask, "How do you/does X want me to handle this?"

Plan A, Plan B
Guest Jun 13, 2:28 p.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,

My husband is 39 and I'm 36, and we have been married for two years. We are both in total agreement that we want children, but we have been in active disagreement about the timing since our wedding day. My husband has an older sister who went through a divorce in her 30s, remarried an amazing guy at 40, and naturally had two children in her early forties. Breezy pregnancies and everything. This is my husband's gold standard for what's possible, and he has decided that all the fertility/age fearmongering that goes on is just conservative propaganda. I do think there is plenty of propaganda around this topic, but I am 100% sure that trying to get pregnant in one's forties is NOT anyone's Plan A, though it might be a solid Plan B. So how do I get us on the same page about this—do I drag him into my gyno appointments? (Not ideal!)

ANSWER: So that's it, that's what he's going with -- it's possible because his sister did it? And anything else is "conservative propaganda."

Dude needs to read. Or, ah, listen to his wife?

I don't know what to tell you, but you've described a degree of resistance to information that is not promising.

If he is willing to consider a source that is neither his sister nor conservative propaganda, and doesn't involve his attendance at your GYN appointments, then I'll be happy to tell him that fertility windows vary from woman to woman -- which means some women struggle to get pregnant after age 30 or 35, some have babies over 50, and some can't conceive at any age. So if he wants you to conceive his child without medical intervention, then now's the actual best time to start trying.

And if he simply does not want you to get pregnant right now, then that is something he needs to own, knowing "not now" might well mean "not ever" -- and not deflect by saying "eh we shall do this no-worries-like when you're down to your last egg."

Also? Pregnancy punishes a body, more so as a woman ages, though not equally each prenancy and each woman. Some get through with relatively little effect and some get walloped and it's not entirely up to them. But, if you are reading, my good dude -- put an 8-ish pound roast in there, then rip it out, then lmk.

(Sorry again, everyone.)

QUESTION: this isn't the answer you're looking for, but encourage your bike rider to get LED lights - inexpensive and (if used) very effective!

QUESTION: For the parent of the bicycling son: helmets are great. I'm a bicycle commuter, and wear one all the time. A couple of other things are more important though, based on my experience: being seen the riding defensively. Make sure he has quality lights on his bike, and uses them regardless of lighting conditions. And encourage him to take a class from the League of American Bicyclists on safe riding.

QUESTION: For posting the Stephen Colbert statement. His two older brothers that died in the plane crash years ago were my best friends, his mother was a saint, and I've had a small glimpse of what he went through while still young.

Oh, and a bike helmet might have saved my life 4 years ago.

Re: Plan A, Plan B

QUESTION: This is less about the timing of your having kids and more about, IMO, your husband's openness to things not going just the way that they went for his sister. There are so many uncertainties that come with trying for and, hopefully, having kids, that his continued use of his sister as the gold standard (for kids? marriage? life?) is not going to align with you and, potentially, reality. I suggest therapy for discussion of how to reconcile all of this BEFORE you start trying for kids in earnest.

ANSWER: Right -- like I said, a robust resistance to information. Whether it's sister-centric is almost beside the point, this is going to be torture over the long haul.

Okay, enough -- I'll leave you with a preview of a good percentage of my weekend plans.

I also want to express my deepest condolences to Jax's friend. Devastating news. I am so sorry.

Thank you everyone for stopping by, and I'll type to you here in two weeks.

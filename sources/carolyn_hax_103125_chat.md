Hear the ghost story of Mrs. Kyle, twice buried but alive in local lore

Column | A 6-year research project found a surprisingly simple route to happiness

Boo.

Spooky season special, a Post ghost story! Two ghost stories, in fact. I mean come on.

Also, a desperation season special (which I meant to post last week but forgot). It seemed on point for this group: "a sort of happiness hack for our chaotic times." It's from Milbank's pivot to peacing out, and his column is worth a follow -- it's aimed right at the screaming part of our brains.

Neighborhood mom gives but never takes
Guest11:05 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, Happy Halloween!

There is a ring of moms in my neighborhood, we've all become friends as many of us are staying home with our young children. One mom, "Paige," loves to make treats for the kids, give them all little gifts (for example she left them all a "boo basket" last night that they found this morning upon waking up), and invite people to send their kids over for a couple hours if we have an errand to run. It is all so lovely and kind, and yet she NEVER lets anyone reciprocate. I have invited her countless times to let me watch her daughter while she steps out (as a bonus, this would help entertain my kids, who love playing with hers), but she always says no even if I know she does not have an alternative. There is no real space for anyone else to do things like the boo baskets because she always does it so well and so early that we can't really compete.

Is it ok that some people are just givers who never want to take? (But, I don't want it to be thought that my family takes and doesn't give!)

ANSWER: There may be no space to give back, I've definitely seen this -- but is there no space for conversation, either? One-on-one with Paige: "You do so much for the rest of us -- always so kind and thoughtful. I am not comfortable, though, with how lopsided things have become. I have never been a 'taker.' If you won't let me reciprocate in kind by watching your daughter, then will you at least name something I can do to put the accounts more in balance?"

She may still rebuff you, but at least then you will be on the record with your discomfort with taking advantage. Not to get too alarmist or put ideas in your head, but a mom who always hosts and never ever ever lets other parents reciprocate may have had a bad experience herself as a child in another's care and this may be her way of being vigilant without denying her kid a full community social life. Just ... I don't know. There are plenty of other possible explanations but it rang a bell, let's say.

The second thing this conversation accomplishes -- again, assuming Paige doesn't respond with some concrete suggestion for you -- is to free you from any expectation that she will say yes to balance. Now you can take it upon yourself to do something nice for Paige on your own. Pay attention, see where she shops for treats or how she decorates or what she does for fun or whatever, and buy her gift cards periodically and generally spoil her a little. Presumably she won't give things back?

Your column
Guest11:27 a.m.
QUESTION: I think if you had come out and said that you were going to change up your production commitment. We would all understand. But the sudden cut of the cartoons and daily columns was a bit abrupt, hence why some people want to know why they can't see you as usual. In the Post we got used to yours being the only reliable column to appear in the Style section. Now not so much. I've always loved your snark and honesty and understood why you went from 2-3 questions daily to one but I know it had to be a huge burden to do daily. So go ahead and dial it back but admit to it. I retired so can you.

ANSWER: I did! I came right out and said it. In the chat right before it happened, and then there was a notice on the columns that published that week.

I suggested I film myself doing an interpretive dance, but that was voted down. Ned was the decisive vote, brindly little twit.

(I really, really don't understand any of this, and am not retiring, as the announcement spelled out. And the 2-3 questions to 1 thing? Um. That was basic evolution. Every advice column out there does quick hits, so I decided to go the other way -- but not in some announcement-worthy moment of discovery, but gradually.)

Husband's therapist seems to want him to cheat.
Guest11:35 a.m.
QUESTION: Several months ago I found some old messages my husband had sent to young women on an "arrangements" website. It was apparent he never followed through, but I was devastated. After lots of tears and pleading from him, I agreed to stay with him, but only if he agreed to therapy.

The problem is, his therapist, a guy, has emboldened him. Before, he was emphatic that he was in the wrong, that it was a moment of weakness, and that it would never happen again. But now, he's almost indignant, saying our sex drive used to be the same but now mine is much lower, and that I have a responsibility to tend to his needs, one way or the other. He's pushing me to have sex (when he knows I'm less interested), to take libido-enhancing drugs (which he knows I'm against), and even that I should agree to let him be fill his needs with these "arrangements" since his love for me has not changed (using marital money and exposing me to disease).

The worst part is that he's weaponizing his therapist against me. All this pushing is at his therapist's behest, and when I push back, and tell him to stop violating my boundaries, I'm met with "but my therapist said X" and then he won't budge. Someone wrote on chat a few months ago about a spouse using their therapist as a marital appeals court, and that's what it feels like.

Truthfully I want him to stop seeing this therapist who is putting all these marriage-ending ideas in his head, and to stick with his first instincts -- that he screwed up and won't do it again. But I'm the one who insisted on therapy so I don't know how I do this. Advice?

ANSWER: I can see why you want the therapist off the scene. Your husband's "first instincts" response sounded much more in your favor -- mainly because it let you believe this would all go away and you could go back to the marriage you thought you had before your awful discovery.

Thing is, that whole "my bad" and "I'll never do it again" reaction is a panic response from someone who doesn't want to break anything. It's scary to think it might all be over in an instant. So people, when caught, tend to do what your husband did and try desperately, reflexively to hold the status quo together. This doesn't make the underlying stuff go away.

I (and you) don't know that the therapist is saying to your husband. But I have a pretty good idea, if he's doing his job, that he's getting at the unhappiness and frustration that led your husband to sneak around on websites. And urging your husband to talk to you instead. Wouldn't that make sense, when you see it spelled out that way?

The therapist could be guiding your husband (not advising, remember, that's not what they do) to say out loud how unhappy he is that you decided unilaterally without conversation or remediation effort that sex would dwindle to near nothingness, and that he would have no recourse because you were also deciding unilaterally that it was monogamy or bust -- again without conversation.

This is, arguably, a fair beef -- not the unilateral decision on sex, because that is what it is (the alternative being rape), but the "without conversation." I say arguably because two people can differ on what "no" conversation or effort means.

It's also possible your husband came home from this work and spun it as "My therapist says you owe me X." You don't know how well he's representing the therapy. And no means no regardless, once conversation is had -- but it's discussion of options and recourse between you.

So, two possible ways out of this blind alley. One is to see if your husband (and the therapist) will agree to have you join him for a session. The other is to enter couples counseling in addition to your husband's individual. Pretty common configuration. You could also do both, sequentially. But expecting to shoo away the problem with the therapist is not realistic. I'm sorry.

Needing a break doesn't mean I don't care
Guest11:57 a.m.
QUESTION: Hello. I’m having a difficult time conversing with my teenager (age 17) about politics and world events. We’re mostly on the same page as far as values and concerns. The difficulty lies in my needing time away from all the doom scrolling and negative energy. He wants to talk about politics and what is wrong in the world all the time. I do not. We do have lots of conversations about these topics, but I cannot handle it 24/7. When I say I don't feel up to continuing a conversation, he says “well I can’t just ignore that this stuff is happening.” When I try to talk about something positive, his response is to find the negative. It’s like we live in a Debbie Downer episode.

I’ve explained that needing time away from negative news doesn’t mean I’m ignoring it, don’t agree with him, don’t think it’s real, or don’t care about it. We’ve talked about focusing on what you can do now, rather than spending all your time agonizing about an uncertain future. We’ve talked about finding pleasure in small things, which will invariably turn into a conversation about something negative about that nice thing. (Like, I say the flowers in the garden look so pretty right now and he says, not for long with how we’re ruining the environment). It’s not like I don’t think about these issues, but I find value in spending time appreciating things just to appreciate them regardless of where we’re headed as a society.

Some background in case it helps – my child does suffer from anxiety and depression (as do I) and is already on medication and in therapy (as am I). He is also on the spectrum and tends to obsess over topics.

I wish I could help him see the value in turning off the negativity, and that doing so doesn't mean you don't care. I don’t know how to do that beyond what I’m already doing, but I would love some suggestions. As I'm writing this I'm also realizing that I am sad because it seems like my child doesn't respect me or see that I do really care about this stuff. I'm not sure there's an answer for that part.

ANSWER: All the elements of this -- the over-talking, the doom looping, the anxiety and depression, the parenting challenge -- all point to relief in the form of a concrete action framework.

For example, your kid needs things he can do right now, vs. talking about focusing on things he can do now. Canvassing/phone banking if he's into politics, omg food banks need everything -- any community organizing or volunteering. But apolitical works too, like an animal shelter.

You and your kid would get along better if you were doing this productive thing together, including talking about it for specific organizational purposes, instead of talking generally about all the problems.

Your correct diagnosis of negativity exhaustion, and your prescription of "talk about something positive," would land more effectively if it were part of a cycle of effectiveness: You will do your Productive Thing better if you take this rest period to restore your productivity. This is where your kid is right now. Bonus, this is also correct -- the most productive people are the ones who rest. So you won't be trying to sell flowers to your kid in the vacuum of pleasestoptalkingIneedflowers!!! anymore, which obviously doesn't resonate with him. You can even incorporate two other truths: Beauty and peace are what you're fighting the negativity for, right? So it makes sense to devote time to appreciating those, too. And, you can also actively cultivate them. The values don't promote themselves. Plant and nurture, literally and figuratively.

Do, though, take the "it seems like my child doesn't respect me" out of it. He's 17, there's a good, developmental chance he's actively hating you right now. He's just doing his job, though, of differentiating himself from you, and the more personally you take it, the harder you make it for him. Just love him and trust he loves you through all the aaaaaaarghggggghhhh (wait -- can you mentally conjure the Tasmanian Devil cartoon sound? Imagine that's his psyche till 18-ish. It helps.)

Husband’s therapist
Guest12:00 p.m.
QUESTION: It could be that the therapist is encouraging the husband to be more upfront about his sexual needs, and Husband is taking it the extra step (all on his own), after being validated that his feelings and needs exist, to assuming ergo he is entitled to having things “his way”. The therapist may only be encouraging him to start the conversation. If the husband is going from that “point A” zooming past discussion to his own “Point Z” of feeling allowed to bully and gaslight to get what he wants, I see many many red flags a-waving that have more to do with the husband than the therapist.

QUESTION: If you and Paige are part of a group of friends, surely the lot of you have gone to get coffee at some point, correct? If not, try suggesting that. Once you know Paige's specific order of coffee/tea/whatever, occasionally get one for her and drop it off at her house. This works best if it's on a random afternoon, FYI. And on the off chance that Paige ever has an extreme emergency and asks if she can take you up on the child care offer, do that if at all possible -- life is full of the unexpected. On a side note, both you and Paige sound delightful -- thanks for making the world a kinder place.

Which includes forcing the single person into the awkward "nope" position.

Therapy as a condition
Guest12:17 p.m.
QUESTION: I once made therapy a condition of staying with a partner. The partner did get into therapy (desperately didn't want to have to leave our home), but did it for my reasons not theirs. Of course it didn't go the way I hoped. The person has to be in therapy for their own reasons, not on someone else's orders. My then-partner tried and did make a little progress but not with the issues that had led me to set that condition. Later (after we broke up), my ex started therapy for other reasons--their own reasons--and made much more progress over a period of a few years. I learned a lot of lessons from that relationship and breakup in terms of what is mine and what is the other person's. I would never ever set that condition again.

Needing a break doesn't mean I don't care

QUESTION: Advice I give to everyone: pick your lane. Pick your movement or issue and focus your time, energy, attention, money there. Trust that the people in the other movements are doing their work in their lane just like you're doing work in yours. They will tap you in when they need you; you will tap them in when you need them. One of us can't solve every problem -- and if we spend all our time trying to solve everything, we'll be too burnt out to solve anything. Also rest and joy are resistance :)

Re: husband’s therapist
Guest12:28 p.m.
QUESTION: What Carolyn said, but I’d also ask yourself this - what, if anything, are you willing to do to address your husband’s unhappiness with the state of your sex life, including, as Carolyn suggests, sitting down to talk to him about it? Or talking to a therapist or other medical professional to see what possibilities are out there to improve things for both of you? I’d also question your assumption that the therapist is putting ideas in your husband’s head - clearly, he’s been unhappy about the state of your marriage for some time, and your response - at least as detailed here - is for him to bury that unhappiness somewhere, and never talk about it - and for both of you to continue to do nothing constructive to address it.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Right, thanks. It is really easy to vilify someone who is doing and saying all the sketchy stuff this husband is doing -- and, in fairness, the extent of the sketchiness may be more than the marriage can or should withstand. But that doesn't change the fact of the mutual responsibility in a marriage to hear each other out and respect each other's needs and feelings -- even as each of you retains full veto power over your individual actions. All his wrongness doesn't make it a valid option to, like you said, "bury that unhappiness somewhere, and never talk about it."

Where is the line?
Guest12:59 p.m.
QUESTION: Where is the line between a reasonable ask of a partner and asking them to change who they are?

I'm not talking about abuse - I'm talking about (for example), a complete one-sided overhaul of a communication style that otherwise works in other areas of their life (both personally and professionally).

I've been struggling with this for over a year - both in and out of therapy - and still don't feel like I have a good answer for this. I feel like my spouse married a direct, confident, assertive, gets-stuff-done person and then seems to resent the fact that their spouse is direct, confident, assertive, and gets-stuff-done.

I also recognize that it can be a lot to be with a person like me, and that there's (always) room for me to improve as a person and inject more thoughtfulness into my communication. I think I've gotten a lot better at asking questions and reigning in places where assertiveness could veer into steamrolling.

But I also don't think that change in communication can be one sided, and he resists my (and our couples therapist's) ongoing point that we need to meet in the middle on communication changes because there's two of us involved.

Any insight on the line between reasonable behavior modification vs change who you fundamentally are would be appreciated. I'm willing to - and have - done the former, but I'm not willing to do the later, and I'm starting to suspect that's where we're stuck.

And I am so, so, tired and have even less energy than normal to navigate this given *gestures vaguely.*
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Hard to answer, because such a line is personal, of course.

But i think there is a fair way to look at it generally that takes into account different personalities.

Being human has two types of "work." There's the work of life management, such as chores and a job and keeping cars safe and registered. Then there's the work of self-management, which includes hygiene, emotional regulation, social awareness. Oversimplified, but I'm too slow as it is.

When you're with someone, you need to manage your workload in both. Hold up your share of the chores and other life management, and not let the self-management slide.

Good so far.

To my mind, a couple isn't working when being in it demands too much work in either category. Now, their life work might just be crazy -- young kids, etc. -- and as long as they're sharing it and both equally flat out exhausted with "too much" work, then okay. That's temporary and they can get through it, and true sharing means they're a good pair. It's lopsidedness that will doom them -- when one is doing everything and the other says "You wanted kids I didn't!" or whatever.

That is also true of self-management work. If you're kind of a mess and your partner asks you to get some help, and you're in therapy and it's hard, but you're learning healthier ways, then your self-management work will go up for a bit but ultimately go down as you get healthier. That's a good thing.

If instead you're being asked by your partner to, basically, suppress yourself into a little box (because you're "loud" or whatever), then you're going to work yourself to exhaustion on the self-management side, trying to be someone you're not.

That, to me, is the line: when being with someone doesn't make your life better, but instead drains or exhausts you (in a chore sense or self-management sense), with no prospect of improvement.

Hope that helps.

Bad Wife?
Guest1:18 p.m.
QUESTION: Women in my family have the luck of going grey in their late 30's. I'm 41 and just about completely grey. Our kids are 10 and 8. My husband is asking me to dye my hair as most of the women in my family do, but I really am resisting. Its expensive, time consuming, and I don't like the chemicals (no shade to women who dye....just not me). My husband does have social anxiety and since we met in college, there are things I do to help both of us in public - I'm aware he needs to sit at the end of a row or table, know where two exits are at all times, and will review party list of names/jobs/relationships before we go out. If a place is too loud/crowded, we leave or I plan to go alone. He's saying that doesn't like the grey because of what people think - they could think I'm the kids' grandmother or that I am older than I am. He is asking me to consider dying my hair - for him. He sees it as another small thing to do to make him comfortable. He has even said good partners, good wives do things for one another and he has asked me to "strongly consider" dying my hair. He says that he thinks once I'm in my 50's everyone else will have grey. Great - so I'm looking at 15yrs of dying my hair? I'm I a bad wife for not doing it? An uncaring person if this really could help him feel more comfortable socially and ease outings?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yeah no. Sorry husband. Feeling better with multiple exits is not the same as "I need my wife to look a certain version of hot." But you can tell him I said nice try 🙄

Plus, if we're going to address the anxiety here seriously, making him comfortable is not the answer. His facing your gray and getting used to it is the winner. Anxiety is fear of something that isn't happening. Accommodating an anxiety = feeding a fear of something that isn't happening. Meaning, feeding an irrational fear.

Meaning, if he is not in treatment first, and then coming up with evidence-based solutions second, then I'm side-eyeing the effectiveness of the lot of it.

Here are my biases:

1. I think pretty gray hair looks just as pretty as any other color hair.

2. Hair dye maintenance is a colossal butt pain.

3. I think fewer dye jobs in real life are pretty or persuasive than we want (a direct extension of 2, so I feel bad saying 3, since it's really just that people have other priorities for their time and $ than to get perfect gray cover, so good for them, and they certainly don't need me critiquing the results).

Anxiety fact-check is readily available. Making his world smaller-easier is exactly counter to the recommended approach.

ANSWER: Please make an appointment to see your primary care person, then follow the breadcrumbs from there. There is no need to resign yourself to suffering and then tough this out as if it can only be about personal failings. Perseveration can be a symptom of a medical issue -- or something else, but the medical issue has the lowest barrier to entry as far as exploring causes, plus it's the logical starting point for that kind of detective work.

Meantime, as your health permits, consider also adding physical activity and mind-consuming activities. Busy is good. If you're moving forward on the two paths -- pursuing diagnosis plus keeping occupied with purpose -- you might find some quick relief.

QUESTION: I am a (recovering) Paige and I had friends tell me directly it made them uncomfortable. That may help here but it wasn't until I got divorced and really needed my friends (and acquaintances, and professionals and strangers!) that I realized that my giving was self-protective. Once I had to let people do things for me, I realized the joy I had been denying them for years. Paige may think her value is in giving and it can be very hard to let that go. You may have very little influence here, even if you are honest with her.

Gray hair
Guest1:44 p.m.
QUESTION: I also come from a family where the women go gray early (starting in high school). Over the years, I saw all sorts of responses to and judgments made about individual decisions, and I guess it comes down to this, for me - do what’s right for you, period. You don’t owe anybody, including your husband, any explanation for what you decide to do with your own hair - and his extreme anxiety about what people might think is something he needs to address in his own, not through trying to control your choices.

Communication styles
Guest1:45 p.m.
QUESTION: My husband (of 46 years) once said of me to someone who’d found me a little direct, “She may be opinionated, but she’s usually right”. Being loved for your strength/weakness is what you need in a partner.
Think I’m just off to kiss my husband.

Husband’s Therapist
Guest1:52 p.m.
QUESTION: As a retired therapist of 30 some years, I think it’s interesting that Husband uses the phrase, “My therapist says I should…”. That’s really no different than “My dad says, “ or “My boss” says or anyone in a power position says I should do this thing. It just seems to indicate that the client is still uncertain about the new change that is being requested, and needs to refer back to someone with “ credibility.” And I agree with the advice to suggest you attend a session. We therapists only know what is presented in the room, not necessarily “objective” reality. And, while it may seem counterintuitive, our stance can also be misrepresented to family/friends if the client has a different agenda than what we are aware of. Just saying.

where is the line/communication style
Guest1:55 p.m.
QUESTION: At the start of relationships, we are attracted to people who have qualities we lack. We think: Chemistry! Gratitude! You complete me! Then, in the long-term and day-by-day, enthusiasm for difference vanishes. If you aren't careful, you start to try to turn the partner into someone more like you. We all tend to do this. But the secret of long love (which is amazing, btw) is not to. He needs to modify his expectation of change. You are who you are. Your love for him won't last unless he accepts you as you are, even when your approach to life at times grates. You're getting close to your bottom line. Stare at it awhile, because he will have to give up on this project or you will have to leave. You've done what you can. The next move is his.

re: husband's therapist
Guest2:00 p.m.
QUESTION: I'm a bit disturbed at all of the responses putting the blame on the wife whose libido is lower than it used to be. That happens with age, injuries, illness, menopause, stress, etc. Mine is considerably lower thanks to all of those, and I know it frustrates my husband. I make an effort even though I could go months without sex and not care.

But in NO WAY would he look to cheat, then gaslight me and misrepresent a therapist saying the things the writer's husband is saying. He has integrity and emotional intelligence, and is not an immature, entitled jerk like this woman's husband is. She doesn't need a therapist. She needs a divorce attorney.

ANSWER: I didn't see anyone blaming the wife for a low(er) libido. Or anyone letting the husband off the hook for poor behaviors.

Any discussion of the wife's side of the ledger was about a responsibility to communicate about things and to consider both their needs with respect vs. expect problems just to go away. To call that "blame" is a terrible misread.

Husband's therapist
Guest2:14 p.m.
QUESTION: Original poster here. Thank you for the feedback. To clarify, I agree that my husband now shares these thoughts on some level, but it's more that he's been convinced than that this is my husband's true self coming out. He's channeling his therapist, prefacing with words like "My therapist said I should explain that..." and "My therapist said you would probably respond that way..." Even the choice of words seems rehearsed. I know my husband and this is NOT the way he thinks or what he sounds like.

His therapist is in a non-monogamous relationship himself, has his own blog, and seems to be some sort of advocate of it.

I've suggested couple's therapy (which my therapist suggested too), but my husband is not interested, as he's VERY happy with the advice he's getting. Apparently his therapist did offer to talk to me in a joint session or to my therapist, but honestly I don't want to since I think the therapist's values are just so different from mine, and I don't want to join whatever cult he has going. I suppose I could let him talk to my therapist, if you think I should... but at that point, doesn't it seem like we're just handing over control of our marriage over to our therapists instead of actually having it ourselves?

ANSWER: Run it by your therapist before you do it, certainly, but I don't see how your going to one session and hearing it from the guy directly means you "join whatever cult he has going." To me, it would mean you confirm for yourself, firsthand, what you suspect is happening.

The whole blog thing, too -- I assume you've talked to your therapist about the ethics of what's going on?

Maybe you don't need confirmation. If your husband believes what his therapist is advocating and is "VERY happy with the advice he's getting," and if you don't even want to be in the room with it, then you're at a crossroads with your marriage, no?

I want that for you, for the two of you to have "control of our marriage," but if your husband won't cooperate, that's not something you can will yourself to have on your own.

What’s wrong with me😄?
Guest2:20 p.m.
QUESTION: Yeah, I was the Paige in my neighborhood. I done know why. I think it had something to do with getting pleasure from doing things for people but not wanting them to do things for me because I didn’t like owing them anything. Does that make any sense. I realized how weird it was at the time.

That's it for me. Thank you everyone for stopping by, have two great weekends -- out of spite if you have to (remember, spite is free). I just realized I'm a Ned short ... here's he is when he's big mad. I think we were watching Caps and wouldn't play with him, can you believe our nerve. Anyway, see you (better!) in two weeks.

One more Paige comment
Guest2:28 p.m.
QUESTION: The part of the question that bothered me most was that the OP felt like she wasn't getting to do the things for her own child that she wanted to do, because Paige was doing them first. So maybe that is the thing to talk with Paige about, more than the rest of it

Husband’s therapist
Guest2:29 p.m.
QUESTION: Interesting and important additional details in the update from the OP - but why turn down the offers from husband’s therapist? The “control” issue here seems to be something of a distraction, if not an avoidance technique - why not get all the information you can get, and all the help you can get, to solve this problem in your marriage? And to address your husband’s dissatisfaction with the state of things, even as you both explore ways to deal with it, in ways that are comfortable for you both? At this point, what do you have to lose?

re husband's therapist
Guest2:29 p.m.
QUESTION: The LW seems like one of those advice seekers who doesn't want to do any of the things that might help. She won't try medication, she won't try to meet him partway re his needs, won't go to see his therapist. She won't even listen to him, but instead insists that he doesn't mean what he is saying.

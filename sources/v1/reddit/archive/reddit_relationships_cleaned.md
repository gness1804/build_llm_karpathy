I wanted to give an update on this post I wrote about 2 years ago. I got some great advice, I got a lot of tough love advice and some terrible advice. I know he was already committed by all of his actions and that I really needed to focus on college first before having to plan a wedding. 

Well, it turned out my boyfriend at the time had been planning on proposing to me for a long time. He wanted to wait until I graduated college. A little after I graduated college, he took me on a hike. I knew this was a special hike because it was the same place we went for one of our earlier dates. 

The first time we went on that date was magical. I always teased him that he never kissed me on the date. There was this perfect moment he was holding me in front of a beautiful picturesque lake as we were just enjoying each other's company in an embrace. I thought he was going to kiss me but he didn't. 

I later kissed him first but always teased him that he didn't kiss me in that moment we had. He confessed he wasn't sure if I wanted to be kissed. He said he wanted to kiss me more than anything. 

Well he took me back on the hike 4 years later, and when we got to that lake, he told me this is when he knew he was first in love with me. Then he got on one knee and proposed to me. I just kissed him and even forgot to say yes! So he asked, "Are you going to marry me or not?" And I said of course. We got married about a year later and we just celebrated our one year anniversary in October. 

I've never been happier and I'm so excited to continue our life together! 

Thank you for reading 😁

Edit: Grammar on TL DR

Edit: Wow! I did not expect this post to blow up like it did! Thank you all for the incredibly kind words. I'm sorry I can't respond to everyone but thank you. I'm glad I could brighten so many people's day! You all brightened mine :)

TL;DR UPDATE: My [24] boyfriend [25] of 3 and 1/2 years hadn't proposed and I was starting to worry. This is a two year update that my boyfriend at the time was planning on proposing all along. We have now been married for one year. I am so happy everything worked out the way it did.

ANSWER: When you said "my boyfriend at the time" my heart dropped. Great update and super glad you got it together and relaxed into your love and relationship!




QUESTION: Update: My(M26) wife(F26) is not happy

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hm1wdi/mym26_wifef26_isnt_happy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Thank you everyone for the advice from the original post. I just wanted to give the community an update. My wife finally got back yesterday from leaving to go see her sister. We talked for a little bit yesterday, but still came to the same thing she has been telling me. She doesn’t want to be with me because she doesn’t feel in love, emotionally connected, or intimate towards me. She views me as a friend. I told her she needed to choose either we work on this and go to counseling or it’s a divorce and we cut ties. She couldn’t decide and said to give her the weekend. 

This morning I woke up early, made her breakfast and brought it to her in bed. Then took her out to eat for lunch and desert trying to just spark anything to see if she would agree to work on it. Well we sat down again after getting back and she said she wanted a divorce and she was 100% on that. 

It was tough. A lot of crying, sadness, hurt, and all the emotions one would feel. I ended up just going to my room and she left for the night. I decided to get out and do something so I jogged and listed to some music for a bit. It helped. 

I came to the realization that we all have such little time on earth and I don’t want to waste it moping around. I want to improve myself physically, emotionally, and mentally. I want to just enjoy life and find myself again. So I’m going to do that and one day I might meet someone who is perfect to continue the journey of life with me. 

So I’m still sad and hurt, but all that to say I’m moving forward and trying to be positive. Thank you all for your support.

tl;dr Wife wants a divorce. I’m trying to stay positive and move one.

ANSWER: The end of a relationship is hard but it’s also such a great opportunity for growth, self compassion, and fun. The initial part of the separation is hard but just know that you will be okay, slowly things will get better. 
You’re still so young, you’re going to find someone that’s a better match for you. Just give yourself time to grieve and take care of yourself. When my bf and I broke up I listened to “Breakup Recover Podcast” by Barbara Stevens, she’s so calming and has a way of making you feel cared for and safe. There were days where I felt like shit but I would force myself to listen to it and I never regretted it. 
Hope you find happiness within yourself soon!




QUESTION: My(24f) dad (56m) committed suicide about 2 weeks ago and Im having a hard time grieving and being in school. I don't want to drop out. (UPDATE)

Hi everyone, my last post wasnt super popular or anything but I just thought I'd update you guys anyways!

About a month ago, I went back to school a week after my dad died, and obviously the last few weeks have been super hard. It took me awhile but I ended up getting back on my feet, ultimately school has become one of my biggest outlets as far as keeping myself busy goes. I ended up passing all my classes with all A's and B's and I'm on track to graduate this fall.

Thank you to everyone who believed in me and encouraged me to keep going. Its people like you that really helped me get through one of the hardest chapters of my life.. 

Life can be really fucking hard, so sometimes you just have to take the small victories where you can.

ANSWER: I didn’t actually see your initial post but this struck a cord with me as my dad committed suicide last month and I too now have choices to make about school. I’m so sorry for your loss but well fucking done with those results! 💗 as the Kris Jenner meme says you’re doing amazing sweety




QUESTION: UPDATE : I (46F) have hurt my daughter (16F) by giving her friend(16F) a few books

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n7jcfj/i_46f_have_hurt_my_daughter_16f_by_giving_her/)  
I found the perspectives and guidance I received really helpful. I decided to just spend some time with her. She loves to bake and we baked together and we had some movie nights. her comments melted away and she became happier. 

we were baking yesterday when she came out to me. I didn't make a big deal out of as I felt she didn't want me to. I just told her I loved her before continuing to bake as if nothing happened. We did have a conversation later on. 

She told me that she and her friend had been together ( scary, how well kids can hide things.) Her girlfriend wanted to come out but she didn't and it had strained their relationship. It seems, they had a fight before we gave her the books to her (ex?) girlfriend and that had hurt her. Their relationship is in the limbo and she doesn't want to come out to the world right now. My husband ordered a small pride flag to keep in her room. The world is a bit crazy right now and we want her to have a space where she can be herself.  

TL;DR : My daughter came out to me, her friend was actually her girlfriend and they had a fight.

ANSWER: I wish I had you as my mother. No I'm not gay but to take the time to learn from others on how to take care of your daughter lovingly is a really good trait and she is lucky that instead of you responding back in kind or from a place of negativity, you are responding with love.




QUESTION: UPDATE: I [26f] opened my husband's [32m] snapchat and it was a very explicit picture and caption from a girl. He's sitting not 20 feet from me & I don't know how to handle this.

Link to original post: https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4z9cgn/i_26f_opened_my_husbands_32m_snapchat_and_it_was/?ref=search_posts

Again, I am overwhelmed by the support and love I've received from everyone. It feels great to be comforted and cheered on by you all. Thank you so much.

So, husband cheated. He has been since "maybe two weeks before last Christmas", according to him.

I was very calm when confronting him and took the advice many of you gave me by telling him that he needs to explain to me who Roxy is and why she is his "best friend" on Snapchat. His face gave him away immediately but he still tried to lie to me at first. 

He said that she works with his friend and they met when his friend invited her out to lunch with the two of them. At first, he claimed he only met her about two months ago. He said that they're "best friends" because he doesn't receive many snapchats from others and she is extremely active on the app. He said she just sends randoms and is really into fitness, so she sends a lot of "inspirational" snaps on being healthy and living a better life. He said that every once in a while, he'll send her something back, like a picture of a cheeseburger or something just to tease her about her level of health-consciousness.

First, I asked why he didn't just tell me about her. He said he didn't even think about it because she's just an acquaintance, not even a friend. Then I asked if he'd ever received anything even remotely inappropriate from her.

He answered with, "Not on purpose". I'm assuming he went with that because he knew I opened that snapchat and he probably knew it was a bad one.

I asked what "Not on purpose" means. He got very defensive. Started raising his voice and saying he doesn't need to explain what that means, that sometimes people accidentally send the wrong snapchats to the wrong people. Then he had the nerve to say something along the lines of, "I feel like I'm on trial here. People warned me that you'd get crazy when you're pregnant but I never thought it'd be this bad."

Now. As some of you mentioned in my last post, it seems amazing that I'm able to keep such a level-head. That is because I was raised by a mother who always told me that you never accomplish anything with anger. That you can be emotional, passionate, upset, etc. without ever raising your voice. Messages received quietly and concisely are just as loud and clear as messages received through yelling and screaming. That is how I have lived my life for 26 years, with the exception of just a few blow ups (I am human).

This moment was an exception. I didn't exactly yell and scream, but I became furious. For him to try to blame this on me being pregnant? How unoriginal and offensive. Long story short, he said he'd never seen me this crazy and I told him that I'd never seen a picture of another girl's pussy on my husband's snapchat before. He came back with that I shouldn't have looked at his snapchat. I came back with that it was an accident but even if it hadn't been, there shouldn't be any reason he's receiving snapchats like that for me to see- accidentally or not- in the first place. I told him that I may be pregnant but I'm also an intelligent person and I am his wife, so I knew he was lying and I deserved to know the truth. I asked if I could see his text messages to see if he's been texting Roxy. He said sure. No messages. Then I asked to see his Facebook messages. He looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He told me no. I asked why.

He finally broke and started to cry. Told me he couldn't let me see the messages because they would hurt me. Because they were inappropriate. 

Then it all came out. They screwed in the backseat of her car the first night they met.

This is already long so I'll spare you all the details. But it's been an ongoing affair for months. No, they did not always use protection. Although I was recently screened for STIs, I'll be getting checked again in light of this information.

My uncle already assured me that if he was unfaithful, we would cream him in court. Really the only thing I'm willing to fight him tooth & nail for is our home; I put a lot of effort and money into making this home my dream space. I won't be seeking spousal support but I will seek child support. 

I'm obviously heartbroken and told him to go stay in a hotel or with Roxy for all I cared (I confronted him last night). My mom & sister stayed with me last night and let me sob all over them for hours. Right now I'm sort of numb but I'm also thinking very clearly. I know what my next 10 moves are and I feel supported and secure in my decision to leave him and keep my baby.

A few things I just wanted to clarify: My husband is not a lawyer; his good friend is. There was some concern for my success in court if my husband is a lawyer. His friend is in environmental law so, while I'm sure he can provide some advice, he will not be my husband's divorce lawyer.

There were suggestions of me terminating my pregnancy. I fully support the right to choose and I would probably terminate the pregnancy if I was in a different financial position and lacked a support system. However, I work as a marketing manager for a large company. Not only does this allow me the privilege of working from home about 50% of the time, but it also grants me financial independence. I do not rely on my husband for money and I really never have. He works in tech so, while he makes a good salary, I will have no need for spousal support. I have a phenomenal support system; this baby will be loved so dearly by so many. Yes, I will have to deal with my husband for the rest of my life if I have this child and it will make future relationships for me more difficult, but it is worth it. I've wanted this baby since day one and I am her mother, which means that I am strong enough to raise her alone because I have to be strong enough.

Here's to hoping for a speedy divorce. I'm ready to be done with this marriage. Which is crazy because just a few days ago I thought my life was as close to perfect as you could get.

tl;dr Husband admitted to an affair. I will be proceeding with a divorce and will keep our baby. I'm numb but calm and feeling good about my decisions and how I handled the situation. I know there is a long road ahead of me and this will all probably really hit me soon. When it does, I'll mourn and grieve the end of what I had thought was a happy union. Right now I'm in self-preservation mode and much more focused on how to come out of this in the best position possible. Thank you so much for all the advice and support, Reddit!

Edit: Formatting

UPDATE: I know it has been only a short time since I posted this update but I need to tell you all how amazing all of you are. Wow, this much support is just... wow. I wish I could reply to all of your comments and messages but because of the volume, I'm just going to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to each and every one of you who read my posts, who commented, thought of me, wished my baby & me the best, messaged me, and anything else. I am currently at my parent's condo, sitting outside at their pool, sunbathing my little baby bump and reading each and every one of your amazing and empowering comments. I just want you all to have that image; that you have made me happy and content in a time when I am short on both. This is proof that love does exist, even if it doesn't within my, now over, relationship. And that is a powerful thing. 

Love to you all.


Me again: I was going to post more details on what happened during the confrontation with my husband, etc., but then I decided against it. I should keep some details private; it's likely my husband has seen this post. 

I will leave you with this:

My dad and I were up late talking last night and, as usual, he had the perfect thing to say to me. He told me that weak people are afraid of strong people. He told me to keep on terrifying the weak ones. That way, the only people who won't fear you are the bravest, strongest of people and those are the people who are worthy of you.

Then he said my husband is a spineless turd who couldn't kick it with the strongest woman in the world.

Just thought I'd leave you with that and encourage everyone to "be terrifying" by being strong and not standing for nonsense.

This is the last I will post on the matter. I have a lot ahead of me with everything and will probably go quiet on Reddit for a while. Time to get ready for court and to "be terrifying". :)

Thank you, thank you, thank you again. Love to all of you and best wishes.

Love,

-T

ANSWER: I've been thinking of you since I saw the original post a few days ago. It broke my heart to hear this, you deserve a thousand times better than a man like him.
You've handled the entire thing with utter grace by the sounds of things, I for one could not keep my cool especially if I had pregnancy hormones whizzing around my body. I am flawed by your measured response and strength to leave someone who quite clearly doesn't deserve you. That is true strength. Your child is lucky to have such a strong mother and role model. All the best for the future, you deserve happiness x




QUESTION: [UPDATE] Me [31F] with my husband [35 M] married 2 years together for 10. He doesn't want his kids to be like me.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2i34pr/me_31_f_with_my_husband_35_m_married_2_years/

It took me 3 more years, but I finally left him last year.

This post helped me see how much was wrong in our relationship, but I was still so hesitant to leave.

We had pets and a beautiful home together and I loved his family and we had so many inside jokes and plans for the future.

But eventually it was all just too much for me to take any longer. The day after his parents' 50th anniversary party, I told him I wanted a divorce. I just couldn't see myself living like that for 50 years.

I moved from the suburbs to the city with a friend. I rekindled some old friendships from high school and made a bunch of new friends who I am so thankful for. He kept the dog, I took the cats.

I thought my life was ending but it was just beginning.

I told my (very religious) family and they were all understanding and supportive. I've maintained friendships with a good number of our mutual friends, friendships I was worried about losing.

I'm working on my masters degree and volunteering and experiencing life and love and art and beauty like I never thought was possible.

I met a guy at a friend's punk rock show and we hit it off, but we are taking things very slowly. He is wonderful and so kind to me.

If you are in an abusive relationship, please don't be afraid to leave.

It gets so much better. I still miss him from time to time. I feel guilty about getting divorced, guilty for wasting my parents money on a failed marriage. I miss his parents. I miss my dog.

But I am SO MUCH happier. My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.

Thank you so much to everyone who offered advice and sympathized and even had harsh words for me deciding to stay.

tl;dr: Left my abusive husband. Life is much better.

EDIT: for those saying it didn’t sound that bad or abusive, you should know it got worse. It did escalate to physical abuse, us sleeping separately/no intimacy for a year. 

If you think you are too old or too much trouble or have too much baggage or are too much anything, please believe that it is possible to find love again. Both loving yourself and having someone else love you 💕

ANSWER: >My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.

Yes! I remember reading once that what human beings are scared of most is uncertainty. So in a way, staying with your abusive husband -- while awful and full of emotional abuse -- was the safe option because you knew what you were in for. Leaving him was an act of bravery and I hope your future is full of warmth and love.




QUESTION: [Update]I [30f] want to discuss moving in with boyfriend [34m] but we have a significant difference in income.

OP:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i\_30f\_want\_to\_discuss\_moving\_in\_with\_boyfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i_30f_want_to_discuss_moving_in_with_boyfriend/)

Thanks for all the advice, I ended up broaching the topic last week.

As mentioned in the first post both my boyfriend and I have been hinting around the topic but hadn't directly discussed it. I was still on the fence about bringing it up myself when my boyfriend made a comment about how he's excited for us to live together (one day). I just responded with, "Well did you want to? My lease is up in July." and he said that he did.

It was before work when it happened so we left it at that for the day and got together that evening to work out details. I expressed to him at that point that while I would love living with him that my concern was that I wouldn't be able to contribute equally and I didn't want him feeling taken advantage of. He in turn expressed that he'd never want to put me in a bad position financially and that we could easily figure out something that would be fair while still putting me in a better financial position.

We ended up deciding we'd go with a lump sum monthly that I'll pay to him to cover all the costs, rather than splitting bills. The monthly amount he offered at first I actually upped because I didn't think he was being fair to himself, and it was still less than what I pay now. He seemed happy with that and it definitely works for me!

He keeps mentioning how excited he is to move in together, and came to my apartment last week to help me clean for photos to show it! We're deciding together what we'll keep out of my furniture vs. his, what we'll get rid of and what we're going to store. He's also mentioned a couple renovations he wants to get done around the condo so we're going to go together to pick stuff out and make it a summer project. :)

TL;DR: Boyfriend gave me an opening to ask about moving in so I seized it. All went well and we'll be moving in together in June!

Edit: Wow... this really blew up! Thanks to everyone for the super kind words. To address the most common comment here; we did discuss splitting proportionally but ultimately decided to go with a lump sum. I definitely see benefits to proportional splitting but for where we are right now and my financial situation I prefer a lump sum. It's still significantly less than what I'm paying now, and it wont fluctuate as the weather changes so I can count on what I owe monthly not changing.

Many people have mentioned chores as well. My boyfriend and I tend to do chores together. I mean right now with two separate places we each have our things that are more our responsibility but when I've stayed with him for a stretch of time we've just balanced together. He doesn't know how to cook but wants to learn so we cook meals together and then clean up together. We will each have our own washroom at his place (I've already taken over the main washroom and he uses the en suite). He volunteers at a local animal shelter once a week so those days I clean and cook if I'm around. But generally speaking we just treat doing chores as an opportunity to spend time together and be productive. :)

ANSWER: Aw, this is adorable! You guys sound like you communicate well and really care for each other, good luck!




QUESTION: UPDATE: I (30F) caught my husband (31M) in an affair and I don’t know how to move forward.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i7wkqu/i_30f_caught_my_husband_31m_in_an_affair_and_i/

First of all, I just want to thank everyone here for the support I received following my first post back in August. At the time, it truly felt like my world was ending. It was important to me to make this update because I need to tell anyone who’s currently going through the same thing—IT GETS BETTER. You will get so much better. 

I had one conversation with my husband since everything happened—by his choice. It lasted maybe five minutes and was like talking to a robot. I know from others that he cries to people about how he ruined his life, but I have never once gotten an apology or the same show of regret. At this point, I don’t care. I know him and the other woman are still seeing each other and frankly, they deserve each other. Good for them. 

While I still feel angry occasionally, I no longer mourn what I once had. Instead, I’m so excited for the life I now get to live. I moved to a small walkable city and gave myself my dream apartment. It makes me so happy to see how I’ve decorated it and to just live in a cozy place instead of our old dreary house.  I was the breadwinner in our marriage, and he would make me feel awful about wanting to pay for nice meals or do fun things. Since moving here, I’ve done a ton of foodie fun stuff and don’t feel guilty. It’s so refreshing. 

I have dipped my toe into the dating pool again and had plenty of mediocre dates from dating apps. Recently, I found someone who I’ve really clicked with and am enjoying how appreciated and desired he’s made me feel.  It’s definitely early and we’re moving slow, but overall, dating has made me realize that I’m a catch who doesn’t have to settle. 

Therapy has done wonders and I’m so happy I immediately dove into it. My therapist is proud of me. I’m proud of me. I’ve stopped looking at being divorced as a failure. He failed—not me. I’m genuinely happy and excited to wake up each morning and no longer feel like this terrible weight is sitting on my chest. The holidays were surprisingly easy and I found myself so happy to spend time with my family without having to compromise anything. 

So all in all, life is good and there’s so much of it ahead. Looking back, I can’t believe I wasted so much time thinking about how I could get him to come home. I’ve made my own home and my own happiness and that is worth so so much more. 

TLDR; Husband left me for another woman. He sucks, but things get better.

ANSWER: Thank you. I forgot to mention above, but I also got a new job offer and am happily busy with fulfilling work again as well!




QUESTION: Update to the pettiest question ever

Update to this petty thing: [https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3hi08p/stupidest\_question\_ever\_is\_there\_any\_polite\_way/](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3hi08p/stupidest_question_ever_is_there_any_polite_way/)

It  took 5 years and a marriage and he curled his eyelashes last week. He found my eyelash curler and asked what it was for and I told him how to test it on himself. He said he didn't notice any difference but his eyes sparkled for the first time.

He's not going to keep doing it but at least I know what his pupils look like now lol

TL;DR: I didn't ask him, he asked me.

ANSWER: Thank god, I've been on the edge of my seat for the last 5 years. Glad you guys got married and things are OK. 

Give us another update in 5 years when you've got a house and a couple kids?




QUESTION: [UPDATE] I'm [28F] unsure if it's time to draw boundaries with my boyfriend [28M] and his coworker [late 20sF] who he got close to very quickly

Original post is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9cx874/im\_28f\_unsure\_if\_its\_time\_to\_draw\_boundaries\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9cx874/im_28f_unsure_if_its_time_to_draw_boundaries_with/)

TLDR of original: My boyfriend has become fast friends with a female coworker. She and her fiancé are now moving into our apartment building, and my boyfriend is seeing and talking to her more and more. I don't know if it's time to set boundaries or if I'm getting ahead of myself.

&#x200B;

A lot has happened since my last post, and I got some good advice there, so I wanted to post an update!

After I made the last post I came home from the trip with my family a couple of days later. I told my boyfriend that I wanted to talk to him about something and I brought up his friendship with Liz. I basically brought up all of my concerns from the post. I told him that I didn't want to discourage him from having a friend, but I also felt like they were talking quite a lot and spending a lot of time together, and that it was starting to make me feel uncomfortable.

My boyfriend took it really well! He immediately reassured me that he only saw her as a friend, and that he hadn't even realized how it could look to me. When I brought up how I felt like he wasn't being forthcoming with information (like how he didn't mention the phone call from her), he said that was 100% unintentional. He then immediately asked what he could do going forward to make me feel more comfortable. He offered to stop carpooling with her and to cut down on contact with her except for work-related stuff. I told him I didn't have a problem with the carpooling because financially it does make sense (he spends a lot of money on gas), but maybe he could try to text and call her outside of work a little bit less. I also told him I would really love to meet her and her fiance, and he enthusiastically agreed.

He set up a hang out for the following weekend - the two of us and Liz and her fiance all went out for drinks at a bar by our building (they'e moved in by now). It was actually really fun! It turns out we all have a ton in common. Liz and I do very similar work, and we all have common nerdy interests. It was a little awkward at first as meeting new people often is, but once we all got comfortable we had a blast. From there, we have all become fast friends, and Liz and I have developed our own separate friendship too. We text often, go over to each other's places for dinner sometimes, and hang out on weekends. I can honestly say I really like Liz (and her fiance) as a person and trust her 100%. I no longer have a problem with her friendship with my boyfriend at all. They do still carpool sometimes, but they've never hung out alone outside of work - it's always the four of us. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Finally, I have a separate - but slightly related - update: my boyfriend is now my FIANCE! Less than a month after I made my last post, he took me out for a really beautiful and romantic dinner. When we came home, our apartment was covered in roses and candles. I was so shocked I could barely move as he got down on one knee and proposed. I said YES and then cried for about two hours as we called all of our friends and family. It was absolutely perfect and we are getting married next year!

It turns out that Liz actually helped him plan the proposal and that was part of why they were talking a lot too! Since she lives in our building now, he had all of the flowers, candles, champagne, and accessories shipped to her and kept at her place until he was ready for them. He even had her hold onto the ring the week before he did it. After he proposed she came upstairs and took photos for us and cried with us. That was the moment I realized what a great friend she is to both of us.

So communication saves the day again! We're all great friends now, and Liz and I have regular girls nights to plan our weddings together :)

TL;DR: I talked to my boyfriend and he introduced me to Liz and her fiance right away. We're all great friends now and I'm no longer uncomfortable - but I am engaged!

EDIT: Wow, wow, wow!!!! I know this is stereotypical, but I never expected my post to blow up like this. I started reading the comments last night and planned to reply to some but then I got busy, and then this just got out of control! So let me just say here, thank you all SO MUCH for the support, advice, and well-wishes! You guys rule 😭 And thank you for the platinum, gold, and silver?! I’ve never gotten any of that before and now I’m a little sad that this is a throwaway and not my main, haha. I’ll pay it forward and gild someone today :)

ANSWER: Awww this is the kinda stuff I’m here for! I’m so glad the situation was resolved healthily and congrats on the engagement! 🤗☺️




QUESTION: UPDATE: Me [36 M] married to my Wife [36 F] 11 years, and I can't stop thinking about a girl I dated for 1 month 16 years ago.

Original Post 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lqpshq/me_36_m_married_to_my_wife_36_f_11_years_and_i/

So I mentioned to my wife vaguely that I was having a bit of a midlife crisis and ruminating on my past a bit too much. That I miss how I was physically at my peak in college. 

She said she is also having a bit of a crisis, worried about longterm health and missing the shape she was in before kids. 

We made a commitment to each other to get into shape and have changed our eating habits and bought a treadmill. I have been working out daily and my rumination issues have really dwindled. We also planned a nice vacation, and a few get togethers with frends in the next few months. 



---
tl;dr: Told wife I was having a crisis without much detail. We are making strides to better ourselves and each other.

ANSWER: That’s a great update. I can promise you that the one month relationship would have never worked out, because it didn’t. And how it ended suggests that it never had staying power. 

I hope that getting into shape helps you both. I think the pandemic also makes relationships tough because you’re likely no longer getting out and doing the things that brought you together (or, simply having time apart and separate interests). At least that’s been the case with my marriage! I think that would make it tempting to fantasize about some other reality that “could have” been (but really, it could have never been).




QUESTION: [UPDATE] My (28F) colleague (30F) didn't invite me to her wedding, and it's completely unravelled our friendship

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bctq5b/my_28f_colleague_30f_didnt_invite_me_to_her/)  


So it took me a few days to decide the best way to approach this, but yesterday I had lunch with her again and had the conversation. 

I started by saying: "So you've sent all your invitations out now, haven't you?"

She looked immediately panicked by my question and I knew right away that she didn't want me to go down this road. 

When she said she had sent them all, I asked if that meant she could show me her venue now. 

She showed me the website of it, including the photo gallery, and talked me through all about where everything was going to happen, all the flowers and decorations she was going to add etc. It's a nice enough country hotel with some pretty gardens, but I'm not sure what all the secrecy was for. 

I probed a little more, asking who she's invited from work (the list didn't include me), said I was looking forward to seeing the photos so I could see how everything looked (she didn't correct me that I would see it on the day) and then I was completely sure that my lack of invitation wasn't an accident. She looked so relieved when I switched subject and asked if she's excited about her honeymoon and having a rest from all the wedding stress. 

So I'm definitely not invited. I thought it over carefully and I have decided not to ask why, for three reasons:

1) The reason is already fairly obvious. She clearly doesn't think we're anything more than colleagues and I've misread the situation. (There were some other theories suggested e.g. jealous husband-to-be, associating me with her past grief, but considering everything I know about her and our history I'm sure it's not that.) I'm not sure why she didn't cool it on the wedding talk with someone she had no intention of inviting, or even just bring it up with me and explain why I'm not invited, but never mind.  
2) Having an awkward relationship at work is the last thing I want. I'm worried that if I push this and turn it into an "issue" that I'll look pathetic and needy, or it will just be unprofessional. I also run the risk of her badmouthing me to colleagues and mutual friends, and I will find it much easier and less messy to handle my own feelings quietly.   
3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down. 

And you know, I'm fine with not going. It was never really about getting invited to a wedding, it was more having to face the fact that I'd been naive and taken for granted, and I felt silly that I'd invested way too much in this relationship. That's not all on her, because she was never obligated to be my friend.

Talking it through on my previous post actually really helped me work through my feelings. When I went back to work on Monday I felt much calmer and more detached from it emotionally. 

I have looked back on our whole relationship and honestly she's always been self involved, entitled and narcissistic. Being a bride has just made it more obvious, but it's always been there. She's also never given back to me (besides helping me get my job, which of course I'm grateful for), in that she's never been willing to talk me through any problems I've had, and although I help her happily with her work, she says no if I ask her for help in return.

She has a few office enemies and even though I saw her negative traits that caused her to be disliked by some people, I overlooked them and defended her anyway. Now I have put a little distance there it's quite apparent that she's not a very nice person, and I'm genuinely OK with just moving on.

She hasn't really noticed the distance between us so far (or she has noticed and doesn't care/is relieved that I'm giving her space), so I intend to just continue with doing that. If she eventually asks why, or I get the sense that she's trying to rekindle our friendship, then it will be time to clear the air with how I've been feeling. If she doesn't and we just continue drifting, then that's probably for the best.

It's sad to lose a friend, and it will probably take me some time to get over it and to become comfortable with the change in our relationship, but I have other genuine friendships, and plenty of colleagues who are lovely people who I can get to know better now.

The main thing I really took from my original post, and I'm so glad I did post because I needed some tough love on this, is that my fear of confrontation really needs dealing with. 

If I can learn how to better speak my mind as things are happening, that will stop things from building and building until I have to have a Serious Conversation and it makes what should have been a molehill into a mountain. 

I also need to figure out how to have difficult conversations without having an anxiety attack, which not only weakens my message but is extremely distressing and puts me off dealing with things and being honest with people. 

I had a couple of books on assertiveness recommended to me, so I've bought them to start me off. I'm also looking into going to a coach, or maybe a couple of therapy sessions at least, to try and better myself. I don't want to hurt other people by doing this, so this has become top priority for me. 

Thank you so much everyone who pointed that out to me. I was aware of it but I didn't think it was a problem and figured I'd just be that way all my life. Now I know better. Thank you for being so honest with me.

Also thank you to those who talked me through the one-sided friendship issue. I'm a good listener and have always attracted people who need to vent, but I only ever noticed the one-off conversations, and didn't think I was being taken advantage of as a long term listening ear.

I have been examining my other friendships in the last few days, to see if anyone else is using me in the same way, or if I've even been doing this to others and not had the self awareness to realise. There are a couple of changes I need to make, including a friendship that I need to set some boundaries in, and another one where I've not been giving back to the other person as much I should have. I have learned a really valuable lesson from this about maintaining healthy relationships, and I'm very grateful for that.

&#x200B;

TL;DR So I'm definitely not invited, our friendship is likely over (but that's actually OK) and I'm going to work on my assertiveness so I can handle things like this better next time. I'm also going to move forward having learned a good lesson about friendships being two-way.

Edit: A few people have been asking about the books I was recommended:
Nonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg
When I Say No I Feel Guilty by Manuel J Smith
Why Men Love Bitches by Sherry Argov

ANSWER: > 3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down.

Jesus christ kudos for having that kind of outlook on things.




QUESTION: update to: Husband and I are having our longest fight ever and I don't know what to do

link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/abayxw/husband\_and\_i\_are\_having\_our\_longest\_fight\_ever/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/abayxw/husband_and_i_are_having_our_longest_fight_ever/)

Soon after I made the post, my husband called me. He was babbling and I couldn't understand him, so I kept asking him to slow down. Then he started screaming (not yelling, literally just screaming). I freaked out because I thought he was being murdered or something. I tracked his phone to a park in town and called 911.

Turns out he had a complete mental breakdown. He's in the process of being diagnosed with a mental illness that usually shows up in people's 20s but for some reason manifested later in him. He's currently in an inpatient mental health program and already doing a lot better.

Thank you all again for the responses and advice on my original post.

&#x200B;

ANSWER: The onset of mental illness posts are the ones that I hate the most. 

Often nobody is really at fault, but its likely the start of a long and difficult road for all involved.




QUESTION: UPDATE: I (26F) want to propose to my boyfriend (25M) but just found out he plans to propose as well

Link to my original post: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/exp0i0/i_26f_want_to_propose_to_my_boyfriend_25m_but/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So yesterday he took me to run errands but he "randomly" decided to we should just have fun instead. He took me around the city, we tried all kinds of food, had honestly the most fun I've had since I was a kid, made memories off of little moments, I didn't think that much of it. I realized that the whole day had basically been an all day-date, I knew it had to be coming and I had the ring with me and I was going to try and propose at the same time (someone suggested this in my original post and I thought it would be cute) 

He opened my door, walked me down a beautiful pathway and just looked me in the eyes and I said yes. He laughed and dropped down to one knee and I started crying and forgot that I was supposed to be proposing too. I don't even remember what he said, he was on his knee for a while saying what I'm sure were the sweetest things, but I was too busy crying. I'd already said yes before he even got down on one knee so he put the ring on my finger.

We went home and and I realized I didn't propose, he wanted to shower and we sometimes shower together so I proposed to him in there. He smiled and said “I wonder if when our first kid is born will it top this moment” then because I was on my knees in the shower he had to make a sex joke 😂

After we got out he held me while we called his parents (I'd already called my whole family in car ride home) 

Yesterday was amazing and now I'm laying next to him while he plays video games and he's talking about our engagement to his friends and I couldn't be happier and I don't know how to contain all this and just ugh! I love you Nathan!❤️

Edit: Thank you to everyone congratulating us! I appreciate it very much 😊

TL;DR: He took me on a romantic all day date and popped the question. I was supposed to propose at the same time but was too busy crying form happiness, I proposed to him in the shower when we got home😂 I'm overjoyed right now!

ANSWER: I needed this positivity. This may sound weird coming from a random stranger, but I'm happy for you. Wish you all the best and your SO as well.




QUESTION: My (30F) husband (32M) impulse bought a dog. [update]

Update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cmu75w/my_30f_husband_32m_impulse_bought_a_dog/

Thank you all for the thorough responses. I read every comment you guys sent.

A few months ago I read a post where a woman sat down with her husband and outlined everything she takes care of at home in a list format. Like, kitchen: trash, dishes, wipe counters down. Etc. That way of communicating really stuck with me and when we went to see our therapist, I used the same format to express how much I do for the dog.

My husband told me that owning a dog was a joint effort and since I’m home all day it shouldn’t be a problem.

Which is when I realized that has been his excuse for everything. Cooking, chores, cleaning. I’m not sure how I became blind to it. I don’t know when I started bending over backwards to accommodate him.

We used to be a solid couple who helped each other out. I remember when I was still in school he’d come over to my apartment and clean the whole thing for me during finals. Or he took care of my elderly cat when I was away for a week and a half. He used to help me dry the dishes and it was always fun. We used to have so much fun and laugh all the time. At some point it all stopped.

I started crying right there in the middle of a sentence and he got concerned. I’m not a cryer the only time he’s ever seen me cry was when I had to put my beloved cat down a few years ago. But he held me for the first time in what felt like months and we had a serious heart to heart about how he made me feel. Not only with the dog but how stressed I’ve been with my job, how lonely I am, I don’t feel important and how we don’t feel like a team anymore, that I’m worried about us.

I guess it clicked for him because he really stepped up taking care of the dog. He started going into work earlier so he can come home early and hang out and make me dinner. It happened slowly over the course of the last few weeks and the routine suits us a lot better. We hired a trainer to make sure we can understand the dog’s boundaries together and the dog sleeps in a dog bed. Our bedroom life has slowly gotten back to where it was when we got married. We’re watching our favorite shows again and going out more. I’ve been putting my foot down more about my feelings and he has been receptive. We are still going to therapy for now. 

As for the dog, we’re going to keep him. Is he a No List dog? Yes. But is he a good puppy with a big heart? Yes. We have the money to afford him and he took off after training. It’s nice having a dog again.

TL;DR: husband and I went to therapy, we talked through our problems, we are giving our marriage the time and attention it needs to mend. We’re keeping the dog.

ANSWER: Good job on the communication. Things can sneak up on people and unfair routines can creep in. I'm glad that you two seem to be correcting course for your relationship and it's a big positive that he's putting in a lot more effort now.




QUESTION: [UPDATE] I [29F] am traveling overseas to meet my online "boyfriend" [38M] in a week. He just said he had to cancel

So many through comments and PMs requested an update from my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9vlueu/i_29f_am_traveling_overseas_to_meet_my_online/) and so I thought I'd do one!

After my post I FaceTimed him to say my what I wanted to say and end things. He tried to get me to post-pone my trip and even tried to give me money to make me less mad at him. I told him whatever we had was over as I could no longer trust him. He cried which made me feel weird. I wished him and his ex the best and ended the call. 

I went on my trip and had a top class time. The Reddit community really astounds me sometimes. I received a lot of PMs of suggestions of things to do and see and the trip to Ireland became a trip of a lifetime. In Dublin I did meet up with a very kind Redditor who showed me around the city and came with me to a bunch of museums during my stay. I saw amazing sights, met a bunch of really cool people through my travels, and met a few really cute Irish boys. (;

I learned a lot about myself on my first solo trip abroad. I am pretty self reliant and I did a lot of self reflection. This "relationship" was my first "serious" one after my ex and I split up. I think in my desire for closeness with someone I ignored a lot of red flags and downplayed my self worth. I am now focusing on making real connections with people I meet in real life and have decided to stay away from anything long distance indefinitely. 

My first night in Belfast I did message him after I had had a what was probably too many beers (damn you delicious Irish beers!) and he said he was sorry but it was what it had to be. It didn't really seem sincere and it extinguished any romantic notions I had. 

Thank you to everyone who commented and PM'd me. It really made me excited for my trip and it was the best time!

TLDR; Online BF backed out but after some logistical rearranging I still went on my trip and had the best time ever. Glad I cancelled the bf and not the trip.

ANSWER: > Glad I cancelled the bf and not the trip. 

I love this, lol! I'm glad I caught the update post, and am so happy that you went through with the trip! Wishing you oodles of happiness and success in the future, OP. ♥




QUESTION: Update: My wife [28F] found out that my mother [59F] and I [28M] have been lying to her about our (me and my wife's) baby [0M] for months

Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/az648p/my\_wife\_28f\_found\_out\_that\_my\_mother\_59f\_and\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/az648p/my_wife_28f_found_out_that_my_mother_59f_and_i/)

Don't think anyone would particularly care about an update but I all appreciated the insight anyways. So here's an update:

After I wrote the original post, my mom took my son to stay overnight with my wife's sister so that the two of us could have the house to ourselves.

We pretty much just talked for an hour while constantly reaffirming that we love each other a lot and want to sort this out. I apologized and explained why I did what I did. She said that feeling like she was there for our son's milestones was really just a band-aid solution that didn't actually convince her she was present. She said that if she actually had been using the milestones to feel like she was present, this would probably have felt worse for her. But since she wasn't, in her words, "deluding herself into thinking she's actually home", her main issue was that I lied which hurt her feelings. I apologized and explained that I honestly thought that she would prefer the lying if given the choice. She said she understood where I was coming from and that she felt betrayed when she realized, but she sees that I was doing it because I love her and she thinks we'll probably laugh about it with our grandkids one day (yes, I am very aware I don't deserve my wife).

Some things came out on my end that I wasn't going to tell her and didn't mention in my last post- namely, that I'm scared she's going to become suicidal. My uncle committed suicide when I was a child, in part from working in a high-stress job where he made a huge and costly mistake. One of my wife's colleagues attempted suicide while she was on mat leave. Being a working mom is bad enough, being a resident in this program is bad enough, both combined are a recipe for trouble. Since our son was born and the incident with her colleague happened, I've been afraid that if her home life wasn't perfect, it would push her over the edge. Anyways, she reassured me that that's not happening and I think saying it out loud also made me realize it's a pretty irrational, groundless fear.

We ordered takeout and sat together watching the real videos I have of all our son's firsts. I also have a special folder of pictures/videos of my son with my wife, so we went through that after. She almost choked from laughing so hard when I tentatively revealed the beanbag trick. I am the laughing stock of her friend-group chat. So I guess we're already at the stage where we're laughing about it.

Thank you to those who responded to the last post! The stereotype of someone in [r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships) advocating divorce every time anything happens is true.

tl;dr: marriage is work. I am stupid. We moved past it.

ANSWER: I've always heard that NO firsts ever happen in daycare. Until Mom sees it happening, it didn't happen. Many grandparents feel the same way.




QUESTION: UPDATE: I (34F) feel unattractive and my husband (41M) of 5 years has low libido

I posted last summer about [struggles with my husband of 5 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/), our longest dry spell being 9 months.

I felt unattractive and undesirable, and wanted to have sex more often, but he was happy to never have sex again (aside from how that would affect me). I wanted to feel like a sex Goddess again. Reddit advised me all kinds of things, from checking testosterone, to therapy, and even that there was no hope and if I wanted to feel like a Goddess again, I'd have to leave him. The [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/estjlke?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that hit me hardest was jimmyjrdanceparty's who pointed out that I was allowed to feel the way I did.

Well, I feel like a Goddess again, everyone! :D

What happened? I decided to go to individual therapy, and focus on myself, work on myself. My physical self-image was a symptom of a larger problem. Troubles at work, troubles at home, a storm inside. During counselling, I opened the door to a cellar where I had been keeping my true self locked in the dark - ashamed of her. I was bullied as a kid, and I had no idea I had accumulated so much self-loathing since then. Releasing that was amazing and so freeing!

And so, by the time I said goodbye to my counsellor, I was stronger and more self-assured. I realised I had been sacrificing so much of myself for the sake of others (especially the important men in my life - my husband, my boss, my father, my manager, etc). I was constantly seeking approval, trying to please them. My relationships had gotten completely out of balance.

Things started to get complicated. I developed a crush on a colleague, and because I am demisexual, my attraction to my husband started to diminish. The more time passed the more I felt like I just didn't care anymore what he thought of me.

At a low point, I said to my husband: "You know, you always keep your thoughts to yourself. I used to find it mysterious and interesting - like a puzzle I could unwrap. But now I realise that there's actually no mystery to unravel. There's just nothing. And the silence is boring." It was hurtful and unkind. I'm not proud of it. Something changed after that. Both for him, and for me.

Over the course of the next few months I gave less, and I took more. I went to conferences, I left the kids with my husband, I took time off work, I stopped making up for the mistakes of my superiors at work and let them deal with the consequences of their actions. I felt like I was coming home to my true self - my no nonsense kickass self.

One night my husband and I were watching Alien, and he confessed that ever since he'd seen the original as a boy, he'd really liked Ripley. She was the kind of woman he had wanted to marry. And so he married me. You should've seen my face, the tears wouldn't stop. I felt like he had finally told me what I needed to hear the most.

I got rid of my attraction to my colleague. It's actually not that hard as a demi, I just focused on everything I didn't like about them, and within a week or two the crush was totally gone. I find them a total turn-off now.

Do you remember I mention I wasn't able to initiate sex? That's because it was a huge turn-off for my husband. One evening we discussed why, and you know what? He felt too much pressure if I initiated, because he thought he'd have to perform. Once he realised that he can safely turn me down if he's not in the mood - and also that's it's OK for us to kiss and cuddle without it leading to something more - he's been OK with me initiating. You'd think you wouldn't get to age 40 without having figured that out, but hey... I guess people never cease to throw surprises!? Haha!

Our sex life improved a lot. I no longer needed his praise to sooth my self-loathing, so I was less needy about it. He initiated a bit more often. But more importantly, with greater enthusiasm and quality! He chooses what I wear sometimes - and I feel so beautiful when he looks at me like I am the only being that matters. And he compliments me! We even got into a bit of light D/s, which has spiced things up a lot!

Even though I had fallen out of love with him for a while, I have fallen back in love with my husband stronger and harder than ever before!! I couldn't be happier, I love myself, and I love him so SO much!! He's just the best partner I could ever wish for! <3

Thank you reddit for helping me through one of the hardest lows in my life, and thank you especially jimmyjrdanceparty for your advice and encouragement.

TLDR: I felt unattractive and my husband didn't want sex. I went to a counsellor. I stopped self-loathing. Husband and I fell back in love again & have great sex.

Update: OMG thank you thank you thank you for all the comments and awards! I have no words! I thought maybe 5 people would care about the update, not this amazing amount of encouragement! Thank you so much, so glad to have been on this journey with you. <3

ANSWER: This is the best post I have ever read on here. You changed your thoughts about yourself, which is the secret to life (IMO). Congrats and thank you for this empowering and amazing story!




QUESTION: UPDATE: My [24 F] boyfriend [26 M] of 6 months told me that I need to "unlove" the men from my past before I can love him.

Link to original post [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ccl1gt/my\_24\_f\_boyfriend\_26\_m\_of\_6\_months\_told\_me\_that\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ccl1gt/my_24_f_boyfriend_26_m_of_6_months_told_me_that_i/)

Figured I'd update my post from about a month ago. Unfortunately, there wasn't a happy ending, but I am very grateful for a lot of the advice I received here. Thank you, reddit, for helping me keep my head on straight!

After I made my first post, I read all the comments and thought about everything for a few days. A lot of people mentioned that they would not be comfortable with the frequency of my communication with my ex. I thought that was very fair. People also mentioned that Mark's behavior was pretty controlling and not ok. I also thought that was fair.

I went to talk to Mark and told him that I understood if he was uncomfortable with me being in touch with Eli weekly, and that I would be totally willing to cut that down. I also reiterated again that I was not currently in love with Eli and hadn't been for a while. Mark was understanding this time and seemed happy with the fact that I offered to cut down my contact with Eli.

But then I told Mark that although I was willing to do this, I wasn't happy with how he approached the issue and that I found his behavior controlling. I basically told him that I want him to approach issues in a more rational way and I would appreciate if he opened a dialogue rather than just telling me what to do, and that I wouldn't put up with him trying to "command" me to do something (especially something so ridiculous). I said everything in the same tone as I used for the first half of the conversation - I wasn't yelling at him or admonishing him, just trying to let him know where my boundaries are.

You guys - Mark. Flew. Off. The. Handle. He started SCREAMING at me. I obviously wasn't having it, so I got up to leave. He started throwing dishes and random kitchen items at me, and grabbed me and slammed my head into the door jam. I ended up with a nasty black eye and a busted lip. Luckily for me, a neighbor heard the commotion and called the cops. Mark was arrested and I was taken to the hospital. Yes, I'm pressing charges and filed for a restraining order.

Overall, it was a horrible incident but I'm glad this happened earlier in the relationship rather than later. And I am forever grateful for the neighbor who called the cops. Im also grateful to (most of) you guys for telling me that I wasn't being insane in my first post and for pointing out the early warning signs. It wasn't the best ending, but I'm ok and I'm just glad it's over. Take this as a cautionary tale, I guess!

TLDR: tried to have a rational conversation with Mark, he gave me a black eye and busted lip, it's over (thank God).

EDIT: I've gotten a lot of concerned messages (which I appreciate!) telling me to watch out for Mark now and that abusers are often at their most dangerous right after a breakup. Just to ease everyone's mind: I'm staying with a classmate (who Mark does not know) for the time being, so I'm well-protected! Thanks everyone!

ANSWER: Him: WOULD A CONTROLLING PSYCHO DO THIS?!

Him: (Smashes dishes and your head)

All of us: ...yes?

I’m really glad you got out of there. I hope you heal quickly.




QUESTION: [UPDATE] My best friend (20M) asked me (20M) out. I said yes. I didn't know it was a date.

The original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9du198/my_best_friend_20m_asked_me_20m_out_i_said_yes_i/

First of all, I wanted to thank people for responding. I was majorly panicking when I wrote the post, and the comments I got helped a ton to get me to relax before talking to Noah. I wasn't expecting such a huge response at the time and I was amazed, but looking back now I can see why it got so much attention. It was a pretty weird situation.

Next, I want to say we are both men (apparently this makes a big difference for some people in terms of advice). Some of the people who assumed I was a woman also made some weird comments and sent me some pretty gross messages. If you did this, please stop. That's not cool.

I gave a bit of an update as an edit to the original post, but now since it's been 3 months I thought I'd give you all an update about how things have been going since then, since it seems like there's been a bit of interest, and I'm still really thankful to all of you for helping me out.

Noah is doing really well. I could tell he was still a bit embarrassed for the first couple weeks, but after that he told me again that he was still happy he asked me because now he knew how I felt and he could get over it. He also thanked me for taking it so well, which is definitely thanks to what a lot of you said, so I guess I'm sort of passing his thanks on to you :P

One of the commenters said I should be careful not to do anything that seemed like flirting with him, so I tried keep that in check (we used to hug a lot, sit really close together, and tell each other flirty jokes, you get the idea, but I toned those all down a lot to give him space and not mess with his feelings). I honestly think I see now why he thought I might be into him, because my relationship with him was very affectionate. It's been a lesson for me on how to be more aware of how other people are interpreting my signals.

About a month after he asked me out, he asked me if I wanted to go to a gay bar with him. He made it super clear that it wasn't a date, but he did it in a really sarcastic way, which was a little embarrassing for me but also I think it was good that he could joke about it. So we went to a local gay bar together and we had a really good time. He's a bit introverted, so I played the wingman, and he ended up flirting with this really cute guy and he just seemed really happy.

That was like two months ago and we've gone to the same bar a couple more times since then. He's been getting a bit more comfortable putting himself out there which is really cool to see, and he's just been more open and happy for the last two months, always smiling and eager to go do stuff. Not sure how it's related but it's a noticeable change from before he asked me out.

I'm doing great too. I'm just really happy that I didn't hurt our relationship and that he's so happy. I also learned some important things from this whole situation about communication and being aware of how I present myself. Important lessons. I actually think I feel more confident now too, since he asked me out. Getting asked out feels good man.

It sounds kind of weird, but I think it made us closer. We've started talking about relationships more, which isn't something we really talked about before. He's gone on a few dates and he tells me about them, and the most recent guy he went out with he was really excited about, and I think he might be headed for his first serious relationship, which is amazing! That's actually what made me think of this post and decide to give you all an update.

TL;DR: So yeah, our relationship wasn't ruined and I still have my best friend. He's doing really well and I love seeing him so happy.

Thanks again for the help!

ANSWER: What a lovely happy update - and I had to go back and check your ages because the maturity and self awareness you have both shown is pretty impressive. Big smile from this mom 🙂 Happy holidays!




QUESTION: (Update) How do I (28f) break up with someone when I’m their (31m) everything?

[Link to original post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aab0wm/how_do_i_28f_break_up_with_someone_when_im_their/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Straight to it: I broke up with him a day after I made my original post a few months ago. I was emboldened by the support and, strangely enough, even some of the negative comments. I came home from work and blurted it out, straight and to the point. I told him that I wasn’t happy, I hadn’t been for a while, and that we would be separating. We agreed that he could stay in the extra bedroom for a few months while we got everything sorted but when the lease was up we would be going our separate ways. 

The last few months have been hard. He went into full blown panic mode, promised to change in the ways I had waited years for, and had several actual melt downs begging me to stay. It was painful, but my resolve to live my own life never wavered. 

I just signed a new lease (by myself) and have begun to casually date someone in the same field as me. Life has an excitement to it that I haven’t felt in years, it’s like I’ve taken my first deep breath in a long time. 

So, if you’re on the fence about leaving someone but your lives are so enmeshed that you don’t see how it is possible: put yourself first, there is always a way out. Thank you! 

TLDR: I broke up with my codependent boyfriend and am the happiest I have been in years.

ANSWER: Amen.

Leases, shared bills, mutual enjoyment of GOTs or Survivor while everything else is terrible is no reason to stay together.

I’ve told my sons. Keep an emergency fund that you NEVER touch. Don’t bail on relationships, but NEVER stay in a relationship because you don’t have first months/last months rent and security deposit. 

EDIT - thanks for the gold!! Just trying to share some hard-earned wisdom.




QUESTION: UPDATE: My [27F] boyfriend's [27M] old crush returning after a few years away. I was worried he would leave me for her, sadly I was right.

Old post - https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xgz9v/my_25f_boyfriend_25m_had_a_crush_on_a_girl_25f/

He ended up breaking up with me about a month after she came back and got back with her. It's been two years since this all happened and I heard through the grapevine they got engaged last weekend. I've moved on and it's alright, but my heart breaks when I think of how insecure and self-conscious I felt when all this went down. I know I'll eventually find a guy who I won't have any worries about, until then I'm chilling.

TL;DR: I was right to be worried.

ANSWER: I get you. I was supposed to be getting engaged and married to a guy who I thought loved me. Come to find he was cheating on me. They have since gotten married and had a family.

The biggest thing that stung wasnt the fact that he cheated, but the thought that I wasn't good enough for him but she was. I had to realize that I was good enough for a good man.

You are good enough. You are worthy of love and affection. You are 100% worth it and there is someone out there who will see that. I promise you.




QUESTION: [UPDATE] Me [32/F] with my husband [39 M] 6-years, our sex life disappeared; he swears he's attracted to me and I'm not sure what to believe or do.

[Here is the original post.  It is from over two years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40tuc7/me_32f_with_my_husband_39_m_6years_our_sex_life/)

I know my original post is so old, but the biggest update only recently happened.  My therapist suggested I post about it here to help sort out how I feel right now and also as a warning to other people.  I feel like I have grown so much in the last few years and maybe I'm a bit less naive (or a bit more bitter... however you'd like to put it).

Through interacting with the comments, I came up with an ultimatum I would give my husband.  

1.  He needed to get his medical stuff tested.

2.  He see someone psychologically.

3.  Couple's counseling.

I decided ahead of time that he'd have to do the legwork for this already.  I had already done so much legwork for this relationship and I wanted to make sure I didn't hold his hand through this either.

He took it surprisingly well for what the conversation was.  There were tears on both sides but he agreed that yes, he would be willing to do these things for the sake of the relationship.  

And then days passed.  And a week past.  I finally brought it up again and it caused a minor fight where he told me he needed to do this sort of stuff on his own time.

A few more weeks past.  I realized that he did not care enough to do something about this.  It was a hard thing to realize, but it was clear as day.

I headed over a friend's house to talk things out, clear my head, and come up with a plan for divorce.

I drove home and a few minutes before I arrived, he got a phone call that his sister was in a coma and dying.  I booked him tickets to go see her.  She passed away a few hours after he saw her.  

She left behind two late-teenage girls.  Who we were now partially responsible for.

So I pushed my pain down and decided to be the best aunt I can to these two girls.  I also got myself a dog (best decision ever in this situation) to keep my own spirits up.

I worked really hard at this and felt like my husband and I were getting closer in the process.

More recently, I started realizing that everything we were doing for the girls was initiated through me--not him.  So I started paying more attention.  He was getting annoyed at me making a big deal over surprise care packages their school suggested we send in and other things like that.  I was starting to resent that he wasn't caring for his nieces in the same way as I was.

On the youngest niece's graduation day, I asked him if he thought the other parents there would be getting flowers for the graduates and if that's something we should do.  This is when he totally lost it at me.  It was a string that started with him yelling about how I get too concerned about these sorts of things and ended with a rant about how I buy too many crackers when company comes over for dinner.  This started changing the lens I was looking at him through again.  Also, at this point, I felt like my nieces had launched into the world with lives of their own.

I started re-seeing the eyerolls when I talked.  The cutting remarks about my intelligence.  Oh, and the utter lack of sex.

So I started talking to people.  I started seeing a therapist.  And together, we all came up with a plan to discuss everything with him--probably ending in divorce (though I never took that as a definite).

I decided we had a different view of what a relationship and marriage should be.  My plan was to present that to him calmly and let him give his opinion of how he sees things.

I had a work trip so I took the time to recoup.  I went on a long hike, and even though I'm not really religious, I prayed the whole damn time about this.

So when I got home, in the calmest and most even way I could, I explained the situation as I saw it and asked for his feedback.  My friends and I rehearsed what would happen if he cried and begged for a chance to change--or what to do (or rather, where to go) if he got really angry.

But nothing prepared me for his reaction.  He agreed with me.  He said that everything felt "forced" to him and that this wasn't a natural relationship.  That he married me because that was the path he was on, and since he wasn't planning on having kids, it's not like that mattered all that much.  In fact, he prefers being alone generally.

He then finished by asking if I thought we should get couple's counseling.  I calmly said that given what he just said, I didn't think that was an option.  He immediately started trying to talk next steps, who gets what, etc.  He brought up that he could probably technically fight for alimony but that he wouldn't.  And said he wouldn't fight for my dog if I don't fight to go after his seperate finances.  

I think this was the most painful in the moment reaction I could have had from him.  I told him I would give him some space that night, so I drove to my friend's house and cried my eyes out.  Him not fighting it is ultimately better for the long run, but it's really hard to realize that your husband of 5 years (and partner for 8) never really loved or cared for you.  

I should have listened to my gut all along.

We had that talk last night.  I'm currently sitting in a coffee shop, typing this all out.  I'm a relatively attractive person and I channeled my frustrations over the last few years into lifting and working out almost every day.  So I'm hopeful when it comes to love in the future.    

I don't really know what my next step is.  I might drive to my brother's.  I might look for a storage facility.  It's a bit overwhelming to think about.

Overall, I'm so grateful this is happening now and that I won't be looking back at my life when I'm 85 years old, disappointed that it never really started.  I have my life in front of me and it's a big scary place.  But after I finish crying my eyes out, it's one step in front of the other.

And thank you everyone for all your help.

tl/dr:  Put off divorce due to spouse's sister dying and despite everything we worked on together, found out he never really loved me.

ANSWER: I am so sorry.. 

I wanted to come here to say, specifically, thank you so much for being an amazing aunt to those girls. I lost my mom when I was 15 and my aunts were hands-down the biggest blessing during that time. I don’t know if I would have chosen to continue living if it hadn’t been for their support. So thank you for being so incredibly selfless and supportive for your nieces.




QUESTION: UPDATE: recently found out that I (17M) got into my brother's (19M) former dream university which he did not get accepted to last year, feeling guilty about really wanting to go now

Update to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95s4ri/recently_found_out_that_i_17m_got_into_my/)

On Saturday I was able to speak to my brother and tell him that I got into the university. He was really happy for me, like a lot of people said he would be. When I told him I got in he gave me a huge hug and was really excited. It was such a huge relief. 

He asked me if it was my top choice, since he didn't know I had applied. I told him it was and he said that we have to celebrate then. He told me I didnt seem excited enough and I should be really proud of myself, and he asked if it was the shock of just finding out. 

When I told him I find out a few days ago and he was the only one that knew he asked me whats going on, because I wasnt reacting to the great news like it was great news. I admitted that I worried about telling him because I didnt want him to be mad. 

We talked about it and he basically said what everyone in the comments said, that he's proud of me and happy for me. I mentioned that I got into a different program than his and my requirements were lower, and he told me to not downplay my success and to stop worrying about him being mad because he wasn't. He told me that when I told out parents he wanted me to be more confident and proud of myself, because I did something great. 

 Yesterday while we were hanging out at his buddy's house he told me I should tell them the news, when I didnt want to because I hate talking about myself he asked if could tell them, which I told him was OK. they were all happy for me too. Honestly, he's reaction was better than I even hoped for, but looking back I should have expected it from him because that's always been the type of brother he is.

TL;DR told my brother I got into the university and he incredibly supportive and happy for me. He told me not limit my success to make other people more comfortable, and that he was proud of me (which meant a lot to hear).

ANSWER: Respect to the brother for being 19 but behaving like a real adult here. Setting a great example for little bro.




QUESTION: Update: My [25f] boyfriend [26m] of 10 months is best friends with his ex [20s?f]. She refuses to meet me and it's getting weird

Link to OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6mql7n/my_25f_boyfriend_26m_of_10_months_is_best_friends/


I wrote my previous post over a year ago, and a lot has happened since then. I wanted to give everyone an update, since the advice on this sub was really helpful at the time.



For a few months after I wrote my OP, nothing much happened. Jeff and I continued dating, and he continued being friends/partners with Jenna. I never met her, but everything else in our relationship seemed to be going so well that I decided I'd try to deal with it.



Things got really hard, however, when I had to take a work contract 12 hours away from home for three months. I hardly saw Jeff the whole time, and I looked at Jenna's instagram almost every day to see if she'd posted more photos of them together. More often than not, she had. Since I wasn't physically present, I felt like Jenna was his real girlfriend. I felt completely worthless and constantly stressed out, knowing my boyfriend was spending all his time with another woman who I already had suspicions about.



While I was away for work, I decided to break up with Jeff. I broke up with as soon as I came back, and I made it very clear that his relationship with Jenna was intolerable for me. I told him he was going to have a hard time dating anyone who wasn't her as long as she was still in his life. He kept saying he didn't understand why it was such a problem. He told me he couldn't control her behaviour, but he promised me he hadn't cheated on me. I explained to him that by allowing their friendship to continue, he was condoning her behaviour. I told him I didn't really even care if he'd physically cheated or not, since he'd already shown disrespect for me and our relationship. 





I didn't speak to him for a few months and I went on with my life. I took another contract out of town and even considered moving permanently to another city. One night, though, Jeff called me and apologized. He said he had been thinking about our relationship a lot and realized he had been in the wrong. He said his relationship with Jenna was beginning to feel toxic to him, and he'd made arrangements to dissolve their business partnership. After that, I decided to meet up with him (not necessarily give him another chance) and discuss the situation further. When we met up, he promised to stop talking to Jenna and unfollowed her on all social media.




As of now, he has not spoken to her in six months, and we've gotten back together. We actually ran into her at a concert a few weeks ago, and they didn't even say hi to each other. I feel much more respected and confident in my relationship now.









TLDR: I broke up with my boyfriend. He ended his friendship/partnership with his ex and we have gotten back together.

ANSWER: Wow. Good for both of you that the communication ended up working and you're happy together now. Congrats and hope it works out.





QUESTION: Update 2: I (30F) caught my husband (31M) in an affair and don’t know how to move forward.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/vfJzYwOX6V

Update 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/uMVTyBbusT

Wow. I can’t believe this happened over five years ago now. In some ways, it feels like it happened to me in a different life. I still get messages asking about this and figured I could add some insight into how life can look a few years down the line after everything gets completely and utterly wrecked. Good news—If you put in the work, it looks pretty fucking great.

First of all—where is my ex husband now? I haven’t had contact with him since September of 2020 and largely don’t keep track of things but I can see that this man still follows me on Instagram and watches all of my stories. I considered blocking him, but just let it be. I think it’s the petty part of me who’s living a full life that’s fine with rubbing it in a bit.

He and the affair partner did get married after a whoopsie kid and I’m pretty sure they had another. But they also both lost their jobs as teachers (he got her a job at his school, so she was working with an entire staff that knew they had an affair) and had to move to the middle of nowhere. Last I heard of them, the affair partner had been texting his former best friend unhinged rants about not including them in get togethers or allowing my ex-husband to be a groomsman in his wedding.

But enough about them, because they already took up way too many pages in my story.  When we last left off, I think I had just moved to a new city (shoutout to Richmond, VA!) and was largely just finding myself again. I think the change of scenery was the best thing that I did for myself. I was never meant to live in the suburbs and moving to a beautiful little city where I can walk to coffee shops, bakeries and bookstores honestly helped my mental health as much as the therapy. I bought a house here a couple years ago and have really settled in.

Then I got my puppy, a corgi named Bilbo Baggins who really is the true love of my life. He is the greasiest thing to happen to me and is just such a fantastic chonky guy. We go to a local dog park with a bar all the time and he even has his own lil’ dog social group. Kids aren’t something I plan on, so he is basically my son.

It hasn’t all been perfect. My dad died, my best friend moved across the country, and I largely haven’t really been dating much the past couple of years.  Dating hasn’t been a huge priority for me and my friends say that I’m probably too picky. I say that I know what it’s like to be in a marriage with someone who might love you but doesn’t like you and it’s worth not settling.

But while I may be single, I am fulfilled and busy. My birthday is Saturday and I’ll be spending it in Paris at a Lady Gaga concert. I saw Sabrina Carpenter in Amsterdam, Taylor Swift in Lyon, Springsteen in Edinburgh, Noah Kahan at Fenway Park. Earlier this year I was able to visit Katmai National Park and see the brown bears in the falls. I have a DnD group and a really amazing village of people I love.

I would not be in this headspace if I didn’t go to therapy and work out the why of me settling for this man in the first place. True story: When planning our honeymoon in New Zealand, I, of course, had to plan the entire thing despite him picking the location. He refused to do any driving, so we had to do a guided tour that left on specific dates. He pretended to not be able to get a day off of work when we needed to leave until I started crying and begging him to just ask his boss for it because literally no other flights worked. That’s when he said he actually always had the day off but wanted to make sure I was actually working hard enough to choose good flights.

Anyway, I chose to marry… that and it was a lot to unpack in therapy.  But I’m glad I did because without it I don’t think I’d have built this life for myself. At the end of the day, what happened set me up to live a happier life than what I was living so in some ways, I’m thankful for the experience, shitty as it was.

If you’re in the middle of something terrible, unfair, and world-shattering to you, just know that it’s not forever. While this experience has made me a bit of a believer in karma, I also know that there was a lot of work to get myself out of that big black mental hole. Sometimes it seemed that I would slide back in it but by looking forward and figuring myself out, I eventually clawed my way out. I think you can too—and that you’re worth fighting for.

TLDR: Got therapy, life is good, ex-husband stalks me on Instagram, and maybe we should all get dogs for our mental health.

ANSWER: I feel like following this story and you having this be your current chapter is the best thing I've heard this year. 

I'm so happy for you! 

Never settle, know your worth. And give the Sir some skritches!

Also, Richmond is a beautiful city. I grew up as a teenager there.



QUESTION: I (22F) just found out my boyfriend (38M) lied about his age for a year—what do I do?

I (22F) recently found out my boyfriend (38M) lied about his age for a year. We met at work, got along, and became official 6 months ago. This is my first relationship, and now I feel completely broken.

He claimed to be 31 years old the first time we met. I was unsure about the age gap, but after seeing how well we connected, I decided to give it a chance.

This morning, we went to do some legal paperwork where I needed his ID. At the office, he kept handing his ID upside down to the staff and refused to let me see it after asking nicely, claiming privacy. By then I had my doubts, though I wasn’t exactly sure what he was hiding.

I finally confronted him saying that I needed to see his ID or I wouldn't be able to trust him anymore. It escalated to, "What are you hiding from me?" He never answered directly. Back home, after much insistence, he gave up and told me the truth:

He lied about his age because he felt bad about being old and wanted to feel younger. He said he knew I wouldn’t accept being with him if I knew his real age, and that he “was planning on telling me” eventually because his guilt was getting hard to manage. He admitted that what he did was wrong, then tried to reassure me that it wasn’t my fault, that I was an excellent girlfriend and person, and that everything we shared was real. I closed the door in his face after telling him I needed to process everything.

This feels like a nightmare. And hurts like shit.

I trusted him, shared my life and my love, and even planned a future together—moving abroad, traveling, building a new life. Now I feel so betrayed, angry, and heartbroken.

I can't believe I was lied to for so long, something so fundamental. I don’t know what to do next. Should I try to salvage this, or just walk away?



Edit: About the “legal paperwork” part, I think I worded it wrong. It’s nothing that really binds me to him in any way. Nothing I can’t undo. He just helped me with some documents that I needed to show for my residence certificate.



TL;DR: My first boyfriend (38M/22F) lied about his age for over a year. I just found out he’s 38, not 31. I feel betrayed and don’t know if I can trust him again.

ANSWER: He wanted you to move out of country before telling you the truth. 

That would terrify any reasonable person.



QUESTION: Bf left after seeing ex's engagement post

Okay so, I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (30M) for a little over two years now. We just moved in together a few months ago. Last night we were doomscrolling on insta reels and his ex's post popped up abt her getting engaged

I don't rly know much about their relationship in detail other than her cheating on my bf with her current fiance while she was engaged to my bf (they were together for 5 yrs and it's been 3.5 yrs since they broke up), so ik that it didn't end well with them and it's just a sour topic so i never rly bring it up. I don’t follow her but she's kind of famous on insta as she is a food vlogger and I watch a lot of that content that's y she popped up.

Anyways when he saw it he like froze and became tense i asked him if everything was ok and he said yeah but i asked if that he looked tense because of the post he just brushed it off and rolled over to go to sleep and then thing is we didn't even rly cuddle when we cuddle like almost every night when going to sleep.

I woke up around 2 a.m. and he was gone. Like, completely gone.  he was nowhere in our house. I called him, like, 10 ,15 times. No answer ,Phone was switched off. I even called one of his friends, and they had no clue where he was. I was thinking of calling his mom but ik she would have blown his phone up so i decided to wait and call my frnd she also suggested to wait a few hours so i did

Then around 3:30 ish  he finally calls me back,i ask him wtf is he doing And he just says I'm fine pls don't call me rn ill explain later and he hangs up b4 i could say anything properly

I tried calling again obviously bcoz what does that even mean like I don't get why he would even be upset about that post seeing they broke up so long ago I can't imagine leaving your gf over this at night. He didn't explicitly say anything abt the reason he went off but I'm pretty sure it's bcoz of the post. I stopped calling him after a few times as hes not going to pick up i rly don't know what to do.

Things have been good with us until now this is the first time i have ever felt like I'm being betrayed by him. I don't even know where he is . Should I leave him alone and give him space I just feel sick abt this situation.

Tldr- bf left in middle of night after finding his ex got engaged and is not responding to me

Update-
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/BBZhLPoYPW

Posting again bcoz previous update post got removed for some reason.


Hey guys,
First of all, thank you to everyone who commented , I didn’t expect so many people to respond, and honestly, reading through your messages kept me from spiraling even more.

I tried to go back to sleep after the post. He did come back around 6 am .he looked like shit cuz ig he hadn't slept. He had just been driving around according to him. I didn't even know what to say to him luckily he was the one who talked first. He apologized a lot of times for running away and for ignoring my calls. I obv asked him wtf happened and why he would ditch me like that and abt his ex. He told me he had a panic attack and he didn't want me to witness it so he went to his car and after that he drove off . He explained that it wasn't bcoz he wasn't over her and that he never wanted her back(i asked him if he was still in love w her). He said it just happened after seeing that pic of them together and happy, he said he depressed after everything went down w his ex but he thought he was fine when he started dating me and that he has been rly happy.

But he panicked bcoz it hit him that she was actually happy and their break up hasn't affected her like it has him seeing she was with the guy she cheated on my bf with and he started overthinking that what if he could never be happy like that when  getting engaged again and getting married to me.

I was honestly a bit shocked at first bcoz we had talked abt how he would love to marry me someday and I didn't rly understand how to comprehend this info but we talked for like 2 hours and he was genuinely sry and he doesn't seem like he's not over her. 

He did say he wants to find that kind of happiness with me and he wants that future with me and he apologized again for being an asshole. I made it clear to him if he ever runs off like that we r done and he agreed and honestly we were both kind of crying by the end of our Convo and i also blocked his ex on my insta (he already had her blocked b4 anyone speculates)

I think i could forgive him. Thank you again for all your help the comments helped a lot. We might try therapy.

Tldr- he came back and we talked abt how he had a panick attack thinking if could be as happy as her and we resolved it out.

ANSWER: i dont understand why people are attacking you in these comments. if i had made it to the stage of moving in with someone and one night they left out of nowhere, id be concerned too, no matter what happened the day before. and while yes he probably just needs time to process the engagement, it wouldve been easy to tell you that. he didnt even have to say it in person or on the phone, he could leave and then send a quick text right after to let you know that he just needed some time alone and that he was alright. you're valid to be upset about this

i understand his distress but it's been 3 and a half years. the least he can do is give you the courtesy of telling you he was leaving to be on his own for a bit instead of letting you wake up alone in the middle of the night and leaving you to panic



QUESTION: UPDATE- Married within a year, and now I’m seeing red flags I ignored before — how do I handle this?(27F/33M)

Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/t08KmdcFxt

Update:

27F/33M

I had a conversation with my husband yesterday and gave him an ultimatum. I brought up therapy again, something I’ve suggested in the past, but he said he can’t do it right now because he’s looking for a job and wants to be financially stable first, which I can understand. However, he also said that even after getting a job, he would only consider therapy, then went on a rant about how therapy is useless.

I told him that if he’s not open to therapy, he could at least speak with a pastor or counselor at our church since that is free. He refused again, saying he has too much on his plate. I even suggested having just one conversation and not committing to anything long-term, but he said he’s tired of me bringing it up.

At this point, I’ve decided to leave. I’m currently looking for a job and hoping things fall into place so I can get my own place soon. I feel scared and heartbroken, but I know it’s necessary. I wish I hadn’t ignored the red flags, but I’m choosing to give myself grace. It’s a terrible feeling, but I know I’ll be okay.

Thank you to everyone who commented on my original post. Your words gave me clarity and courage.

TL;DR: He refused therapy or help, so I’ve decided to leave and start over.

ANSWER: It seemed very clear from the post that he didn't actually want to change, someone who recognised their own insecurities and wanted to change would stop making it yours manage and go to therapy, he's done neither. You've made the right choice.

It sounds like neither of you are currently working, I don't know how you sustained that situation but do you have family or friends you can go stay with so you can leave immediately? Even if that involves moving, it's not like you have a job tying you to your current area - which obviously isn't great financially but freeing in terms of leaving and starting afresh.



QUESTION: My (35f) mil (60f) only wants provide childcare for our daughter(3 months f) not our son (3m) and my wife (33f) and I are not on the same page as how to handle this.

Hi everyone,

My mother-in-law initially offered to help with childcare one day a week and seemed enthusiastic. However, after our daughter was born, she made it clear she only wants to care for her. She claims it’s “fair” because she didn’t help with our son when he was a baby and my mother did. 

For context, we did offer before our son was born and my mother offered, but when we asked, my mil reacted like a deer in headlights, so we dropped it. We’ve had multiple discussions since, explaining that we don’t agree with her only wanting one child, and she seemed to understand—but a week later, she goes back to only wanting to care for our daughter and pretending we agreed to that. 

We’re unsure why this is happening. It might be because we’re a lesbian couple and she only wants to bond with the child she is biologically related to, or maybe she wasn’t ready before but is now. Either way, she has said multiple times that she doesn’t want to take care of our son. She has said this in front of our son. 

I feel like the weekly childcare arrangement is off because I don’t trust her to care for both children equally. My wife feels that we haven’t explicitly said she must take both children or none, and that we should give her a chance. 

This argument is devolving in my wife saying I'm trying to isolate her from her parents and I'm treating her like she is a bad person. I just want to protect our kids. I don't know what to do anymore. Should I truly offer her another chance?

tl;dr my wife and I heavily disagree how we should handle my mil wanting to play favourites with childcare

ANSWER: Why do I feel like because your wife gave birth to your daughter and you gave birth to your son, your MIL thinks daughter is her grandchild while son is NOT? 

Have you ever asked your wife, what would she tell your son when he asks “Why Grammy never let me stay” or “Why Grammy doesn’t like me” or “Why Grammy always prioritize little sister”? 

This is something you should clear with your wife first, because she is enabling her mom’s favoritism and her way of not counting your son as family. What if she escalates? What if she tries to exclude your son in family activities? What if resentment builds between your children due to Grammy?



QUESTION: My boyfriend (33M) keeps saying “Have fun on your date” whenever I (32F) leave the house — how do I get him to stop?

Almost every time I leave the house, my boyfriend says something like “Have fun on your date.” Sometimes he’ll even text it to me after I’ve gone.

There’s absolutely no reason for him to think I’d be seeing anyone else. Nothing’s ever happened that would make him suspicious — he just says these things out of nowhere. I find it really disrespectful and gross. I’ve never cheated, never given him a reason to doubt me, and I don’t even have anyone else in my life I could “go on a date” with.

We’ve lived together almost the entire year we’ve been dating. He didn’t used to say things like this, but now he’s constantly making passive-aggressive comments if I’m on my phone, like:

“If you want to talk to someone else, just do it.”
“You don’t have to hide that you’re talking to another guy.”

I’ve told him many times how offensive and damaging these comments are, but he doesn’t care — he seems to truly believe that what he is doing is somehow harmless.   I feel my respect for him slipping every time he does it. I’m honestly at the point where, if we didn’t live together, I’d already have broken up with him. Unfortunately, it is not going to be easy to separate from him at this point or for awhile due to financial reasons.

How should I handle this behavior when he refuses to take it seriously?

Also, how can I articulate the reason why this feels so gross ? I am struggling to find the words. 

⸻

TL;DR:
My boyfriend keeps making sarcastic comments like “Have fun on your date” whenever I leave the house, even though I’ve never given him any reason to distrust me. I’ve told him it’s disrespectful, but he doesn’t stop. What should I do?

ANSWER: “If we didn’t live together I’d already have broken up with him”

You answered your own question about what to do next. It just requires the additional step of also moving out.



QUESTION: My mom found out about my private life and says she’ll never forgive me. I don’t know what to do.

I (27F) come from a conservative religious background.  I live abroad now, but recently something happened that completely broke my relationship with my mom (55F).

I gave her my old phone because hers stopped working. Before giving it away, I deleted WhatsApp, thinking all my private conversations were gone. Unfortunately, when she reinstalled it, all my old chats were restored — including some very personal messages and “flirty” conversations.

When she saw them, she was devastated and furious. She said I had brought shame, that I was no longer her daughter, and that she regretted giving birth to me. She blocked me, then unblocked me just to say hurtful things like calling me names. She even told me not to tell my relatives that we don't talk anymore, or she'd show them everything so they'd know the truth about me. 

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. She had warned me that if it happened again, she would cut me off — and this time, she did.

I feel destroyed inside. I keep blaming myself, but at the same time, I feel like her reaction is too extreme. I know what I did isn’t acceptable in her eyes, but it hurts to lose my mom like this.
I’m far from home, I feel ashamed and empty, and I don’t know how to move forward.

Has anyone else gone through something like this — especially in a strict religious family? How did you cope with losing your parent emotionally, even if they’re still alive?

EDIT : For context, these messages were related to my active sexual life, so she's hurting for knowing that I'm sexually active.

TL;DR: My mom (55F) found out about parts of my private life that go against our religious background, feels deeply betrayed, and refuses to forgive me. I (27F) love her but don’t know if I should try to contact her again or let her go.

ANSWER: >I keep blaming myself,

The worst choice here is to blame yourself for living your own life. 

Your mom is hateful and willing to drop her own daughter because she sent flirty messages. Someone willing to do that is a shameful, awful person.

To move forward, you have to understand exactly this, that your mother is not a good person and that you may be better off without her, even though it hurts now.



QUESTION: My, 40F, husband, 45M,been living with my dad for work. I think he’s cheating.

I, 40F, have been with my husband Brian (fake name), 45M, for almost two decades. We have four kids. A few years ago, we moved from our hometown, a major city, to a smaller, quiet town about three hours away in another state. At the time, we only had our two oldest children, and childcare wasn’t an issue.

Brian was able to find employment fairly quickly when we moved, and I worked from home full-time, which gave me the opportunity to care for our kids, the home, and our marriage. Things were great until I became pregnant with our now third child and developed some health issues.

Because Brian had to call out frequently due to my hospitalizations during the pregnancy, he was eventually forced to resign from his job due to attendance and performance. During delivery, there was an accident and my baby and I almost didn’t survive. The baby was in the NICU for months recovering. She is now a happy and mostly healthy baby. After she came home, Brian worked odd jobs to bring in money, but his primary concern was making sure the kids and I were okay.

A few days before our youngest turned 1, we found out that we were having our fourth and last child. That pregnancy was tough as well, but things went relatively okay until delivery. During the delivery, I was injured by my surgeon, which prevented me from caring for my newborn and our other kids. I was on bed rest for a few months recovering from the C-section and the injury.

Brian waited on me hand and foot and worked reduced hours. We lived off savings and my disability checks from my employer. My father also sent money to help us out. Once I recovered, I returned to work full-time, but Brian wasn’t able to find steady employment. We made things work for a while, but unexpected expenses in the home and with our taxes drove up our costs.

Eventually, Brian found a full-time job back in our home city; great pay, benefits, and room for overtime. My father offered to let him live with him so he wouldn’t have to commute six hours a day or pay any bills while there. Brian was hesitant to leave because I’d still been dealing with health issues since our last child, but I assured him I’d be fine.

At first, things were great. When he moved in with my dad, Brian would call and text frequently; during his breaks, lunches, and in the evenings. We’d video chat for hours while he talked to me and the kids. On Fridays, he’d come home and visit until early Monday mornings. I’d drive him to work with our two youngest kids, then drive back home. Sometimes, the kids and I would go up Friday afternoon to visit him and my dad and drive back Sunday so he wouldn’t be burnt out.

But then the calls started to slow down. I figured he was busy or tired. One night, because we share locations, I checked the app around 10 p.m. and saw he was at a bar. I texted him, asking what was up. He responded around 3 a.m., saying he’d gone out with friends after work. I felt uncomfortable but told myself not to be insecure. I told myself that Brian deserved to unwind after everything he’d done for me and the kids.

The late nights at bars and restaurants continued for a few weeks. The money in our joint account started depleting from his outings to the point where I had to remind him we needed the money for bills. He stopped coming home on weekends, and when I visited, he seemed distant and glued to his phone.

I asked if everything was okay with him and with us. He said it was. I asked about his new friends, but his answers were vague.

One weekend at my dad’s house, Brian was in another room when his phone rang. The name “V” popped up with no picture. I’d never heard that name before. A few minutes later, my dad’s phone rang. I heard him briefly say something to the person on the phone, then tell Brian to “check his phone when he gets a chance.” Brian picked it up, sent a text, looked at me, and set the phone down face-first. I asked who it was. He just said, “A friend.”

My insecurities got the best of me, so I looked through Brian’s Facebook. He doesn’t post much, but suddenly, all his profile pictures had new “likes” from someone who had me blocked. Using my old unused account (under my maiden name), I found that person. It was a woman named Vanessa, 33F.

On her public page, I saw photos of her and Brian at bars, restaurants, and, heartbreakingly, in my father’s living room and building lobby. In every photo, Vanessa was hugged up on Brian or wrapped around his arm. His wedding ring was off. She tagged him in the photos, but the tags didn’t appear on his profile.

I was devastated. Instead of confronting him right away, I packed up the kids and went home. Brian didn’t protest and seemed clueless. My dad asked if I was okay; I said I didn’t feel well and wanted to leave. Brian quietly helped me pack.

I took screenshots of everything. That was three weeks ago.

Since then, I haven’t talked to Brian much. When he calls, I hand the phone to whichever kid is closest, even the one-year-old. I’ve focused on work and the kids, but I keep checking Vanessa’s page and taking more screenshots as she posts more pictures.

Last night, Brian texted asking why I’d been distant. Furious, I sent him all the screenshots. For about ten minutes, I saw the typing bubble appear and disappear. Then he finally replied: “She’s just a coworker.”

I asked him how he’d feel if I were constantly out with a coworker, hugged up in photos. No reply. I asked why he brought this coworker to my father’s house. He said, “Just to introduce them.” I asked why he hadn’t introduced any other coworkers. Silence.

It’s been about nine hours and I haven’t heard from him since. I’m heartbroken. I don’t want to be a divorced single mom, but I refuse to live in with this kind of disrespect.

Advice needed: What should my next steps be?

TL;DR:
My husband (45M) and I (40F) have been together nearly 20 years and have 4 kids. He took a good job back in our hometown and moved in with my dad to avoid a long commute. At first he called and visited often, but then he got distant, started going out drinking, and stopped coming home. I found Facebook photos of him with a younger woman (33F) out at bars, restaurants, and even at my dad’s house, with his wedding ring off. When I confronted him, he said she’s “just a coworker” and hasn’t spoken to me since. I’m heartbroken and unsure what to do next.

ANSWER: Idk what’s worse about this story. Everything he’s doing or the fact that not only did the dad cover for him the whole time, he is also communicating with this woman on behalf of your husband, and right in front of you.  Im sorry, that’s fucked up and I hope you find your way through it. You should not let yourself be treated like that no matter if it makes you a single divorced person.



QUESTION: Found my partner’s old divorce case online — don’t know what to believe now






I (27F) have been seeing a man (35M) for about four months. He’s divorced and has a young daughter. He told me that his marriage ended because of his ex’s accusations and that she was a narcissist.

I just found their divorce case online. It matches what he told me but with details that shocked me: ICU stay, which I knew about, but it mentions seizure from alcohol use, bottles hidden around the house, and his ex claiming he wasn’t safe around their kid.

He told me those things were exaggerated and that the judge ruled in his favor for 50/50 custody, which is true. But now I’m stuck between believing that he’s genuinely recovering and worrying that he still drinks or minimizes it. We smoke weed together sometimes, and he seems totally functional—steady job, great dad, responsible—but I can’t shake the fear that I’m missing something.

I don’t want to judge him unfairly, but I also don’t want to ignore red flags. What’s a fair, healthy way to ask about this without sounding accusatory or controlling?

Tl;dr: found the court case for the guy I'm dating. It mentions that he's an alcoholic to a dangerous level. He's told me that his ex accused him of different things to get full custody, but I'm now concerned.

ANSWER: I say trust your gut. Like, easy as that, trust your gut, girl. Think about it since you’re having to ask reddit.

I once met a guy who seemed okay, but then he got kinda stalkerish and I tried to brush it off because he was very good friends with my friend group. It wasn’t getting better and I looked him up; turns out he was on probation and parole for breaking a girl’s jaw after she broke up with him (and breaking that no contact order). That was shocking, but the biggest shock was that my other friends knew not only how uncomfortable he made me, but they knew about that incident and never told me. Stopped all contact with all of them immediately and called his parole officer.



QUESTION: My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) live together: I found out how he sees the world, now I don’t know if I should stay.

(Re-upload with edits: my previous post was removed for formatting.)

My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been together for two years. I live at his house and don’t pay rent (it’s one of his parents’ properties).

Over the last six months our relationship has been slowly deteriorating. I’ve had multiple conversations with him about how his communication style hurts me and others, and how little effort he puts into understanding me.

A few examples:
1 Once, I mentioned seeing a male friend and he spent the dinner spiraling into topics like calling himself (grandparents immigrated from Italy to Aus) as “ethnic” as my Asian/Middle Eastern best friend, saying “no one should be friends with Germans, we’ve moved on too fast from the Holocaust,” and “old people don’t deserve respect.” It was bizarre and uncomfortable.

2 When we need to solve small domestic issues (like fixing a drain), he often derails the conversation into his own feelings rather than focusing on the task, getting visibly upset at me.

3 When I’m overwhelmed and trying to self-regulate by being quiet or still, he panics and asks what he did wrong, which forces me to comfort him instead of calming myself.

4 I’m autistic, and my tone can be flat. He often misreads it as hostility, especially around practical or “adult” topics.

5 The other night, he made fun of the way I walked and looked, even doing a hurtful impression. I said “that’s not a nice thing to do to your girlfriend,” and he exploded into, “what about thank you for cooking dinner? Why is it never thank you?”

The breaking point came this week when we took our puppy to be de-sexed. I filled out the vet consent form while he watched. Because I’d be at work during the procedure, I made sure the clinic knew to call him first. I signed my own name at the bottom (as the form requires) and added his details below. Later that day, I discovered a private ChatGPT thread where he described the whole event with anger and resentment, accusing me of being controlling and writing my phone number in its required section (above his) to “belittle” him. Reading that was shattering. It showed me how warped his perception of me has become.

That’s been our pattern: I act from practicality or care, he interprets it as attack or disrespect.

I wouldn’t call our relationship abusive. Most days are neutral, some are lovely, and about 10–20% of the time things get really painful. He’s affectionate and loving, and I truly love him and the life we’ve built: our home, our routines, our puppy. But when anything serious happens, he becomes reactive, defensive, or mean, and I end up feeling small and unseen.

Logistically, leaving is hard. I work part-time (four days a week) and study at university. If I rent, I’ll have around $400 a week to live on. That means shared custody of the dog, major financial stress, and losing the most comfortable home I’ve ever had. But staying means continuing to feel unheard and distorted.

My question: How do I decide whether to stay or leave when the relationship isn’t entirely bad but feels fundamentally incompatible? What concrete steps can I take to make the right decision?

TL;DR: My boyfriend believes I am antagonising him when I’m taking care of logistics or myself. He’s great most of the time and I love the life we share beyond these issues, but I’m worried I’ll never see him the same. I’d appreciate advice on how to move forward and protect my peace.

ANSWER: Your boyfriend is mentally unwell OP.  Take the dog and find a place of your own. There are reg flags all over the place with your BF.



QUESTION: Husband recycled a proposal from the previous relationship.

tl;dr husband proposed in the same exact way, word for word, location etc as he did with his previous relationship. How do I get over this? 


I '33F' just found out that my husband '35M' of 7 years, proposed to me in the same exact way as he proposed to his ex wife. 
Same day, Xmas eve, same exact location and used the same shpiel. Thankfully he didn't use the same damn ring too..... 


It's not a situation where he wasn't over the ex. I truly think it's just pure lack of originality or imagination. 
Idk if I'm being dramatic but I am hurt and sick over this. I've cried non stop. Can't look at him or even talk to him. I gave him the ring back and told him to do it over and make it special. I wanted my own. But honestly, if he does, idk if that would make me feel better. How do I move passed this? 
This isn't something I would leave him over but it is something that has definitely hurt our relationship. 
Any suggestions on how to work through this?

ANSWER: He lacks originality.  I found out my husband took his second wife on a honeymoon on the same vacation that was the only out of the region vacation the two of us ever went to.  While he was having an affair with her, he was introducing him to the same restaurants I had introduced him to in this city, and my favorite restaurant became "their place."  I would not really move past that myself, to be honest with you.  In fact, he's married to his third wife, and they own a hobby shop based on the only hobby I ever had when married to him, a hobby he used to make fun of me doing.



QUESTION: How do I tell my husband I’m uncomfortable with him staying with a female colleague on work trips?

I was going to post this on AITAH but since I’m 95% sure I’m not the asshole, I guess I’m looking for relationship advice instead. Soooo… would I be the asshole if I \[38f\] told my husband \[40m\] I don’t want him to stay with a colleague \[45F, single\] when they travel together for work?

My husband and Colleague are part of a dozen independently contracted people within a professional creative group, which manages projects with clients. Husband and Colleague find their work to be complimentary, so they’re hoping to work on more projects together. Husband and I live in City A, we’re from City B (where both sets of parents live), and City C is where Professional Group and Colleague are based.

Last time Husband was working in City C he stayed on Colleague’s couch. Fine, whatever, not a big deal for a one-off thing. Then he had a job in City B last week that she worked with him on, and they stayed at his parents house together Tues-Saturday. To clarify: City B is my hometown, where my family also lives. I didn’t know about this until he was on the way out the door Tuesday. If he had mentioned it I probably would have said “oh, wouldn’t everyone be more comfortable if she was put up in a hotel?” Granted, budget was a consideration, but my feeling is that if the group, client, or husband can’t afford an assistant on a project, then it can’t be a requisite for the job. And this isn’t a one time scenario, he plans to keep working with her, so this will definitely come up again in some iteration.

Relationship background: Husband and I have been together for 4 years, married for 6 months. We were actually together for a while 15 years ago but our paths diverged. In a crazy full circle way we were brought back together and I’m happier than I’ve ever been in a partnership. Our relationship is based on mutual respect and admiration, and he is extremely loyal when it comes to friends, family, and me. I want to make it clear that I trust him 100%. This isn’t about infidelity, it’s about boundaries and respect and how he shows that he cares about my feelings.

All week I’ve been dealing with icks and ughs about this. It’s been occupying a huge portion of my thoughts. I was by myself while they were working together every day, sharing meals, presumably hanging out until bedtime? And then of course there are my irrational, neurotic thoughts like “did he make coffee for her every morning? Did she use my MIL’s shampoo? Does he think she’s cooler than me? Is he going to run off to City C because it’s way more rewarding than our life together??” I hate that I’m this insecure and jealous and prone to ruminating on this stuff. Yes, I have a therapist, yes, we talk about this sort of thing.  It might be different if I had met Colleague or knew ANY details about her at all. All I know about her is that they have a lot in common and she’s apparently comfortable with this level of familiarity with a married colleague.

I’m already prepared for how it will go if I bring this up. His reaction at best is going to be invalidating my feelings in the guise of reassurance (“you’re being silly! That’s ridiculous, what are you worried about?”) or defensive (“why are you admonishing me when I’ve done nothing wrong?”) He bristles when it comes to personal critique, which makes it hard to express my feelings sometimes. He’s not one to conform to the conventions of society, so me saying “this is objectively inappropriate” or “this simply isn’t done” would not be useful arguments. He usually means well, but can be really blind to how his actions affect me. I’m really hoping that me saying I’m uncomfortable is enough for him to agree to the very reasonable request of getting Colleague a damn hotel room next time.

Ok, so here’s a part I was on the fence about adding in, because all of the above is enough for being upset, but it’s important in the context of my emotional needs not being prioritized (and it definitely adds to my sensitive emotional state). My mom died 3 months ago, so I drove up to City B on Friday to prep for my mom’s Sunday memorial celebration. I thought Husband was going to join me at my parent’s house across town Friday night, but I guess there was a miscommunication and he had to do a bit more work on this project Saturday. We talked about this on the phone Thursday and he told me he was probably going to stay with his parents Saturday night too, so Colleague wouldn’t be uncomfortable at the house without him there. I basically told him no, I needed him with me. I honestly can’t even believe he entertained the idea of prioritizing her comfort over my need for his support during a huge emotional life event. A few days before the memorial.

I love this person. I trust him, but I’m frustrated and sad. Why is he such a dummy when it comes to all this shit?? The big work job is done, and we got through the memorial. Now I guess I’m looking for some communication advice, some validation, and maybe personal experience. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this.



tl;dr: Husband is overfamiliar with a female colleague. He doesn’t think it’s a problem, but the real issue is that he's oblivious to how this makes me feel. I’m not sure how to raise it without him getting defensive.

ANSWER: Okay so this

> Our relationship is based on mutual respect and admiration, and he is extremely loyal when it comes to friends, family, and me. I want to make it clear that I trust him 100%. This isn’t about infidelity, it’s about boundaries and respect and how he shows that he cares about my feelings.

Does not jive with this

I’m already prepared for how it will go if I bring this up. His reaction at best is going to be invalidating my feelings in the guise of reassurance (“you’re being silly! That’s ridiculous, what are you worried about?”) or defensive (“why are you admonishing me when I’ve done nothing wrong?”)

There’s some cognitive dissonance going on here and tbh I think this perfect marriage full of admiration and respect is a story you’re telling yourself. Because I’m not seeing much respect coming from his side. And I think you’re being naive to say there’s definitely no infidelity going on. He’s having this woman stay at his parents’ house, that’s so far beyond the boundaries of a work relationship it borders on hilarity. 

And now he’s trying to abandon you in your time of need to make her more comfortable? At best this is an emotional affair. At worst it’s already turned physical.



QUESTION: My bf (M23) stood me (F22) up on Halloween and doesn’t know why

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years, and he’s always been amazing, but on Halloween, he stood me up and can't explain why. I want to forgive him, but I am still so upset.

We both had different events to go to first, but we agreed that we’d meet up later at a club, which is something we had discussed all week. I knew he was with friends, so I told him he could invite them, but that regardless of what his friends where doing we were going to go out. I texted around 9 PM that I was ready, and he replied saying he was picking up his friends and would meet me at the club. I told him it was a 20-minute walk for me, so he should let me know when he was heading out.

I didn’t hear back from him until 11:40 PM when he texted saying he was finally on his way. By then, I would’ve gotten there around midnight, and I wasn’t comfortable walking through downtown that late. Plus, he and his friends ended up not even going in because the lines were too long. So, basically, I spent hours doing intricate makeup and dressing up all so that I could be stood up by my own bf.

What made it even worse was that the next day was Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead/ celebrate the dead), which was really important to me as I’m Latina, and I just lost my grandpa. My boyfriend was supposed to help me set up my grandpa’s shrine and make food, but he completely forgot.

He came over with gifts to apologize, but his only explanation was, “I’m sorry, I don’t know what happened.” When I asked if he thought it was okay for a woman to walk alone downtown that late, he lied and said he would’ve gotten me an Uber, but nowhere in his messages did he mention that. He also tried to play it off as “miscommunication,” when it was really just a lack of communication on his part. I told him I needed space and sent him home.

Later, when he apologized again, he kept saying that thinking about what he did makes him upset and sick. Normally I appreciate when he expresses his feelings, but I told him that in this case, I truly didn’t care how he felt because I was the one who was wronged and upset. I don’t know if that was too harsh, but I genuinely don’t understand how him being nauseous was supposed to help me feel any better.

The next day, after some pushing, he said he’s been emotionally checked out because of how stressful his doctorate program has been and that he forgets things easily when they’re not “in front of him.” I don’t really know what to make of that.

He’s always been supportive and kind before this, especially when my grandpa passed. I don’t think he’s cheating, which I know is always possible, but cheating is one of his biggest fears, so I doubt this is the case. This whole situation isn’t typical for him, but his explanation feels weak, and I’m not sure how to move forward. I want to forgive him, but I also feel really hurt and disappointed.

How would you handle something like this? Should I try to talk to him again, or just give him more space?

ANSWER: He was out enjoying himself with his friends and totally ‘forgot’ he was supposed to be meeting up with you. He doesn’t want to admit that, so his ‘I don’t know what happened’ isn’t true, and is flimsy at best. And the fact he thought it would be okay for you to walk to a club at that time is absolutely ridiculous plus, and I’m just guessing, he was too hungover to help you the following day when you really needed his support. All in all, he hasn’t exactly covered himself in boyfriend glory, has he? Updateme!



QUESTION: I want to divorce my husband. But he wants another chance. Am I being heartless?

Hi reddit. Like the title says, I (f31) want to divorce my husband (m32), but i'm afraid I may be acting too quickly? For context, we've been together for 12 years, married for 3. He's always had a strong temper and frankly, my parents never fully approved of our relationship because of it. I'm the complete opposite, shy, eternally optomistic, a little too nice (husband says I'm a pushover). Anyway, while we dated he would often be rude to me but his excuse was that he was stressed out from college or he was tired, or he had something else going on. And I believed him. 

Fast forward to our first year of marriage, and I found out the hard way that it wasn't college or any of that. It was just his actual personality. He hates talking about, well, anything. We never talk about money which is outrageous to me because we're married, I can't talk to him about family drama because it annoys him, can't talk about my feelings because he'll get mad, insult me and walk away. He's not only rude to me now but to my parents too. Despite the fact that they've given us a house, a piece of land, helped us get out of a debt, etc. And I could not be more embarassed.

Mostly, I feel stupid. My parents warned me again and again. My dad especially, because he noticed early on how different we were. But my husband always said opposites attract (sounds kind of stupid now). And he wasn't as mean then as he is now, in fact, he got along great with my parents back then. He even got them gifts and things. Now, he's moody all the time but even moreso when we go over to their house. He won't even engage in conversation, all he does is look down at him phone the entire time. It honestly feels like he doesn't care about being part of the family. Whenever someone tries to give him adive, he doesn't take it well, like he's smarter than everyone else and there's nothing you can say to him that he doesn't already know. The few times we do talk, we end up arguing because everything I say is always wrong and "i don't know what I'm talking about" or "I'm ignorant". Mind you, we both have college degrees. All in all, I'm just so disapointed and embarrased by the kind of person he is. Btw, he's not like that around his friends. 

I brought up the possibility of getting a divorce during an argument and he's been nicer to me ever since. But I've seen this side of him before. He's promised to change in the past and has said that he can't live without me. This is the only time I've truly seen him so remorseful though. 

TD;LR: Am I being too rash in suggesting to my husband that we divorce because of how he treats me? Should I give him another chance?

ANSWER: No, you're not being too rash to divorce someone who is not nice to you or your family and has never been, who insults you and who you can't communicate with. In fact, I have no idea why you've stayed with him this long.



QUESTION: How can I (21M) make my Chinese dad (61M) get a life?

The title might sound a bit harsh, but I honestly don’t know how else to phrase it.

There’s a lot to unpack here, but here I go (TL;DR at the bottom):

My dad is a Chinese immigrant who moved to California in the early 2000s. To this day, he hasn’t learned much English, which has really limited his ability to explore new things — even simple stuff like trying non-Chinese restaurants. Over time, that’s made him more closed off and unwilling to try anything new.

He’s naturally introverted, and with his difficult personality and years of working tirelessly since coming here, he’s struggled to make friends. As a result, he doesn’t have many hobbies or much of a social life.

Now that he finally has more free time, I’ve been trying to get him to enjoy life a bit more — to go out, meet people, or pick up a hobby. But whenever I suggest something, he just says things like “There’s nothing to do here in America” or “Nothing interests me.” I know those are excuses — I think it’s hard for him because he can’t read or speak English, so everything outside his comfort zone feels impossible. Still, it’s tough watching him just… fade into routine.

I’d love to know if anyone has gone through something similar or has advice on how to help a parent like this.

Some background that might be helpful:  
My dad doesn’t have the best relationship with our family (my mom, sister, and me). He wasn’t really a great husband or father figure when I was growing up. He and my mom fought a lot, mostly because he’d spend so much time at the casino playing poker — which he insists “isn’t gambling” because it “takes skill” and “helps him relieve stress.” But back then, we were struggling financially, living in affordable housing, so it only made things worse.

He also had a lot of anger issues and poor communication skills. He couldn’t empathize or see things from my mom’s point of view, which led to constant fighting. My sister ended up developing lasting trauma from it, and I’ve always had a hard time talking to him too.

That said, something changed earlier this year. We visited some old family friends — people who somehow have stuck by him despite knowing his flaws — and they had yet another intervention with him. This time, it seemed to click. Around the same time, I broke down in front of him and told him how all of this affected me. I think that really got through to him, because since then, he’s been trying to change, little by little.

Honestly, I’m still conflicted. Writing this all out makes me realize how complicated it is. My dad isn’t the best person, but he’s still my dad — and I know he did what he could with what he had. I just want to help him find a way to live more meaningfully instead of wasting away.

TL;DR:  
My dad isn’t perfect, but he’s still my dad. He doesn’t have many friends or hobbies, and I want to help him find some so he can live a fuller, happier life. Any advice or similar experiences would really mean a lot.

ANSWER: Your best bet is probably to find out where other senior Chinese guys hang out and take him there. He'll be able to communicate and feel a lot more comfortable. Maybe he'll make friends.



QUESTION: M55 How direct can you be to ask relatives to invite you for the holidays?

I (M55) am suddenly without immediate family: no spouse, no kids and nobody at home with me.

I am dreading the holidays.

I have (1) an aunt, uncle and cousins in one city a few hours away and (2) a brother and his family in another city a few hours away.

I’ve usually just waited for invitations and if they didn’t come, I’d spend holidays with immediate family at my home, but immediate family is now gone.  

My sister-in-law has said “we’ve got to get you to come out sometime” and I said, “sure!”, but I don’t know if that was just a general statement or if it was supposed to be an invitation.  My aunt said, “we need to stay in touch” but it would be kind of weird to invite myself to their house.

How do I get an invitation for Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas dinner?

That’s all I need; I can stay in a hotel.

TL;DR: how direct can you be in asking family members for an invitation for the holidays if you’re all alone?

ANSWER: My brother reached out for a thanksgiving one year, he hadn’t been to family events in years. He just said “hey sis, I really wanted to spend the holiday with family, do you have anything going on that I could come to?” damn near broke my fucking heart that I didn’t make it clear enough to him that he’s ALWAYS invited, I didn’t ever think I needed to invite him to these things.

I’m really glad he asked, because now I always invite him.



QUESTION: My (23F) BF (23M) said he’d consider breaking up with me if I changed my appearance and now I can’t look at him the same.

TL;DR:
My BF hates all forms of body modification and has made it clear he doesn’t like when I change my appearance. When I mentioned tattooing over a fading mole, he sternly told me not to “Do that to my face.” When I asked if he’d break up with me over something a bodily change I made he didn’t like, he said yes. He apologized afterward, but I can’t shake how disrespected I feel or how hard it is to be affectionate again.

I (23F) have been dating my BF (23M) “Andre” for a little over 2 years. It’s both our first relationship. Andre has always hated any kind of bodily change: tattoos, piercings, dye, even getting a hand stamp at the bar. He scrubs it off the second we get home.

I’m the opposite. I love tattoos (I have 3), I’ve dyed my hair ginger (naturally blonde), and I have a few piercings. Since we started dating, though, I’ve only added one ear piercing and changed my hair tint slightly. Whenever I bring up wanting something new (like tattoos or piercings), he gets visibly uncomfortable. His voice goes high, eyebrows raise, and he starts asking, “How much of a change are you thinking?”

His facial expressions alone have always felt like a subtle threat to our relationship. if I go too far, he’ll stop being attracted to me or even consider leaving. That’s honestly a big part of why I’ve stopped changing my appearance at all.

Earlier this week, I mentioned that a small mole on my nose is starting to lose pigment, and I brought up maybe tattooing over it with brown ink kind of like a freckle tattoo or microblading. His response was instant and firm: “Do not do that to your face.”
That hit me hard. He didn’t even ask why I wanted to do it or how I felt about it just completely shut it down and told me what to do.

Later that night, I texted him and asked, “If I did something to my appearance that you didn’t like, would you break up with me?”
His reply: “Yes, I could see it playing a factor.”
My stomach dropped. I called two of my friends to make sure I wasn’t losing my mind and they both said that was insane. I ignored him for a bit, and when he called back, I ended up yelling at him for almost an hour (which is unlike me). That’s when it seemed to finally hit him how serious this was. He started crying, apologized, and admitted he was being inconsiderate and disrespectful. The next night, he told me he realized how entitled it was to act like he has any say over my body, and that he needs to work on his reactions. He said he understands I’m my own person and that my choices have nothing to do with him.
I told him straight up that he needs to always speak to me like an equal, and that just because he gets to see my body doesn’t mean he gets to control it. I made it very clear if he ever does this again, I’m gone.

I also told him I’m not applying to jobs in his area anymore. Someone who would consider breaking up with me over a freckle doesn’t deserve me moving states for them.
We’re still together, but now I feel… icked out. I don’t want to be affectionate or sweet toward him. even though he’s apologized and seems to be reflecting. I feel like he doesn’t deserve that from me right now, but I also feel mean with giving him nothing to work with.

How do I forgive him? Will that natural affection come back with time? Is it harder because we live far apart? I get forgive but don’t forget, but how?

ANSWER: Relationship aside, please be careful about tattooing over your mole. You want to be able to monitor moles for changes and tattooing over it could get in the way of that.



QUESTION: How do I (26F) break up with my fiancé (28M) of 7 yrs without destroying him? The timing feels cruel.

See my last post about why…

TL;DR:
I love my fiancé but know the relationship needs to end. He lives with me in my family’s home, is struggling in school, and has a birthday/holidays coming up. Ending things now feels cruel, but pretending until the end of the year also feels wrong. How do I break up in a way that causes the least damage?

I (late 20s F) am at the point where I know I need to end things with my fiancé (late 20s M). I love him, but after reading the feedback on my last post and really sitting with the things I didn’t want to admit, I know I can’t continue this relationship.

The problem is… the timing feels awful.

He currently lives with me in my old family home. It’s not technically either of our places—my parents don’t live here, but two of my adult sisters do. Asking him to leave feels like kicking him out to nowhere, even though he does have family he could go to. I just know it’ll shake his sense of stability.

He’s also really struggling in school. I don’t want to pile this on while he’s barely hanging on academically. College is rough, I’ve been there and completely understand. I’ve told him multiple times that I’m unhappy, but I know this will still blindside him.

Part of me wants to end things now because living like this—acting like I’m not completely torn—feels emotionally draining and dishonest. But the other part of me wants to wait until the semester is over… except then it’s his birthday in mid-December, and then Christmas. It feels cruel no matter what.

I’m torn between doing what’s healthiest for me vs. trying to protect him from more stress.
Do I need to end it now, or should I let him have the end of the year without adding this pain?
Any advice on how to do this in the least damaging way is appreciated. Honestly I’m not sure if I’m mentally prepared for it now - please give me your honest advice I’ve never had to break up like this before

ANSWER: The only reason to delay ANYTHING about this would be to give him a chance to get his bearings and find a better living situation.

Which would sorta mean breaking up with him and then giving him a week or two or more to sort of figure out his next living situation.

There's no point in delaying through Christmas just to wait until the ball drops on New Year to shout "Surprise, we're breaking up! Pack your shit!"

Also... you need to brace yourself for being the "bad guy" here. There is only so much you can do here to soften this landing. You are about to wreck this dude's whooole existence. The odds of getting a handshake and a thanks for the memories card is... low.



QUESTION: My gf (F23) is trying to move in with me (M31) way too soon

I (M31) started dating his new person (F23) back in July. Things were going great and we decided to make our relationship official after a vacation a few weeks ago.

The problem happened as soon as we got back from vacation. She lives with her mom and apparently when she got back home, she got into this big fight with her mom's bum ass boyfriend. Now she refuses to go back home until homeboy moves out. I'm trying to be a good boyfriend and let her stay with me for a while, but "a while" is starting to feel permanent. Her mom's boyfriend doesnt even have a job and theres no sign of him moving out any time soon. It doesn't help that my apartment is tiny and I hate not having space to myself.

A couple days ago she asked me if we could get a place together when my lease ends in February, and since she's already living with me, that would mean she permanently moved in 2 days after becoming my girlfriend. Thats way too fast for me and tbh it feels like shes taking advantage of my kindness and resources. I genuinely don't know what to do because I don't want to kick her out with no place to go but I also don't feel comfortable with her moving in on such short notice. How can we resolve this problem?

TL;DR girlfriend of 2 days is trying to live in my tiny apartment now

ANSWER: Well, first of all, if you date a woman eight years younger than you she’s gonna be in a different place in life and have different expectations. That should be a no-brainer. You want a grownup, date a grownup.

That said, you’re going to have to have a conversation with her and however you put it, she will feel rejected and upset. Just be prepared to remain calm and kind. Explain that you’re not ready to live with someone. That you need her to have a plan for her living arrangements that isn’t just live with you.



QUESTION: Update: How do I (27 M) get my gf (24 F) to understand that I can’t do it all on my own. Is this the end?

My last post on this [(can be found here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ok0qa9/how_do_i_27_m_get_my_gf_24_f_to_understand_that_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) got a lot of responses so I wanted to give a recent update.

A couple days after that post, on November 1st my family had a Halloween party. We attended as we have been staying with my parents. It was fun, it was going good. I allowed myself to just relax, had a few drinks which I don’t often. I “let loose”. This all came crumbling down though when my gf made a comment/joke about getting married. She asked “Do you want to marry me?” I said “Yes!” She asked “so when are we getting married?” I said “When we get married!” she responded “So you don’t want to marry me” I responded “That’s not what I’m saying” and then it got quiet. Now mind you, this was a few hours into the party, after we had a good bit to drink. So it wasn’t really the time or place to have a serious conversation about our future marriage.

Later we are in our room, to escape the party for a bit. She says sorry. I tell her thank you. She says something about how it was just joke. I tell her that the joke isn’t really funny given we’ve had all of these conversations regarding issues we’ve been having, how before we even really think about getting married I’d like for us to be out of my parents house again. She says she wishes joking about marriage wasn’t a stressor. I said that it isn’t just about the marriage, it’s about the accusation that I don’t want to. When I’ve been trying so hard to get us to a point where we have our own place, where I can afford a ring, where we have finances to plan a wedding. And know we are having a good foundation for our shared future. And the fact I reassure her nearly every week. I do so many things to show her I love her, care about her, and want a future. So when she says things like that, I feel unheard in how much I am struggle to carry all of this by myself.

The rest of the convo is a bit of a blur (alcohol and it being late doesn’t help), but it turns into a fight. It went on for about 2 hours. Which really sucks, because I’ve said time and time again I’m really uncomfortable having these conversations while we’ve had drinks and when it’s late. But nonetheless there we are.

I tell her that I don’t want to get married until I feel like I can depend on her. She says that I can, that she listens to me when I talk about work. I tell her that I mean like seriously depend on her, like what if I lose my job? What if I get deathly ill? I want to feel like we aren’t totally fucked, because she will be able to be there for us. I tell her about how we were supposed to have a check-in mid-October, to discuss her progress on things we had talked about fixing in July to keep the relationship going. That we never had that check-in, and it is past that but she hasn’t done these things. I told her I was glad that our conflicts had become less, but that these things were still not being met. She immediately got defensive and said “so how long were you going to wait to talk to me about this if I didn’t joke about marriage?” I said “not long at all, I was getting my thoughts together, and deciding when we should sit down and talk. October just ended.” She ends up telling me about how she has looked into a program at our old university and how she has had two phone calls with them that led nowhere. I was aware of one of these. I asked if she had ordered her transcript and applied to FAFSA like we talked about. She said no. She said it’s all confusing and she doesn’t know what to do. That it’s “hard.” I tell her “You can ask for help when you starting do it and I’ll help. you know when I was looking at going for my masters recently, I applied to both FAFSA and got my transcript in one day. It isn’t hard too hard.” she then brings up us having different capacities.

It some how derails and we are talking about the past. It’s hard to remember all that was said or how we got there. But I do remember telling her how it’s hard to trust her, because she hasn’t done these things, and because right before her psychosis this year, she admitted to me, that early in our relationship she had been posting nudes on a secret Snapchat to try and sell them, browsed Tinder, and apparently had her coworkers thinking I was abusive, that we were in an open relationship, etc. She justified the nudes by saying she was trying to make us money (which we didn't need to do, as I had a teaching job at this time. Also I don't have an issue with some posting nudes online, it's that we had talked about it early on, as she used to do it, and I told her I just didn't want the one's she sent me to be the same one's she posted, because I wanted to feel special, and then SHE decided she didn't want to do it anymore), and that she only did it like once a month, and didn’t do it for that long. And also that it never came up. As if I was supposed to know and ask?? She didn’t respond to the Tinder thing. She also said she didn’t know why her coworkers thought that of me, that she always told them how great I was. She said she speculates it’s because they thought it was odd she had a job and needed to work while I had a teaching job. I told her that, the point is she kept that all from me, while I took my first “grown up job” to try and start building our future, and she was doing all of that, and kept it from me for years. She said she was super supportive of me during that time.

We end up back to the original topic of what we had agreed she would do. I said something about how she has had 3 and a half months to make real progress and figure these things out, and she has done less than what I managed to do in a single morning. She got upset and she said very angrily “so what you want me to get my transcript, apply for FAFSA, and start applying??” I said “well yeah, that’s what we agreed to. It was either that or find another job.” She was upset that I didn’t see her having a phone call with a university about a program as enough. She said she needed me to see that as a good step. I said it was a good step, but it isn’t what we agreed to by this point. She was upset and said something about “so the conflict being less isn’t good? Because I haven’t done this?” I said “No I’ve said the conflict being less is good, it’s just that this was an important part of what we agreed to.” I had said several times in the conversation I was happy about that. I also around this point reminded her what I said last time we had these talks, which is that if she didn't want to go back to school or get a better job, that it was fine, we would just be wanting different things in life, and I wouldn't hate her for that, I would still love her, we would just not be compatible which happens sometimes. She stated multiple times this is what she wants, this is what she wants to do.

Honestly, this whole thing for me is in fragments. I remember points at which she kept trying to change why we almost broke up in the past. She tried to say she is worried to talk to me because I’ll just “break up” with her. And I had to tell her the reason we have almost broke up, was the first time, it was because I told her I got tremors and heart rate spikes when I felt like we were going to have conflict and she belittled me for it. The second time it was because she continuously ran over my boundaries, and had a whole meltdown that started from her tripping and falling when hanging out with family and being embarrassed. Which then went from me supporting her for being embarrassed and trying to make her feel better, to somehow being accusations that I didn’t love her, and she spiraled for like 4 hours, until nearly 5 AM, threatened to not go to my nephews birthday party with me the next day because I told her I think it’d be best if we continued talking about it in the morning, since we were both tired and have had a few drinks. Which she refused to do, and she blew up my phone and criticized my therapy for “changing me.” These weren’t light hearted moments for me, these weren’t just any conversation leading me to think it may be best for us to part ways. This is the second time she has tried to reframe these scenarios as me casually wanting to leave. Instead of what they truly were, which was her pushing me as far as I could go. She also said it’s my fault she has the job she has. That I “made her take it.” Because I’m the one who found it, and told her to apply to there, to get out of the other job that was making her absolutely miserable. Like that job made her seriously depressed. And that we had agreed it was something she could do while she figured something more long term out. But I never made her take it, I suggested it because the other job made me very worried for her and her mental health.

I had 5 heart rate notifications from my Apple Watch from the stress of this conversation. By the end things had settled, she apologized for not doing more, and asked me to promise I wouldn’t break up with her the next day, the next week, and this year. The party was over and everyone had gone to bed, so I missed out on seeing my aunts for longer as they left before we even woke up the next day.

Since then, I’ve just been feeling very confused. I feel sad, angry, confused, and kind of numb. I feel like I don’t remember everything, so if it seems like it doesn’t make sense, I’m sorry.

I just don’t really know what to think. Part of me really feels like this is the end. I just felt like all of our issues are not being dealt with, and that every issue we’ve had, I have to fight against her rewriting what happened. It’s just so confusing. I love her, I really do, so my heart hurts, but I just feel like things shouldn't be this hard. She's been extremely kind since this conversation, and she submitted to get her transcript. But yeah I just don't know. I am really just exhausted of things being like this, and I really wish we didn't have to have an argument for something to happen.

TLDR: Update from my last post. We had a chat, under not good circumstances. I feel very confused and lost. I think maybe it’s just time to throw in the towel. Is this something that can be fixed? Am I being reasonable?

ANSWER: Hon, she is never going to grow while you’re taking care of (frankly enabling) her. She needs to be on her own to figure shit out, and you deserve better than this. Break up, make it a CLEAN break, no contact, and recover. Once you are outside of the situation, you’re gonna realize how unhealthy it is.



QUESTION: My (30F) boyfriend (28M) doesnt have a job and just got kicked out. Im concerned about him staying at mine. What should I do?

Hey humans, I need perspective. Help a friend out. I (30F) have been dating a guy (28M) for two years.

At the beginning of our relationship I was struck by the depth of our conversations, his (verbal) support of my painting, and how he turned his life around (gave up drugs and alcohol 3 years ago). He took practical steps to show up for me—changed the litter box for my cats, took the recycling out, took my car to get the tires rotated. In the past I dated guys who talked a big game, but never did anything, so I felt so hopeful.

(For extra context, both of my parents are mentally ill drug addicts so there’s lots of pain there and kinda… hope for care? Which I know I need therapy for). 

Anyway, while we’ve been together I squared away my first year of a social work masters program and it was the hardest thing Ive ever done. In the meantime, he lost his job 8 months ago and has been playing music on the weekends to scrape by. I told him the high risk of that (lack of savings, etc) was making me nervous. He also really wasnt scraping by bc he didnt have enough money for food… so I started paying. Now I buy almost all of our groceries, and Ive been pleading with him to get a more secure job in addition to music… just a bookstore or something 2 days a week! (or something). 

Anyway he wont. He is working really hard to make enough money with music, but he wont get another job. And yesterday he got asked to leave his living situation so… He needs somewhere to land. He’s not from this town, so there aren’t a ton of options. I want to be a good partner and show up, but my nervous system is terrified. 

More context: He was asked to leave bc his landlord wanted to move his daughter & her fam into the property. He never missed a rent payment. 

He did say he may have found something for work this week, and with losing his housing maybe he’ll be more open to change? 

When I question him about the situation I feel like our conversation always ends up with my “trauma.” ie: clearly Im having a big reaction bc I have trauma and it’s not fair to him bc Im not seeing all he does for me.

On top of all of it the uncertainty and anxiety makes me heartbroken bc Im yearning for a “forever home” with someone. 

Extra context: before he was asked to leave his place, he was spending most nights at mine anyways. But, it feels different if he were to not have a place of his own.  

My question is: If I were a friend, what would you advise me to do? Is it amoral to tell him he cant stay with me? (or maybe to stay with not just me? me part time and his moms part time?) If he does stay here, is there anything I can do to stay sane? (make a chore chart, or something? and have a timeline?). If Im telling him he cant move in… what should I tell him yo do? Im open to the thoughts 

TL;DR My (30F) boyfriend (28M) doesnt have a job and just got kicked out. Im concerned about him staying at mine. What should I do?

ANSWER: I think that your gut is telling you something and you should take some time to listen to it. It's not a moral to see that someone isn't willing to really put in the work and effort to build a life and be a partner and want to keep some distance and safety. The fact that you are expressing these concerns and he's chalking them up to "trauma" is really manipulative



QUESTION: How can I help my husband understand that appreciation in marriage should go both ways?

I (29F) and my husband (29M) have been together for 10 years and married for 1. Lately, we’ve been arguing about household responsibilities — but for me, it’s less about chores and more about feeling appreciated.

He often tells me that I should be grateful he helps around the house because he’s the “breadwinner.” I do appreciate everything he does, but I also work full time — 10 to 12 hour shifts, 5 days a week, as a pet groomer. I handle most of the cooking, cleaning, dishes, and general organizing at home. He handles laundry more often, manages the yard and finances, and does most of the grocery shopping.

The grocery part has mostly fallen to him because we’ve been sharing one car. We moved from Philadelphia about two years ago, and until recently, I didn’t have my driver’s license (I used to be really anxious about driving). I finally got my license last week and am now looking for my own car, which will let me help more with errands and take some things off his plate.

Still, when I try to explain that while I’m thankful for what he does, I also deserve gratitude for working and keeping up with the home, it turns into an argument. He takes it as me being ungrateful or trying to “one-up” him, which isn’t what I mean at all. I just want mutual appreciation — not a scoreboard.

How can I bring this up in a way that helps him see that appreciation should go both ways, without it turning into another fight?

TL;DR:
29F married to 29M for 1 year (together 10). My husband says I should be grateful that he helps around the house since he’s the main earner, but I also work full time and handle most housework. I just want him to understand that gratitude should go both ways — how can I communicate that without starting another argument?

ANSWER: You're explaining your reasoning extremely clearly here, and it's a totally reasonable ask - so if he's not "getting" it, it's likely because he doesn't want to. There are a few reasons why that may be, unfortunately none of them are great.



QUESTION: My (21F) partner (21M) just came out as transgender, and I feel confused.

Me (21F) and my partner (21M) have been dating for three years, right before we graduated high school, when she identified as a male. Yesterday, she called me for a serious talk, and told me that she was transgender. 

Of course, I want to be by her side and help her with her transition. However, I don’t know what to do, as I see myself only being attracted to men. I don’t want to hurt her because of my sexuality. 

I am still so in love with her, and I don’t want to end our relationship, but I see myself as straight. As of now, I can’t see a future with a woman. I don’t know what to do, and I need advice. Should I stay? Should I break up with her? What do I do? The last thing I want to do is hurt her. 

TL;DR - My partner just came out as transgender, and I don’t know if I should stay or leave the relationship, as I identify as straight, even though I’m still in love with her.

ANSWER: check out r/mypartneristrans

if you’re not attracted to women, it’s okay to break up - you can support her without being in a romantic relationship



QUESTION: My husband (37M) blames me (35F) for our child being on the autism spectrum

In the pre diagnosis phase he started to shut me out and drink more. She is now officially diagnosed and is a beautiful and happy 3 year old who lives life in her own way. She is minimally verbal and requires a lot of extra support (we are level 2 for those familiar with the level stuffs).

I tried to bring this up. He rejects the notion but isn’t himself. He was my rock and best friend. But I went through a period of time that I couldn’t trust him to take care of her. He let her elope multiple times while I was at work and had to have a home visit from CPS.

I think he is drinking too much and putting us in financial trouble with his drinking and reckless spending. I don’t think divorce is something I want but don’t know how to fix this. How do we move through this? Please do not just say therapy because I have tried.

TL;DR!

We have been friends/ dated since high school. He is a reliable and good person. When I unexpectedly got pregnant with our son (now 8 years old) it was the logical thing to get married and build a life together but now all of that is in jeopardy.

ANSWER: I think the better question is it safe for your child to be in the current environment rather than do you want a divorce. If he is an unsafe person, then you have your answer.



QUESTION: We were ALMOST perfect for six years, bought a house together... then everything fell apart. (Me 25M.. Her 25F)

So me and her been together for 6 years! Everything was great! Even perfect! In my head she was the woman I was going to live my whole life with. We just bought a house and it’s been 2 months we have it. I recently had a harder past 2 months. All my friends were moving some place far so I felt a certain way like I was losing them. So I was a bit more distant, in a mini depression, wanted to do nothing all the time and was always refusing her (let’s say for small activities like walks, etc). I was in my head a lot and was more distant from her and did not really talk about it to her. So she was a bit disconnecting from me.

She, 1 month ago, started to game with a work colleague that she discovered liked playing WOW. They started playing every night and me, not naturally jealous, started to feel things were strange… like she was just watching movies with him online and you know doing stuff she normally would never do.

At a certain point, 2 weeks ago, I asked her if everything was great between us and she then said that she was loving me less. I asked her, shocked and a bit hurt, if she is in love maybe with him or maybe she’s having some feelings for him and she then said yes. My heart shattered… my heart EXPLODED…

We then came to the conclusion where she would stop contacting him. She told him and they stopped talking. The day after she came home and I saw that she was distant. I asked her if she was doubting us and if she still wanted to try working on stuff. She said no, so then we broke up. She moved to her parents’ place...

A week after that she decided that she loved me and wanted to work on us. She came back, I left her as much space as she needed. The first night she spent it on the couch and then the second night she gave me a hug and touched my arm a bit, nothing too serious, and then slept in the same bed with me asking me for a kiss before going to sleep.

The third night I unloaded my bag so I let her know that I feel the guilt, like I fucked up everything by being closed off and being stupid to leave her and not being as much present as I used to be. She after this came in my chest and cuddled me “sensually” and kissed me deeply.

The day after, she came back from work and I saw in her that she was different, a bit weird, bizarre, like she was hiding something. I then asked her if she had something she would like to tell me. She then sat down and told me that she’s not loving me anymore and that she has difficulty trying to work on our relationship and seeing me giving my 2000% for her and she could not give that much to me. She also told me that the whole week she was giving me love not because she wanted to but because she knew I wanted it.

We then had a big conversation, a rough one, and concluded that it’s maybe too early to take the big decision to completely cut off the bridges. The night after I exploded, my heart is destroyed, I don’t know what to think or do anymore, so I go for a car ride alone. She then started texting me a lot. She started asking me where I am and if I want to watch a movie with her. I said yes. We watched the movie, she asked for my hand, I gave her. We then went to bed, she asked me “can I cuddle with you? I need reassurance.” I said yes. We then did some adult stuff...

And now we are 2 days after the movie night. She didn’t tell me I love you or cuddled me since... but this morning before leaving to work she came in the room and kissed me goodbye and said I love you. I love her so much. I have no idea what to do anymore. What to think... I’m lost... I’m hurt... and I want some advice and some exterior advice on my situation.

  
TL;DR: Been with my girlfriend for 6 years, just bought a house. I went through a rough couple of months and got distant. She started gaming and connecting with a coworker, developed feelings for him, and said she loves me less. We broke up, then she came back saying she wanted to try again, but now she’s unsure and says she doesn’t love me anymore. I’m heartbroken, confused, and don’t know what to do.

ANSWER: Could 2 months of you withdrawing cause this much damage to a 6 year relationship that you describe as great and perfect? 

I wonder if she saw it as great and perfect the way that you did.



QUESTION: [UPDATE - 7 years later] For years, my [35F] husband [37M] said that if I want stability in our life, I have to make it happen. I did. And now things are worse than ever. Help?

I was recently cleaning out my bookmarks and [found this old throwaway](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9tdkqa/for_years_my_35f_husband_37m_said_that_if_i_want/), and obviously the two posts I made with it. I'm not sure why now, but I feel compelled to write a followup. Maybe it'll give people the bravery to change or at least an example of how sticking with what you know isn't always the best choice.

An obviously very long story short, with the help of those posts and a lot of long nights of thinking, I left my husband. In fact, it took him going away for a long weekend to realize how much happier and at peace I felt without him around... At first the split was amicable, but looking back I think he was just waiting for me to come rushing back to him once I "realized my mistake." When that didn't happen and he could see I was actually serious about building a new life for myself, a switch flipped. We only spoke when he needed something from me and eventually that stopped too. Enough about him.

I'm now 42, happier and healthier and more satisfied than I've been my whole life. I picked me and that was the best choice I could've ever made. I lived alone for the first time and my god, the peace of having my own space... unrivaled. I ended up staying in that apartment for 5 years, not a moving box in sight. I put art on the walls, I knew my neighbors. I made a home. I grew my career and went back to school. Made friends, built a little community.

I've done a ton of therapy and realized that the abusive patterns my parents created in childhood were just repeating with my ex. I fell in love, a real love, a supportive love that encourages growth and security. I'm doing new work, work that helps people and is so much more than just chasing money. All of those things have created a life that's more rewarding than I ever thought possible for myself.

I've gone through some really shitty times too, illness, cancer scares, deaths, loss... but I have no idea how I would've come out the other side without the community I'd built around me. Even something as simple as people at your local coffee shop recognizing you is a comfort after feeling adrift and alone for so long. Anyway, if I were to respond to myself from 7 years ago, this is what I would say.

>Leave the loser. He doesn't care about you, never did. He only cares about what you can do for him and now that you aren't serving him... well. Just go. You are capable of doing difficult things, and you are worthy of the work it takes to accomplish them. Trust your abilities, trust your gut - it's been screaming at you for years now, honey. Life can be so much more than you've experienced, but you have to make it happen for yourself. 

TL;DR: Left my husband, happier than ever.

EDIT: I'm surprised but happy this found so many people! I genuinely thought I was going to bookend this story and have it disappear into the ether. But whatever urge I had to write it, and whatever brought you to reading it... who knows? Maybe it was meant to. Thank you for all the messages and comments, I feel so grateful to have this perspective and experience.

ANSWER: It's really ridiculous the mount [edit: amount] of women I know who leave marriages and blossom, thrive, are so much happier for it. You don't see that much talked about in the outside world. It's really remarkable.



QUESTION: I am considering leaving my husband over keeping a lock on on of our doors and refusing to open it

Hi everyone. Very sad to be posting this but I F29 am considering separating from my husband M33 of 5 years over a big issue we just had a couple of days ago. My husband has always cared about his things, and he puts all his valuables in his office where he works remotely 3 days a week. He put a lock on the outside of the office door 6 months ago to supposedly keep his things safe from our destructive toddler. I let it go, but found it a bit odd since the key is usually no where to be found.

Anyways, I recently went in the office to get our bird's perch out the room, and he was hovering acting really suspicious. He defensively said what do you need in there? And I said the bird's perch...but then instantly felt he was hiding something from me. I also noticed he locked the door after that. After we put our toddler to sleep, I told him I needed to go in the room to change the sheets on our guest mattress because we have visitors soon. He was acting defensive again and said he would do it another time. That is when I said what are you hiding in there? You are getting really defensive, and its weird that I am locked out of a space in my own home and have to ask permission to enter. He got more defensive until I eventually said you need to unlock the door and let me see what is in there because you are hiding something.

Long story short, he admitted to hiding weed in the room and playing video games when I go to sleep. But he REFUSED to open the door. I told him i'm going to sit by the door until he unlocks it because I think he is hiding something worse since those things aren't that big of a deal. You guys, he literally refused. I tried begging, I tried getting the lock open, I tried everything I could think of. Not only would he not unlock the door, but he was gaslighting me the entire time telling me i'm crazy and it must be my pregnancy hormones thinking there was something else in there? He said that if he opens the door, he would be giving in to my pushiness. He also kept touching my leg and telling me he was sorry i'm going through this like I was making all of this up in my head.

Unfortunately, I got too tired around 2am (keep in mine i'm pregnant having to deal with this) and told him i'm going to sleep and whatever he is hiding in there he can get rid of in the morning, but i'm done. In the morning, the room was perfectly staged with his little weed pen out and switch game. He has changed the lock on the door to a normal one that only locks when someone is in the room, but still seems to see no problem with what he has done. He is still adamant that it is perfectly normal to lock a door from the outside if you have important things in there. He also said there was nothing else in there and he just couldn't for the life of him let me in after I said we needed to go through his stuff. He said that was controlling behavior and giving in would be saying that was okay.

I guess what i'm asking is...is it normal to put a lock on an office door even on the outside? Would a separation by the best next steps? I have a toddler and a baby coming, and really don't want to have to do this alone if I don't need to.

ANSWER: Yeah he was hiding something in there. If you’re lucky it’s something he’s just embarrassed by that he doesn’t want to share. But if it’s not that, I’d guess hard drugs or a porn habit that’s borderline cheating, since apparently he needs somewhere private to indulge. You could try asking him for a drug test to see how he responds.



QUESTION: My boyfriend turned me into a baby and I don’t feel like myself anymore

I (30F) used to be a very independent person. For example, I’ve travelled to over 30 countries all by myself by age 25. I knew how to survive anywhere in the world. My parents were abusive, so I escaped home and lived on my own as soon as I became an adult. I enjoyed living by myself and doing everything by myself.

Then I met my boyfriend (27M) a few years ago. Despite being younger than me, he treats me like a baby and started doing everything for me. He always takes me to work and picks me up after work since I don’t have a car. Without him, I would’ve walked or taken public transport. I’ve always been grateful to him for doing this. Not only that, but he also does all the housework. He does most of grocery shopping and cooking and cleaning and laundry. When we go on a trip, he plans everything.

Life with him was so convenient that I got used to doing nothing by myself in a few years. All my friends say they are jealous that I have such a good boyfriend who does everything for me. I thought so, too. But suddenly I realised that I can’t do anything by myself anymore? When he goes on a business trip and leaves me alone for a week, I find it so stressful and exhausting to do house chores like cooking and cleaning, which I always did by myself before meeting him.

I became much less independent than I was 10 years ago and I don’t feel like myself anymore. On the other hand, I feel like I’m finally receiving the love and treatment I didn’t receive from my parents and it’s compensating my miserable childhood. He says I need to be treated like a baby now because I didn’t have the chance in my childhood.

I’m aware that this isn’t healthy in the long term. What should I change?

TL;DR: I used to be an independent person, but my boyfriend treats me like a baby and does everything for me and now I can’t do things like house chores by myself. I lost the independent person I was and turned into a baby.

ANSWER: Girl you got a guy like this. Start picking up the efforts and put in 50% rather than him doing 90%, and you both are SET. If he continues doing all this, he's gonna be burnt out sooner or later.



QUESTION: Bf (19m) and I (17f) were mugged. He ran away and left me alone with the mugger. I can't see him in the same light anymore

Yesterday I was hanging out with my bf and we were in a not so great part of our city. Suddenly a guy approached us to ask for indications and asked us to help him get there and we helped him (stupid i know). After getting there he pulled out a knife and asked for all our money.

Bf ran away and left me alone with the mugger. Lucklily he just wanted my money so i gave him all the money i had and then he went away.

After that i went inside a bar and called my parents. My parents were furious with bf and tried to call him but he did not pick up. We then went to the police and then returned home and after maybe 2 hours i received a call from bf asking me where i was and telling me he alerted the police. I exploded on him and he did not even apologized but kept telling me he did the best he could.

My question is: is there any way to recover from this? My image of him is shattered 

TL;DR: boyfriend left me during a mugging. I can't see him in the same light anymore

ANSWER: >>  is there any way to recover from this? 

I personally do not think so. I am so sorry this happened to you.



QUESTION: UPDATE: I (26F) think my boyfriend (30M) is exaggerating or faking his illness

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jefjhu/help\_i\_26f\_think\_my\_boyfriend\_30m\_is\_exaggerating/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jefjhu/help_i_26f_think_my_boyfriend_30m_is_exaggerating/)

Thank you to everyone who responded to my post and was so compassionate and kind. It was incredible to hear from so many people who actively battle chronic pain/illness and those with loved ones who do. I hope to continue deepening my empathy towards anyone who is struggling with an invisible illness.

On to my update. Armed with some fresh perspectives (and some fresh frustrations, lol) I talked to my boyfriend and told him that he needs to see a doctor or I will no longer be able to support him financially and stand by while he remains unemployed and unmotivated to get the help he needs. I also addressed the idea of managing/balancing his energy levels differently so that we're able to share household responsibilities more effectively, spend quality time together, and keep him doing the things he loves with his friends. 

His response was...really bad. He told me that if I'm not willing to "step up and clean around the house" (something I'm already doing) that there's no use living together and that my efforts to clean are the bare minimum and not good enough for his standards anyway. He was also really mad that I haven't taken initiative to take care of yard projects and car repairs. He sat there and spouted off a whole list of things I'm not noticing and cleaning. And, once again, he was focused on this idea that I don't like his friends/am jealous of them and want him spending less time with them, which isn't true at all. 

This really stung. He basically brushed over everything I said and focused on my perceived faults. This told me everything I need to know and I told him I was leaving. He was just...mad. Not sad or hurt at all. I'm still crying excessively over his whole reaction. I still don't know how real or unreal his chronic pain is, but I guess it doesn't matter anymore. 

Thank you again, everyone, for your support and kindness. I'm truly at a loss. 

TLDR: My (26F) boyfriend (30M) of almost two years and I have separated over his inability to address his chronic pain.

ANSWER: OP, I remember your first post. I know you’re very sad right now, and you have a right to be. But don’t let grief overstay its welcome — you are so much better off and he just lost his bang maid, expect him to come crawling back when he realizes you’re serious. Don’t believe anything he says. 

This internet stranger is proud of you. You deserve someone who can be your partner regardless of whether they have an illness — that doesn’t mean they’re critical or cruel.



QUESTION: My Husband Told Me He’s Filing For Divorce Today


My Husband (34M) told me (32F) that he’s fed up and going to file for divorce.  We’ve been married for 1 year, together for 4 years. He is very angry, and I feel depleted and numb.

Backstory: 
My husband suffers from a type of OCD called Relationship OCD otherwise known as Retroactive Jealousy. It is where he fixates on my past sexual relationships, particularly on one person, a person who I have not even spoken to in over 8 years. 

He can get triggered anytime, anywhere. We could be watching TV and a character will have the same name and he will get triggered. Last weekend, we were at a concert celebrating our one year wedding anniversary and someone came on stage wearing a jersey that is for the same sport this person used to play. He wanted to leave the concert immediately, we ended up fighting and our anniversary was ruined. 

Anytime he is triggered, his energy completely shifts from warm, goofy and loving to ice cold and bothered and he shuts me out. It is a very sad, confusing, frustrating and isolating experience for me and for him, it’s mental turmoil.

Pretty much every single fight we have had in our relationship has stemmed from his retroactive jealousy. Other than that, we’ve been extremely happy. Unfortunately, every time he gets triggered it chips away at my happiness. I walk on eggshells and feel anxiety sometimes because I never know when he will get triggered next.

I thought he might get better with time / after marriage because he would finally see that I want him and only him forever, I was wrong. 

Ever since he was triggered on our anniversary last weekend and we fought, things have never been worse. Something feels different about this time, like I finally realized this isn’t going away or I’ve hit my breaking point. We’ve been cordial to each other all week and sleeping in the same bed but no sex.

Yesterday, he asked me if “I’m ready to go back to being loving again”. I told him my concerns and how he needs to seek support / medication for this RJ. I also thanked him for giving me space (which literally just meant not initiating sex) and he got an attitude and say “yea well I was upset too”. 

It felt clear to me in this moment that he wasn’t really listening to me and to be fair, I sometimes have a difficult time seeing things from his side as well. Sometimes his aggressive approach and victim mindset in conversation makes me automatically defensive. 

He ended up storming out of the room and slept in the guest room (where he always sleeps when he’s upset or for his everyday naps) and has been slamming every door he walks through ever since. 

At this point, there is so much tension that I told him I will move his things from the master bedroom to the guest room so that we both can have space to process what we’re feeling. 

He left for the day to go golfing, a new hobby he picked up that he has trashed for the last 4 years.. While he was away I moved his stuff. I did not move it to upset him, I truly feel broken and anxious when I’m around him now and just need a little space to process everything.

He came home from golf and was livid. He said he wasn’t interested in being roommates and this was no way to live. I told him once again that I need space to process everything and he said rudely “you’ve had enough space, you’ve had a week of space. Instead of moving my belongings all day you could have instead come up with a way to communicate.” I told him I did try communicating with him yesterday and he got upset. I told him that the way he is currently speaking to me is with an aggressive tone to which he replied “Because I’m angry! This is ridiculous. I won’t be married to someone who can’t resolve simple issues, I won’t have kids with that person, I’m filing for divorce.” 

I responded that I don’t want a divorce all I am asking for is a little space for us to work through this. I don’t remember what he responded but he didn’t care that I said that and I think again he just repeated he was filing for divorce. 

After he said that he left the house. The crazy part is I still don’t feel much? I don’t feel angry or sad, just numb. Perhaps I’m over it or it could be some kind of coping mechanism to protect myself.

I’ve never spoken to friends or family about his RJ because I love him and didn’t want them to think negatively about him. I think it’s finally time I open up to my mother about it. I feel very alone.

I’m not sure what to do or where to go from here. I’ve never been more in love with anyone in my life. He was caring, made me laugh, bought me flowers, supported me when I was laid off from my job, etc. but I am just not sure I can be in this relationship anymore now with how he’s acting. Not taking accountability, being rude to me and instead of giving me the space I need, threatening to divorce instead.

REDDIT: It would help to hear from you (an outside perspective) on this. I am too in it to think clearly at the moment. Even if no one responds, it felt nice to be able to type this out. 

TL;DR: Husband has ROCD (retroactive jealousy) that causes most of our fights. After a bad trigger on our anniversary, he’s now threatening divorce because I asked for space, claiming I am incapable of solving issues. I feel numb and don’t know if this relationship is salvageable.

____________________

UPDATE: I am blown away at the amount of support this post has gotten. Thank you to everyone who has responded and to the mod of this post for giving me a great book recommendation. As many of you guessed, his threat of divorce was not real.

For the first time in 4 years I truly put my foot down and told my husband that I will no longer put up with this treatment. I told him that if he continues to choose not to seek help and instead continue to hurt me, then I’m not staying (and he knows I mean it). I told him I love him, but I love me and my mental health more. 

Since this long conversation he has set up an immediate plan:

Daily plan: 
 Morning reflection / meditation
 Medicine / Vitamins: Fluoxetine, magnesium, omega 3
 Workout

Weekly plan:
 Meet with therapist / start ERP (first session is scheduled for this weekend)
 Read 50 pages of self help books: 
     The Art of Letting Go - read by 10/1
     The Happiness Trap - read by 10/1
     Overcoming Retroactive Jealousy - read by 10/15
     Brain Lock: Overcoming OCD -  read by 10/30 

I told him that I support him, but that he needs to do deep reflection and work on himself before we can start rebuilding our relationship. I plan on leaving town this week to spend some time with my mother and will be working on an exit plan to have just in case the day comes. 

I have found a lot of strength and growth within myself throughout this process,  and am very proud of myself. 

I can’t describe how it felt going from feeling so isolated and alone to feeling like I have a community who supports me through this post. So if you’re scrolling and see someone who needs help, just know that your comment can make a big difference. <3

ANSWER: This divorce would be a gift, honestly.  

I don't know if this is genuine, but its absolutely wild.



QUESTION: UPDATE:  My boyfriend [M24] and I [F24] have too much sex and I can´t handle it anymore. How do I explain it to him that it exhausts me and how do I negotiate new intimacy with him?

Original post: [My boyfriend \[M24\] and I \[F24\] have too much sex and I can´t handle it anymore. How do I explain it to him that it exhausts me and how do I negotiate new intimacy with him? : r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ge7l3a/my_boyfriend_m24_and_i_f24_have_too_much_sex_and/)

I spend a lot of time reading through everyone's replies and looking inwards about how I feel. I gathered my thoughts and spend a few days making a list of what I wanted to say when we have the big conversation. On a weekend when we had planned to spend the day together I sat him down and told him the following points: 

I love him to the moon and back and want to show him that I love him, make him feel desired, loved and appreciated

BUT

Having so much sex with such frequency is physically exhausting to me which causes me to avoid sex and even sex acts I enjoy because I don´t have enough energy and motivation to do it. This also causes me to orgasm not as often anymore. I also need time to physically recover before it may even start to become painful. I feel like sex has become the single defining aspect of our relationship and many other parts like doing activities together, romantic dates, just talking and cuddling have taken a backseat. I also feel exhausted emotionally and underappreciated from giving as much as I can (which I gladly do for the people I love) while little comes back from the other side of the relationship. 

I then proceeded to explain the things I like during sex and what makes me go wild, hoping to show him that I still want to have sex with him. I also made a few more compliments just to keep the vibe positive and because I meant it. 

He reacted pretty well all things considered. He listened and let me finish, but asked for a little time to think about it. Obviously I gladly agreed. We spend the rest of the day together without him initiating once. At the end of the day he said that he wants me to enjoy sex just as much as he does and that he loves me. 

I was really hopeful for the next week and a half. We spend our time together like usual and he asked for sex about one half as often as before our talk. We even had days without sex at all. He also started to ask "Do you want to have sex with me?" instead of physically initiating like he did before, like touching me somewhere, hugging me from behind and similar things. He also stopped asking for pictures of me and when he did it were just selfies. I was so happy that I even took the initiative once and he seemingly loved it when I asked for sex.  

Then one day he sat me down with a stern look and said that he hated what this relationship has turned into. To him it feels like we are now just roommates or platonic friends instead of lovers. He told me that the one time I initiated after he was overjoyed to finally "fuck me again" his heart was broken because I suddenly wasn´t as submissive as usually (I asked to be eaten out and was on top with some more dominant dirty talk) and that all of that is not what he signed up for. He doesn´t want to walk on eggshells waiting for when I am finally in the mood, but have what he deserves in the relationship. 

Basically he gave me an ultimatum: either we return to how it was before the talk starting right now or he leaves me. Guess who doesn´t have a boyfriend anymore?

I spend the last few days bawling my eyes out and eating lots of ice cream and watching some shitty shows. What he said hurt me a lot and I do not love him anymore, but still the feeling of loss and sadness is all too real.    He was my first relationship and for the past two years he was my entire world. No I have to gather up the broken shards he left behind. 

TL;DR: I took your advice and talked with him about my feelings. He pretended to be ok with it for a while and then left me after demanding more sex again.

ANSWER: Yeesh I'm sorry, but I'm so glad you stood up for yourself, because the way he reacted exposed even more red flags. 


Do not take him back if he asks, he may try to manipulate you with the breakup so that you're more submissive next time.



QUESTION: I don’t want to relocate to India with my husband

Tldr: I, European 26, f doesn’t want ro relocate to India with my husband Punjabi 29, m due to cultural differences and lifestyle changes being too much for me to handle. 

My husband is a Punjabi and I am a European NZ. We have been married for three years and he has been living in New Zealand for 10 years. I have been to India many times for three months at a time each go. 

My husband has decided he wants to relocate us to India permanently, I really don’t want to. I would never force him to distance himself from his roots but I honestly don’t think I could cope with India for atleast 6 - 8 months a year, he said we could visit NZ yearly apparently. I made a compromise with him that I visit India for three months  a year and he can stay 6-8 months a year. He says life in India would be better for us because we would have more money and he has more connections in business there etc. My husband didn’t agree to this and said where ever and whatever the husband says the wife should follow. He said he Weill buy me a car in India and I can get a job teaching English to pre schoolers. I can only speak the basics on Punjabi and no one in Punjab but his parents and a few of his relatives who don’t speak English anyway. 

I am really conflicted and cry about this often because I feel like I’m going to be giving up my freedom and individuality. 

The times I have stayed in India have been hard at some points as my husbands house is rural and I can’t leave or go anywhere without him. I don’t get to wear what I like and to be honest if I say I don’t want to eat or drink something that is culturally Punjabi I found his family judged me so much. His parents also told me to stop watching English tv shows in the house. I followed their instructions and turned it off but felt super sad after wards. 

I think that maybe I am being selfish for not wanting to live in India but I don’t want to be trapped with no where to go. I think I will go mad. Any insight on my situation would be appreciated. Sorry my paragraphs and words are all over the place, my thoughts in my head and just a mess at the moment.

ANSWER: “Whatever the husband says, the wife should do.” He’s telling you who he is. Just wait until you are isolated and surrounded by this belief/culture.



QUESTION: UPDATE: Boyfriend slept with someone else while we were on a break

Origional post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Z9RsQy6S1Y

Firstly, thank you for all the useful advice I was given on my original post. I was unable to reply because it was locked but thank you all. 

Since I found out my (39F) boyfriend (40M) of 14 years slept with someone else, I broke up with him. He stayed living in my flat for 2 months (on a tight deadline) so he could find a home as he is jobless. He didn't. He is now homeless. 

His mum pressured me to have him for longer as there is a cold snap here and he's on the streets but I said no. His mum can take him in if she is so worried.

I found out it was the lady he has been spending time with at the gym. I think he wanted to try that to see if it was better.

That is all. I now live alone (with dog). 

TLDR: I chucked him out. He's homeless.

ANSWER: If he knew he was going to be homeless that far in advance and didn't sort out any income then that's on him. Who would want to have anything to do with someone who behaves like that.



QUESTION: My husband (63M) goes cycling way too much leaving me, his (60F) wife alone. How do I help him understand he's losing me?

Good people, I need some help.

My husband (63M) and I (60F) have been happily married 30+ years. Five or so years ago he started cycling. He loved it and I was happy he found something he enjoyed and was good for him although I felt he was spending too much money on bikes, tools, supplies, rides in races and weekend trips.  

The last few years have been bad with the time he spends riding. It’s getting unbearable for me. He’s gone all the time. He takes two cycling classes a week at the gym, he rides there when he’s not taking classes and he’s out on the road or a path 4-6 days a week for 4-6 or 7 hours at a time coming home after 10 at night on weeknights. Oh, and works a full-time job on top of this.

Last month we went to Florida for three days to visit my family and of course he had to rent a bike and ride. In the last 5 months he’s left me alone to ride on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, Easter and Mother’s Day. He probably went riding on Valentines Day too, I don’t remember. As I post this, he’s in Chillicothe Ohio on a weekend ride and visit with friends.

This is not a communication issue as I have joked, talked, complained, yelled and cried and cried all many many times. I love my husband dearly and don’t want a divorce. But I can’t take being alone anymore. I'd rather be separated and alone than married and alone. But if I leave him, I feel I’d be letting our kids and grandkids down. I’m so lost and don’t know what to do. Nothing I do or say makes a difference to him.

I'm hoping a few people are willing to comment so I can show him this and maybe we can both learn something, or I can gain some insight. Thanks ahead for your helpful comments.

TLDR, My husband rides his bike and leaves me, his wife alone way too much and I have no idea what to do. Can you please offer some advice?

ANSWER: I'd sit down and talk about this and focus ENTIRELY on you and what you need. Do not say the words "you are cycling too much" or it will become an argument about whether he is cycling too much. Instead, say 'I need to spend more time with you" or "I need to know that you'll be physically present on holidays and vacations" and ask him how he's going to make that happen.



QUESTION: Wife is a whole new person after giving birth. I’m scared i’m going to lose her.

My wife [30F] gave birth to our daughter 4 months ago. She doesnt work so she is a sahm. She is NOT the same person she was before the baby. Before birth we got into a serious argument maybe once every few months, now it's almost every weekend for almost no reason. Monday we were supposed to have a date night (drinking wine, watching movies, playing games, ends with sexual relations usually I'm (32M) holding her while we're watching a movie and she randomly blew up on me for no reason. Said she's sick of me and doesnt ever want to have sex again then storms out and locks herself in the bedroom. I prioritize her wellbeing. Make sure she's fed, hydrated, doing well mentally when she's with our daughter. She doesn't even seem happy to see me anymore when I'm home from work. Past fights recently have been about how she's not happy with me anymore after i snapped back one time about her nitpicking everything ive been doing recently (she has never once mentioned this before the baby), she's snapped on me because the baby was crying and I couldn't get her to sleep fast enough, also screamed at me because i ran a yellow light with her in the car. When we fight it's really hurtful things being said to me and I'm always saying sorry trying to defuse. I've done maybe 95% of the feedings at night so she can get about 7/8 hours of sleep consecutively and take baby from the moment i return from work so she can get alone time. I also do a lot of the household chores for her and it seems to land on deaf ears. She refuses counseling and won't talk to me about it and doesn't think it's a big deal. It seems like our marriage is close to an end and I'm scared. I care so much about her I hate seeing her like this. Can anyone relate?

TL;DR: wife gave birth 4 months ago and now randomly hates my very existence.

ANSWER: It could be postpartum depression or anxiety. 

Four months post birth is a difficult time regardless, she may also be struggling to adapt to her new life. I remember there were moments where I felt like I hated my husband, especially in the early days. 

I would try and get her to speak to a doctor.



QUESTION: Update: I told my boyfriend I loved him right after we had sex. How badly did I mess up?

Sl I (33f) made a post the other night (which can be found here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/TvHzNz4WpV) about how I’m with my first ever boyfriend (37m) and told him right after we had sex that I loved him and he didn’t immediately say it back so I freaked out and tried to backtrack before shutting him down and saying I wanted to move on. I left shortly after and just shut myself out from him for most of the next day. This morning I got a text message from him that said he misses me and was really loved to go out tonight, so I figured what the hell and we went out. While we were out, there was a moment during dinner that I reached over and held his hand and told him I was sorry I ignored him and told him about my abandonment issues and how self-destructive I can be when I’m scared people will leave me. I’m sure it’ll come as absolutely no shock to anyone that he was lovely and patient with me. We went back to his place and were snuggling and I was starting to fade away to sleep…

…then he said “love you, beautiful” (“beautiful” is his pet name for me. Corny but he says it’s very fitting lol). I stopped and then looked over at him, and then he said “you don’t have to say it back.” I said “but what if I wanna say it back?” and he told me to go ahead and I said “I love you too.” I rolled over on him and gave him a nice long kiss and then put my forehead on his before I started crying a little bit. I cannot tell you how badly I’ve wanted to say that to someone since I was 14 and it doesn’t even feel real. Feels like some dream I had that was nice but didn’t happen.

Riding this emotional high I can’t sleep so I’m writing this while he’s sleeping next to me. I have to get up in four hours to have enough time to go back home and get ready for work, but I don’t care. One bad day of crap sleep is forgettable, I’m gonna remember this night for the rest of my life. It’s way too soon for this, but I’m already getting giddy about putting my name in front of his last name.

So yeah. I’m in love you guys <3

tl;dr: follow up to the situation with me telling my boyfriend I loved him. He forgave me for shutting me out and later told me he loved me too.

ANSWER: If we're talking about silly crap we did after only two months... I had a psychotic episode and ran down the highway trying to get away from a guy I met on tinder screaming he was trying to kill me.

We've been together 4 years.



QUESTION: I (43F) read my fiancee's (56M) journals and don't know if I can marry him now

I (43F) am using a throwaway for obvious reasons here. Before I start YES I know I am a huge jerk for snooping in his (56M) email and I definitely found trouble, I accept that. I was working on his computer and his gmail was open and I saw my name so I opened it and it was a Word doc that he journaled. Curious of course I searched his inbox with my name and saw his entries and read them. Some of what he said has devastated me and shaken me to the core. We have been together almost 3 years, the first year on and off and was rocky. We have been living together since the summer. He is not home and I have not brought this up yet. I think I might faint and need some space. Should I get some distance and go to a hotel for the weekend? I thought we were in a great place. Over the past 10 months these are some of the things he's written about me: For reference i put \\\\ in place of my name.

"There are moments, in my dark thoughts, where I feel like being with her is a compromise for me, like this somehow diminishes me and that I am settling for her because I have ruined all of my other prospects and I’m too old to find someone else."

"At times, I wish she had stayed out of my life.  I wonder if I had stayed on my own if someone better would have come into my orbit.  There is so much to deal with, so many bad feelings and darkness.  I find that I am thinking about Lauren a lot but who’s to say that she would be any better.  The reality is that I met her on tour and fucked her a day later.  What kind of woman is that? I feel like I have pissed my life away and this is all that I am entitled to.  I have pissed away all of the good things in my life."

 "Someone like \\\\ would never have been able to get to me. When I was younger, I had many opportunities to be with women like her but declined. I am uncertain about whether this is a good thought pattern to have."

"My mind wanders to places, like what it would have been like if someone like Lauren could have been in my life instead of \\\\.  Lauren has the advantage of existing in my mind as an ideal.  We never really got the chance to know each other outside of two nights and a week of texting and talking on the phone.  I know that she had a drug past but has been sober for over a decade.  I don’t think she was promiscuous; most guys that I know that knew her in the old days indicated that she didn’t have a lot of men in her life.  That’s not to say that there hasn’t been a lot of darkness in her life. It would have been easier to be with her.  There weren’t all of these men in her orbit like \\\\.  She was never married, so there was no divorce.  She’s not as emotionally damaged as \\\\.  In some ways, I feel like being with \\\\ is some sort of karmic thing, like this is what I deserve for being non-committal for most of my life.  I have my own damage.  Everyone likes to think that they are a good person but there are moments when I am not so sure about myself."

TL:DR I am not sure if I can go forward with this relationship after reading this.

ANSWER: One: if he could get with Lauren, he'd soon be finding fault with her, too.

Two: run as fast as you can. He doesn't even like you, at all. Don't be a placeholder. You're not even second best here.

I'm sorry for how you feel atm, but it's good that you know so you can make your own decisions.



QUESTION: Update: husband has a new chosen family he prioritizes and sees every week, I’m jealous and frustrated


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/JwBnrT9EL9

It’s been a while since- our little boy is 2.5 now. Thank you to everyone who commented - it was the kick in the butt I needed to lay down the law. Esp the folks that rightly pointed out I was a passive doormat without self respect — that stung but was true.

After my post, I had a big sit down with John on my the things I was upset about. My husband was traveling to be a groomsman for a good friend — I told him to stay out there for an additional week and decide: 
1. if he wanted to stay married and wanted to be a family
2. If he wanted the above, think about what needed to change on his part (not just Pam but other stuff too), how he was going to be a good husband/father going forward
3. Arrange to go over it with me and our marriage counselor on his return

Alternatively, if he didn’t do the above then when he got back we’d start logistics on separation and co-parenting. 

And surprisingly, he did all the above. Apparently he reflected a lot at the wedding (his friend and his wife are such an in love couple) and thought a lot about us and our relationship and what he wanted.

He came back and proposed changes (immediate break from Pam/company and stop to their hobby — he’d play some dnd / mtg online but that was it), he’d take over remaining baby prep (nursery, logistics), and   promised to lay out a post-partum care plan for me and baby. He stuck to his word and also worked hard to regain my trust.

Then we had our son and my husband was over the moon in love. He and baby have been inseparable ever since and have an amazing adventure filled life with all the hobbies (baby/toddler swim, gym, soccer, co-op, and a great local parent community). After our kiddo was born Pam lost interest in my husband anyway (she doesn’t like kids) and shortly thereafter cheated on her poly relationship. Kevin and John have actually become good friends since then, but John is straight so I have no worries there.  And as I’ve reflected — I think I also just actually hated Pam — she’s everything I don’t like relying on men for affirmation, no job/life ambition, frivolous and stupid. And apparently (according to Kevin) the feeling was mutual - she thought I was a controlling, stuck up, robotic ivy league workaholic who didn’t appreciate or support my husbands hobbies/quirks. I was also a lot more emotiobal during pregnancy than normal. My husband- upon reflection liked being needed and admired 

We had a lot to work through with us, but two years later we’re in a great spot (I also had a weird shift in hormones post-partum which made my sex drive really really high which for us helped a lot with our relationship). Didn’t want this to be too long, but there were a lot of changes we implemented to get back to a loving place. John feels a lot of purpose in being a dad and supported me as my career has taken off. Sometimes things are still hard (my job is really high stress, toddlers are a lot of work, etc). 

But we’re pretty happy. We spent this morning snuggling in bed with our toddler and dog pretending we were on a boat, making hair dryer sounds, and giving hugs. We live a pretty boring suburban kind of life - but it works for us.

Thanks everyone for the push for me to stand up for what I wanted and needed.

ANSWER: What a great update. I'm so glad your husband honestly reflected and chose you and the baby. Hope it stays that way!



QUESTION: Friend's [34M] Girlfriend [33F] Called Me [36F] A Pick-Me And Now My Friends Want Me To Apologize?

Hi everyone, I need some advice. I (36F) have a group of five friends. We hang out together a lot, playing video games, going to Friday Night Magic, watching movies, D&D, and just generally being nerdy. One of the friend group \[34M\], Bruce, has recently gotten a new girlfriend and we've tried to include her in our get togethers. The girlfriend \[33F\], I'll call her Silver, really seems to hate me, and I'm not sure what to do. I didn't notice it at first, if I'm honest. She came along to our May the 4th/Return of the 5th party/sleepover, one friend Peter \[35M\] helped her make a paladin to join in on a D&D one-shot when she said she wanted to learn, she's come along to FNM multiple times, etc.

However, the other night, while I was having a passionate debate with another friend, Steve \[36M\] about the atrocity that was Hush 2 from DC Comics, Silver absolutely lost it at me. She started yelling about how I was a 'Pick-Me' and how I was mad that she was in the group and that I wanted to sleep with all the boys \[?!?!?!\] but especially Peter. She yelled for like five minutes, while I just sat there like a deer in headlights, because I didn't know what to say? She accused me of making my Warlock sexy in D&D to make the boys want me, that I picked a "Pretty girl card" for my deck in Magic, that I tried to "dress sexy" for May the 4th. \[I wore an Ahsoka sleeveless tank top, no straps, just sleeveless.\]

I tried to tell her I have no interest in sleeping with Bruce, or any of my guy friends, and she just burst into tears. Peter said that maybe I should go, for now, because she was upset, so I did.

Now, on Discord, a bunch of them \[Peter, Bruce, Steve and Michael (33M) have all said I should apologize to her, with only Clark \[35M\] saying I have nothing to apologize for. There's been a lot of talk about 'keeping the peace,' but I'm not sure what I should apologize for? I didn't make a move on anyone. I haven't slept with or tried to sleep with any of my friends.

I'm not sure what I should do, or what I can do. I don't know what to apologize for and I feel like my friends are siding with her.

TL;DR: Friend's girlfriend called me a pick-me and went on a rant about how I'm trying to sleep with everyone and now my friends want me to apologize to her.

ANSWER: Sounds like she has major insecurity issues and sees you as a threat without really knowing you.  I would hold my ground and hopefully your friends come around since it seems like you are a decent person.



QUESTION: UPDATE 6 years later: I (F26) am in love with my best friend (M26) but he thinks a relationship is doomed to fail

Original post can be found  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dzdykr/i_f26_am_in_love_with_my_best_friend_m26_but_he/)

6 years ago I was here lamenting the feelings I caught for my fwb turned best friend (let’s call him Franky).

After the initial pain of rejection, we both agreed to stay best friends. We moved in together with 3 of our other friends, and lived as platonic roommates. We confided in each other all our dating woes, cooked together most nights, and continued having fun nights out. During that time I grew equally close to my other roommates, and had a casual Covid lockdown fling with one who is now one of my closest friends (shocker).

After 3 years of living together, I had finally (mostly) gotten over my feelings for Franky. We were both casually dating other people and in a good place. I had spent many holidays with his extended family as his best friend, and was content knowing that I had a life long friend. Then he had a big health scare. It ended up not being anything major, but at the time put a lot of things into perspective for the both of us.

The night Franky returned from the hospital we had a heart to heart. I cried as I told him how scared I was during the emergency and it ended with us both deciding to try dating seriously.

We moved out of the group house with our friends to a small condo together. It took some time to change from an awkward platonic relationship to a truly romantic one, but we allowed the relationship to take its own time and course.

It’s been 3 years together now. He is currently cradling our shared cat as we plan a romantic weekend get away to New York. He was right, after the one year mark we sat and had a big talk. We talked about what each of us needed to work on to continue the relationship. Instead of it being a relationship death sentence, it lead to both of us getting therapy, making positive changes, and brought us even closer.

We now have such open communication that even after 3 years we have not had a fight. I could not be happier to have my person, as well as the wonderful family that I now get to be a part of.

TLDR; after 3 years of remaining besties, a mortality check pushed us together. Celebrating 3 years of bliss and hopefully more to come :)

ANSWER: Love this for u both. also a good reminder that love doesn’t have an expiry date, it can come back around when both ppl are actually ready.



QUESTION: My (21f) bf (25m) is going on a week long trip to Italy. How do I not resent him?

So my bf of 2 years along with 7 of his coworkers got invited by his work to go on a one week trip to Italy. Everything is completely paid for. Meals, flights, excursions, they are renting a private yacht, they’re staying on a mansion on the beach. Literally a trip of a lifetime and he didn’t have to pay a dime

When he first told me I was honestly I was anxious because 7 months ago he had previously did something to break my trust and we were trying to build back. Come about a week away from his trip to Italy I found out that he had an option to bring a +1, expenses all completely paid for as well. literally all their other guys who were going invited their gf/wife. I was the only one left out.

That completely changed how I felt. It wasn’t just a work trip anymore. It felt very personal and left me wondering why he didn’t want to invite me while all the other men had no problem bringing girlfriend along?

When I brought it up he said “he didn’t know it would mean that much to me” and he views it as a “networking and making connections trip and doesn’t want to have to worry about keeping me entertained while he is busy networking and building connections”. Or something along those lines.

He told me I would basically just be sitting in our room the whole time which at least id be sitting in our room in a huge mansion on the beach and private yacht getting fed pasta every night. Instead I’m just sitting at the house.

I feel so hurt and excluded and now he is living his life across the world with him and a bunch of other happy couples while I’m at home trying not to spiral.

I honestly feel a lot of resentment building. He knew I was anxious of him going because of him previously breaking my trust and he knew he had the option to invite me but didn’t. He said he “never considered how id feel and was thinking of it from a different perspective.” Outside of him breaking my trust we have an incredible relationship. We never fight, he pays for my all school/bills, anything I want. Most importantly he is my best friend. And I don’t want to destroy what we have.

My question is am I being over emotional or is this a real red flag? How do I process this and not let it turn into long term resentment?

TL;DR: My bf of two years is going on a two week work trip to Italy along with 7 of his coworkers. All of who brought their gf/wife. I was the only one left out. Now I feel hurt, excluded, and unsure how not to resent him

ANSWER: Come on. He had the option to bring you and chose to spend the week in Italy without even asking you. That’s not someone who wants to spend time with you. Without knowing the details of breaking trust it sounds like Simone who wants to spend his vacation with another woman or at least keep his options open.



QUESTION: Dad (60m) is giving all his money to a 21-year-old he met while driving Uber. I’m at a loss.



My dad (60m) met a 21-year-old while driving for Uber and now I’m watching what looks like a slow-motion trainwreck.

She told him she was homeless, so he started paying for her hotel, got her a job, bought her a car, and in total has given her around $20k… in just two months. The worst part? He doesn’t have that kind of money. He’s borrowed some from me under false pretenses (which I now know went straight to her), and his credit score is in the 300s.

People have tried to warn him. Her friend called him saying she’s still with her ex and using him. Her ex’s mom said the same thing. Every time, she tells my dad they’re just jealous or dislike her.

It’s beyond surreal. He looks like Danny DeVito (no offense to the man), has nothing in savings, and yet thinks this 21-year-old is with him for love. They’ve known each other two months and he already tattooed her name on him. He’s even had the police recover the car he bought her multiple times—until the last time, when she got him to sign it over to her officially.

He swears she never asks for anything, but somehow he’s hemorrhaged $20k since meeting her. I don’t know how to make him see it. I’m torn between trying to intervene or stepping back until he crashes and then helping pick up the pieces… but it’s getting worse fast.

TL;DR: my dad gave 20k to a girl he met in 2 months and thinks she loves him, idk how to get him to realize she's 99% likely using him

ANSWER: Sometimes there's just nothing you can do. Don't give him your money, but on some level the attention this woman is giving him is worth the money to him.



QUESTION: My husband (33M) just asked me to quit my hobby and say goodbye to my hobby friends. I really don't want to say yes to that. What should I do?

Deleted

ANSWER: Are you currently being actively treated for your depression? That’s the root of the problems here. I don’t know if your husband is making your mental state worse, but I have a strong suspicion that your dynamic is. 

But no, don’t let your husband isolate you from the only social outlet you have left. Isolation will make you feel even worse.



QUESTION: [Update] I [27F] don’t know how to deal with insecurities from dating bf [28M] who is much more attractive (7 years later)

Ok, a brief, mostly sad update. Previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bbvhkg/i_27f_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_insecurities/)

We got engaged a year ago, which felt like one of the best days of my life. The universe decided no, and earlier this year I found out my fiance cheated on me in the first months of our relationship and slept with his ex model fling a few times even though he had denied there was anything other than friendship between them. Found out because she still shares mutual friends with him and is in the same field, we were all at an event and she made a snide comment about it after a friend heard about our engagement and congratulated me. 

I can't really put into words how betrayed I felt, our entire relationship built on lies and years of insecurity being validated after I finally put them to rest. We tried working through it, but I decided to break things off because I don't think I'll ever be able to trust him again. He made sounds about how it was an early mistake and that I'd be throwing away 5 years of our relationship, but tbh I felt like they never became a thing because she wasn't interested in more, not him. So yeah, I wish I could say all of the "but he picked you" comments were correct, but clearly it was too good to be true.

\\tl;dr\\ Starting over at 34 after finding out my fiance actually did cheat on me with his ex fling at the beginning of our relationship

ANSWER: > So yeah, I wish I could say all of the "but he picked you" comments were correct, but clearly it was too good to be true.

Just want to mention that him cheating has absolutely nothing to do with him being "more attractive" than you or even his ex being "more attractive" than you. Men cheat on beautiful women all the time, often with less attractive women and often when they themselves are unattractive.

Cheating is a character flaw. He would likely have cheated on the model too if they'd gotten together for real and will probably cheat on his next partner. I hope in all this you don't internalize that you were right to think he was too good-looking for you because that's absolutely not the problem.



QUESTION: (UPDATE) How do I (47M) tell my boyfriend (35M) that I'm a virgin?

Original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Rrnwj7gcmp

Hey everyone. I'm really greatful for all the advice and support I got on my original post. I posted another updates on the comments of the original.

Summary, I (47M) have been with my boyfriend (35M) for a little under a year. He wants to get physical, and I haven't told him that I've never had sex, because of my history of abuse. After getting advice in the comments, I ended up writing him a letter explaining that I'm a virgin, and touching on some details of my abuse.

I left the letter on the nightstand before I left for work. (My boyfriend works from home) when I got home, his daughter (2F) ran up to me for a hug like she always does. I scooped her up in a hug, and pretended to eat her little fingers.

We had dinner and put her to bed like usual, then my boyfriend asked me to sit on the couch. My stomach tied up in knots, and part of me just wanted to run out the front door.

I have to admit, you were all right. He immediately held my hand and told me he's not disappointed at all. He asked me a bit about my past and the abuse I suffered from my mother. I don't feel comfortable going into detail here, but I barely scratched the surface and I ended up crying in his arms. I never want to be without those arms in my life. His hands rubbing my back, resting my head on his chest to listen to his heartbeat, the smell of his cologne. It's the safest I've ever felt in my entire life.

Once I calmed down, we started looking for therapists near me, then the night went on like normal. Watching our favorite shows while cuddling on the couch, doomscrolling social media and showing each other funny posts. Then we went to bed.

I feel like a weight has lifted off my shoulders. I don't have to hide this about myself anymore. I don't have to live with the fear of my amazing boyfriend seeing me as a lesser man. I won't lie, I'm still anxious about not being able to satisfy him in bed, but we'll work on it together.

I have a therapy appointment for later this month. So things are going good!

Tl;Dr, I wrote my boyfriend a letter, we talked, and now I'm gonna go to therapy.

ANSWER: This literally made me tear up. I’m so glad you found someone who is empathetic and very understanding of your situation. Dealing with trauma in your past, does not invalidate you! You are more than just a body. You’re a living human being, who has gone through so much and deserves the world! Thank you for sharing this, and I’m glad to hear you will be going to therapy.

QUESTION: Should I [F30] warn my coworker [M24] that he is alienating himself socially?

I [F30] work in a project-based profession. The projects take anywhere from six months to several years and you’re typically working with the same small group for the entire duration. 

As a natural consequence of working closely with the same few people, friendships usually form, and we’ll all take lunch together sometimes or go for drinks after work, that kind of thing. 

We have an especially copacetic group on my current project. We’ve been working together six months and we go out socially, we talk and joke around during the day. We’re not “friends” but it’s a tight knit group as coworkers go. 

We have one coworker [M24] who is alienating himself from the group and I feel awful because he doesn’t seem to be aware of it. 

He’s losing the good faith and camaraderie of everyone in the office and he doesn’t seem to understand why it’s happening. I can see that it’s upsetting to him and it’s unpleasant for too. 

That being said, I don’t know him well at all, and I feel uncomfortable approaching him about the issue. He’s an overall nice guy and has some excellent qualities but they’re overshadowed by his tone deaf conduct. 

The result is the entire team is spending less time together because we wouldn’t host an event with everyone except him, but most people also can’t stand to be around him more than they have to. 

Should I say something to him and if so, what should I say? 


His behaviors include but aren’t limited to:


—Acts like he’s the most experienced despite being one of the least; constantly interrupts or gives unsolicited advice to other specialties.


—Minimizes coworkers’ complaints; e.g., when someone said “the client keeps calling me on weekends,” he replied “maybe work harder so they won’t need to.”
	

—Gets angry if anyone uses a nickname version of his (very common) name, even from people who barely know him.


—Went to a bar with us and other teams then spent the whole night lecturing everyone about how he doesn’t drink because he’s healthier and has more willpower.


—Proudly and conspicuously tattled on coworkers for bending the dress code when no clients were around, leading to a companywide memo.



TL;DR: Younger coworker keeps alienating our tight-knit team with tone-deaf behavior (know-it-all, minimizes complaints, lectures at socials, tattles). He seems unaware. Should I say something?

ANSWER: The only thing I could see doing is questioning his inappropriate behavior in the moment. Addressing his interrupting- making sure the person who was interrupted gets to finish their thought, questioning if he thinks an unhelpful suggestion is actually helpful etc

Calling out behavior that shouldn't be happening may make him see that it's unpleasant, or at least give everyone else the license to also call out his inappropriateness.



QUESTION: I [29F] have lost attraction to my [27NB] disabled partner and I'm at a loss for what to do.

My partner and I met and started dating 6 years ago. When we first met they didnt identify as non-binary, and we started our relationship as a lesbian relationship. I am a lesbian and I am not attracted to men. I have tried, many times, it just does not happen for me and I cannot force it. That being said they were the love of my life. We fell very very in love and I have never experienced the acceptance they showed me. The love they showed me was magic and I look back with very strong fondness at that time of my life.

They started to transition in earnest 3 years ago. They were very hesitant to do so initially. They knew I'm a lesbian and was not attracted to men. And they didnt want to transition for that reason. I encouraged them to do it wholeheartedly, because being trans is something you do for yourself, not for anyone else. I assured them that I wasn't considering leaving them over that,  and that it was men i wasnt attracted to not non-binary people. I told them that they had to do it for themselves. That it was crucial, even. And they did, they've been on T for quite a while and are much more masculine and in general pass as a man. They're non-binary, but yeah even so we get read as a straight couple and theyre often referred to as my boyfriend (a term they like). Over time though... its just not the same anymore. I struggle with intimacy with them, I am still deeply attracted to who they are. But their body has changed and their demeanor has changed and it's just no longer within what I'm attracted to. Its starting to hurt me to force myself through it. I want them to be happy but I am unsatisfied in several ways and have had a lot of feelings that I'm not voicing because I do not want to hurt them in any way.

They are also disabled and reliant on me for a lot of things. I rely on them for a lot too, as I am not always in the best mental state. Neither of us has a relationship with our families. We both experienced a lot of abuse growing up so we're mostly by ourselves. I can work and am working but they aren't as they have been going to therapy. They wouldn't have anywhere to go if our relationship ended. They don't have support to fall back on. And their mental health fluctuates and at somewhat routine times they are suicidal. I'm so scared of what would happen if I did decide to leave.

I don't really know what I'm looking for. Someone who has been in this situation I guess? I feel so much guilt and fear. I'm semi-sick today because of how anxious this whole thing is making me. I'm so scared of being alone too. They do provide emotional support to me, which has been very helpful for me at times. I just don't know what to do. I feel like no matter how I look at the situation I'm in the wrong. That I'd be throwing away the life weve built together and that its my fault.

TL;DR my partner transitioned and I'm losing attraction to them but they are disabled and we are very dependent and I have no idea what to do.

ANSWER: This is pretty common for partners of people who decide to transition. There's no shame or harm in deciding that you are not attracted to their new self (with absolute respect for your partner — I am saying this as a transgender woman!).

You're allowed to feel the way you're feeling. I know it hurts and feels awful and it does not at all reflect how you feel about your partner. But you need to do what is right for you — just like they did for themself (with your blessing).

Edited to add that I'm rooting for you both and wish you peace and light.



QUESTION: My boyfriend (27M) stays over almost every day but never helps with groceries or bills. How do I(25F) talk to him without sounding rude?



I(25F) need some advice because I feel stuck. My boyfriend(27M) and I have been together for a little over a year. He has his own place, but for the last few months he has been staying at my apartment almost every day. Sometimes he goes home only to pick up clothes or do some chores then he comes right back.

I love having him around. I really do. The problem is that my expenses have quietly doubled and I did not notice it at first. Groceries go way faster. The water and electricity bill are higher. I am the one cooking most nights because he is already here when I get home. He never does it on purpose, but he has slipped into the routine of treating my place like our place without the responsibilities that come with that.

Last week I realized I spent more on groceries than I usually do in an entire month. My rent and bills are manageable when it is just me, but not when I am basically hosting someone full time. I do not want to resent him, but I am already starting to feel irritated when I see the fridge emptying twice as fast.

The hard part is that he is not a bad person. If I asked directly, he would probably help. But I do not want to sound like I am charging him for staying with me. I also do not want him to think I am keeping score. I just want things to feel fair because right now it feels one sided.

How do I bring this up without making him feel attacked or unwelcome? Do I ask for a set amount each month? Do I tell him we should split groceries on the days he stays? I honestly do not know how to word it in a way that does not feel awkward.

I care about him a lot. I just want to find a healthy way to talk about this before it becomes a bigger problem. What is the best way to have this conversation?

TLDR: Boyfriend (27M) stays at my place almost every day and my expenses have increased a lot. He does not help with groceries or bills because we never talked about it. I (25F) want to ask him to contribute but I do not know how to bring it up without sounding rude or making him feel unwelcome.

ANSWER: If he is already there when you get home, why are YOU the one that has to cook? He could at least pull his weight by preparing meals for you if he is already there when you get home from work, like a decent partner would, even if you are paying for the food. I’d be pissed if I got home from work to find my partner had let themselves in, was using my water/power, eating me out of house and home, and still expected me to cook for them while not contributing anything financially or otherwise.

Do you want to live with him full-time? If so, it’s definitely time to have that conversation as he’s making himself very comfortable. Let him know that you care about him and enjoy his company, but if you are going to continue the relationship and build a future together, you need to have a conversation about splitting costs, division of labour and living arrangements. Show him copies of your bills before and after he started spending all his time at your place, and how much you are having to spend on food, and ask him to help you with the costs, because the increases are due to his presence. If you do want to live together, tell him that whatever you both will save in rent could be put towards the shared expenses.

If he is not willing to chip in, then you may want to reconsider this relationship, or at least start spending more time at his place so he can wear some costs. Why is he at your place so much? Do you live alone, and he has roommates or lives with family? Right now, he’s treating you like a free hotel with catering. What exactly is he contributing? He’s living his best life and probably saving himself a fortune by never being at his place or having to buy his own food. I’m guessing you also get stuck with cleaning up after him too?



QUESTION: My (36M) bf has made 0 friends or maintained 0 friendships since high school. I'm (31F) his only "friend" and it's wearing me down. What should I do?

As the title suggests, my boyfriend doesn't have any friends and relies on me for all social contact. He can also be really moody which makes it hard for me to know how I can help or respond to this.

For example, yesterday morning I got up for work. He was still asleep and I didn't want to wake him. I went out into the kitchen to start boiling the kettle and when I came back into the room his eyes were open and he was looking away from me and frowning. I smiled and said "oh! good morning! How did you sleep?" And he said "fine yeah" and still wouldn't look at me. I could already sense something was wrong and asked "is something wrong?" He said "why didn't you say good morning to me when you got up?"

I explained that I had thought he was asleep, and of course I would have said good morning if I knew he was awake but didn't want to wake him. He was angry and wouldn't speak to me, saying he couldn't believe I had ignored him when I got up. This turned into an argument and eventually I left to go for a morning walk.



I understand this is a really micro-level interaction, but it happens a lot and I'm getting so tired of this. The moodiness really gets to me. He also won't see a therapist even though he's been saying for almost a year that he will at some point. I see a therapist monthly and try really hard to keep on top of myself and my own emotions etc.



He doesn't have any friends, I mean actually zero friends. He never has had any friends since high school and this puts enormous pressure on me to be everything in his life (I'm 31, he's 36). And I try hard to keep my own friendships going, but it's gotten so hard since I started dating him 3 years ago. Every time I say I'm going out to see friends, he gets moody and gives the same reaction as above - he goes quiet, won't look at me and then says nothing is wrong, but then later on will blow up and say he doesn't understand why I'm seeing xyz, why I feel the need to go out etc. But equally when I ask him to join me, he either says no or goes further and asks why I don't just stay home or do something with him. Then whenever I try to broach the subject with him, he becomes incredibly moody or angry/sad.

I feel like I'm you crazy and I can't take it anymore. I'm feeling so isolated and just...sad. I don't know what to do. I want to leave but every time I say so he gets angry, then cries, then I end up deciding to stay. Meanwhile every time I do, he doesn't change anything and just continues with the moody behaviour. I don't want to be someone else's entire social life, whilst also missing out on my own social opportunities. But I'm scared of losing all the really good things about our relationship, and there are lots of them. I just can't imagine staying with him and getting married or having a kid (he really wants kids whereas I'm more on the fence) - I'd just rather be alone even though I know it'd be hard. Am I crazy? Help?

  
TL;DR I'm feeling responsible for my partner's emotions and entire social life, given he has no social circle and hasn't made any friends or maintained any friendships for the past 17 years. I have my own friends and social circles but am feeling like he doesn't want me to have friends. I don't know whether to leave or if I should  keep trying to work on the relationship. Any advice on what I can do?

ANSWER: There's a reason why he doesn't have any friends and it looks like you're finally seeing it.


Just because you've had a few good moments with him doesn't mean you have to stay with him forever.



QUESTION: My (29) boyfriend (30) is deeply enmeshed with his  parents (70 F, 72 M) and he’s an only child. It’s very difficult for me.

I (29F) am in a year relationship with someone (30M) who is very enmeshed with his narcissistic parents (70F, 72M). Our relationship is wonderful,  but it has been absolute hell with his parents, to the point I’ve had to hold boundaries and have gone no contact with his parents. He feels he can’t do this. He often says “they’re all I have” because he’s an only child. 

He’s an only child and I’m his first really serious relationship where we live together, are planning a future, and we’re serious about getting married one day. 

It’s like his parents have always hated me for this and have seen me as taking their son from them. 

His parents financially abuse, verbally abuse, and heavily manipulate my partner… he’s basically like their servant. 

They have made a series of poor financial decisions; overspending, luxury trips, clothes, spending over their means, expensive housing they can’t afford, etc…. They always tell us “we deserve to enjoy life”….. 

They’re in a really bad spot now financially in their 70s and it’s really hard for my partner. His parents are desperate and basically in survival mode now. They’re guilt tripping him and being straight nasty about it all… basically telling him it’s his fault and guilt tripping him constantly to do things for them, financially support them, etc. 

My partner already gave up the house he owns so they can live there for low cost, and I just feel they will always come first. We now pay $3200 in rent together, and while we can afford it, we keep having to make ourselves uncomfortable for his parents, or they throw a tantrum. We have a lot of financial goals we had to adjust now to accommodate for his parent’s poor life decisions. 

It’s directly impacting me now, sometimes I feel it’s time to leave. His parents will always have a hold on our relationship as long as they’re alive and it’s just going to get worse as they age. 

He’s starting to see how his parents are the more he interacts with my healthy family dynamic, and his parents resentment toward me has grown to the point I’ve had to cut them out of my life….. they try to put a wedge between us…..however, I know they’ll always impact our relationship as they are his parents even if I have no contact. Also….his programming runs deep of course over many years. 

Any advice please?

TL;DR: my boyfriend’s parents are very difficult and use him for everything, but do not treat him or me well to the point I’ve cut them off completely. I feel it will never get better.

ANSWER: >(29F) am in a year relationship  
It’s been absolute hell,  
are planning a future, and we’re serious about getting married one day.

I cannot understand why you are planning a future with someone with whom it has been hell with and you've been dating for only a year.



QUESTION: My girlfriend (19F) cancelled my Thanksgiving flight during an argument, and now I’m unsure how to move forward. I’m (21M).

My girlfriend’s mother bought plane tickets for both of us to visit her family in Virginia for Thanksgiving. This would’ve been my first time meeting them, and I was genuinely excited.

A few days after the tickets were booked, my girlfriend and I had a disagreement about something related to her sorority process. She left my apartment upset and we didn’t speak for several hours. We made up the next day, but the following morning she told me she had cancelled my flight during the argument.

She didn’t pay for the ticket herself, and her family already knew I was supposed to come. She still hasn’t talked to her mom or anyone about what happened, so I don’t know if I’m still expected to come or if her family plans to rebook anything. I don’t want to pressure anyone or make assumptions, but the situation left me confused and disappointed.

I’m trying to approach this maturely, but I’m not sure how to communicate my feelings to her or how to move forward when the plans changed so suddenly.

How should I handle this conversation with her, and should I still go if the family decides to rebook the ticket?

TL;DR: My girlfriend cancelled my Thanksgiving flight that her mom bought during an argument, hasn’t talked to her family about it yet, and now I’m unsure how to move forward or whether I should still go.

ANSWER: Maybe next year. They won't be able to rebook for the same cost now, and honestly I would not want to meet her entire family with this hanging over your head.



QUESTION: 43/F Married 13 years. 46/M Husband betrayed me in multiple ways. I’m trying to figure out if people like him actually change or if I should walk.

Tl;dr
My husband lies to avoid conflict. How do I trust him to keep going thru this betrayal torture?

I’m using a throwaway because the details are embarrassing and honestly I don’t want anyone in my life connecting this to me.

My husband and I have been together 15 years, married 13. We have a 9-year-old son. Until recently, I thought we were solid. Not perfect, but solid. Turns out the foundation was rotting under my feet.

Here are the facts, and I’m trying to be fair about my part too. I want real feedback from people who have gone through things like this.

1. The strip club incident.

About six weeks ago, we went to a strip club together after sexy talk at dinner for his birthday. I’d never done anything like that with a partner, but he’s been venting about not frequent enough sex for a couple years so I thought this might spice it up and give us content to fantasize to after. We had a blast the first night though my feelings were a little hurt when he got too into her. He apologized and swore he’d stay sober and keep me emotionally safe next time. The next week, he went way over the line. The stripper touched him, he got “too aggressive,” and he orgasmed during a lap dance. This shattered me. He had just promised me emotional safety the week before. I felt stupid for trusting him.

2. His past and what he downplayed.

He worked in the club scene before we met. Always claimed it was “I worked in the office, just had a few dozen dances, nothing crazy.” Now I find out he’d been sucking strippers’ breasts and doing a lot more than he ever admitted. He has since estimated 50-100 dances over his lifetime when pressed. I’m sure that’s downplaying it too. I didn’t marry a saint, but I did expect the truth vs a picture of an innocent kid. He hid the real story for years. Yes I now know how naive this was of me. But he reassured me of the things that go on at the club when I asked before we went and I felt I’d be safe and he’d just be watching. 

3. The money lies.

Twice he pulled money from a line of credit behind my back. The first time was 2022–2023 which almost led to us divorcing due to the risk, the amount, and the way he wouldn’t take ownership and said he was just “leaning into his business”. He promised he’d never do it again. Then he did it this year—$40k—for a sponsorship he couldn’t afford. Hid that too. Being in finance, I’m held to a high fiduciary standard, so it hits extra hard. 

4. The porn and social media.

Hours a day. While I was drowning in work and parenting. He wasn’t cheating physically, but he was checked out. He deleted a few text messages with a woman he worked with (non-romantic from what he says, but hiding anything at this point hits hard). He has given multiple excuses. 

5. The unnecessary lies.

This one killed me. Our son mentioned a conversation with us all together cuddling in bed about a conversation he had with his dad about my husband’s 4-5 ex-girlfriends. My husband instantly denied ever having the conversation gaslighting my son in the moment. Even when our kid said it happened last week. Was proud my kid held his ground and said “Dad you did say this.” It was such a low-stakes thing to lie about, and he still did it. I confronted him. He doubled down. When cornered, he backpedaled with “I didn’t think it was significant.”

6. Emotional stuff.

He often says he “doesn’t lie,” even when caught. His crying performative. Voice shakes, no tears. It’s hard to explain, but my gut screams he’s faking empathy instead of feeling it. He gets defensive instead of owning his choices. And when he does “own” something, it feels like he’s reading from a script.


Where I’m culpable:

I’m intense. I’m direct. I have a big career and a strong personality. I’m sure that has been intimidating for him. I’ve also been overwhelmed with work, parenting, and philanthropy. That said—none of this justifies lying or betraying someone.


Where I’m innocent:

I didn’t betray him. I didn’t lie. I didn’t do anything that required secrecy or cleanup. My “crime” is being successful and busy. His is breaking trust in every direction.


Therapy:

We’ve been in a therapy marathon for weeks. He journals now because his therapist told him to, not because he chose to. He says he wants to change, but his actions come in short spurts and fall apart fast. He has admitted he doesn’t know know how to show me empathy even after seeing all this pain. That was gutting.


My question:

Do people like this actually change?
Has anyone stayed and seen their partner do a full 180?
Or is this one of those “you already have your answer” situations?

I’ve read about people who are compulsive liars, people who can’t tolerate shame, people who crumble when confronted with their own behavior. I don’t want to raise my son in a home where his dad lies over small things and big things. But I also don’t want to blow up his world if there’s a real chance my husband can actually change.

If you’ve been the betrayed spouse or the betrayer who actually changed, I’d appreciate hearing your experience. What signs were real? What was fake progress? What should I be watching for?

I’m exhausted. I’m hurt. I don’t want to waste another year waiting for a miracle that won’t come.

Stay or go?
What do people like him actually do long-term?

ANSWER: Are you tired yet? I am just reading it. This dude lies at every single opportunity, how can you trust him about anything at all? And if you can't trust him, what's the point? Cut the weight and feel free and happier.



QUESTION: My husband (34M) has started talking down about my (27F) exercise habits, not sure how to approach the conversation

We've been together for 4 years and married almost a year. I was diagnosed with PCOS at 20 and spent my early 20s learning how to manage it. I take medication to manage insulin resistance and I do some form of exercise 5/6 days a week. Usually walking a mile, around 45mins/1 hour on my exercise bike, and I got really into squats this summer so they have been added in. I do the stairmaster when I'm able to physically go to the gym. 

When we got together I had dropped around 80 pounds and was below my original goal weight. He was always very complimentary of this, saying it was impressive that I was able to stick with it and get the results I wanted. I easily maintained my weight the entire time we were dating, it does take time out of my day but I almost always got it done while he was at work so we could hang out. We tried to walk the mile together but he almost never felt like it and I preferred to get it out of the way earlier into the day anyway. My husband isn't massively overweight but he is definitely insecure about his weight, I think he looks great and am happy to support him wherever he's at. 

Since we've married and moved in together he has slowly become less approving of my working out. It didn't happen at first but now it's like he views my very mild exercise as "excessive" and also done incorrectly apparently. He tells me I should do the bike for "15 minutes max, anything past that is not helping you", that my mile walk that takes me 20/30 minutes is "too long, you don't need that much", and finally to me proudly telling him how many squats I did was "You'll need to show me how you're doing it because I know you're definitely doing it wrong" (not even a "great job", also someone taught me years ago but he "doesn't believe it"). 

I've been getting annoyed about this new behavior but trying to push it aside for some reason. I finally got frustrated a few days ago because I was getting dressed to take my walk and he got very upset with me. Pouted and said "You don't need to do that, why don't you want to spend time with me?" We spend almost all of our free time together!!! Plus no one told him he couldn't walk with me, I just knew he was going to have an issue with it. 

I've literally been gaining weight and his criticism is making it hard for me to stay motivated. I've always been so proud of getting on top of my health and I've felt so much better, but lately it feels like punishment. I'm not sure how to approach him, I think he feels unhappy with his body and habits and is pushing these things to me. I want to be kind but I also want to defend myself. My quality of life was so much worse before and I feel hurt and annoyed that it seems he would prefer I go back to that so it doesn't challenge him at all. 

Tl;dr my husband suddenly dislikes my exercise habits and talks about how unnecessary or wrong I'm doing everything. I think it's unhappiness in himself and I want to be respectful to him, but he's not being very respectful to me so I'm not sure how to approach this chat.

ANSWER: My question is why are you pushing this to the side? This should be immediately addressed because he is getting the signal that this is okay. Your exercise habits predate him and are not for him to control. Have the discussion, he needs to stop.



QUESTION: Friend keeps messaging me  20–50 times a week and I don’t know how to handle it

TL;DR - Old friend messages me constantly despite my repeated attempts at boundaries. How do i stop this without being cruel? 

\_\_

Hi all,

  
I (29F) have an old friend who I’m not very close with anymore (39M). We worked together for about a year when I was 18. We don’t hang out, I don’t really think about him day-to-day, and I usually reply maybe once every few weeks. But he sends me constant messages - mostly Facebook reels - literally every day. Sometimes it’s 10 a day, and recently I opened Messenger and saw 54 unread messages from him.

I haven’t replied in about 3 weeks. He keeps messaging anyway, and today he sent things like:  
“I don’t think you like me anymore haha you talk to me like once a month.”

He’s also asked if he could visit me while he’s in the area (I didn’t respond), and he keeps pushing past hints that I’m busy or not very active on Messenger.

For context, he has bipolar disorder and can be very intense and emotional. A few years ago when I tried to set boundaries, he told me he cried in the shower because he thought he was “losing me,” which made me feel horrible. I don’t want to hurt him or be cruel, but the constant messaging makes me uncomfortable and I don’t feel close enough to him to manage his emotional reactions.

I don’t want a big confrontation or to send a harsh message - but I also don’t want to reinforce this by replying and starting the cycle again. I've sent a couple of messages over the past year or so just saying 'Hey man, im not on facebook much" or other things along those lines. He just doesnt take the hint to stop messaging. Its relentless. 

What’s the healthiest way to handle this?

  
Is it OK to just stop engaging at all? Should I send a short boundaries message? Mute him? Block him?

  
If you’ve dealt with something similar, what worked for you?

ANSWER: So dude has been overly attached to you since you were 18 and he was around 28. Without you encouraging it at any point by hanging out or entertaining himself outside of the workplace. And it's been 10 years and he's still going.

This is actually pretty damn creepy and scary. I agree with the longer comment advising you to get your ducks in order safety wise but I would also download or screenshot as much of your message history as you can in case you need to take the problem to law enforcement. Emphasize the very earliest interactions. The ones where you were 18 and he was nearly 30.

Be safe please!



QUESTION: My HUSBAND Always does STUPID experimental stuffs, how not to get ANGRY?

I am F(27) and my husband is M(28). Married for more than 2 years. My husband is a very clumsy person. He easily gets distracted. He says that he has ADHD, I also think that. But it is getting really stressful for me. He is not that careful with his spending. He tries to be careful, but the things he does ends up costing us more money. Recently, his mac was heating up when he worked on it, he saw from a yt video that suggested a small repair. So, to save money he ordered the kit for himself to fix it on his own. We are immigrants and every penny counts for us. I told him that even if it costs a little more he should go to a professional for these stuffs as he has no prior experience. He said yes i think you are right but ended up doing what he thought initially and damaged a more expensive sensitive part instead of fixing it. Now it might cost us 10-20 times more to repair that. This is just an example he keeps doing things like that and I am always stressed or anxious about him constantly about whatever he does. Even if I show anger because of that he did not listen to me he says that I am nagging and it is not right. If I can't say anything good in these typpa situation I might just stay quiet. His ADHD is increasing my anxiety and stress levels. What can I do to fix his these type of behaviours so that he takes more mature decisions and thinks maturely and logically before doing something. So that I no longer have panick attacks.

 TL;DR My husband is always doing immature things and making immature decisions, I am getting hyper anxious day by day, what should I do?

ANSWER: 1. You're not having panic attacks. That is very different from being frequently angry with a spouse and having anxiety over money.

2. You can't "fix" him.

3. Your husband \may\ have ADHD -- has he actually been diagnosed? -- but "disregarding my partner's concerns" is not a symptom of ADHD. That's just a spouse being a jerk.

So the first thing I'd do is encourage your husband to actually get checked out for a formal diagnosis. If he has a problem that prevents him from being functional in certain ways that are very important to you, medication and teamwork to change how you divvy up tasks (like who is responsible for repairing a broken laptop) are things you can get from counselors who deal with people with these problems. I don't think it's helpful for you (or him) to pathologize all your relationship issues as being caused by a mental health disorder your husband may not even have. If he does, then HE has to do the work here, and YOU have modify your expectations and behaviors so that you find a dynamic that works for you.

As for the rest of it, when you say you're constantly stressed or anxious about what he does, that's a really bad mental state to be in. You can't parent a grown man. What are some practical things you can do to protect yourself from the impact of his impulsive decisions? (e.g. take over managing the household money) How about some emotional things you can do? (e.g. don't clean up his messes, leave the area and go someplace quiet away from him, etc.) 

Does your husband CARE that you are having all these conflicts? And how did you resolve conflict before you got married? Surely this didn't just spring up out of nowhere.



QUESTION: Moved in with my boyfriend (23M) 3 months ago and I’m (22F) drained. Should I move out while he’s gone?

My boyfriend and I moved in together about three months ago, and ever since then I’ve felt completely overwhelmed. Before living together, things were great. But now I’m doing almost all the housework while working fully onsite, and he works hybrid and still barely handles his small chores unless I remind him multiple times. Whenever I bring up how stressed or frustrated I am, he says I’m “attacking” him or blowing things out of proportion. 

Today I rushed out the door late for work and accidentally tipped over my sock drawer, and instead of being understanding, he texted me during lunch pointing it out in a passive aggressive way, even though I silently clean up after his messes every day. It made me realize how imbalanced things have become and how little accountability he takes. We’re going to be apart for a month starting Sunday, and I’m thinking about staying in an Airbnb until he leaves, then going back home when he’s gone and possibly moving out while he’s away so I can think clearly. I still care about him and would give the relationship another chance, but living together has brought out issues that are really draining me. Am I overreacting, or is this a sign we’re incompatible living together?

TL;DR: Since moving in with my boyfriend, I’ve ended up doing almost all the chores while he gets defensive whenever I bring it up. Today was my breaking point, and I’m considering moving out while he’s away for a month. Not sure if it’s dramatic or the right move. What should I do?

ANSWER: Get out now while you still have your fire, because it gets a lot harder to leave once you’ve forgiven him two or three or twenty times. It does not get better, seriously. This is supposed to be the honeymoon period of living together. It’s the best it will ever be, right now.



QUESTION: Bonding with parents feels impossible because I (28M) feel like I have to walk on eggshells.

I (28M) often find myself in this position where bonding with my dad (63M), I might say something conversational and it gets interpreted as me not having a good time.

For example, I come over so we can watch films together over dinner, and let's say we watch a movie and even though I liked the overall film, I might say, 'It was good. It kind of dragged at points but it was a great narrative.'

Somehow that gets translated into him profusely apologizing: "I'm so sorry I made you watch that. I liked it, I just thought you might, but I won't make you watch any more-"

As much as I try telling him that I did like it, he doesn't seem to hear me. It's like one wrong move, and suddenly, it's all over. My mom is pretty similar, but right now, I'm focusing more on my dad.

This has happened across several experiences throughout my life and unfortunately, we're not that close. I want to be closer, but I feel anxious about saying anything around him. Anyone experience anything similar?? How do you get around it??

TL;DR: I want to bond with my dad, but even small comments make him fret and over-apologize. I feel anxious speaking around him and don’t know how to communicate honestly without upsetting him.

ANSWER: How does he react if you just mention what you liked about it? 

One of my colleagues wrote a book that was . . . okay, but not that great. But it did have a really strong sense of place, and when I said that I'd read the book, I pointed that out. He then said he was really happy to hear that, because he'd worked really hard on that, and it turned out that I didn't have to say anything else at all.

It sounds like your dad has some insecurities. Have you seen this show up in other ways, with other people in his life?



QUESTION: I (32f) am being made to choose between my ex con (34m) brother in law or the rest of my in laws by my mother in law (51f)

I really need advice here. Please help! Names in the story have been changed for anonymity.

I'm a 32f and have been married to my husband, Lucas (32m), for almost 7 years. We dated long before that, basically since we were both 18. I was a co-worker with his mom Bella(51f) when my husband and I were still dating, and so we've always been pretty close. My mother in law tends to keep my son(7m) with her over the weekends because she loves him and loves spending time with him doing fun things he'll enjoy. I've been accepted into Lucas's extended family with open arms and feel very welcomed by everyone. They may not always understand me and I may not always understand them, but we try and are always there for each other. 

As a child, my brother in law, Tom (34m), hung out with the sorts of people that got involved with drugs and gang related activity. Lucas was then made to be the responsible one in the family in Tom's place and basically become a mini adult to help raise/care for his cousins and younger brother while his mom and the aunts worked on their careers. It was a turbulent household with an abusive man married to my mother in law, which had a big effect on the kids. Tom would basically do what and go wherever he wanted.

I've been told that Tom was doing drug deals, tried to pretend to be my husband when he'd gotten arrested one time, (thank God a family member was able to set that straight), broke into his mom's house when he wasn't supposed to be there, got shot in a drug deal gone wrong and has stolen someone's car. And those are just the things that I've been told about. There's most likely much more.

After the drug deal gone wrong, Tom was sent to prison for a few years. He got out, and within just a few months, he stole someone's car which broke his parole and was sent back to jail. So now he's been in jail for at least 5 years. (Sorry, I haven't been keeping track of exact dates.) Now he's out of jail again and has been since sometime in July of this year, I think. And that was when the initial issue started. Not with my brother-in-law but with my mother-in-law. 

I believe that Bella truly does love her children, but I also feel like she has a large amount of guilt for how her son's life turned out. I think that she's trying her best to make up for lost time as quickly as possible. However, she's doing it in a way that's making others uncomfortable and is pushing other family members' boundaries. 

Around when my brother-in-law got out of jail, my husband's entire extended family had been planning a trip to a water park together for an Aunt's birthday and everyone was looking forward to it for almost a year. However, Bella tried to insist that we invite Tom, too. Some of my husband's family are in law enforcement and have young children. They were not comfortable with that idea, especially with him so freshly out. My mother-in-law then tried to dig her heels in and say that if he couldn't come then she wouldn't come, and then the aunt that was putting on the entire trip for herself and the family almost canceled the whole thing over the drama! Luckily, my mother-in-law saw reason before we left, Tom didn't come and the trip stayed on. 

Which brings us to the problem that I'm having now: Bella is trying to plan her own Thanksgiving away from the rest of the extended family because Tom isn't invited. And that would be an okay choice for her to make. However, my husband and I are now being made to choose sides. Either we support my mother-in-law and Tom, or we support the boundaries of the rest of the family. I don't really know what to do. Honestly, I don't like Tom. From what I've heard about him, and how I hear him talk to Bella, Lucas and my son (7m), I just don't like him as a person. Even without the crimes he's committed, he's rude and selfish. If he was not related to my husband, I would never be around him. But my mother-in-law is making this extremely personal. She insists that Lucas, my son, me, my other brother in law Dax(22m), Tom, his daughter (14f) and his daughter's mom Angel (??f) all forfeit going to the annual extended family Thanksgiving. 

I don't believe that this is a fair choice, especially for my young son. Usually, at the big extended family Thanksgiving, all of the kids play together all night, watch holiday movies and then write out their Christmas lists to Santa. We all play family games like charades or trivia. All of the adults exchange white elephant slips to know who they're buying for that year. Then all of the adults plan on Black Friday shopping to try and knock out most of the lists. I don't see how making my son sit with a bunch of adults awkwardly all night it's supposed to help anything or show support. 

And did I mention that I have my own family's Thanksgiving to attend? Every year it's a struggle to balance two separate Thanksgivings on the same day but we somehow manage. Now I have all of this added stress to the decision making and need to essentially choose to do three Thanksgivings or upset someone by not attending one of theirs.

I tried to appeal to my mother-in-law to ask if maybe we could get together with Tom on a different day, and tried to explain that the family just needs time to see whether or not he's changed and to rebuild trust with him. That he made a series of poor life decisions and that these are the consequences. I'm not saying that he shouldn't have a Thanksgiving with the family members that want to support him right now, I think that that's very good of Bella to want to do. I just think that she is letting her emotions cloud her judgment and that this could be the start of a rift between the family and unnecessary tension. My son cried today when he heard that we wouldn't be going to his cousin's house this year and it broke my heart. I think I'm leaning toward choosing to go to the extended family's Thanksgiving, now, instead.

How will future holidays go? Christmas? Easter? Birthdays? Anniversaries? Etc etc.

Not to mention that my mother-in-law is lashing out and has essentially said that she doesn't care what me and my son do, but that she expects my husband to attend her Thanksgiving because she would hope that all of her sons would want to spend the holidays with her. So now she's trying to keep my husband with her. How is that fair to my son and I!? I don't know what to do! I have so many past traumas, current mental health issues and people pleasing tendancies that this is really putting a strain on me. My husband is very non confrontational and hates that he's being forced into choosing.

Lucas has already tried to discuss this with her but she still insists on doing it this way. When my husband first told me about her plans, I expressed how upset that I was and how unfair it was for our son and he agreed. But he still wants to support his mom, even if he doesn't have a good relationship with his brother and isn't super close with his mom. He doesn't know what to do, and neither do I. I don't know what Lucas will choose to do.

Please, I'm begging for advice or people's perspectives! I really need help!

Tl;Dr:

My mother in law wants us to choose between her awful son or the extended family Thanksgiving tradition this year since he just got out of jail. Help!

ANSWER: I would choose not to spend my thanksgiving with an asshole or the woman trying to force me to do so. Your husband needs to step up, this is his family to deal with.



QUESTION: Married within a year, and now I’m seeing red flags I ignored before — how do I handle this? (27F/33M)

Hi, this is a long read. Bear with me. Im a 27/F. My husband is 33M and we’ve been married for a year. I’m looking for some advice on how to handle this situation. I feel like I have no one to talk to, and I really need to vent while also getting someone’s perspective.

My husband and I got engaged and married all within a year. Everything happened pretty fast, but we both deeply desired marriage. Now that we’re married, some of the subtle red flags I noticed before are starting to repeat themselves.

My husband is very paranoid. He often assumes I’m cheating or doing something shady when I never have and never would. We attend church, and he gets upset when I put effort into my appearance. He assumes I’m dressing up to seek attention — even though I keep to myself at church and rarely engage in conversation unless I have to.

A few weeks ago, he went on a brief trip. While he was away, I booked a hair appointment. He became upset, saying I must be getting my hair done to entertain another man while he was gone, and created a whole argument about it. The truth is, that was the only available appointment time.

When he returned from his trip, he inspected the entire house, looking for signs that I had company while he was gone. In the past, he has often asked to look through my phone — and I’ve allowed it because I have nothing to hide.

If a man at church looks my way, or if he sees me glance at someone, he interrogates me and asks if I know them or if I’m trying to get attention. He frequently asks about my whereabouts, even though he has my location and I’m always transparent about where I am and what I’m doing.

One particular incident stands out — I was on my way to a church meeting (I serve at church), and I left early because I like to be punctual. He called me and told me to come back, accusing me of leaving early to mingle and potentially meet other men.

These are just a few examples of many similar incidents that have occurred. He says he wants to change and asks me to give him time. I believe he’s genuine in that desire, and he truly does have amazing qualities. Every time he realizes he’s wrong, he apologizes. I understand that change takes time, but when these episodes happen, he becomes a different person — angry and loud. And it honestly scares me. He’s not physically abusive but I’ve become so anxious around him. 

I don’t know if I should wait it out or leave. He plans to seek therapy, but hasn’t yet. He says he can fix the issue himself, he just has to be self aware. I want to give him a chance, but I also know this behavior could get worse once kids are involved. I’m torn and don’t know what to do.

TL;DR: My husband and I married quickly, and now his paranoia and constant accusations of cheating are becoming overwhelming. He says he’ll get therapy, but I’m torn between waiting it out or leaving.

ANSWER: Please leave if he doesn't treat his insecurities- he's being extremely controlling and  isolating you, the first steps towards more physical abuse.



QUESTION: After 4 years together still no proposal. How long do I continue to wait?

I’ve (39F) been with my BF (37M) for four years and we’ve been living together for over two. Before I gave up my apartment and moved into his house, I asked where he saw our relationship going and his timeline for commitment. He said if after a year of living together everything was going well, we’d get engaged. This matched with what I wanted, so I moved in.

A year passed and no proposal. I bring up the conversation we had before I moved in and he said he’s saving up for the ring. Then his friend asked us if we were going to get engaged, and my BF said yes, soon. So, I was reassured we were still on the same page.

Then we get to two years living together, and still no proposal. The type of rings I like are not expensive, and with his salary I know he would have saved up enough by then. Then his brother got engaged after only two years with his GF. I know all relationships have their own timelines, but the news made me reflect. So, I straight up asked my BF why he hadn’t proposed.

At first his excuse was that planning a wedding was such a hassle. This didn’t ring true, so I said I thought he wasn’t being honest. Then he confided some struggles with his mental health and fears that I would grow resentful of ways he couldn’t contribute to the relationship due to them. I was surprised because those things are not deal breakers for me, I’m not upset by them, and I don’t think I’ve ever expressed resentment.

He said he’d thought about returning to therapy to work on things and asked me to give him some time. I agreed, but he’s not forthcoming if/when his appointments are or what he’s working on – which I understand I have no right to know. He’s allowed to keep his therapy private if that’s what’s best for his therapeutic journey. But, I wish I had some insight to know my waiting will be worthwhile.

I don’t question his struggles, but I’m having a hard time believing he’s not just stalling. He’s expressed some reservations about me, mainly that I’m not social enough, especially with his family. I’m a super introvert, but I’ve really tried with his family. I once expressed a worry that his family mistook my shyness for disinterest, but he assured me they understood and liked me, so I don’t know what the problem is.

My other doubt is that he talks about doing things and often doesn’t follow through. Like, he’s been saying he was going to take me on a weekend trip since the first year together, but he’s never done it. During the same time he’s planned and gone on four trips with friends and family. I don’t doubt that he would enjoy a trip with me, he just doesn’t care enough to actually plan it.

Recently, we went to his friend’s wedding, and another of his friends asked if we’re getting engaged, and my BF again said soon. I just don’t believe it anymore. I don’t doubt his love for me. We do a lot of stuff together and he’s physically affectionate. But I can’t ignore this feeling he doesn’t want to marry me and never will. I don’t think he wants to break up, but he also doesn’t want to commit.

I get upset about this every other day and I’m just so tired. I’m nearing forty and just want to know he wants to be my life partner. I feel four years is plenty of time to know someone. I have been open and transparent about who I am and what I have to offer. I don’t know how much longer I can wait around for him to decide to commit.

Do I stick around and see if he ever proposes, or follow my gut and cut my losses?

TLDR: After four years BF has not proposed even after saying multiple times he was planning to. Explanations are weak and I'm questioning if he'll ever do it.

ANSWER: I think it's time you look for your own apartment and move out. He is just stringing you along. Just consider: there is no actual factual reason he can't propose to you - the only valid explanation is that he just doesn't want to. It's heartbreaking that he stole the four years from you that were vital if you wanted to have children - I really hope you don't, because that would make it so much sadder. 

Anyway, he's telling you loud and clear that he is not going to marry you - time to accept that and move on. You will be much happier once you're free from his push/pull mindgames.



QUESTION: Fiancé (31M) threw me (29F) under the bus to our friends


My fiancé and I are thinking about going to this music festival in a few months. We’re planning for it now since tickets go on sale tomorrow. We both really want to go, but money is the issue. Not only are we planning our wedding, but we are going to be renovating soon. As well as I have some debt I keep trying to pay off. I can’t pay it off since things like this keep coming up and we don’t wanna miss out. 

Anyways, today in our group chat with our 4 other best friends (who know about my money struggles and us needing to save) we were chatting about renting an RV vs tent camping and I mentioned that I wanted to do whatever was cheapest since we’re a little tight on cash right now. I also mentioned that if that wasn’t an issue, we would do the RV in a heartbeat and I wanted to compare costs. I will add; I’ve never been the friend to complain about costs. In fact, I’ve always been really down and that’s how I’ve found myself in some hot water with debt. I’m only being “stingy” because I haven’t been able to pay it off and we’re planning a wedding and such 

My fiancé and I were texting separately about all of this and he even agreed with me- even stating this wasn’t even worth it, he’d rather go on a vacation, he doesn’t mind tent camping and we could bring all our own stuff etc. We ended up saying that we would chat more about it later when he got home so we were on the same page. BTW the cost difference with tent camping vs RV would be 400-500$ total. 

Our group chat kept popping off about the RV and I sent a text saying “Fiancé and I are going to chat more about it tonight and get back to you guys”. My fiancé then messaged me separately saying “stop telling them about money problems, you’re making us sound poor”. I apologized and said I wouldn’t mention it again. He then proceeds to text in our group chat saying “oh yeah by the way we’re for sure doing the RV, that makes the most sense” and just completely threw me under the bus. 

I got super pissed at him because wtf we literally were just chatting about it and he acted like he would have my back. I totally felt like I was the bad guy/the only one not 100% about the RV. It especially sucked because everyone else is like “what why wouldn’t we do the RV?” And are all gung ho about it. He told me that he didn’t want our girl best friend thinking we didn’t want to do it and he sensed she was upset we were on the fence about the RV so he said that… I literally was like so you’re putting her potential feelings over my feelings? I am the one struggling to pay off my debt and trying to be smart. 

I’m so annoyed and frustrated with him. How do I approach this with him? 

Tl;dr my fiancé threw me under the bus with our friends

ANSWER: The way he talks to you is problematic. He can convey his thoughts and feelings without cussing at you.



QUESTION: How can you really start to accept that people won't change? (Relationship with ADHD)

The relationship between me (28F) and my boyfriend (31M) is pretty decent overall. Our communication is good for the most part, we can be very honest with each other, we respect each other and act usually very supportive of the other. We've been together for 5 years now.

One thing I cannot get behind though is the fact that he has some traits and qualities I cannot change and which will, very likely, never change. Most of our arguments are about the same topics. Often times it's about his lacking degree of emotional regulation towards inconveniences or stress in general. He frequently uses me as an 'emotional dumpster' when he wants to vent about the world and whatever happened to him that upset him (note: not all of these things are really overblown and unreasonable as my wording might make it seem). Recently this happens a lot more frequently and it's exhausting.

He's already in therapy because of depression and ADHD (already medicated). I know that emotional regulation is especially hard for people with ADHD and this is what makes this so incredibly frustrating. I'm at a point where I don't wanna hear about all these same things anymore that bother him. He's just venting about it at me, not changing anything (e.g. talk to the person at work that actually upset him) or trying to work with his emotions to not always react this hard (which again, might not even be possible). To add some extra salt to the wound: He formed a new friendship with another person at work which is all fun and giggles all the time. So basically, he comes home, tells me how much fun he's had with this person and what cool stuff they've been doing this day, and then starts to vent. It feels like I'm being served all the negativity he's built up over the day, and this person is experiencing all the fluffy joy he has to offer instead (he's a very fun and goofy guy when he's not venting and marinating in his own misery). Yes, it's honestly the first time in perhaps 10+ years I felt some sort of jealousy.

I've voiced my wish for not being used as his private therapist all the time many, maaany times. He always apologizes and wants to better himself. Never does. We also get into other discussions about the same stuff over and over again, too. Also mostly related to his ADHD (cleaning, putting some effort into planning special days like anniversaries). In general, he's apologizing all the time and I believe him but at this point I can almost predict the words that come out of his mouth every time we're having this conversation.

A part of me feels like 'well, it's the ADHD, suck it up. If you like him, YOU have to find a way to deal with all this, not the other way round'. Another part, that has a lot of old childhood trauma mixed into this emotional response, screams at me that I cannot accept my boundaries not being heard. I don't want to go into details of my backstory, let's just summarize that I've had my fair share of therapy to work through this independently. I feel stable and pretty safe in that regard. But these two backgrounds—one person with ADHD, one with former PTSD—feel like a nightmare to mix.

Is anyone out there, perhaps with the same combination in their relationship, who can perhaps offer some advice? How can I not get triggered by making the experience of 'nothing will ever change, just swallow your anger and adjust your needs' over and over? It goes heavily against what I learned back then in therapy. All of this is really sucking the light out of our relationship. The fun times get less and less, all this 'drama' is leaving me so exhausted and depressed. One part of me is slowly giving up, since it all seems so hopeless to me. Please, offer some advice.

TL;DR: ADHD boyfriend (in therapy & medicated) constantly uses me as emotional dumpster + we have the same arguments over and over to no avail. Therefore getting depressed myself since I feel like I just cannot expect any change at all + this heavily triggers some of my former trauma memories of helplessness.

Edit: Adjusted TL;DR

ANSWER: By ending the relationship. I have severe ADHD and it's my job to manage/regulate my emotions and symptoms. I don't get a pass to shit on people who love me.



QUESTION: I (26F) need a reality check before I move cross country with my ex (29F).

Five years ago, I was married to a man while discovering my queer identity. He was supportive simply because he was a horny man and loved to imagine it, and encouraged me to explore. That is when I met Zoe through a queer dating app.

During the pandemic, our connection developed quickly and deeply. We had virtual cooking nights, painted together, planned creative dates, and all from opposite coasts. By the end of the year, we each separated our partners as we each wanted to do for years, and she moved across the country to be with me. For a week, it was magic. Then reality hit.

Despite sharing important values and perspectives, we were wildly different: our personalities, family dynamics, and ways of handling conflict clashed hard. I was going through a divorce and struggling in a conservative town where neither of us felt safe. Fights turned volatile, once even physical as she hit my throat when she was triggered as she thought I called her stupid during an argument. After nine chaotic months, we moved apart but kept talking.

Over the next couple of years, we tried to heal. Therapy helped me and she turned to secretive spiritual communities and meditation programs. That secrecy, along with our fundamental differences, always left me feeling confused, awkward, and divided (granted, I often feel that way as a person anyway).

In recent months, she asked me to be her girlfriend again. Things were calm and steady, though not romantic. No hand holding, no cuddling, separate rooms, but an awkward “dance” through our individual routines near each other each day. We’ve become great friends and roommates, sharing our lives but without intimacy. Still, I hoped our peace meant progress — and I was content as we had a great balance at home, and we each lived as our holistic, sober, celibate selves comfortably around one another.

Then, when prompted as I was in desperate need for clarity, she told me the truth: she doesn’t want a romantic partnership with me. She cares deeply, but she feels fear and sadness for me: for my small support system, my sensitivity as autistic person, my autoimmune conditions, and how we’ve impacted each other over time. It hurt, but I finally had clarity.

Now we are supposed to move to her hometown this spring, as we’ve planned for over a year, to care for her family that needs consistent care. On paper, it makes sense. We coexist well as friends and co-parents to our cats. But part of me knows I’d end up feeling alone and resentful while she’s surrounded by family.

I could instead move back to my home coast to be closer to the few family members I’m close with. It would mean living alone for the first time in my adulthood, which terrifies and excites me in equal measure. It feels like a real beginning. It feels like I finally would be able to be in my own orbit rather than someone else’s.

I think I already know the answer, but I can’t help second-guessing myself:

Would it be foolish or selfish to choose independence and move on my own instead of following her to support her, and care for her family?

— 

TL;DR: My partner of five years and I planned to move to her hometown across the country to care for her family in the spring. She let me know that she is not interested in me romantically, but wants to remain as the good friends we are. Do I make the move I promised to make or move for myself for the first time in my adulthood?

ANSWER: > It feels like a real beginning. It feels like I finally would be able to be in my own orbit rather than someone else’s.


This sounds like an opportunity too good to pass up.



QUESTION: My fiance (M29) always eats things I leave for myself (F26)/or takes all of the food snacks


My partner and I have been fighting over food lately (or I've been fighting with him). He is always asking if im gonna finish what's on my plate as I'm eating. Or Ill buy snacks and they're all gone before I can have any. Or last week I had wings for lunch and didn't finish them, he just ate them before I got home from work and didn't feel bad at all. 

It's frustrating. I tried to bring it up today and he tells me I must have a problem with food because it's weird that I'm upset about it and I shouldn't be upset about wings from a week ago. But I'm obviously not upset about that specific thing. I feel like for me, its just like he doesn't respect my boundary which is why I'm upset. 

This feels like a stupid thing to fight over but I just can't stand that I food I want goes missing because I didn't tell him directly "don't eat my leftovers" or "hey save me some caramel bites because I'm gonna want some". 

How do I fix this? I don't want to fight with my partner about food. But now he's in our bedroom and told me to leave him alone. Ugh. 


TLDR - Fiance eats food I want to save for later every time or snacks in hoping to eat and told me I have a food problem because I'm upset about it.

ANSWER: It's not a stupid thing to fight over. You were looking forward to your little treats and he took them from you with zero consideration for your feelings. Partners shouldn't do that to one another.

Talk to him and tell him clearly: my leftovers are off limits to you unless I say you can eat it. You can share my snacks but it's rude to eat an entire bag of something I bought for myself and not immediately replace it. If he had a non romantic roommate he wouldn't be eating all their food without asking; it's the same thing here.



QUESTION: Is my (34F) husband’s (35m) terrible spending habits a deal breaker or is this salvageable?

My husband and I have been together 10+ years, married for 6, and recently I gave birth to our 2 month old baby. When I was pregnant I discovered that he accrued credit card debt among other things. His debt and loans amounted to $40k, he also spent $6k on a road bike and a mountain bike, spent unknown thousands on collectable cards (Pokémon, baseball), and had no personal savings. He makes great money ($150k+) so it’s extra shocking that he spent so much money to not have savings and end up with debt. He also hid it all from me because he was trying to fix it on his own without me finding out. In the past he also gambled some unknown amount and has also lost $14k by investing all his savings in one company’s stock. We had many fights about this and he has expressed remorse and that he is turning a new leaf. We cancelled all his credit cards and are gradually paying off the debt. Is this a deal breaker? Or is this relationship salvageable? 

Here are some additional pros and cons for context: 
Pros:
- we generally enjoy spending time together 
- he contributes and is involved with the family and household 
- he is a good father 

Cons: 
- bad with money 
- no physical intimacy 
- no sexual chemistry 

Tldr- my husband is bad with money and hid his debt from me but said he has changed. Is this relationship salvageable or would most people walk?

ANSWER: Apart from the “list” of pro’s and con’s you failed to mention that you clearly have lost respect for him. Add to that the missing intimacy and missing chemistry - your frustration levels are only going to increase while your tolerance levels for putting up with “bad stuff” will only decrease. Once those lines intersect downwards you’ve crossed a threshold. You might already be there given your post. Even if you salvage his spending (and thats a big iff) how can you salvage no chemistry and a lack of intimacy???  This has “doom” written all over it. Ugh.



QUESTION: I (22M) have a very complicated relationship with my (24F) best friend

I've been pretty much best friends with a girl for over 5 years, and there has always been chemistry and tension between us. We tried dating once but she backed out because of her own stated commitment issues and life circumstances. 

I'm the closest thing she's ever had to a boyfriend and the only guy to ever even take her on a date which is crazy because shes very traditionally attractive and could have any guy. 

We hang out 1-on-1 constantly, travel to motor races together, stay in hotels, and have slept in the same bed platonically many times. She tells me I'm very attractive and a great guy, is very flirty with me, we know everything about each other, her friends and family even say we should date, and when anyone has asked her for reasons why she wouldn't, she said she couldn't think of one. 

She even made a marriage pact with me (her idea) and wants to come to my work Christmas party saying we could joke that we aren't "dating" but getting married in 8 years. She once called me while drunk and said I'm the only guy she's ever felt really cared about her and that I might be the only guy she's actually loved. But whenever I talk to or date other girls, she acts like she doesn't care and just says she knows I'll "find someone," which hurts because I want it to be her. 

The worst part is that she completely deflects and shuts down any time I try to have a serious talk about us. We're also core members of our friend group so I'm scared of ruining things - but the limbo is draining me. How would you recommend I approach this?

TL;DR there's clearly romantic tension between me and my best friend but she shuts down whenever I bring it up. How do I approach this?

ANSWER: Well, since she doesn't want to talk about it, it's time to stop flirting and acting like her BF. She doesn't get GF treatment if she doesn't want to be your GF.

================================================================================

QUESTION: MIL waited until 48 hours before a wedding to tell me my dress ‘didn’t look nice.’ I’m so done.

For some context, I've been married a few years now and never really had a close relationship with my in-laws, especially my MIL (mainly from their side because I put in a lot of effort at the start but it's barely reciprocated, so I stopped trying). She has a cold, not really caring type of personality, and she's the typical boy mom even though she has a daughter. Her personality and the comments shes made over the years are what  makes me hate being around her and she's a huge Karen in public. It mentally and physically drains me when I'm around her.

Recently my husband and I stayed at my their place for a week for his cousin’s wedding (the whole week was exhausting). We live far away, so whenever there’s a family event, we stay with them.

For more context: over the 3 years I’ve been married, my MIL has always commented on my clothing and how I “should” dress — usually old-school styles that aren’t really my taste. I normally ignore it because it’s easier than arguing.

Anyway, months before the wedding I told her I’d be re-wearing a dress I already had. I even showed her photos from the wedding I previously wore it to. She said it was nice and didn’t give any negative feedback.

Fast-forward to the wedding week, on Monday I went to get it altered because it was a bit loose. I even showed MIL the dress again before I dropped it off.

On Thursday evening (the wedding was Saturday), literally two days before the event, when I was going to pick it up, she suddenly asks:

“Do you have any other dress? That one doesn’t look that nice.”

I was stunned. Why wait until now? She had seen the dress MONTHS ago and again earlier in the week. Then she starts offering money for me to go buy another one. I was so annoyed because (1) this was last minute, and (2) I know how long it takes to find proper Desi wedding outfits — you can’t just grab one off the rack.

I had another dress with me, but it wasn’t as formal as the original. Still, I wore the backup because I didn’t want drama on the day of the wedding.

I had a feeling she was worried that somehow our dresses would look similar or I would somehow outshine her.

When I finally saw what she wore to the wedding, it wasn’t even similar to mine. My original dress was a bluish-grey with silver detailing.

Hers was lilac/pinkish-purple with gold and a bit of silver. Completely different color family, vibe, and design.

So now I’m honestly wondering why did she make that comment right before the wedding? Why wait until the last minute when she had multiple opportunities to say something earlier?

Was it jealousy? Was she worried I’d “overshine” her? Or does she just like to criticize me no matter what?

This isn’t the only issue I’ve had with her — she’s made plenty of comments over the years about my clothing, how I do housework, etc. It’s always criticism, never once has she been supportive or positive towards me. After 3 years I still feel like an outsider in their home.

I’m just so tired of this. Why do some MILs feel the need to control or comment on everything their DIL wears? Am I overreacting to feel upset about this?

ANSWER: She wanted to manipulate you into wearing something else. And it worked.

QUESTION: Advice on managing Christmas gift-giving with the in-laws

I'm hoping someone might have advice for me when it comes to gift giving at Christmas. I'm not a big Christmas person, but my husband loves it so I mainly celebrate for him.

The issue for me is that our Christmas has come to revolve completely around his family. My parents died when I was younger and I'm an only child. I have extended family who I see, and we usually have a lunch together before the holidays get busy.

Every year we spend Christmas day at my mother-in-law's. FIL attends. So does SIL. So does my husband's aunt. They exchange a lot of gifts and it's been expected that I will bring gifts for everyone.

As the years have gone on, this circle has expanded depending on the dynamics. Sometimes the aunt or SIL have a partner; sometimes those partners also have children. This is the case this year, so we're looking at gifts for more people than last year.

So many of my friends' families have stopped gift giving at Christmas and just focus on being together, and I wish I could have the same. I like giving gifts, but I find it adds a lot of financial pressure to us. We are in a different financial position that my in-laws: Everyone is retired and on a very good pension, aside from SIL who still lives at home and pays no rent.

My husband and I on the other hand have a mortgage, and I'm putting myself through school while running my own business. We are also trying to put more money aside for the future. My in-laws travel constantly and have a very comfortable lifestyle, and I don't know if it crosses their mind that we are not where they're at financially, or that we have to be focused on different goals right now.

It doesn't help that my husband lost a job in October and hasn't found work yet.

I want to honour their traditions but some years I wish I could just get off the hook with all the Christmas gift giving and have the chance to put some money aside instead. I don't expect my in-laws to change their gift-giving traditions, but I feel like the odd one out, as well, as though I can't say no even though my wallet is having trouble saying yes.

Whenever I try to talk about this with my husband he gets defensive, so it's hard to find a middle ground. Has anyone been in this situation before? What solutions have worked for you? I do set a budget for everyone's gifts, but with more people to buy for this year it still adds up to more to be spent.

ANSWER: Recommend doing a secret Santa gift due to hard financial times

================================================================================

QUESTION: Hangouts with in-laws are painful - help change our routine

My in laws are quite boring people. It’s my MIL, BIL and SIL. When we see them, it’ll only be at one of our homes and it’s pretty painful. They’re very surface level so the conversation runs dry quickly and it becomes awkward. My partner says their relationship has been like this his whole life. 

I’ve come to dread out hangouts because of this. I tried to offer to play games, they don’t want to. 

I want to suggest we just go out to lunch/dinner so it’s just a quick hour/hour and a half then we can go our separate ways rather than painfully sitting around the living room staring at each other/ the tv for too long. 

The problem is they struggle with money. I’m fine with going somewhere cheap - Applebees, chilis etc. My partner is worried if we invite them they’ll expect him to pay for them and he doesn’t want to do that. I think splitting the bill is completely normal and nothing else should be expected. 

Asking for sympathy of these dreadful hangouts and if we ask them to do something else, does that insinuate that we’d pay?

ANSWER: Are your in-laws Nordic? Cause they sound like my family. Just because you’re hanging out in silence doesn’t necessarily mean they aren’t enjoying your company. Try to relax into the silence and don’t try to fill it with trivial conversation. Talk about important things, or just enjoy the calm.

Or they’re weirdos and also feel as awkward as you do.  In which case, find cheap / free activities to do with them. Literally just go for a walk around the neighbourhood.

================================================================================

QUESTION: What would you do in this situation?

Full honesty is always appreciated. I've posted here probably a dozen times in the last 3 years and its always been helpful.

My (31f) husband(30m), myself and BIL (20m) all live together. Next week will be a year since BIL moved back in with us upon graduating trade school in a neighboring state.

We have a set move out date next year, finally. Im just really getting to a point of resentment leaking into my marriage and household as well as apathy. The mixture is awful. I get zero help around the house despite having autoimmune issues/flare ups and working full time while trying my best to maintain the house. 

My BIL has become more of a chore than any help, despite the rent he pays (its being put aside to send him off with when he moves out, he is not aware of this).

The 2 things expected of him weekly (aside from personal responsibility and hygiene which is another story) is taking the trash out to the road/bringing it back in and cooking dinner once a week. 

Despite being told to set alarms (he has, they go off, he ignores them) for both taking meat out to defrost at the right time and taking the trash out, he still "forgets". I've found it easier to just deal with the trash myself to save myself the aggravation of stilling having this talk after an entire year, and as far as cooking, at first he took it seriously and enjoyed himself. Pushing himself to make things hes never made.

The last 2 or 3 months its like pulling teeth. I'd rather him not cook anymore and either pay $200 more a month until he moves out that will go towards the groceries he eats or tell him he is now responsible for his own food. 

My husband about a month ago had a pretty heated discussion with his brother after weeks of noticing I stopped cooking entirely. My BIL always thanks my husband but anytime I cook he disregards me.... my husband questioned and reminded him of his manners towards me. He also blows my texts off while on MY phone plan (ive made peace with this by tacking the cost of the phone bill onto his rent about 8 months ago). Hes paying $865 a month in rent. The state we live in, this is maybe a bit less than HALF of what he will be paying when he rents on his own unless he can find a roommate. 

What would you do in this situation? I have a feeling a lot of people are going to say he needs to leave, yesterday (fully understood) sadly its a bit more complex as this is the last person in my husbands family he has any sort of relationship with. 

ETA: my husband works a full time job while managing his own business while helping where he can in the house, so where some of this may be a "husband" issue, the lack of contribution around the house falls solely on my BIL. My husband also does 85% of the cooking as mentioned earlier, i stopped cooking.

ANSWER: Well, for starters you should keep the money. There is no reason for you to give this man that money back. He did not do you a favor, he paid you rent. Besides, it would send him the wrong message. He would read it as “Hey, I can treat her as garbage and get rewarded for it.” That aside, the three of you need to sit down and agree on a timeline for his moving out. You need to be present because you are part of this, not an accessory to your husband. I understand that this is his brother so you wanted him to take care of it, but your brother in law interpreted this as if you mattered less or as if your word carried less weight.

QUESTION: I hate my mother (monster) in law wanting to control everything about my life

My MIL did it again and literally let religion control her fucking life. So my mom got my son this cute farm pj onesie and I love it. It has different farm animals on it but literally tonight my monster in law told me that I should donate it because it has pigs on it...like bitch he's 4 months old the only one who has a stick up their ass about it is you. 

Fucking hell this woman I swear If she gets rid of it I'm screaming at her again and cussing her ass out. Bitch acts like my son is eating pork fuck off its children's clothing why the fuck is bothering you that bad!? Oh I know why because you want fucking control.

Then I told her that I'm studying to get my massage therapy license as a back up and told her that its 11 month program both her and my SIL told me that I shouldn't go through with it because I won't make that much money and I will only massage women (again using religion as their crutch) my sil asked me how much do I think i'd make well it all depends on my clients and building that relationship. 

I get they're worried come on the only reason they're against it is because of bs religion and that's it.

ANSWER: Okay, it would be different if he was chowing down bacon, but there’s no prohibition on having cute pigs on clothing that I’m aware of. Time to put her (and SIL) on a low info diet.

QUESTION: Pending parenting plan and in laws

My ex and I split in August and it was (unbenounced to me) not shared with his family until he was served with a Temporary order of Protection the third week of September after putting his hands on me while I was asleep after not leaving my home when coming to see our kids. 

When I filed our 3 year old and 1 year old were included in the TOP that stated he could not be near them or contact them. When we went to court in October, the children were removed from the TOP but it was extended for some time. At this time it is still in place that he cannot be near me or contact me. My ex-FIL was who I had told the judge to put as the designated 3rd party to contact regulating my ex’s visitation with the children. 

I filed and served my ex with a parenting plan to which he responded AND filed for an emergency parenting plan stating that the children were “in imminent danger if the respondent (me) continues to server my(ex’s) relationship by denying me any parenting time”

Not ONCE have I received any texts or phone calls from my ex-FIL requesting time for him with our children. 

Rather, my ex FIL and MIL (who are no longer married and live in different states- MIL lives out of state but reached out since she’ll be home for the holiday) have been texting me almost every day this month demanding time with the children but refusing what I am offering since I’m not willing to do unsupervised visits. According to my FIL I am evil even because I had posted on FB looking for a sitter to watch the children during the day of Thanksgiving because my time off at work was denied and their daycare was closed. He had texted me about it saying he would do it but I politely declined since I had found a reliable sitter that has watched them before and I have been sticking to my well stated boundary that we aren’t having unsupervised visits at this time with anybody. My MIL just texted me tonight saying that she understands that I’m advertising for a babysitter next week and is asking to fulfill all the days needed. I don’t plan on responding especially since she must know that I had talked to my FIL about it 3 days ago and told him no. 

Everyone is blocked on FB so I have no idea how they even saw what I posted. Not to mention that my ex FIL doesn’t even have a FB. 

I don’t even know how to continue to handle their contact and requests especially since my children’s father has made no request or attempt to request any time with his children but they have been more than happy with blowing my phone up and demanding unsupervised time with the children.

ANSWER: This sounds complicated and I’m sorry you’re going through that. For starters, it’s best to talk with your lawyer about this, as they can give you better advice about what’s ok and not regarding the supervised visits. It’s also a good idea to remove FIL from the TOP as he’s clearly not on your side or even an unbiased person.

QUESTION: I’m about to break bad.

I don’t think any of the admins know me personally but if you do or know my family, please keep this to yourself.

My husband & I have been together for 12 years since we were in high school. He is the most amazing caring giving man.

Which comes at a price because his family since he first started working at 15 y/o, has constantly asked him for money. I mean constantly. We’ve gave & helped & gave. Fixed big issues but they keep asking him for help to fix other big issues & feels like they’re guilt tripping him. He’s sat with them to remove bills and budget. We literally took away an entire $700 monthly bill.

& yet, we’re faced with them asking for help again. Now, I don’t care to give them the shirt off my back. However, it’s taking away from our kid but more than that, it’s absolutely stressing my husband to the max. He’s literally financially supporting and helping to run 2 households.

I love them to death & they love us so much. I know they do & we’ve had some beautiful memories together with love, laughter & support, but i’m on the edge.

My husband keeps saying “I’m a terrible person if I don’t help. They’d help me.” But he’s obviously torn in both directions. I try to help but being they’re his family, it sits heavy on his shoulders.

I avoid conflict like the plague but I’m about to flip out. I’ve never said one thing out of the way to them our entire marriage, but I can’t stand how it’s affecting my husband. It hurts me so much.

How would yall handle this? Because I’ve took it up til I’m about to let it all out.

ANSWER: Perhaps you can say it since your husband is struggling with the weight on his shoulders of both families.

Inlaws we can only assist with x dollars (don't give them the full amount, make it a 1/4 or what they are asking) and state we don't have the funds available to give you what you are asking and continually giving you money is at the expense of our own kids.   You all need to find a way to resolve this but it is unfair to continually shift the pressure of your financial issues onto us.  You are relieving yourself of the problem by making it ours and that needs to stop.

Just as the title states- no matter what you say or do you are vilified and then they use a falsely perceived slight as a reason to openly start treating you shitty. 

Instead of bringing concerns or issues up 1 on 1 they decide to go the smear campaign route and complain and vent and bitch about you behind your back? And they think that it’s justified because you did something small and non malicious that they spun into a negative & think you are mean. 

Example of spinning the narrative:

“wow you look amazing.. have you been working out?”

“she thinks i’m fat and that I should work out”

OR

“I love that decoration where did you get it?”

“she’s being fake and doesn’t actually
like it or care”.

ANSWER: Yes. They have made up their minds in advance to dislike you and now they are looking for evidence to justify or support it. Nothing you will do is right and everything is wrong. 

Take a step back and protect your peace.

QUESTION: Husband’s inaction…

Hi everyone. I am hoping to get some thoughts and possibly any advice. About 2 weeks ago my MIL sent me a text cataloging all the times she felt disrespected by me. Most of these are based on her perceptions. For example, she accused me of talking badly about her to my friends, and making fun of her behind her back, and that she can “perceive the bad energy” and then said she deserves respect. Also accused me of micro aggressions (I’m a POC and she’s White btw). I was completely taken aback. I showed my husband these messages and I also texted my friends asking if they ever heard me speak negatively about her and of course they all said no, and I showed this to my husband as well. I have been very sad about these accusations. My husband agrees what his mom did was not OK, and that he’s willing to support my decision of maintaining low contact. But he continues to talk to his mother as if nothing happened, and did not stand up for me. Am I expecting too much—if my parents wrongfully accuse my spouse, I think I would speak up and let them know not to treat my spouse like that. Am I crazy to expect this from husband?

ANSWER: Absolutely not! Your husband should absolutely stand up for you. I was having the same problem with my partner but in the end his parents showed HIM how problematic they were and now he stands up for me Everytime. I'm sorry to tell you this but your husband probably won't change until it directly effects his mental health.

QUESTION: Venting?

I’ve posted in the JustNoMIL page a few times, but never here. I’ll summarize the backstory as best I can. 

Last Christmas, my MIL saw my FB post asking if people had ever painted their KitchenAid mixer because I wanted to redo the decor in our new home and asked my husband to find out what color I want so she could get it for me.  Fast forward, she did not get it for me. My husband did. But she asked for a mixer as her present, knowing that there’s no reason I need two. She gave me a $20 blanket as my gift. And she got my $400 mixer. Later when my husband told her how I felt and how it was wrong, she supposedly cried and was worried she ruined the relationship. But never once reached out to apologize or say anything to me. 

After that, a month or so before our wedding (we got married this April), she invited people without telling us until those people RSVP’d after the RSVP date and didn’t understand why that was an issue. 

At the wedding, they took my husband away from me as we are taking our couple photos following the ceremony to take a “new family photo” without me, the bride. His sister and her husband also got high and everyone could smell it. His parents and brother drank all the wine. And they didn’t even pay for what they said they would pay for. They ignored me and acted like it was a family reunion for them. 

I told my husband I didn’t ever want to see them again, including holidays, because I’ve felt mistreated and not valued. He said he understood. 

Today, he tried to get me to change my mind and I held my ground. Coincidentally, his sister texts me out of nowhere with “hey girl, how are you?” Which I left her on read because I have nothing nice to say to her, because when my husband confronted her about her actions at the wedding, she played stupid. I feel bad for my husband because I know he would like for everyone to be together, but I just can’t sacrifice my peace and “play nice” with these people. 

I told my husband I left her on read and why I didn’t respond, and he told me “well she’s never going to take accountability, OP. She’s always been that way, she doesn’t care. She does this to my parents too.” 

Anyone else ever feel similar to this? What did you do?? Am I being unreasonable?

ANSWER: Your husband is expecting you to step up and be the bigger person. Why doesn’t he expect the same from his family. You are not being unreasonable. Your husband is being unreasonable for expecting you to forgive someone who hasn’t apologised or taken accountability for their actions. You don’t need to forgive people who hurt you. Your husband has made his bed so he can lie in it. He let his family treat you badly. This is the consequence of those actions.

I also can’t believe he gave away your $400 kitchen aid. You should have sold it. 

I’m sorry to say that you have a husband problem. I would strongly suggest couples therapy to help your husband understand that you and him are a team and he can’t sacrifice your peace for the sake of his.

QUESTION: Tips on boundary setting with in-laws

I’m currently pregnant with my first and inching closer to due date.  
I’ve expressed to my partner, but no one else yet, that for the first week PP, I don’t want any visitors.   I want to just focus on our baby, that we’ve waited so long to meet - as the ttc process was much longer than we thought it would be.  
I am also a very private person who absolutely loves their privacy.  
Their aunt, who lives a few states north messaged me yesterday asking when my due date was.  I shared.  She responded that she was so excited because she had plans to be in town the due date week, for a separate event happening.  And she responded can’t wait to meet your “little one”.   
(Obviously I know, baby will come when baby comes..)
I haven’t responded.  But would like tips on a polite but blunt way to tell her that she will not be coming over.  
I also intend to have this conversation with my MIL who I already have a tense and not so great relationship with due to disrespect of boundaries and passive aggressive comments she’s made to me over the years.

ANSWER: Don’t be afraid to be direct, but don’t over explain yourself! It may be useful to keep it short and sweet! 

Ie: “thanks for sharing our excitement! We’ll be taking the first week of post partum for the three of us to bond, we’ll reach out as soon as we’re ready for visitors!” 

Or “we’re so excited for you to meet baby after the first week or so, we’ll reach out as soon as we’re ready” 

Etc.

QUESTION: Let’s talk Christmas.

What’s everyone’s thoughts / opinions on-
Last year was our first Christmas with a baby. 
I decided it was time for Christmases to change. I was done “rotating”. We hosted, it created conflict with his family. EVERY SINGLE YEAR - his grandmother hosts Christmas Eve at an extremely small apartment where nobody can comfortably fit. It was an immediate no to me. And his mother hosts Christmas dinner. For the 9 years we have dated we rotated Christmas Day between his mother and my mother. One year Christmas dinner at my moms, Christmas Eve dinner at his grandmas. The next year, Christmas Eve with my mother and Christmas dinner with his mother. For 9 years. Last year I said screw it, I’d like to host for once and I’m not traveling an hour there and an hour back and we are the only people with children. So we hosted a Christmas Eve lunch with his family, They did show up, it was tense, they also kept asking if we were sure we weren’t coming over there on Christmas Day. We said we were sure. The grandma was tense kind of that she didn’t get to do her Christmas Eve dinner? We said she absolutely could we just wouldn’t be there.
We went over to my mother’s for Christmas dinner. Stayed for an hour. That was it last year. NOW THIS YEAR, I am pregnant. I am heading back to work right before Christmas. Things have been crazy and hectic with a toddler as well. We are very busy. We did thanksgiving 🇨🇦 with his family, didn’t do mine, and now we are going to another get together with his grandparents. Is it safe for me to say it’s only “fair” they come over again to us for Christmas Eve or day after Christmas? I don’t even know what Christmas is going to look like with me working also. Like we have now done 2 events traveling an hour each way, and nobody’s came to us in awhile? Why would I go there again? I must say December 24,25,26 mean absolutely nothing other than dates to me. I don’t care when we see them either. THEY get hung up on dates. Christmas Eve get together is out of question at the extremely small apartment where nobody fits, especially my growing family. So it just leaves the Christmas dinner his mother offers and that we will be expected to be at. Husband knows any “plans” from us will create conflict, but I don’t care? We offer them to see us when we can and if that’s not good enough then too bad!
I guess it creates conflict if we invite them again for Christmas Eve and then go to my moms for Christmas night. Not sure why it matters.
Keep in mind - his family lives an hour drive each way, mine lives 5 minutes.
What would you do?

ANSWER: Right? Like do dates really matter? Does the “holiday” really matter? We try and go to their get togethers when we can, doesn’t happen often but we do. But they for sure haven’t been to us in a damn while?!?

QUESTION: Is it weird that I don't care to have a relationship with my in laws?

Hi everyone!

Hope it's alright to ask here? Do delete if not right.

So I've been with my partner (lets call them A) for many years and I've met their parents/siblings less than a month into our relationship. A met my parents about 6 months in.

I've had a pretty close relationship with A's family for most of our relationship and it's been mostly uneventful besides the fact that I really don't care to have this relationship. It's not even the conflicts it creates (though obv there has been conflicts and it's annoying but I like A's family, I'd say I'm friends with a few people and friendly with the rest) but it's more that I don't really see the appeal of being close with them.

Like sometimes it feels that to date A, I need to become part of the family and I just don't really care to. I'm A's partner and that's enough for me.

Similarly, A seems to want to build a relationship with my parents (at the moment it's very polite and positive but theyve basically never had a real conversation), which is fine with me but I don't get why.

 I feel like maybe I'm weird?? I just couldn't care less if my parents and A talked ever or got along or not, those are completely separate relationships for me.

Maybe it's because I'm not a huge family person? Im an only child, I am very close to my parents but mostly one-on-one not as a family unit + i only see my extended family for christmas. Whilst A's family is much more into family reunions and shit.

Is that weird? Should I make more of an effort to build those family relationships or is it fine to just date A and not care about the in laws of it all?

Thanks a million if you take the time to give me advice!

ANSWER: I don't think it's weird at all. I feel the same (although my situation is tainted with odd behavior from my in-laws and differing family dynamics and expectations from what I'm used to). The way I see it is I have my own family and my own friends that take up a large portion of my social life and time..his family is just something I have to deal with every now and then and that's ok, I have no interest in it being any more than that or a deeper connection. Have you spoke to A about this and see how they feel?

QUESTION: Need advice for MIL

Hello! I’m looking for advice on what to do with my relationship with my MIL.
Within the last three years, my MIL has gotten divorced from my soon-to-be husband’s father. 

Their divorce was not amicable, there was a lot of scandal and it left my MIL distraught, while my FIL kind of just let her go after it all happened.(Very) shortly, after that my fiancé and I got engaged while his family and I were on a trip in Reno. 

We all shared an AirBnB bc it was already paid for and planned before the divorce 😅 you can imagine the tension in that house.

Fast forward about 1.5 years, my fiancé and I see how upset my MIL is living in her hometown living with her sister: working at her old job being called by her previous married name after changing it back to her maiden name. So we offered her to move 8 hours away from it all and in with us. We had just moved about a year before to a new town for my fiancé’s job and thought the smaller town might be a nice change of pace for her. In the divorce she didn’t take anything, she left pretty much everything behind needed to live day to day and didn’t purchase anything for herself while living with her sister, so we thought the best financial decision would be to live with us. My fiancé and I were living decently on our own as mid twenty year olds in decent-paying jobs in a small town, so my MIL moving in with us was more of an equal benefit for us all. We discussed the dynamics prior to her moving in over zoom and in person to make sure it would work with our habits and from what we spoke about, it seemed like it was all okay.

House hunting was not a big deal as there are a lot in the are for rent where we live. The one hiccup we ran into is that my MIL wanted a very specific floor plan that we couldn’t find and I only have seen in nicer houses in larger cities (so they cost a lot to purchase). So we settled for a different floor plan that my fiancé and I didn’t mind but my MIL didn’t love.

So then we all moved into the house, my fiancé and I moved in a week before, bug bombed the place, deep cleaned it, pretty much got it ready for when my MIL arrived the following week. We got our cats settled and made sure everything was ready to go. Then my MIL’s things were delivered a day prior to her arriving, so we got them organized in the garage for her to go through. She arrives the day after and it’s a very sweet homecoming and we are all excited that she’s here finally. My MIL starts getting her things unpacked and we help her carry things upstairs if necessary.

Some background on my MIL:
• Gluten Free diet
• Has lost a lot of weight in the last year
• Does not intend to ever get married again
• Has two cats that are 3-4 years old and have never lived outside of a bedroom till moving in with us

I’ll jump to September, my birthday and hers are about 5 days apart. My fiancé’s half sister decides to come down the weekend of my birthday along with my MIL’s brother. My MIL plans to have a BBQ lunch, but my MIL does not cook. My fiancé is just now getting into barbecuing and I am the cook in the house 🙃 I am sure you understand where this is going. So since my fiancé and I were throwing a barbecue, I invited my parents who don’t live too far since my birthday was that same weekend so I could see them. And unknown to me my fiancé started arranging a surprise for my birthday that day with a cake and balloons. So the day approaches for the BBQ, we are all preparing. My fiancé and I are cooking the whole day and don’t sit down once until to eat. My MIL doesn’t get up from the dining room table once. Even my mother is helping me in the kitchen at one point. I know everyone’s family dynamics are different, but the offer of help on a very busy day when you’re hosting a lot of people is appreciated 😕
I also end up finding out after the party that my MIL fought over the phone with my mother stating that my parents did not throw me a party first. I was a bit shocked to find that information out, because my MIL and mother fighting is the last thing I want. Especially with wedding planning still going on.

When moving down here my MIL accepted the first job that was offered to her and it wasn’t one that my fiancé thought she would enjoy in her career field. For context, my MIL was practically head of her dept and a high school campus college level teacher with no lack of resources. There were other jobs and schools at the level she was previously teaching available, she just got anxious and wanted a job before moving. I totally understand that and am not upset about that. She is now a 5th grade teacher for a school in a town with a population of 1,000. She comes home miserable everyday, about 3-4 hours after school ends, and has come home without her voice multiple times now. We really don’t think the grade level is a good fit for her and want her to find a new job at the end school year that’s more her speed.

His mother also doesn’t really clean dishes? She kind of rinses them with hot water and soap but there isn’t any scrubbing on cups, straws, etc. so I have to go back in and clean them but that’s causing my fiancé and I to fight when I point it out to him. His mother isn’t someone you can casually mention things to 😅 she will think that you think she is the absolute worst person in the world and hate her guts if you make one comment or suggestion to her….i have learned this the hard way and now she doesn’t really talk to me, so cool cool! I actually need to clean my blender again after this….

This kind of ties into what my major complaint of all this is. My MIL does not help cook dinner or clean the common areas. The expectation is that dinner will be made at a decent time for her, or else she starts making passive aggressive comments to my fiancé (if he is home) about when we will I be home from the gym to make dinner. When moving in together, because of my MIL’s dietary restrictions for her weight loss and health reasons, she said she would cook for herself. She told my fiancé and I, that she wouldn’t be upset if we did our own thing for dinner. Now, we keep gluten free bread, veggies and other alternatives around for her to eat. But one night there were leftovers from the meal that I made my fiancé and I for our anniversary, she had given us some privacy to enjoy the evening together which was very kind, the following evening when I was pulling out all the leftovers to eat to clean out the fridge and said the ramen broth was gluten free but the ramen noodles were not and that she could just make herself some noodles, she made a face. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened where something wasn’t gluten free and my MIL made it very obvious that, although there was an alternative, because I wasn’t making it for her in that instant she was very upset. 

I do also have to state, whenever I make a group meal or pasta, it is either gluten free or I made a gluten free variant for her. This mostly happens when making a dessert not meant to be a group meal or heck I pulled the rolls out I ended up not needing for Thanksgiving to eat. She’s going to be in a different state for Thanksgiving and no one at my parent’s house is gluten free so the rolls I had grabbed were not gluten free! But she did have gluten free rolls in the freezer for whenever, so she could have made herself a roll like I was making myself one! Not made a passive aggressive comment about them not being gluten free! Am I being rude or inconsiderate? Or is this a prime example of someone expecting everyone to accommodate to their dietary preference?

My MIL also doesn’t say please ever?? Or ask for things?? She expects everyone to make accommodations to her as well? Which I found the expectation of just tapping your bowl at the dinner table with no “would you mind taking this to the sink for me” wild, but then my fiancé, MIL, and I went to a food festival with my parents, grandparents, brother and his girlfriend. My MIL didn’t dress for the weather, so my mom was very kind and sat with my MIL inside the whole time so she wouldn’t overheat. My fiancé and I brought my MIL food and water while she sat inside. Everyone else kind of cycled out of the chairs bc there wasn’t enough with how packed it was. Then at the end of the night once we were home and settled, my MIL complained how she didn’t eat enough at the festival? She never asked for more food and my fiancé and I checked with her every time we got up from the table. I’m not sure if she just thought we wouldn’t get something gluten free? But the way she phrased it in the moment rubbed my fiancé the wrong way and it made me feel bad. He looks forward to this every year and he said this was the first year he didn’t enjoy it.

I am sorry if you made it to the end of this. This ended up being more of a rant than asking for advice.

But if you have any advice on what I should do moving forward because I can’t keep ranting to my fiancé because it’s his mother and it will only cause tensions between us. I don’t want to do that. My MIL is a nice lady but her personality can be more doom and gloom than not sometimes, which I think can also be a contributing factor. I’ve tried to talk casually to her and her #1 rebuttal is “what year was that? Oh I was a mom then ,don’t know it” or she’ll go on and on about how smart my fiancé’s older sister is 🙃
Which my SIL is one smart cookie, she deserves her cudos but I never hear praise from her mouth for my fiancé, which is disheartening bc he quite amazing and kind. So I don’t want to keep bickering with him about his mother!

So any advice would be greatly appreciated! Please and thank you!

ANSWER: Newlyweds shouldn’t live with parents in my opinion. 

So maybe postpone the wedding planning until she’s moved out or else she won’t be the only divorcee.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Getting offended by my FIL constantly saying “ I didn’t do enough research”

I am having 500+ person wedding. Not by choice. Thats another long story and i wish we just would’ve done what i wanted and eloped. 

My father in law (and MIL)wanted me to find a venue that was;
Big enough for atleast 500 guests, 
Open catering policy ,
Free or ample parking .

And for my fiance and I, it just needed to be affordable because we paid for the venue HE wanted. 

But do you know how hard it is to find all of that? 
VERY HARD. 

I found a venue that could hold 400 but there was only 90 parking spots on site and the rest was free for all street parking! That’s CRAZY! 

And every other venues that were big enough didn’t let you bring in your own caterer and was atleast $15k. I know to some that’s cheap but in my area that’s actually very expensive. 

So we found the venue we have now, it can seat 460 people, open catering, and is a very good price, with onsite (paid) parking. Is it my dream venue? No,but it was my only option. 

We started working on our guest list last night and it doesn’t help that my fiancés family literally consists of 250 ALONE. So then my father in law proceeds to bitch about how “we didn’t do enough research and should’ve kept looking for venues” that PISSED me off because I frankly did do the research and I’ve been doing nothing but busting my ass off for a wedding my in-laws and fiance wanted. So now my FIL is pissed he can’t invite more of “his” guest because the venue isn’t big enough. I don’t know what to tell him because it’s not my fault half of the list is HIS FAMILY HE WANTS THERE. 

My family only consists of 40 people and now at this rate I might not even invite my cousins anymore and just my aunts and uncles just so my father in law can invite more people. 

I’m getting so sick and tired of this constant complaining and nagging from my FIL about how things aren’t going his way in this close to his snapping at him, I frankly don’t care if it’s disrespectful anymore. I might just tell him my fiance and I frankly don’t care what’s going on anymore and this is not what we wanted and to make FIL happy well start uninviting people from our list to make him feel bad.

For more context: my in-laws are paying for the buffet meal (about $10k) which we appreciate cause that is a HUGE cost but can’t help but feel like that’s what they should do since 95% of the guest lists are people they want to invite. While my fiance are paying $35k+ for everything else.  Yet my father in law wants to have an opinion on everything while my fiance and I haven’t given a single opinion on the food. 

Take it from me; DONT CONJOIN EVENTS WITH YOUR IN LAWS AND DONT TAKE ANY OF THEIR MONEY

ANSWER: Cancel the whole thing and elope.  Why are you doing this to yourself?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Husband acts like I’m in the way when he’s around his family.

Whenever my husband is around his family, his whole demeanor toward me changes. He becomes short, irritated, and acts like I’m somehow in the way or an inconvenience. It’s especially noticeable whenever I try to talk or join the conversation, his tone gets clipped, dismissive, or he just seems annoyed that I spoke at all.

It’s confusing because he isn’t like this when it’s just the two of us. I don’t know if he’s trying to “perform” for them, if there are underlying family dynamics I’m unaware of, or if this is a sign of something deeper.

Has anyone else experienced this? Why do partners switch up around their families, and how do you address it without it turning into a fight?

ANSWER: Hi. I've been there with my now husband. My in-laws (FIL, MIL and SIL) are very entitled to their son. At first I didn't understand why this was happening. Eventually I noticed that my husband was stressed managing everyone's expectations in the family. He was spending a great amount of energy to please and navigate their moods to avoid drama. That has drained his energy and unfortunately at times was a bit short with me. It was painful to address these issues with him and we ended up in an argument a few times. Eventually he stopped managing the situations with his family. His family behavior changed in the worst. They started to guilt-trip my husband for giving him an education and claiming he is professionally successful because of their efforts. Their behavior toward me also changed as I was the reason his son was now living his own life.

QUESTION: has anyone been here before? Tw suicide

Update 11/20: Thank you for those who left comment and reached out. I woke up feeling better/more supported after reading your messages, truly thank you from the bottom of my heart. As an update, maybe when I have energy I'll write more what has happened with my in laws in details. I'm just preparing to give birth tomorrow and saving my energy. My husband is very supportive and help put out strong boundary but sometimes he miscalculated the level of danger that I'm in and lets some of those guard down. However he tries to meet me with it.

-------

has anyone been here where life is unbearable that you are up googling which state does assisted euthanasia because you cannot go on anymore but not being able to finish the job yourself? 

I may not have the energy to write what happened but my in laws are pushing me to end my life. My SIL both hated me and have punished my husband to try to control me. my MIL only want access to grand kid. I am 39 weeks pregnant and thinking I am worth more dead than alive right now. My husband support me but I feel worthless with the constant pressure to do more. with the baby my in laws will demand more of me. I do not want to live like this. I just want to deliver this baby and seek ways to end my life. 

I have deep cptsd regarding being raised by narcissistic parents myself and I am no contact but my in laws mimic the same trauma and they retraumatize me to the point of suicide. They probably will not be happy until there is a dead body. 

Considering going to ER because I am suicidal and constantly trying to plan it

ANSWER: Please go to the ER. You might not know this but there is always a way out of the dark place you are finding yourself in right now. Please, there is help available, you just need to ask. I know it's difficult to ask for help, and I cannot imagine what you are going through right now.

Now sil wants to move back to the city and to she called me yesterday trying to guilt me into agreeing to move to the village. For more context  my parents and my other sil all live in the same city of bangalore.

We have already given equal share of the property to both sisters . And while I understand that the inlaws are familiar with their village. They have a ton of family in the city aswell.

QUESTION: Mom vs sister in law

As a younger sister (of a brother) witnessing the toxic dynamics between my sister in law and my mom, I need some advice. Due to circumstances, I’ve been away from home and haven’t met or talked to her yet. During this time, I heard how bad either side is to each other. I’ll be seeing her soon in a family gathering so I’m wondering how I should set the tone. Should I talk to her as someone who’s heard many bad things about her (neutral not so friendly tone) or as someone who has no idea about her and what she’s done. Obviously the latter seems like a sensible choice but I don’t want to look like a fake, also I kinda want to let her know in a subtle way that I’m not fond of how disrespectful she is to my mom. On the other hand I don’t want to be biased or start our relationship negatively. Any thoughts?

ANSWER: I see your edit. So yes. Stay out of it.

I do have a question since you said that your family is close. Does your family expect to be close to your brother forever after shit-taking about his wife?
I’m not saying this to be insulting, but you’re obviously on your mom’s side and you’ve all been talking about your SIL. I’m genuinely curious on how in-laws expect things to go. 
Like, is it that you think that your brother will always side with your family because he doesn’t love his wife as much and just eventually divorce her? Or do you guys think that she’ll just spend the remainder of her life surrounded by people who don’t like her?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Fear aggresive dog in law

Hi everyone, I'm looking for some perspective regarding my in laws fear aggresive dog. 
I do not know if my own fear of dogs is creating a bias in this situation or if the my MIL is an irresponsible owner. 
Coming into this with an open mind as I am not a dog owner and somewhat fearful of dogs.

Short backstory: My SIL adopted a fear aggresive dog. She put years and immense effort into helping rehabilitate him and help the dog acclimate around others outside immediate family. Shortly after her son was born the dog bit her husband and she decided on euthanisia. My very frail MIL decided she would take the dog instead.

Fast forward to the past few years and I am at a point where I cannot be in their home unless the dog is kept away. The dog is fine with my husbands parents and siblings, but is highly reactive and aggresive towards me. If the dog is not closely monitored he will go under the table and try to nip me, and has cornered me barking and snarling on several occasions.

My mil is very passive about the dog and will try to diminish my fear and say I should feel sorry for the dog because he was abused and is scared. I do have sympathy and feel awful thinking about any animal abuse, however I do not feel safe in their home because of this.

Despite many discussions with her about my fear, she will sneak him out of their room while I'm in another room. I will only discover this when I get up to the kitchen and the dog begins barking aggresively. She'll scurry him back in the room like "whoopsie".

I'm at a breaking point and have scheduled to work all holidays to avoid going to their house.

It has been 7 years of dealing with this so any advice is appreciated

My questions overall are: Am I being dramatic and am biased as I am generally afraid? Or is this ignorant and irresponsible behavior on my mil's part.

ANSWER: In your situation I would never go to her home again.

QUESTION: Should I build a home next to my parents?

My fiancé (26)(male) and I (24)(female) have been gifted land by my grandparents. We absolutely love the town the land is located in as both of us grew up here and would love to raise our own children here one day. We would not be able to afford this land otherwise because the value of a piece of property here is close to $600,000. We are very outdoorsy people and love to go boating. The closest boat ramp is 3 minutes away. We would basically be living on the water. We can build a home in our price range without having to move out of our beautiful home town. The only down fall is that the land is surrounded by my family. My brother and his wife live right next door, my grandparents live across the street, and my parents live down the street. My fiancé is not too keen on the idea of living next to in-laws, no matter how great our relationship is. 
 
I need advice. Do the pros out way the cons ?

ANSWER: Well, what are the cons of living close to your parents/family? Is there any boundary crossing in the past, etc?? 

If it was me, I'd say no to living that close to my in-laws. But mine are literally mentally abusive, manipulative, and selfish.

================================================================================

QUESTION: FIL pulled my hair at my wedding

“He didn’t pull it THAT hard, he showed me. He pulled my hair as hard as he pulled yours and it wasn’t that hard.” - MIL

I’ll set the scene. I’m dancing to the last song of my wedding night with some of my best friends from high school. People who haven’t all been in the same room together in years. The song is Don’t Stop Believin’ (not my first choice but I get it’s a crowd pleaser, DJ picked it) and these friends and I met in choir so of course we’re also singing at the top of our lungs. All of a sudden, I feel a tug on my hair. My long hair, that had been styled in a half-up braid on my wedding day. 

I didn’t know or care who was behind me with their hand holding the end of my braid. I was going to let them know to not pull my hair. I raised my voice to be heard over the music and flatly said “DON’T PULL MY HAIR PLEASE” as I turned around. It was my FIL. It appeared that he didn’t hear me. All he did was say goodbye to me, because my in-laws were leaving their son’s/brother’s in the middle of the last song of the night for some reason. FIL decided to get the bride’s attention, while she was dancing to the last song of her wedding with her best friends, by pulling her hair (I put it in second person to try and get my MIL to understand why it was upsetting. It didn’t work). (Also, I should’ve been dancing with my husband the entire time too, but FIL was saying goodbye to him before he pulled my hair).

I was so bewildered. I tried to go back to dancing. I almost chased him outside to confront him. Then I thought, I couldn’t let him pull me away from my night any more than my in-laws already had. I told my husband, and he was already upset with them too and now even more mad at his dad.

(The rest of this post is pretty much unrelated to the title, just needed to rant. Thank you for reading. You can stop here, I wont be offended lol).

In-laws pestered us to take photo booth pictures with them throughout the reception when we had professional photos taken with them (all of my husband’s sisters were in the wedding party, he’s the only boy and it def plays a factor in their dynamic). They were physically pulling my husband off the dance floor for photos, not taking no for an answer. We kept saying not right now, we’ll find you, etc, nothing worked. We finally caved and took photo booth pics with them. We tried to walk away after because a song we liked started playing. They whined for us to take more pictures. He said not right now. They whined again. We tried walking away. Whined again. FIL says to him “Cmon bud just take a photo.” My husband finally said “Guys, I JUST want to enjoy my wedding!” sternly and we walked maybe 5 feet away before being stopped by other guests and began chatting with them. In-laws proceeded to pout for the rest of the night. Oh well.

I use they because his family (MIL, FIL, SILs) are enmeshed and completely hive-minded. Husband has broken away from the enmeshment and they don’t know how
to deal with it. 

My husband and I thought our wedding was amazing overall, but his family’s behavior definitely affected his experience and he was struggling with it.

My husband tried explaining to his mom that their behavior hurt him/us. All we were met with were excuses, justifications, and lies frankly. MIL told my husband he shouldn’t have raised his voice. Husband apologized for raising his voice. Gave MIL an example of a real apology. Didn’t really matter.

MIL told us that FIL had tried touching my shoulders/back to get my attention before pulling my hair. The thing is, one of my amazing friends had set her phone up on the DJ table to record us dancing. It caught FIL pulling my hair in plain view. None of that happened, he didn’t touch me at all or try to get my attention in any other way before pulling my hair. She told us that he did, in fact, hear me say not to pull my hair. So he ignored me I guess? Weird. “He pulls all the girls’ [sisters] hair to get their attention, it’s playful.” says MIL.
 “He’s never done it to me, because I would’ve reacted the same way I did at my wedding. Point is, the bride’s hair was pulled on her wedding day.” I said.
 “FIL wasn’t doing it to be mean.” MIL says.
 “I know. I don’t care.” I say.
No getting through. 

As for leaving early, MIL told us we should’ve asked them to stay after the wedding. They thought the wedding was over. Why didn’t we ask them to stay? We didn’t ask anyone else to stay, people just stayed and hung out/helped clean the bridal suites. You’re the groom’s parents!? We could’ve taken the photos they so desperately wanted. There was no getting through. They can do no wrong. No accountability or even acknowledgement of their decision to leave early. Definitely no real apologies. It’s all our fault. Also, now MIL is hurt that she wasn’t part of planning the wedding (my husband and I planned it alone). And hurt about whatever else she can come
up with. Oh well.

Just needed to vent, sorry for the length. We’ve been in couples therapy in the months leading up to our wedding to address all the ways they affect us and it is helpful. My husband and I are solid and very much in love. We’re facing this as a team. We’ve been laying low from them since our wedding almost 2 months ago. Doesn’t stop MIL from reaching out, being overly sweet trying to regain control. In their world, no one has any problems and everything gets swept under the rug without any real accountability being taken. I’m not part of that world. I can confront safe people. I can’t confront them, clearly. Oh well.

Thank you for reading.

ANSWER: Stay low contact and keep them out of your personal, marital, and financial business. These are your husband's parents, so let him deal with them.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Is it a bad idea to go no contact with ILs during wedding planning?

For background, my in laws have caused severe relationship issues for me (27F) and my fiance (27M). He comes from a conservative religious family that is very strict and not understanding or tolerant of anyone who is different than them. When I met my fiance, he didn’t have a backbone with his family. So they have forced religion upon me, gave me religious trauma, and are always in our business. They still see us as children, who can’t make decisions for ourselves. They don’t respect that my family comes from a different religious background. His mother even said right after we got engaged she doesn’t know if we’ll last because I’m not religious enough. 

After a while, my fiance saw the damage they’ve been doing and spoke up to them, said we will be doing things our way. He moved out of their house and we got our own place away from them. He still talks to them everyday but my contact is limited. They want us over for thanksgiving, since my family will be working. My family doesn’t celebrate Christmas and they do, so they will likely want us over for Christmas too. After all the horrible things they’ve said behind my back I told my fiance I want nothing to do with them and will not be attending any holidays (he’s free to go although he doesn’t want to go without me, but that’s his choice). We are in the middle of wedding planning and his mother obviously wants to be involved. But I want to go complete no-contact and my fiance said he supports that but I’m scared it’ll cause issues. He loves his family a lot but I’m emotionally traumatized and not sure if this is the right approach.

ANSWER: “Is it a bad idea to go no contact with ILs during wedding planning?”

Answer: There is NO better time than wedding planning (and planning your future happiness together) to cut toxic pit vipers out of your life!

Actually, I’m stumped as to WHY you need to ask…

Go NC and STAY NC — unless you want to lose your mind, your sanity, and possibly your marriage.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Little rant if any toddler moms / moms of littles can relate…

Idk I just feel like throwing it out there. We are expected to go to these lunches and dinners with my husband’s family + grandparents, sometimes we decline sometimes we go. We have a LO and another on the way. We are expected to pack up the house, drive an hour there and an hour pack AND lug around a highchair.?!?!? Idk. Something just doesn’t sit right with me. Keep in mind we have to lug the highchair up 2 flights of stairs and an elevator and it’s just overall inconvenient to have my highchair in the car also… 
Half the time we say NO because it’s just way too much. We were invited this time, agreed and then they just say “don’t forget the highchair” ugh. They also added they tried “looking for one, but can’t find one to keep at their homes..” like idk it’s just pretty rude in my opinion. I KNOW others will think that’s just the nature of being invited places but I find it rude. With our family growing and us having 2 littles we have decided we won’t be going anywhere for quite some time eating out places due to the inconvenience. We will be declining invites for dinners and lunches. They can come to us.

ANSWER: Why do you need a high chair? When mine were little they just sat on someone’s lap at family events. Your in-laws should buy one that straps to a chair and have it at their house if it is that important to them

QUESTION: In-laws weird after having baby

I never really had an issue with my MIL or FIL but since I had my November 2024 baby, they act so different. My MIL feels so entitled to him and like she doesn’t have to listen to boundaries. She was so cold the entire pregnancy—never checking in on me or baby. Now she wants to be here all the time and have all this time with him. 

My FIL was all excited during the pregnancy. Would frequently check in and liked updates. Now that he’s here and a year old, he like doesn’t interact with him. He’s probably held our son 5 times in the past year. To me that’s so fucking weird. I understand not having much interest in holding a newborn because they’re so fragile, but like he’ll go out of his way to not hold him. You have to pretty much set him in his arms for him to hold him. Seems off to me. It’s his first grandson after all. 

Anyone else experience their in-laws changing after having a baby?

ANSWER: Yeah MIL’s get crazy baby rabies for some reason, even when they aren’t close with the DIL. It’s weird. And FIL’s are distant, mine barely shows up to anything and never says anything.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Can you see why I'm stressed?

I just get so incredibly extra emotional and sensitive lately. But I think anyone would in this situation.

I have health issues. 27F.  When I first got with my boyfriend he knew all about my health issues and that I took medication and was on birth control.

About 3 months into being official with my boyfriend and meeting his family. They noticed I took my thyroid medication in the morning.
They knew I had health issues too.

About after 1 year of us being together, I came off my Anti-anxiety/anti Depressant medication.
Part of me was in a good space but also his family were bringing it up alot - that I need to stop them.

I was fine. Withdrawal was hard but I did it.
This year I stopped my birth control. My boyfriend and I both agreed on it - because it was making me unwell.

His dad didn't know I was on birth control. (At least I think he didn't know)

About 3 - 4 months after stopping the pill (this year), his dad started trying to scare me into stopping my thyroid medication. Saying it'd give me cancer and that it's the cause of my anxiety.

I lost it. And said i was on the pill- that that's why I've been a mess emotionally. That I've always had my thyroid medication and never had an issue with it. I feel better on it and it keeps me well.

I respect his family. I love his family.

But, having my boyfriends dad tell me I should be taking this supplement and that supplement. 
(This has been on and off constant)

Asking what ones I'm taking. 

Sending me videos on why I should take this supplement and why I should stop thyroid medication.

Then telling me to stop my thyroid medication (I'm diagnosed hypothyroidism) because he thinks it's causing me health issues.

I think that can be adding to my stress too.

I go to work to work. (I work at his family business)

Not to be told to stop my medication or bring up my health issues. While at work - in front of my co-workers.

Being told what I should eat, what not to eat. What to wear, what I should and shouldn't be putting on my skin.

And even how I should be talking. What words to use. "I Hope" is apparently negative and I shouldn't say to someone I hope you feel better soon.

I think my stress just rises so much more when this happens. 


I'm actually doing all the right things. 
I don't drink, I don't smoke, don't do drugs, I don't drink softdrinks. No candy. 

I'm gluten free and lactose free. I eat healthy and avoid takeout. 
I'm a healthy weight for my age and height. I wear no makeup. I get my lashes done and that's it.

My thyroid levels are perfect on my medication.
I'm usually mentally well - when I hit luteal phase I become more sensitive and feel physically sock and it's harder to brush this all off, it makes me unwell.

My boyfriends mum doesn't try to convince me to stop my medication. She was always lovely to me. 

Everytime there's a little hurdle in our realationship and my mental health - it starts from his dad trying to change me.

Why doesn't he try to change someone who is actually doing the wrong things or eating KFC, smoking ect.

ANSWER: 1. Start looking for new employment immediately.   
2. If there's an HR department, GO TO THEM.  
3. Learn to be calmly assertive. 

"My wardrobe is fine and not up for discussion."  
"I do not want to discuss my diet/medication/health, thank you for respecting my boundary about this."

He could get in legal trouble about this, if you were so inclined.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I need advice about what to do with my MIL

So to give some context My husband and I have been married for a little over a year now. We didn’t have the money for a ceremony at the time so we decided to do a very small wedding with just the two of us and our pastors. (His parents were aware of this before hand and were very excited). We also explained to them that would not be taking my Husband’s last name ( He hasn’t spoken to his real Dad in over 18 years) and we would be taking my grandfathers last name instead. At the time they acted completely fine with this, even went as far as saying they couldn’t care less about a last name they were just happy for us. 

Fast forward to now, my husband and I finally saved up enough money to have the wedding of our dreams. About a week before the wedding his mom called him furious, screaming at him over the phone claiming she had no idea about the last names and that he was inconsiderate and must not care about the lineage of their family at all. This definitely upset my Husband but he brushed it off and told her he loved her and he meant absolutely no harm to them. She then hung up the phone and refused to speak to him leading up to the wedding day. Jump to the wedding day, she still ended up showing up to the ceremony but was very quick to leave right after before my husband even got a chance to speak with her. My husband doesn’t typically show his emotions outward so he tried to brush it off and enjoy his night but I could tell it bothered him. Him and his mom were very close growing up and he really wanted her there to celebrate with us.  The wedding was amazing but come to find out, while my husband and I were in our sweets getting ready for the ceremony his mom was outside with the rest of our guests crying and visibly angry. She was telling people that she had never met my parents and that my parents had no interest in meeting her. ( which was a lie). Finding this out days after the wedding upset me greatly. Mainly because my parents were busy setting things up for the wedding and were not present when she was telling our guests this. They had zero chance to defend themselves and his mom made them out to be bad people in front of everyone. My parents are amazing people and were actually very upset that they didn’t get a chance to speak to his mom before she left.  It’s been about a week since the wedding and his mom still hasn’t said anything to him. 

To give more context we’ve been together for 8 years now and I’ve never had a single issue with his mom or his stepdad. I’m writing this here because I don’t want to be disrespectful to her but I don’t know what to do. Please give me some advice anything will help.

ANSWER: I wouldn’t even bother reaching out! She’s a drama queen at its fullest!!

Question: how did yall go about doing the bigger wedding? My husband and I did the same as the first and want to save for a bigger ceremony. Did you just do like a vow renewal? 😩idk what to title it lol

QUESTION: Should I call my mother in law out for getting my 4 month old baby sick???

ANSWER: I would just have your husband reiterate to please not come around sick. It is cold and flu season and as parents you're trying to prevent illness.

If it's something you feel strongly about then I would express it to your husband and work it out between the two of you and let him reach out to his mom. It sounds like the two of you are not on the same page.

I understand the urge to call his mom out, but that really should come from him. It's his baby too, so he also has to make decisions about the baby's health and step up and take initiative.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My in-laws are always at my house.  (Long read)

My in-laws live in a different city. My husband and I have been married for a little over 2 years.  We have a toddler and an infant.  Before we had kids my in-laws only visited one time in the span of 5 years including his siblings with their kids.  Now that we have kids someone flys in to visit and stay with us almost every month.  My in-laws though fly in 5-6 times a year and stay with us for 2 weeks at a time.  TWO WEEKS.  Our place is small and it gets cramped with so many people there.  I’m okay with them staying for one week but TWO?!  I’ve asked my husband if they could occasionally get a hotel for 1 of those 2 weeks and he gets furious with me when I bring that up.  He phrases it like they are there to help me with the kids but they (his parents) don’t help at all.  In fact they make more work for me.  They leave dishes in the sink constantly and it frustrates me so much.  We also only have 2 parking spots where we live.  Sometimes they drive in and my husband expects ME to park my car elsewhere.  When I was pregnant I was walking (with my toddler mind you) 3 blocks away to get to my car and they took my parking spot.  They knew this and didn’t care.  When I was 6 weeks postpartum they “came to help” but honestly just watched me struggle with my toddler and newborn for 2 weeks.  At one point my mother in law was taking a nap on the couch and my father in law was watching football while I was holding my colicky newborn and bagging my milk.  My toddler wanted to play with grandad and he kept shewing them away and saying “not right now I’m watching football”. It infuriated me.  I grabbed my toddler and played with them.  I’m now only 14 weeks postpartum so I’m still having to wash bottles and pump parts on top of the other stuff and I’m potty training my toddler so them creating more work for me and not helping me is sending me over the edge.  Not to mention my husband is on the road a lot for work so he’s not even home most of the time they are visiting so it’s kind of uncomfortable for me.  
My in-laws aren’t bad people.  I actually like them just fine but I’m starting to get very annoyed that they’re always in my house.  My family lives in the same city as us and I don’t even see them as much as I see his family.  
Am I being unreasonable for wanting them to get a hotel sometimes when they come to visit?

ANSWER: Does your husband have any respect or love for you? Why is he such an ass and why does he let his parents trample over you?
Why do you allow all of this?

Hi! Please tell me honestly who might be the problem in this situation. My boyfriend is an only child, and his mom is a single parent who works abroad. She goes back to the Philippines for vacation every year, and every time she comes home, I always feel something odd.
When we go out, they always sit next to each other. They whisper and exchange words only they can hear. I sit on the opposite side and end up talking only to his cousins. This has always been the setup.
I understand that there are errands that only the two of them need to do, but I’m always left at their house, wondering why I can’t come with them. I feel like my boyfriend hasn’t fully separated from his mom emotionally — I don’t know what developmental milestone this would be — or maybe I’m the problem for overreacting, as my boyfriend claims.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Step FIL and comments about women

I have been with my husband for nearly 13 years. His step father is significantly older than his mother and is very friendly, but he's what I would deem as a pig in terms of women.

Because he has a British accent and is charming, he thinks this protects him from being deemed this way. My husband has told me ever since he was young, is stepfather was a flirt. He'd flirt with receptionists, waitresses. And he still does. He ALWAYS harassed the waitress and even makes jokes about how he is going to.

At first I wondered why this bothered me since he wasn't my husband.  But it kept gnawing at me. Everytime we went out, he has to remark and point out which women he finds "attractive." Here's where things get sticky.

He would often look to my husband to join him and would ask him doesent he find her attractive? My husband would respond no, or he doesn't care, and try to change the subject.  My father in law would then get defensive and start talking about how men need to look at women, how all men do it, blah blah. I personally think that's all sexist bullshit, and eventually I said as much. He did not like that.

He is constantly speaking badly of people who aren't thin. He's very very fat phobic and I am not skinny. He makes it known that women need to be attractive for men. When I first told them I had Endometriosis his first comment was "oh my friend had to leave his wife over that. They couldn't have sex so he couldn't stay married to her.

Most of the time my MIL defends him but there was this one time at the beach he pointed at a young mom, looked at my MIL and said "why cant you look like that??" And she was PISSED which was super akward.

Anyways, the older I get the more I hate being around him. It almost feels like he's negging the women around him. My sister in law is a lesbian whose newly single and now I keep hearing of all her "attractive" dates. He seems to always create this hierarchy. He will come up to me and say "youre okay with your husband talking to that pretty friend of yours? I thought you'd be jealous" when I never felt inferior to my friend or weird about my husband having a conversation at dinner with her until he said that. 

I feel uncomfortable existing. I feel like I cant just hang out and not wear makeup,  I dont want to to wear a bathing suit infront of them so he can see my "belly" (he had a NIGHTMARE my MIL got a belly) 

Lastly, ANY bad interaction i have with a female leads to him asking if she was attractive. A woman cut me off in traffic. Was she attractive? My coworker is so mean. Is she attractive? I could be shot and he'd ask me that 

Am I weird for feeling this way?

I just want to add I have major body image issues and an ED.

ANSWER: This makes me feel better because I haven't been going at all. I dont want to socialize with him and it honestly just affects my mental health terribly

================================================================================

QUESTION: I want to cut off in laws but husband doesn’t want it.

I’m so sorry for how long this is but please stick with it. 
My husband and I are married 2 years, we have a 1 year old and are expecting our second early next year! His family have never fully accepted me and throughout the past 3 years It’s been constant passive aggressive remarks. My husband has a sister who is not a nice person at all, husband and I agreed it would be best to cut her off from our family completely and that has been that way for 2 years. My husband was the main instigator in it yet his parents have always blamed me and even sent horrible text messages my way, the sister also sent some nasty messages about me to my husband before he blocked her. 
Last year, while I was in labor in hospital (we were living abroad for context, his mother flew in uninvited a week before the baby was due to be induced due to PPROM), while I’m having contractions, she texts him guilting him that she hasn’t been able to spend much time with him and asks him to go for lunch. 
My baby was eventually born via emergency c section and was rushed into NICU. I didn’t get to see her, first time I laid eyes on her was over FaceTime. The hospital had strict visitation rules. Husband could be there 24/7 and additional birthing partners until 4pm. (My sister was my additional birthing partner), the NICU was open until 10 but visitors had to be accompanied by 1 parent at all times. The day my daughter was born, both his Mother and my sister were invited to come to the NICU and see her. They stayed from 7pm-10pm. They got to hold her etc. 
the following day, my husband gets a text from his mum asking if she could come and see the baby again. I told him, not until later as my sister had to leave (it was 4pm) and I wanted help to have a shower, get pain meds, go to bed and get some sleep but her and my sister could come back at 7pm again like the night before. Well, just after I got out of the shower, NICU requested us immediately. Went to find out that baby was a little more poorly than they thought and she would not be coming home for a few more days but I was ready for discharge. I was devastated that my baby had to stay there and I couldn’t be with her. My husband puts me back in wheelchair and when we get to the post delivery ward, sitting outside is his mother, I’m already crying because of baby staying, and seeing her made me cry even more as it had disregarded my request of going later. Husband bought me into the ward and went to go and talk to her when he received a text saying she was leaving 2 days early, she was going to get a flight home, blamed it on me getting upset at her being in the hospital etc. This obviously upset me even more as I felt I hadn’t done anything and I was just trying to recover and adapt to having a baby but also a baby in NICU. That night I get home without baby…and there she is. In our house still. She didn’t leave early, but the next morning she did leave, without even saying goodbye. 2 weeks postpartum she shows up unannounced again…and stays for 3 weeks but does absolutely nothing to help with the baby…! 
Over the last 18 months of being a mum, I get so much unsolicited parenting advice or she will say stuff like “mommy should have put more layers on you because you’re so cold, silly mummy”…to my 4month old, clearly digging at me. Telling me what I should and shouldn’t do with baby, picking up baby despite being asked to leave her down while she sleeps as I won’t always be able to hold her for naps and I didn’t want her to get too comfortable with always being held during sleep, she picked her up even more. 
This past weekend it came out that his mum has been bitching about me constantly to anyone who will listen and it came back to me. Really hurtful things were said. I want to cut off his family, I feel like it’s been 3 years of trying to beg for his family to treat me with respect and enabling it so my children have a grandma (my mum is sadly dead) but I’m at the point where sacrificing my own happiness isn’t worth a grandma figure. My husband doesn’t want to cut them off and says it should be our children’s decision when they’re old enough. I disagree and think it’s my job to protect them and put their best interest at heart. I want my children to feel loved and wanted and his family don’t do that. She has got 4 aunts/uncles on his side, the never text, call, visit, no birthday and Christmas gifts (despite us sending to their children), great grandparents who have met all the other great grandchildren, but not ours. His mum makes effort with our child but it feels like it’s only done to spite me if that makes sense? 
Would it be unreasonable to cut them off?

ANSWER: Your husband is wrong, and is a horrible person for not having your back against his mother.  Your feelings should ALWAYS be more important than his mother's, and she has proven over and over she doesn't respect you, and won't respect your boundaries. 

Your child will turn out just like him by being around that manipulative woman. If your kid is around her, she will abuse them mentally and emotionally,  just like she did to your husband. 

You staying with your husband should be if he gets therapy NOW, for his enmeshment with his mommy. You are completely right in wanting to protect your child from that toxic, abusive woman.

QUESTION: Addressed my creepy FIL about his behavior…

Today I told my husband’s stepdad that I feel he is inappropriate/creepy. He’s made comments toward me, jokes (which I think is lowkey flirting) and constantly is complimenting me when I’m around. The family thinks, “that’s just how he is.” He’s done it for a while now and I think I should’ve said something way sooner. His response was “have a great day!” I won’t lie, this upset me because it felt like it was dismissive. My husband let him know that his comments are not appropriate and that if l feel uncomfortable, not to expect us at Thanksgiving. 

His stepdad tried to act like he didn’t know what I was talking about and said there was no reason for us not to come to Thanksgiving because it would “solve nothing”. My husband reminded him and he said that he “cares so much about us.” And that if he hurt me, he wants to correct his behavior. 

I sent his stepdad another text asking why when my husband reached out to him, he responded, seemingly remorseful, but when I reached out to him , he ignored me? Like, am I not worth an explanation? A conversation? No response. Hopefully, he does stop with the weird/inappropriate comments and jokes. My husband’s family tries to put on this front that we’re all really close and have the most perfect family unit when there is SO many issues. I just feel like an outsider.  Am I reaching? 

When things have happened in the past (pertaining to me) I’ve always tried to have conversations about it and my husband’s family (specifically his mother and stepdad) either ignore me and create this narrative that I’m trying to start drama. 

Thank you for reading. 

UPDATE: My MIL text my husband this morning and said that I have “gaslit” and “lied” and that she is done! She called, crying, and wouldn’t let me or my husband get a word in and hung up the phone! A long text followed and ofc, I am the reason she is not close with her son. I have twisted her husband‘s words, I am hateful, and a whole lotta other unrelated stuff.

================================================================================

QUESTION: “Divorcing” the in-laws?

I’ve seen a bunch of posts here about “divorcing” your in-laws (going no contact). How does that work in practice?

Is your partner still in contact with their parents?

If so, what are expectations around the holidays, in terms of travel and/or gift giving/receiving?

Are you still in contact with other members of the family, like your spouses siblings, even if you’re not in touch with the parents? 

Do you still participate in large extended family events (weddings, funerals, reunions) if the in-laws will be there? If so, do you interact with them, avoid them, be curt and courteous?

Of course, there are no right answers and no one way to do things. Before my partner and I take this step I’m curious to hear how this has worked for some of you. TIA

FOLLOW UP: Who told your in-laws you were going no contact/taking a step back? Or who explained it to them when they wondered why you stopped engaging? You? Your partner? No one?

ANSWER: I don't know what I'm doing! I'm just hurting, man.

For now:

\-abstaining from all events including weddings and memorial services, taking a break from literally everything

\-not reaching out to folks

\-keeping answers very short or not at all when they do contact me (they don't)

\-letting husband do what he wishes with his family. I'm not coming between him and his family bc that's not my style

\-giving presents to the kids, he can take them over with excuses as to why I couldn't make it (but they know)

\-we're not having people over anytime soon--our home is our private space and his family isn't welcome here

and ALSO I see this as being a "break" or a "short-term" solution to get some space. I can't commit to a lifelong policy of this.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Am I overreacting or is this actually insane? My in-laws are at my house every single day and I am losing my mind.

My husband and I live with my MIL. This is not her house. My husband pays most of the bills and the house technically belongs to his father who passed. My MIL was never married to his dad and they broke up when my husband was an infant. This is not a situation where we are mooching or living in someone else’s space. This is supposed to be our home.

When I was 4 weeks postpartum, my MIL suddenly told us she was picking up her other son from the airport the next night (my husband’s half brother). I asked why and she said he was coming to stay with us so he could work and get a house here for his family. They live a few states away. This man is 45years old, with a wife and four very young kids, and I assumed he at least had a job lined up or some kind of plan. Absolutely nothing. No job. No plan. No house. No money. Nothing. He showed up with a suitcase and just moved himself onto our couch.

He stayed for almost 3 months. He barely worked. He was always on the couch. I was extremely uncomfortable around him. He is irritated by crying kids, he gives off weird vibes, and I felt unsafe breastfeeding in the living room because he was always there. It forced me to isolate in my room for months. He is genuinely a loser and I cannot sugarcoat that.

Now he finally brought his wife and their kids here this week, and I thought it would be over because he wouldn’t live here anymore. It is somehow worse. They all come over every single day. Four kids. A wife. Noise. Mess. Chaos. 

My son is almost four months old. He does not have the immune system for this. One of their kids is sick right now and they keep bringing him over. Never do I hear them telling that kid to cover his mouth when he coughs or stay away from my baby. I do not want their germs around my baby or their rough kids around his toys. I have to hide in my room anytime they show up. I cannot use my own living room. I cannot cook in my own kitchen. The house is small and they take up every inch of it.

On top of that, we already have two small dogs who stay in my MIL’s room to keep them separated from the baby. They have a big dog with a severely wounded, bleeding paw that has also been staying here. I cannot even continue to work on my organization project in the garage because I do not want a dog with a bloody paw jumping on me or tracking blood through the space.

Every day they take over the house. Today I wanted to clean my bathroom and vacuum. My bathroom is in my bedroom so I needed to keep the baby out of the room to avoid the harsh chemicals. I wanted to let the baby nap, clean the living room while he slept, then put him on his play mat afterward out there so I could finish bleaching and let the air circulate. They showed up while he was napping without me knowing. He woke up because they are so loud and of course I could not do any of my plans because the entire living room was taken over by them for hours.

Yesterday I wanted to clean the fridge. Cannot do that either because they were all in the tiny kitchen and I could not set my baby down in the living room because random kids were already in and out of there. Over the weekend, my husband and I had friends over to watch a game. My MIL invited my BIL and his entire family over, even though she was not going to be home. We told them our plans to have friends over and they still showed up. They brought laundry and did multiple loads using our utilities which my husband pays for. Meanwhile their kids were crying because they wanted to watch Bluey on our TV while we had guests over. It’s annoying we have to schedule when to use our own living room, kitchen, and laundry. 

I honestly do not know who I should even be mad at anymore. My MIL for inviting them constantly like this is normal? My BIL and his wife for being inconsiderate and barging into our space every single day? They have had babies. They know what postpartum is like. How do they not understand how intrusive this is?

My husband has been supportive. He agrees this is out of control and he has started looking for a place for us to move. What hurts is that this is supposed to be our home. The original plan was for his mom to eventually move to a smaller place in a senior community when our son gets bigger and needs his own room. Also,  for us to stay here as we start to raise and build our family. But I genuinely cannot last that much longer living like this. We’ve been holding on thinking this situation is temporary but it feels like there’s no end in sight. 

Is this actually normal to anyone? Or am I right for feeling like my entire home and postpartum experience are being stolen from me?

ANSWER: No, this isn't normal. Who is actually on the deed of the house? If it is your husband, than he can give mil eviction notice.

QUESTION: In-laws putting stress on me and my marriage!

I am a U.S Navy veteran, after getting out of the military me and my wife decided to move to Kansas where her parents were moving to from Colorado. When we moved here we had nothing and so my in laws had allowed us to stay with them for a year or so and we were paying rent and helping with bills until we could get on our feet and find our own place to live.

We found a rental in August of 2023 and decided to move in there and we had lived there for a year before we had found out that my FIL had lost his job so we decided to move out and move back in with them to help them pay bills and what not because we could not afford to pay for 2 households worth of bills. 

Since being in the military I had gotten my disability to go up to 100% disability and I work a small job doing construction inspections and going to school all at the same time. It came to about May of 2025 when me and my wife were ready to live on our own again and buy our own home. We had to both of my in laws that with this home that we are buying we would no longer be able to pay for there bills anymore and my FIL has a job and they said that they were fine with that. 

All along this timeline I had received back pay for my disability and I had given them a lump sum of about $15k to help them and say thank you for giving us a place when we had no where else to go. 

Fast forward to now and me and my wife are expecting our first baby here in June of 2026. My FIL no longer has a job and we are trying to build our future and pay our bills. A couple hundred dollars is no big deal to lend but when we are being asked to pay all of their bills and some of them including a $150 Hulu bill is a little bit out of hand and continuing to pay for all of their groceries! Etc. 

I haven’t spoke to my wife about this but I have brought it up in the past and she keeps telling me that she won’t let her parents go homeless. But how are we able to support our future family if we are keep paying upwards of $2000 a month to support your family as well and then being asked to buy them beer and pay for their property taxes which is $6700 a year. We can’t get ahead to begin with but we are struggling finically even more trying to help them out. 

It feels like we are constantly drowning and I don’t know what to do anymore! Please help!

ANSWER: Your wife has a kid to look out for now. Her parents can collect social security or look out for themselves. You need to put your kid first, find a stable place without moochers, and be real you can’t keep helping them. You already have given them thousands

================================================================================

QUESTION: How to navigate in laws who only help or care for other grandkids and not yours

My husband is the eldest of all his siblings, and he’s also the one who has his life together. He did really well in school, got a job at a law firm, and started his own company. When we had our daughter, our business had just started taking off, and we really needed help. We told my mother-in-law that we were going to hire a nanny, and she insisted we give her the money instead and she would take care of our daughter.

During this time, she did a terrible job taking care of her. Our daughter was left in front of the TV for hours, she was always hungry when we picked her up, and she consistently had dirty diapers. We confronted my mother-in-law about this, but she never changed anything.

When we later had our son, my mom came to help for the first few months. Eventually, we decided to hire a real nanny, especially because our daughter needed more therapy and was attending a special school. Even though my mother-in-law hadn’t cared for the kids in over a year, she still wanted my husband to pay her the same “nanny” money.

Around this time we also discovered that she was using that money to buy gifts for all her other children and their spouses, and she was giving money to her adult kids who are frankly deadbeats. Once we learned this, my husband and I decided to cut her off financially.

As my husband’s siblings began having children, my mother-in-law went out of her way for them. She babysits their kids for free, takes them to activities and events, helps out at their homes, and has even taken their kids on vacations and cruises—while never once inviting or including our children. She’s helped her deadbeat kids with down payments on houses and other financial support.

She used to come by our house claiming she wanted to “spend time with the kids,” but all she did was sit and watch them play video games or watch TV. She’d leave within 30 minutes because she “had to go help” her other children. She hosts parties for her other grandchildren but has never offered to host anything for ours. She buys those grandkids nice gifts and gives mine cheap dollar-store knockoffs.

On top of that, she frequently asks my husband to pay for her smaller personal expenses. One of her sons—recently divorced—lives with her and pays zero bills. Her daughter drops her child off randomly, and my mother-in-law happily takes care of that child without hesitation.

My husband, being a good and generous person, has always helped her when she asked. But we eventually discovered she was using the money he gave her to continue supporting her other kids. I finally confronted her and told her she is not fair to my children, and that I wanted to end contact because she clearly does not treat them equally. She never apologized or acknowledged her behavior.

My husband even spoke to her in person, but she still refused to take responsibility for anything she’s done or the way she has made us feel. Despite all this, she continues inviting us to random weekday dinners—knowing full well our kids have school, homework, and activities.

I told my husband that I will no longer go to her house and that I expect him not to go either. But he didn’t listen, and he went anyway.

Am I the asshole here? How am I supposed to navigate all of this?

ANSWER: You can’t change her behavior or your husband’s behavior, unfortunately.  You can’t ask your husband to go to counseling with you to get him to understand how upset you are, but if he refuses, you’re going to have to live with it.  People don’t change very much once they’re adults.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I live with my husband’s family in Pakistan and I’m emotionally exhausted. I don’t know how much longer I can do this.

I’m a 30’s woman, not from Pakistan, and I came to Pakistan and living in Pakistan with my husband and his family. I really need some outside perspective because I’m reaching a breaking point.

For the past month, I’ve been trying very hard to spend time with his family, thinking I “should” be a good wife and show that I’m trying. I’ve stayed near them, joined family time, forced myself to be around everyone even when I didn’t want to. But the truth is… it’s draining me to the point I can’t keep doing it.

The differences in food, daily rhythm, conversation style, reading the room, facial expressions—small things on their own, but together they exhaust me. Even though no one is intentionally unkind, I constantly feel like an outsider or an “intruder.” This house is his family’s house, not mine. No matter how welcoming they are, I don’t feel like I belong here.

Recently, I’ve reached a point where I don’t even want to hear Urdu anymore. Even when his siblings speak to me kindly in English, I still feel overwhelmed. I end up isolating myself in the basement just to breathe.

I don’t hate his family. But I don’t feel any connection with them. I don’t know what to talk about, and I honestly have no emotional capacity left. Right now, I can’t accept anything about living in Pakistan.

Another issue: my husband has always been very close to his family. Even when we lived in overseas, we fought because he called them at least 2-3 times every day. Now that we’re in Pakistan, I have even less freedom. I can’t go out alone, my life feels limited and monotonous, and I feel like he spends more time and emotional energy on them than on our marriage.

I know he loves his family, and I respect that. But as long as we live with them, my feelings of isolation, frustration, and loneliness won’t disappear. I feel like I’m slowly losing myself.



Has anyone been in a similar situation—living with in-laws in a different culture, feeling isolated and losing your sense of self? How did you cope? Did anything actually help, or did you eventually leave? I’m really lost and could use some advice.

ANSWER: I don’t know if this will be helpful or not but everything you have described it is what normal Pakistani girls go through with their in-laws. I’m assuming you are not Pakistani which is why this might feel a lot worse. The only thing I can really think of is moving out which again is a little bit uncommon in Pakistan or it would be divorced.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Christian reformed in-laws (echo chamber) causing struggle in my marriage

I 26F am a practicing and raised Catholic and my husband 26M is a Catholic convert (in-laws believed he was becoming Catholic because of me). He grew up in a family where everyone (even extended extended family) are Christian Reformed. His parents only would pay for his college if he attended a Christian reformed college and he grew up in a bubble only surrounded by these people and they always told him date a Dutch Christian Reformed Girl and so on in every aspect of his life (he disliked this, complained about it and did his own thing). As a Catholic and someone who will raise my kids to create and follow their own path in life, this was hard for me. My Husband found the Catholic Church and joined me. I have mixed feelings around his family 5 years in and a lot of feeling like I am not good enough when around them (unless I was reformed too). I am a very bold Catholic and will unashamedly speak the Truth. I also grew up in a great home where we always practiced Catholicism, but my parents didn’t mind where I went to college and even sent us to a Lutheran preschool since it was highly rated. While my family has always been practicing Catholics, we have known it to be the Truth, but I did not grow up in an echo chamber like my husband did. There are days we consider cutting them off for a while, but I am left wondering if this is the right call.

ANSWER: Hi, former CRC kid here! I’m probably distantly related to your husband but we don’t need to play Dutch Bingo to confirm 😂  

I didn’t realize until my mid-thirties why I carried such a wild bias against Catholicism; turns out when your faith history is born from men who based their reformed religion on hatred of the church they separated from, you…are instilled with a 500 year old, really stupid bias that makes you stubbornly blind to how other people’s faith practices are just as valid and sincere as your own!   

It runs deeply in the CRC identity, unfortunately. Growing up, I was never allowed to attend mass with a catholic friend (the basic vibe being: “we are real Christians but Catholics aren’t really real Christian’s”). It’s ignorant and egotistical and I’m sorry you’re dealing with this garbage.   

I mean, maybe the church that follows the guy who decided to remove entire books of the bible that he didn’t like, could stand to learn a few lessons about being humble and maybe just get over their silly ego, but I won’t be holding my breath waiting for that 😂  

At the end of the day, it’s pretty sad that they spend so much time “judging the splinter in your eye while ignoring the 2x4 sticking out of their own”…but hey, why adhere to that bible verse when you can just be smug and judgemental about others? 

no religious trauma here for me to deal with, nope

QUESTION: Mom wants to stay at our place for a month

For context, my mom went to her home country and needs to be back in the states to apply for disability before returning there for good for retirement. She needs a place to stay and my husband and I are the only place that’s available. My other 3 siblings live with roommates.

Our apartment is small with one bedroom and one bathroom. Am I making a big deal? I moved out at a young age to get away from the dominance of my family and living with my mother was not so great either. Tending to have strong opinions about other people’s lifestyle and has no problem with gossip and criticism. Thought I don’t hold a grudge my mother has helped me tremendously. 

She’s in her 60’s and doesn’t work. So it’s between my siblings and I to send her money for groceries, and support her. 

What should I do? I hate company even when it comes to my own people. I like my space. What should I do in this instance?

ANSWER: You simply don’t have room for her to stay for a month. Tell her you’ll help her find an Airbnb nearby and, if your budget allows, you could offer to help with the cost? Your sanity and comfort will thank you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: What does a normal healthy relationship between son, MIL, and FIL look like?

What does a normal healthy relationship between son, MIL, and FIL look like? Maybe I have things misconstrued when it comes to what my partners relationship should look like with his parents. 

Currently my FIL is telling me that he's gonna cut us off bc his son doesn't talk to his mom (MIL) much anymore. His dad thinks he needs to "mend their relationship" and have a "deep conversation with his mom about how she's made him feel in the past". Which honestly isn't even the root of the issue. The real issue is that my partner doesn't talk to or spend much time with them anymore bc if a few reasons.

1. We just had our first baby. She just turned 6 months old. We are still trying to figure this sh out.
2. My partner works full time, while I'm a SAHM bc we just weren't comfortable sending our baby to daycare at only 3 months old. So the little time my partner does have off work, he wants to spend it with us. 
3. His mom has screamed and yelled at him in the past on numerous occasions when my partner didn't do what she wanted when she wanted. For ex: she would call him up out of the blue and ask him to help her clean out her storage unit. When my partner would inevitably say no, she would freak out on him and start screaming at him.
4. To me, it's normal to see "extended family or relatives" once a month or every 2 months. Not once a week. Which is what it sounds like his FIL is wanting his son to do. 

With all that in mind, I'm wondering what is a healthy amount of time to spend with your parents? What's normal? Is it normal for him to talk to his mom once a week? Is it normal to tell her anytime he is going to see FILs side of the family so she can choose to be there based on if we are there? (MIL and FIL are divorced and have been for some decades). Things like that. 

My family isn't estranged by no means. But my mom lives 1.5 away and on top of that I'm a recluse. I am very "keep to myself" type person. Seeing people too often drains my battery. Seeing his mother specifically, puts me PAST empty bc she's high energy. 

My partner is also a recluse and again with all the above stuff going on, to me it's unreasonable to expect him to talk to his mother and see her anything more then how often we see FIL. Which is like...once a month.

My FIL tried to "appeal" to my side of saying "well if your mom said she would come up to see you once a week just to spend time with you, what would you say? I'm sure it'd be different." I said um no it wouldn't. I would tell her that it's too much. Also honestly my mom would think that's too much as well AND my mom and I have the opportunity to see each other every week but we choose not too. I did tell him that last part. 

I get everyone is raised differently, but to me his expectations of what his sons relationship should look with his mother (FILS ex wife) is over the top and leaning towards enmeshment.

ANSWER: There's no normal here. Normal is whatever works for your family.

QUESTION: I need tips on dealing with my toxic and narcissistic and victim complex SIL

WARNING: This is kinda of me venting about her behavior tbh but I want to share my experience in hopes someone else is dealing with something similar and has some tips on how to keep the peace and my sanity without blowing up some day and looking like the AH. 

Context: My partner of 3 years fiancé of 1 year has 2 older sisters the 1 is great she’s a lot older with quite an age gap and is honestly great completely supportive of us and minds her business with our relationship as she has children of her own and a husband of 25 years the OTHER sister we’ll call her “Felicia” is closer in age to my partner and is honestly just a mean spirited narcissistic individual and is constantly trying to get into our business and is enmeshed with my partner. I have a theory that Felicia suffers from sick kid syndrome as she had an illness growing up and a lot of trauma as the 3 of them lost their father a decade ago. However as I am disabled with a birth defect and have plenty of trauma of my own I don’t see that as a reasonable excuse to treat literally every person in your life not just me as POS. I’m also not an only child and have 4 siblings myself so i know the dynamics of siblings and this ain’t it. 

Now for her behavior: for starters she may not like me for all i know but I truly do not think she tries to intentionally cause problems with me or get under my skin i genuinely think and have observed she’s like this with everyone in her life. It’s her world and everyone is just living in it. literally the first day i met her Felicia made a point to tell me that growing up my partner constantly has been in her shadow since they’re so close in age. I did find that as a strange comment to say at the time but knowing what I know of her now I know that is not true at all, my partner constantly tries to live his own life and she’ll try to hold him back if he tries to accomplish anything that she hasn’t done first and manipulates any situation where my partner or anyone else is getting attention to twist the attention back onto herself just typical narcissistic weird bitch behavior. Some examples as my partner and I started dating she literally made it a mission of hers to find her own partner as Felicia kept telling everyone it wasn’t fair she was the last single sibling? WEIRD. She does get a partner after 6 months of searching and then stresses her whole family that the holiday season had to be absolutely perfect as it was Felicia and her partner’s first holiday season it was also my partner and I first holiday season together so I found it odd to want to control other people’s behavior? Then after 2 years my partner and I decided to take the next step and to live together and in the process we very briefly were looking at houses just because I have a dog and wanted to have a yard for my dog etc it wasn’t even a serious house hunt either just let’s go to a few open houses and then we settled on a dog friendly condo to rent. However Felicia caught wind of us looking at some houses completely freaked out and demanded a brother/sister meeting and told my partner he had her “blessing” to take the next step of living with me but a house was a terrible idea as we were not married. my partner explained it was only an idea we toyed with when looking for places and ended up renting a condo instead so she was panicked about nothing and as he’s a grown man he doesn’t need Felicia’s blessing for anything as his life’s choices is none of her business which led to a victim complex type sobbing filled meltdown that led my partner to believe he did something wrong to her. WEIRD. My partner had a big 30th birthday before we moved in so he asked for a few home goods as gifts and it led to Felicia  standing up as he was opening gifts to announce that her and her UNMARRIED partner were house hunting almost like it killed her the attention was on her brother on his own birthday and not her. WEIRD. They ended up not finding a house impressive enough and she moved into her partners apartment. This caused a huge rift with her bff that she lived with as she literally broke the news to her friend that she was moving out and that her friend needed a new roommate by telling them the day Felicia was moving out by pulling up in a uhaul and she still to this day doesn’t know how that’s wrong and that her friends just “a single lonely jealous bitch” (Felicia’s words not mine) WEIRD. A year ago my partner proposed to me and when he told his family she had another crying fit meltdown that she was going to be the last sibling to get married no congratulations or nothing. WEIRD. We get married next year (2026) and now with Trump being president and millions loosing their health insurance and or insurance premiums doubling, Felicia convinced her partner they should get legally married and have a reception in January 2026 so her partner can go on her insurance plan and she will not be the last sibling to get married my partner will be instead “a win win for them!” WEIRD. They’re not yet engaged but… (this one’s not that bad just personal pet peeve of mine I find disrespectful) Felicia’s partner got his mothers first engagement ring and they took it to a jeweler for her to completely destroy and butcher the ring. The mother’s ring is a 3 emerald cut stone ring that Felicia completely wants to trash and rearrange to make it look exactly like Taylor swifts ring as she’s a huge swiftie. WEIRD. I totally get the insurance thing but my partner and I can’t help given her behavior it’s all a master plan for her to A: get married before my partner and B: try to take away any attention we might receive from our wedding plans and events and put it on to her. WEIRD. She’s also constantly recycling friend groups whenever they disagree or call her out on anything she takes it as they’re just bitches trying to attack her. Whenever anyone ever tries to correct her on her behavior she cries that everyone’s just out to get her. Felicia also caused a rift with the other sister because Felicia told the other sister she doesn’t know how to control her ADULT children and is a shitty mother. (Felicia isn’t a mother herself btw) and ofcourse the sister took her children’s side. Big no no in Felicia’s eyes which led to 2 years of trying to convince everyone else in the family the other sister and kids are toxic and we should all excommunicate from them but we didn’t so we took “the wrong side” she also drunk texts people “who’ve wrong her” to “delete themselves” including the sister and kids which led to them having to change phone numbers. Felicia once in an argument with her partner decided to pee on his floor to win an argument??? She’s VILE. Anyone who confronts her and tries to explain to her that in these situations Felicia is the common denominator in all of them so she needs to change her behavior and that she’s too old to act this way, Felicia cuts off as they’re just toxic and trying to bring her down etc. 

Honestly I can just keep going she’s super narcissistic thinks everyone should drop everything for her to make time for her etc. interrupts every conversation to make it by herself. Makes super nasty and or back handed comments. Is super manipulative etc but this post is just way too long already and really I just need some tips and advice to help me tolerate her so I don’t explode one day. I know people are going to suggest to stop communication with her and my partner and I have talked about it before as she’s always been this way and isn’t changing but we feel with our wedding coming up now’s not the time as someone with siblings myself I could imagine one of them not being at my wedding and don’t want my partner to regret her not being there etc. So I just need extra strength to survive the year till we regroup with our options if she’s still a nightmare. Thanks!

ANSWER: I have considered that but my partner assures me if she tries anything at the wedding she’d be told to leave I also just don’t want to push the idea of uninviting her onto my partner if that’s not 1000% what he wants like I know she’ll probably just blame me if he does but I’d just prefer it to be his decision and his doing if that makes sense we do have a year to go so who knows what she’ll pull leading up to it that mind change his mind lol

ANSWER: MIL, I can tell that you’re a bit out of sorts. What can we do to improve your (mood, comfort, satisfaction)? 
C’mon, you don’t need to be uncomfortable all day, let’s fix what ails you.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My FIL just called me at 10pm to talk about my MIL and I'm reeling. UPDATE!!

So FIL called me this morning to "finish the conversation" and basically told me that he was choosing to cut us out of his life (his son, currently only grandchild, and me. If you didn't read the last post.) bc he felt so guilty about him being able to see us and not MIL. Bc he "treated (my partner) so bad when he was a kid and feels like bc of that she deserves it more. Bc she was "protecting the kids from him when they were younger bc he was really mean and abusive". 

Here's the thing. He went to therapy for his issues and got better. MIL hasn't went to therapy and up until recently decided that she wanted to change and "better herself". I told him that my partner and I are basing our issues off of how we were treated when we were together and that FIL didn't do anything to us directly but MIL did. He said he knows, he is just being selfish bc it's "causing him a lot of anxiety to the point where he can't even work and that it risks people's lives if he isn't focused at work". 

I said ok well you talk about all this anxiety but I currently feel the exact same, if not worse amount of anxiety towards MIL bc of what she did. But I'm currently choosing to take baby steps towards having a good relationship with her for my partner, not for anyone else. He then went on to say that well everybody has a choice and you can either choose to be the bigger person and commit too it or you can choose take the easy way out and say sorry bout it. I then said so....you're choosing to take the easy way out? He paused. Then said "at this current time I am." 

So to me he's being a huge hypocrite, basically trying to pressure and guilt us into having a relationship with MIL. But HE can take the easy way out and just be allowed to walk back into our lives Willie nillie?? Like WHAT. He said "when she comes of age, old enough to understand and if she decides she wants to talk to me then I'll tell her the truth. That I felt like I shouldn't have a relationship with her bc of my guilt of how horrible of a father I was to her dad."  To me, he is expecting an enmeshed family dynamic bc that is what he is used too. My family is NOT like that and never will be. 

I attempted using a few examples of the assault to get him to understand (ex: how would you feel if someone apart of your family physically assaulted your current gf, etc) our side of things and he kept saying things like "that's not what I'm talking about, that's not the point" he also said that "well idk how I would feel, bc it's never gotten to this extreme in our family. We just let things go bc were family and I think a lot of the problem with the family is that we feel like (my partner) picked you over his family. Which is hurtful bc for our family we always have each other's backs on everything." Isn't that what a partner/husband/SO is supposed to do? We are the family he decided to create and we are definitely a priority over the family he came from. So idk what he's expecting? To me that's not normal. 

Edit to add to the above paragraph: he told me that he wouldn't know he would feel, but he would pick his family over any relationship. 

I honestly think what he is choosing is seriously f up and I told him that and I SHIT YOU NOT, this man agreed with me! Then went on to say he's doing it for his own selfish reasons. I'm like ok, you're just making it easier for me, now I don't have to be the bad guy. Then I said the only thing I ask is if/when your family decides to ask you why you tell them the truth. I don't want that to cause more stress for my family. 

Edit to add: when I tell you my therapist had a hay day with this, I'm not kidding 😂. She's even excited for our next visit to hear more "juicy details".

ANSWER: So weird. And he tells you this, but not your partner? Oh, well, he's made his choice. Move on and don't give him a thought. It's one less person telling you to make nice with your awful MIL.

QUESTION: I can’t take it anymore

I 24F can’t take dealing with my in laws. I know so many people think “justtt don’t see them anymore plain and simple! Ghost them” but I genuinely cannot stand any of them. I always feel like an outcast but expected to show up. When any one of them are around me alone they don’t talk but when they are around each other they have so many conversations (not nice ones it’s always talking shit about someone and their looks and everything) I genuinely do not mesh well with people that do nothing but talk shit about others. I just feel judged whenever I say smth nice about someone. I just chose to keep my mouth shut a lot because also they twist my words making it like I said smth to offend them. I will literally be saying something nice to them and they will be like huh?? Did u mean it in this way? And girl no I was trying to compliment u😭 I just don’t get their way of thinking

Right now we are planning a thanksgiving potluck. I’m not terrible at cooking but I have to give it to them they are pretty good cooks. So when I make smth it’s not nearly as good as theirs and they JUDGE so hard. They find the worst things about me and judge me and make a big deal out of it. I’m so stressed on what to make everyone. I’m even moving away which is the only thing keeping me going but they already are talking about how they want to come visit the place I’m going to and they went there before and when they go I have to invite everyone over and feed them. I’m so stressed and if I buy everyone food it can come off as lazy to them. I considered divorce because I hate them. We see each other every weekend and I dread weekends because I hate it so much. I can’t do this I need a huge break from them. I’m falling apart I’m not even myself when I’m around them. My friends say I’m funny, goofy, sweet. They see me as naive, dumb, air head, girl who doesn’t know how to do anything, boring. It really affects my mental health. I got into too many fights with them. About them being mad I talked back to their shade throwing, for example, one day I didn’t know where my husband was all I knew is he was with his brother. My SIL and MIL kept asking where he is and why don’t I know where he is and I should always know. My SIL implied if I keep this up he’s gonna come home with another girl one day and I snapped back saying that she shouldn’t be talking bc her husband goes on business trips every week (the house went silent it was awkward as HELL). She also said my husband (her brother)will “look outside the house” because I don’t wear thongs 😭 what the hell is that supposed to mean? From my knowledge my husband has never been a cheater. Idk what’s wrong with her. They always try to get me jealous and insecure saying my husband likes blond girls and strong minded girls (the opposite of me). And ALWAYYSSS point out if a girl is staring too hard at my husband or they make it up to

================================================================================

QUESTION: MIL turning 100

My MIL will be 100 in about 3 months.  She wants everyone to go to a party.   My husband and I have been married for 53 years.   She hates me because she thinks (falsely) that he changed his college major from pre-med to English because of me.   That actually was his own decision.

To sum up:  she has had a total of 4 daughters-in-law (2 are now dead but they were not young) and has shown contempt for 3 of us.  She keeps her cards very close to her vest, but she never asks about me.   She lives up in the Denver area at a high altitude.   I don't much like going there because it's hard on my heart failure.   Right now, both my husband and myself are dementing rapidly.    We match each other a bit:  he cannot do the computer but I can (with many typos and revising).   He had an enormous stroke in 1993 and she came to the hospital and he said a 4 letter word (he was in the throes of brain damage, frontal lobe) and it was suddenly as if he was no longer a person in her life.   He calls her about once a month and now about every two weeks.  He conceals his dementia and she never asks about me.

We did go to her 75th, 80th, 85th, 90th, 93rd, and 98th birthday events.  And many before.  She is slightly over 1,500 miles from us so travel is always going to be demanding.

In my opinion, she actively dislikes us but loves to have HUGE parties.  If this is like the rest, we will be additional numbers for her count but she will not have time to speak to us.    We have never had a party for ourselves.  I am aware that we are introverts and she's an extrovert.   I am also aware that she hates immigrants with a passion that makes me queasy about for whom she has voted.

Here are our options:

1). Try to pull it off--I think we would have to hire a paid companion to take care of us.

2) Explain very honestly to her that we are too old and demented to travel so far.

3) In 1976 she refused to lend me money to go to my father's funeral and in 1981 she refused another daughter-in-law (now dead) a loan to go to HER father's funeral.  Considering that information, does she really deserve to be the Queen of Everything?  She has persisted in saying for over 50 years that my wedding was the beginning of the end for her own mother, who twisted an ankle on the occasion.

4). Her son, my spouse, openly admits that she does not like people who are not at least moderately wealthy.  She has said quite recently that he could have cured cancer had he become a med student like she wanted.  But he did not want to do that.

So----29 people are invited and there's a big party room rented.

Are we justified in staying home?  I have no idea how demented we will be. I've moved into sundowning which is truly frightening.   It feels like a bad trip.

For the record:  she can be utterly delightful to people she likes, and there are many of them.  It seems as if she is partial to a couple of her sons and her grandchildren.    I think that it's possible that the only people she has ever aggravated are me and another dil.

ANSWER: Oh please stay home! She will probably forget who was even there

K... I need second opinions here. I found it super weird. 
So basically I switched jobs, and we told the in-laws in passing while catching up. 

My DH was the one who mentioned it over the phone. MILs tone changed and she asked him to pass the phone to me. Her first question was, why did you change? I told her that I didn't find the current job challenging enough, so I realigned to something different in my field. 

Her next question was.... And is that pay better now? 
I found that a bit rude. People change jobs for benefits yes.... But having a new stimulating environment especially after maternity leave could be a benefit too.... 

Is it just me, but it felt very invasive as if her impression of me was that I was just greedy for $$ 

K thanks bye!

ANSWER: "I'm sure you understand that's a private matter between my employer and me." Make very sure your husband doesn't share your private information with her.   Nothing of your medical, personal or financial information should be discussed with anyone!

================================================================================

QUESTION: My MIL attacked me 8 months ago and my husband is going to Thanksgiving with them this year and I'm having a hard time dealing with it.

(Edit at the bottom after reading comments) 
Hello all! I tried posting this in another sub but it got removed. I'm shortening it because it was honestly just a lot of rambling but this is some context for what I need to rant/ask about. It's still a long story so if you just want to read my thanksgiving concerns, I'll mark it with some lines. Most of this is context. The title pretty much sums it up if you don't want to read it all.

-----Context and story-----
It's a very, very, VERY long story but the relationship that I have with my in-laws is a classic tale of weird resentment towards me for dating their son/brother/grandson. I've always felt like the temporary girlfriend, even while we were engaged two years into our relationship. 
It has consisted of a lot of accusing me of trying to take him from his family and manipulating him every time he has his own opinions. His mom and I had fought before the first year we were together and she got in my face and told her husband to "get this stupid b-tch out of my face before I f-ck her up" and when I had left, I found out recently, she said "I was this close to choking her". Anyway, that got "resolved" with a talk where she, once again, threatened me and said "I swear to God, I will come across this f-ing desk, and beat the f-cking sh-t out of you" while leaning over the desk and putting her finger in my face. Great lady.

That was about a year into us dating (almost 2 years) and everything was fine until the beginning of this year. We had moved in with them at the end of 2023 and we just moved out and got our own place in February. I packed his room mostly by myself because I was home more often than him. I left stuff there for him because it was his childhood room and there were things that I didn't want to throw out just in case it was important to him. It took him about two and half weeks to get to it and his grandma called on a Wednesday and told him if he didn't finish his room that Saturday that she would do it and get it over with because his brother was rushing. She, along with his entire family, was calling and texting every single day including the morning of the Saturday we were planning to come over. He told them multiple times not to touch anything and that we would be there. 
We got a call from his brother, a few hours after his grandma called, saying that the room was done and that they threw most of it away. I lost my sh-t a little bit, I know I screwed up there but if you knew all of the history you would know how many things we have let go to keep the peace and how much they lack the consideration of what others want and ask of them, and my husband's mom ended up getting involved and yelling at me. We went and were silent the whole time while his grandma was constantly grabbing me and trying to make me talk to her, while also making comments like "sorry it pissed you off" and "I don't know why you're so mad" with a condescending tone. Eventually, we had to get the last thing which was a surprise that my husband had for our wedding which was in two months, which happened to be in the room where my MIL was sitting. It was something very special to me and I got emotional and then his mom said "must be nice cutting off your family and not even caring", and I said stfu (which was supposed to be under my breath but I accidentally said it a little loud:D), which I regretted faster than immediately, and she screamed at me and got up and stormed toward me. I didn't say anything else because I knew I f-ed up, but she kept screaming. I kept walking and left the yard and got to my car but she was still screaming and walking towards me (which also for reference, she is at least 3ft taller than me and 300lbs compared to my 5'5 180lb self). My husband got in front of me while I was doing something and I turned around and she pushed into him and grabbed my neck. I freaked out and punched her. It all blew up quickly and everyone had to hold her until I drove off a couple of minutes later because she was still coming at me and calling me names and threatening me. 
I cut them all off and blocked them, including my dad who sided with them and was telling them lies about me.
I know where I f-ed up in the whole thing and I apologized to the people I needed to and never received any apologies from anyone. It continued to get worse after my husband had a meeting with his mom a month after the whole situation and it led to his mom admitting a lot and saying a lot of screwed up things about me. I have grown a lot of resentment and I don't associate myself with any of them anymore. 

-----End of context-----

What's going on currently is that, after everything that has happened, my husband still talks to them. Mildly, but he does. I understand why he does because he's been through a lot and he has dealt with a lot of stuff from them which doesn't make him feel like he can be his own person or have boundaries or opinions. 
Anyway, that is not the issue. The issue for me is that he is going to their house for Thanksgiving because he's trying to keep peace. I feel like an a-hole for being upset about him going with his family because at the end of the day, they're still his family and I would never force him to do anything, but I feel like he's trying to save the feelings of people who have never cared for anyone but themselves. It's frustrating to see him so conflicted with something like this. 
I want to clarify that I in no way am upset with him for having a hard time, I'm just frustrated over the hold that they have over him and I feel like I need some guidance in what to do to be there for him without making him resent me for cutting out his family. I don't want to let any bias take over my comforting him but it's so hard watching him coddle these people's feelings when all they do is hurt other people to benefit themselves. Has anyone else dealt with this???

-------------

Edit: Hey everyone! I wanted to edit this to say, thank you all for your comments and help. I appreciate anything I can get. I wanted to clarify some things that I think a lot of the comments weren't understanding. This may be long. 

First thing that I'm going to say is that my husband has been dealing with these manipulative people his entire life and I feel that that needs to be emphasized. A lot of comments were saying how pathetic he is for putting up with this and not leaving. He is in therapy and I don't know if many of you have been in therapy but it takes a long time to get to specific situations when you have to work through over 20 years of trauma and feelings that you grew up never being able to express.
Another thing I wanted to clarify is that he doesn't talk to them as much as this post may make it seem, though I tried to make that clear with little context and history as to not make this an essay. He picks up the phone when they call, which is at least 3 times a month (at most 6) and each call is from a different person. They never text him and they have events at their house once a month, if even that. He has not talked to my dad since April (a month after this started). He is the lowest contact that he can be and I feel that some of you need to be more open minded. 

This situation isn't as cut and dry as it may seem. There have been many years of dealing with these people and it's not as simple as it looks. I could write about every single thing that my husband has been through, and what I have separately been through in this situation and my own life, but some don't appreciate the length of this already and I'm sure wouldn't want the bigger story. 

Again, thank you for the comments. I do appreciate all of you, even the harsh ones. I hope I can give an update once no contact is initiated.

ANSWER: He wouldn’t need to come home afterwards he could just stay with mummy.  Sorry he is such a wuss and doesn’t stand up for you

QUESTION: Rant because what is even wrong with these people🤣

In-laws are angry about the name we've picked out for our son (currently 31 weeks pregnant) we have chosen Ashton, will be Ash for short,  said it was a stupid name and that he will get made fun of and "for the love of god dont name him that", then proceeded to tell us they will not be calling him by his name /nickname but an entirely different name (original name we were going to go with that they did like, but we decided NOT to go with, Beau) LOL 

I just cant with these people, they drive me crazy on a good day but this one is really irritating me 🤣

ANSWER: Tell them that if they try that stunt of not calling your baby by his given name then the favor will be returned and they won't be going by the grandma/grandpa names they want to use. Instead they'll be going by: Mr.& Mrs. Theirlastname. They are not the third parents and don't get to call the shots. BTW Ashton is a cute and wonderful name, l love it!

QUESTION: I seriously need some perspective on whether this boundary is reasonable or if I’m losing it from stress

So my (F20) husband (M19) is currently in basic training. This last year before he left, his parents split up because his dad cheated and ran off with another woman. Since then, his dad and the girlfriend have just been nonstop drama.
Before my husband left, he told me straight up that he did not want his dad at his graduation. He was really hurt, and on top of that, his dad has a recent felony and literally isn’t allowed on base anyway. So it wasn’t even an option.
Now my husband is in week 3, and I’m away at college during the week. The first letter he sent me showed up at his mom’s house. She texted me to tell me it was there… and then immediately started hinting that she wanted to open it. Saying stuff like she was “dying to see what’s in it” and hoping it had graduation info.
Meanwhile, she also tells me that my husband’s dad has been asking her for the graduation details because he apparently thinks he’s going to drive an RV to Texas and show up. She told him no, but she keeps bringing his comments and questions back to me, even though both my husband and I have made it very clear that he’s not supposed to be involved.
I told her I wasn’t comfortable with her opening the letter and that I’m not giving his dad any information. She said okay, but then went into a long emotional thing about how she’s dealing with him and trying to set boundaries too. In the end, she didn’t open the letter, and she left it for me to pick up.
But honestly, the whole thing stressed me out. It feels like every week there’s some new issue with his dad, and it’s exhausting on top of already worrying about my husband and dealing with school.
So am I overreacting for wanting that boundary with his mom and telling her not to pass along anything from his dad? Or is this actually reasonable given the situation?
And how do you deal with in-laws who don’t mean to overstep but still… kinda do?

ANSWER: I’m sure she’s going through it as well but you are not her therapist or her friend. You are her young dil. 
It’s a very reasonable boundary and if she continues to bring it up say listen I really don’t want to be in the middle of this. I’m following husbands wishes and that’s it. Move the conversation along.

================================================================================

QUESTION: In-laws coming to our house unannounced and when we’re not home

My husband and I have been married for 3 years now, and since the beginning we have been living in a house that my husband and his parents built. It is a two-floor house. The second floor is separate from the first, it’s basically like two apartments except the top floor has a lot of work still. 

The agreement was until we can financially save up a little bit more money to finish the second floor, my husband, our baby and I would be living on the first floor as my in-laws have an apartment of their own so they don’t live here, they’re not even in the same neighborhood. 

When this house was being built, my in-laws contributed financially more than my husband but my husband did contribute more with working on site and actually building the house alongside financially. So I think he has a say in all of this.

First, they come without a heads up. They don’t care if we’re sick, if we have guests, if we’re just tired and need to rest. They will come regardless. When we’re not home, same thing - they come here, rearrange things, for example plant flowers in the garden, do something messy and leave the mess for me to clean, which by the way I don’t need extra mess because I have back problems as is. Then they invite people over here and then they go to their own apartment. 

If my husband didn’t contribute absolutely anything I wouldn‘t take this to heart but I DO, I am trying so hard to keep this house intact so when they come to live on the first floor where we are now I want them to have everything in good condition still. But I feel so disrespected. I understand that they will come and live here but WE are currently living here and there are OUR things and it’s OUR privacy. I feel like our privacy is constantly being violated.

Once we tried setting a boundary - we were all sick with high fever and they just sent us a text that said they would come, without even asking. My husband told me to tell her (in his name because he had a headache due to a tooth surgery), that were really sick and that we would come to theirs another time when we’re feeling better. She threw a fit about it - called my husband on his way from work to tell him how neglected she felt, how I am a bad influence on him, how she feels I’m pushing her away from him ALL BECAUSE WE WERE FKN SICK.

Also, this is the woman who my husband asked not to come for at least a week after our baby was born since I wanted to rest and she told my aunt ‘’ I gave her (ME) 2 days but I can’t hold out anymore, I’m going to their house’’, proceeded to put dirty money into a newborns hands, kiss her even though we told her not to and when we did she was waiting for us to be gone so she can do it secretly, expected lunch and coffee from ME, and hasn’t cooked a meal for a new mother with a small baby with anything other than what we already had at home (which btw we had nothing at home atp). Tell me am I being dramatic or is this right to pmo???

QUESTION: Update: More Exclusion This Week (Anniversary Party + Thanksgiving Text)

Hey everyone, thanks for all the advice on my last post. I wanted to give an update because things have gotten even clearer this past week, and honestly… they keep proving the same pattern.

Last weekend was my in-laws’ wedding anniversary party.
My husband and I showed up late because of unexpected issues (including needing to find a last-minute dress and getting my husband’s wheelchair loaded, which always takes extra time). When we arrived, all of my in-laws and their partners were sitting together at the main table.

We were told to sit at a completely different table.

Not a single person said, “Come sit with us,” or “We saved you seats.”
Not one.
Even though they knew we were coming, even though the other grandkids and their spouses were at that table, and even though they had contacted us earlier asking us to arrive early for photos. It was very obviously intentional.

Fast-forward to this week:
One of my sister-in-laws sent a Thanksgiving dinner invitation… only to my husband.
I was not included in the group message.
But guess who was? My other SIL’s brand-new boyfriend ...someone they barely know.

It’s the same pattern over and over:
Selective communication, selective inclusion, and pretending it’s just an “accident.”

At this point, it feels less like oversight and more like a message.

I just wanted to share the update because it honestly confirms everything I wrote about before. If anyone has thoughts on how to handle this going forward especially with choosing whether or not to attend holiday gatherings. I’m open to hearing them.

It's really funny because eventhough they're going through serious problems of their own, like the sil's engagement break up to the other sil losing her home, cops involved and God knows what other serious problems they got... I seem to be the,main problem. We barely even see them yet I still seem to be a target.


Edit: Husband hasn't replied. Plans on leaving it in read. Thumbs up or down?

ANSWER: At this point I would drop rope completly. No texts, no calls, no visits.

My (25F) in laws have been awful to me and my husband (25M) since they found out I’m pregnant. I want nothing to do with them because they truly hurt my feelings and hurt my husband’s even more with their actions. I don’t think they’re capable of change or being kind to him, me, or our kid. My husband thinks otherwise. He’s willing to forgive them, I don’t think they deserve that. With a baby on the way, is it possible for me to cut them out of my life but for him to still have them in his life? How would it even work with a kid that they’d want to visit? Do I just have to suck it up and see them even though they know I don’t want to? Or is this something that we’d need to see eye to eye on to move forward?

Tell your husband to get his head out of his ass. He needs to respect the vows he took and the family he has created.

He's not "in the middle," he presumably stood up in public and vowed to Leave and Cleave - WTH did he think that meant? 

"Foresaking all others" means he's no longer under Mommy and Daddy's thumb. /r/enmeshmenttrauma

QUESTION: In laws decided last minute to be home for the holidays and are expecting to do everything with my family


My in-laws were supposed to go on vacation for Thanksgiving week, which I was sad about because I have no family of my own and was hoping to have at least them over- I have little kids and didn’t want to be totally alone like we were previous years bc everyone was sick. 

Bc of the hurricanes in the south, their trip was postponed to December. A few days ago they decided to not go anywhere for thanksgiving week and my husband invited them to our house for the holiday. They’re coming from 2 hours away and we have a guest room so they said they could come Thursday-Friday or Wednesday-thursday. The idea of cooking thanksgiving dinner with my MIL in my small kitchen makes me want to run away lol. I can’t do it. They’re from Russia and never took thanksgiving seriously, never really made turkey at all. But my MIL cornered me yesterday and asked who will make the turkey, and I said me? Since it’s my house? I don’t see how they’d cook a 20 pound bird and drive it here and then what, reheat it? She was annoyed but agreed. It was just a weird question to me. We also invited my husbands grandparents and aunt but my MIL said they have plans at their nursing home and won’t want to come to us, but she’d check with them and let me know. Which is fine, I just need to know soon so I can plan if we’re having 4 adults or 10. 

Then she invited us to go to their apartment 2 hours away for Saturday to celebrate FIL’s birthday, and also Sunday for dinner at a restaurant. I think those are very heavy traffic days and we have a 1 and 3 year old and I don’t want to drive there. 

I’m just a little annoyed bc a few days ago they weren’t even going to be in the country for the holiday week, but now that they are I am expected to jump and coordinate all this stuff that I kind of already had planned, forfeit my weekend to drive hours and hours, stay overnight at their 1 bedroom apartment with my family of 4… should I just say no?

ANSWER: I would get your husband to personally check with his aunt and grandparents about their “nursing home plans” because I have a feeling that your mil is lying and won’t even ask them to visit.

Who would want to spend their holidays in a nursing home rather than with their own family? Sounds very strange.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Future in laws bringing up having kids at ANY unrelated opportunity

(TLDR summary at the end of the post)

Firstly, not sure if I am overreacting - but this seems to trigger me maybe more than it would for others...but not sure if that's due to me being neurodivergent (diagnosed ADHD/anxiety/PTSD etc) and having more heightened reactions.

My fiance and I have been together for 8 years, recently engaged and just been doing our own thing.

Since we first got together, his parents have made hints about 'one day when I am pregnant, one day when I have kids, one day when grandpa & grandma will look after our kids" and anything in between.

For context, they are great and we get along very well. They do a lot for us. I can confide in them with most things and talk about things I'd feel awks talking to my own parents about. The only issue is when I do have serious chats with them, sometimes they make a comment or hint at us having kids, even when completely off that topic.

For example, I was having a D&M with my future MIL about how I worry about my future because of my mental health, being disorganised, feeling scattered and overwhelmed all the time. Basically, my brain doesn't switch off. I have many things to do daily but find it hard to start basic tasks without encouragement. I bring it up occasionally because she offers to help with things because she likes doing that stuff, but her response this time was "maybe that will all change and go away once you have kids".

This triggered me because I have had these issues my whole life. I struggled a lot in school and with daily life things. I don't want to wait to have kids for me to feel like I have some order or less stress in my life. I just want to feel heard, at peace and not have people assume what will make me better. I feel like I don't get taken seriously because of my diagnosis as it is and I have a weird sense of humour, but it's almost as if the answer to almost everything I say gets redirected to something relating to having kids.

They already have a grandkid they don't see due to some unresolved family issues, so I feel really pressured and anxious every time it's hinted to me because I feel like I have to compensate for that. But I also don't want to start a fight and end up in that situation where we don't talk to them.

Since I was a kid, I've genuinely been afraid of being a parent because I get overwhelmed with change, especially something big like starting a family. I can't imagine how I would be as a parent or if I will even be organised/patient enough to be one. So maybe this is why I feel so upset when people bring it up. I love my fiance and I like the idea of having kids one day after we get married. But I am in my early 30's and feel anxious that time is running out, but I still don't feel ready just yet. I still feel like I am a child in a way.

I don't want to become bitter towards them and end up like their other son and his wife, but both my fiance and I have mentioned to them not to bring it up so often as it does make me anxious. It's almost like they forgot or get too carried about about thinking about it.

Am I being a bit too bitter about it? Should I be happy that they want this for us? I often wonder if I am overthinking it or if it's genuinely an insensitive topic to bring up with people because what happens if I found out one of us can't have kids?

Wondering what I could I do. Or what has someone in a similar situation done that worked without starting a fight?

---

TLDR; future in laws always make references about me having kids. I feel uncomfortable, pressured and not ready, but they don't seem to stop bringing it up at any opportunity and I am overwhelmed. I don't want to start a huge fight but just want a way to get them to understand, or maybe do or say something to put them in their place. 

Thanks for taking the time to read about my little crisis which feels big in my mind.

ANSWER: They didn't forget that you have both asked for the subject not to be brought up because it makes you anxious. They have already lost contact with their other grandkids, which doesn't bode well for their ability to get along well others. They are showing you who they are: All they really care about is grandkids, period. 

I would proceed with caution and pull back on confiding in them about sensitive topics. It is a common theme here that in laws were sooo sweet until a baby arrived and then things turned ugly. 

To say that having a baby would make any current struggle easier is laughable and an obvious attempt to hurry along their own desire for grandchildren.

QUESTION: Not a single picture of me!

I have always felt that my husband’s family didn’t “love” me the way they love my SIL (husband’s brother’s partner). That made me sad over the years and very depressed because for me, their validation was important. 

Yesterday I went to their house and they have loads of pictures of their kids , my husband, his brother, cousins, aunties, uncles….and my sister in law. Not a single picture of me. I am not going to lie, it hurt so much. I felt not part of the family. 

But then I thought: ok, you got your answer. After all these years, I know now that they don’t love me. They accept me, they are nice to me , but that’s it. And it was liberating. No more begging for love. 

Of course I am still a little bit sad, but I need to focus on the ones that love me. I hope I can keep thinking the same over the years!

ANSWER: I’m sorry this is so hurtful. They’ve shown you who they are. I’ve personally just embraced being the least favorite DIL, as I’ve done nothing wrong to them and it reflects who they are way more than me. Nasty, excluding, scapegoating people.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Is it reasonable that I want to skip Christmas with in laws over this? They keep pushing a sensitive topic for me

Hi everyone. I am frustrated and sad about this situation. 

My husband and I were originally planning to go to my in laws  (who live in another state) for Christmas as my family doesn’t really celebrate. We have a small baby but were okay with taking him around the family because he will be old enough to have most of his vaccines by then. Note that we all did not have a perfect relationship before all this, but it was civil and tolerable. 

But now I don’t want to. The reason is my in laws, MIL and SIL in particular, will not leave me alone about a deeply sensitive topic to me. They are very upset by the fact that I am not breastfeeding and exclusively formula feeding my baby and keep guilting me over it. 

This topic is so sensitive to me because I wanted to breastfeed really badly, but I wasn’t physically able to. Even though from the very beginning I was okay with formula feeding as an alternative if breastfeeding didn’t work out, it surprisingly gutted me when it actually happened. My milk never came in. I don’t really feel guilt for formula feeding, my painful feelings are more related to being upset that I can’t experience that part of motherhood and that my body somehow failed, and jealousy of those who it seems easy for. I was also made to feel really awful by some lactation consultants when I tried to get help for it. Just a very negative experience. Overall I am trying to move on from this positively and reach acceptance but I’m still at a point where I feel immense grief, shame, and jealousy. The whole topic of breastfeeding is very upsetting to me even without this drama. 

The in laws don’t know why I’m not breastfeeding as I’m not comfortable sharing intimate details of my body that make me feel so upset. I don’t think if they knew they would be more supportive, they’d just change tactics. But MIL & SIL are constantly sending me breastfeeding stuff about how important it is, and really anti-formula stuff. Stuff not even backed by science and seems designed to guilt me into breastfeeding. This would be hurtful no matter what but it’s just intensifying my grief. They seem to have a weird savior complex about my infant, overall just acting like I’m failing him which is so ridiculous even if it was solely my choice to not breastfeed. But it wasn’t my choice, my body didn’t work how I expected and so it just piles on the negative feelings. They make me feel guilty even though I was never really feeling guilt in the first place as I mentioned above. 

The most upsetting thing was when my husband messaged them to tell them to knock it off, this is incredibly hurtful for my wife, SIL said “I don’t care about her, I care about my nephew.” This infuriated my husband and he is refusing to speak to his sister. He told MIL that he went on my accounts and phone and blocked them until they stop with this, and we won’t come to Christmas if it happened again. She fake cried when he said this, her signature move, and said she just wanted to help me be the best mother I could be. He has ignored her since this but Isnt explicitly no contact (as far as I know) like he is with his sister. He’s very angry at both of them. 

I just want to skip Christmas this year because I feel like they’re going to shame me the entire time. My husband is in favor of skipping Christmas but said he would do whatever I felt like. 

The only thing that makes me hesitate is missing Christmas with his brother and wife, the ones in the family who are supportive of us in all aspects and we won’t have another Christmas with them for a while due to logistical stuff.  Also the rest of the family will take this as a major upset, but my husband at this point doesnt really care but it may make everything harder with them in the long run. It would also put the reasonable BIL and SIL in a difficult spot between us as they currently live under MIL’s roof and MIL will bring them into the drama and basically make it like they have to pick between us. 

Should we just not go? This whole thing is so hard on me.

ANSWER: Do not go and spend Christmas with them, they will ruin your first Christmas with your baby. Your MIL and SIL are despicable human beings. It’s no one else’s business if a baby is breastfed or formula fed. Your MIL and SIL should even get a chance to have a relationship with your baby. They will just spout more hate and try and turn your baby against you. If you think it is okay to take your baby around these hateful people, you should really reevaluate your priorities.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My FIL just called me at 10pm to talk about my MIL and I'm reeling.

So for context my FIL and MIL are divorced. They have been divorced for at least a decade if not more. 

My MIL from the very beginning of my partner and i's relationship wasnt a fan of me and was actively trying to get us to break up. She would also enable my partners behavior at the time of drinking and telling him I was being controlling bc I wanted him to stop drinking. Enabling him in the way of buying him more alcohol when he didn't have the money. She also would tell him that I was worthless and just dragging him down and he should leave me. Fast forward to 1.5 years ago she physically assaulted me. 2 weeks after that I conceived her first and currently only grandchild. Ofc I didn't want anything to do with this woman regardless if I had her grandkid or not. 

FIL and my partner both pretty much asked me to push aside the assault. I said I would if she apologized. The apology I got was "sorry for all the craziness". That was it, but I accepted it and moved on bc I was very pregnant and didn't want to deal with it anymore.

Before having the baby, I told her on multiple occasions that I didn't want any visitors at the hospital. During all occasions her response was "um I'm gonna be there". She also told my partner on multiple occasions that she was "just gonna come by and pick me up to shop" or  to "hang out". But decided not too. She was going to do this without warning and only decided after to tell my partner. 6 days after I have birth (emergency c section after 26 hours of labor) my partner talked me into letting his family come by. She came by with only food for herself. Helped herself to my kitchen and left a massive mess in my kitchen. Then later bugged us to come by to see her only grandchild once a week.

My partner still wants his mom in his life and ofc his daughter's. So we talked about it and I agreed that if she apologized to me and set some boundaries then I'd be willing to work on our relationship. It took her a total of 2 months after my partner told her this to actually message me, then took her a full week to respond to my messages. Simple messages like "I'm ready to talk about boundaries when you are". 

My FIL was informed of these boundaries before we even initially talked to MIL bc my partner thought he should now. My FILS initial response was "well MIL felt like her son was being ripped from her. If that was (my babies name) in a relationship, wouldn't you feel the same?" I said um no, especially not if her partner at the time was trying to have a decent relationship with me to begin with. That conversation went on for awhile. 

Ever since the boundary talk with MIL, I've seen her 2 times. (It's only been like a month). She has messaged me to see me (my baby) pretty much every week. I still don't trust her and am uncomfortable being around her obviously. So I've made a few excuses here and there and then we were sick. 

My FILs family (they're Hispanic for context) was having enchiladas for my FIL being back from deployment. We originally wasn't going to go bc we were still getting over being sick. But today we decided to go bc we were all feeling much better just some cough and congestion. Everything went well. This was the first time (my baby is now 6 months old) that the FILs side of the family got to meet my baby.

My FIL called at 10pm, I was confused and thought it was an emergency so I answered. Instead he wanted to talk about MIL and wanted to know when her boundaries was gonna be lifted or lightened bc he felt guilty about being able to see the baby more then MIL. I explained I was uncomfortable being around her due to the physical assault. He went on to say a few things (skipping a bunch bc this is already long). He said that the family felt like I wasn't putting in effort to mend our relationship. He said that I speak of accountability but my partner and I have never been held accountable bc we are family. He also said that I should be holding him to the same standard as MIL bc he "said some stuff about me too at first". For that one I asked him if he physically assaulted me or enabled my partners drinking or bad behavior, he said no. Then went on to ask if i was ever going to work on the relationship. I told him that's not my job, I didn't break the relationship. That I still felt uncomfortable and didn't trust her and that I wholeheartedly believed that if baby wasn't in the picture she wouldn't want anything to do with me. He then said it was late and he had to go to bed...

Honestly idk what to think or what to do. I didn't do anything wrong. I mean the lady PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED ME IN PUBLIC for crying out loud.

ANSWER: If he didn’t cut her off after she abused you he’s still not doing enough.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Insight needed, AITA

Hi Reddit, I (30F) am traveling with my husband and my in-laws (both in their 70s, but very mobile and somewhat healthy). We’ve been on a 3-week trip together abroad, and we are now on the last leg in Tokyo. I honestly feel like I’m losing it and I can’t tell if I’m the asshole or just finally burnt out.

Context from today:

We agreed to wake up early to head to Osaka for a quick 2-day trip. My husband and I wanted to grab breakfast at Tsukiji Fish Market (literally a 3-minute walk). His parents said they wanted to eat with us, so we waited but I was starving, so I went ahead while my husband waited for them.

We had already been to Tsukiji earlier in the trip, and it’s super straightforward for tourists. All the food is displayed, everything is labeled with prices, and you just walk up and order. But when they arrived, they expected us to figure out what they should eat, where to line up, what each stall sells, etc. They can walk fine, they’re healthy, they’re totally capable adults but for some reason they wanted us to navigate everything and basically act like their tour guides. Which has been a repeated trend this trip. 

Fine. We helped them buy some things, then my husband and I grabbed something to eat ourselves and told them to stroll around for a bit.

After we ate, my husband said he was going to get his parents so we could go. I went back to the hotel to use the bathroom and grab our things.

This is where everything went sideways.

Minutes and minutes pass. And I’m getting anxious since the train ride to Osaka is not short. Apparently they went the wrong direction after eating dessert. Eventually my husband gets back to the hotel and tells me his parents are “right behind” him, so I call an Uber to Tokyo Station. The Uber arrives fast, but the hotel staff starts getting irritated that we’re standing in a no-waiting zone, and I start panicking.

His parents take even longer to show up. I’m stressed, the Uber is there, the hotel is telling us to move and is upset.

When they finally show up, I’m obviously frustrated and asks them what happened. And then my FIL says, “Well, IDGAF the Uber should wait for us. We’re the ones paying.”

I explained (again) that this is Japan, people don’t just let Ubers block hotel entrances, and we need to respect the rules and other people’s time. He shrugged it off.

Apparently he “wasn’t feeling well” and wanted to stop by a pharmacy to buy a mask… but didn’t say anything to my husband. Why not communicate earlier? Why wait until we’re rushing? Why not speak up when they woke up knowing we had a tight morning plan?

Then we got into a fight in the car.
They said I was being impatient and rude… even though I honestly feel like I’ve bent over backwards the entire trip trying to help, translate, plan, adjust, accommodate, and guide.

I’m exhausted. I feel like I’ve been carrying this whole trip and today was just my breaking point. But now I’m wondering if I’m really the asshole here.

AITA for getting upset at my in-laws when they weren’t communicating and kept delaying us?

ANSWER: You’ve had all you can take on a 3 week trip.  NTA.  Everyone is tired and irritated.  I couldn’t stand a 1 week trip with my in-laws. Have you traveled with them before this trip?

QUESTION: Sudden changes in my in laws

I (F) have been dating my partner (M) for over 7 years. We have always had a great relationship with both of our families. Seeing them often, planning get together, all normal things. Even to the point of them joking about when we would finally get married (we just felt ready to get engaged this past year). Well after we got engaged, my soon to be sister-in-law really changed her tune towards me. She started texting my Fiance asking if I read his text messages, asking if I’d be taking his last name and why not if I didn’t, not wanting to come to my dress try on appointments even though I asked her and she’s a bridesmaid. But then making plans to hang out with my Fiance during the exact same time as my appointment. Weird stuff. I don’t know what happened or what changed. She’s been a huge supporter of our relationship until now and it makes me feel self-conscious, like I did something wrong to make her suddenly act this way. Has this happened to anybody else? What did you do to mend the bond? Her and I have always been close so this change feels honestly really awful for me. And I feel terrible for him being put in the middle of it.

ANSWER: She is jealous that you're now the centre of attention because of your wedding.
Your fiance should ask her straight up what her problem with you is and she should make it right. Remove her as a bridesmaid if she can't get her crap together. You don't need the stress of a jealous snake dressed as your bridesmaid ruining your big day.

She and her husband have 2 kids and recently announced they are expecting their third.

She sent my husband two separate lists for the boys and then one for the unborn baby.

The items on her lists are all top of the line too, ranging from 50-500$

My husband sent her back laughing emojies and told her she almost had him for a second but we both know she wasn't joking. 

We already go all out for Christmas for her kids because we know she and her husband can barely afford their basics and every kid should experience the 'magic' of Christmas but this is just making me want to say fuck it, bail on Christmas with his family and just take him on a trip somewhere. 

I obviously won't but I'm so damn tempted.

ANSWER: Gifts are up to you. If they can't afford Christmas, they shouldn't be having a 3rd kid.

Buy the cheapest gift for the 2. Unborn kid doesn't get a gift until next year.

QUESTION: Holidays !

The holidays are here! You know what that means? Guilt tripping in-laws are here to make your life miserable. Don’t let them steal your joy with your family and your children. Put up your hand, say No, and watch them lose their shit. Do it early so the panic of them not getting their way can subside by Dec 25th.  

I am currently going through it with my husband, because I have declined the yearly invite (guilt-ridden expectation from his stepmother) that my children and I will attend Christmas at my husband’s  stepmother’s house.

Call me cRaZy, but I do not enjoy spending the holidays with people  who I never see socially throughout the rest of the year. And if I do happen to bump into them, they pretend they don’t see me. That is not family. 

My husband whined, “why are you doing this to meee?”

I replied, “WUT?! I am not doing anything to you. I am putting up boundaries with people who have mistreated me. This should not be a surprise. I have been saying how excited I am about the holidays for literally months because this is the first year I am doing it on my terms. This season, I choose not to be around them. I choose to enjoy my holidays with my wonderful little kids free from guilt and nausea-inducing anxiety. How YOUR family treats you is on them and on you to allow or forbid. “

He whines for me to just let him take the kids for a few hours so he doesn’t get “a whole bunch of shit” from everyone. Absolutely not. My children are not spending time away from me on Christmas around people who were OK with me being bullied. No. What happens when my kids are older and they get bullied in that family? I am not teaching them that “this is family” once a year when gifts are around.

ANSWER: I’m delighted to hear that you will no longer allow your dunderhead husband to use YOU as his meat shield! Because that is the ONLY reason he dragged you over there for so long. They’re gonna roast and grill the ever loving crud outta him! (Over here snorting with glee on your behalf, lol.)

Maybe, just maybe? he’ll learn to appreciate WHY you cannot stand to be around such rude and intrusive A-Holes. If they can treat THEIR OWN CHILD so disrespectfully (simply because he went alone) then he should only imagine how disrespectful they have been to YOU when you were hubby’s meat shield.

QUESTION: Methinks There are Some Confused Words........

Please don't take this the wrong way, peeps, since I know that this is the place to vent for a lot of you.........do you realize that the words you speak bring things to life and perpetuate rough feelings? 

I see so many people on here talking about "toxic" and "evil" in-laws ​and the "cut them off completely" or "divorce your husband because he doesn't love you" is tossed around so casually.

Don't get me wrong.......I've dealt with some really awful inlaws and some that I simply don't like.  My first set of inlaws were f\\king horrible people in general - they enabled my incredibly abusive ex-H and were the type that wouldn't allow spouses at family dinners (or, in his sister's case, none of her 4 sisters-in-law were allowed at her wedding) because they weren't family.  My next set of inlaws (only married a year and wouldn't have even dated him if I had gone to therapy after the absolute trauma of the first one) were nice enough in general, but made zero effort to get to know me at all even though I was around for several years before getting married.  My in-laws now definitely have some toxic behaviors (like alcoholism) but in general are just selfish and obliviously inconsiderate to the people around them - it doesn't seem intentional, they just don't think of other people and don't make an effort to get to know them.  I actually had someone on here that told me it was "toxic af" that my inlaws couldn't remember that I hate ice cream and chocolate after 5 years.  No, not toxic, just.........too self-centered to pay attention.  Does my husband not cutting off his family of origin because I perceive them as disrespectful at times mean he doesn't love me?  No.  It would probably mean I don't love him much to expect that of him.  (Again, there are obviously cases where scorched earth is the only answer.)

  
Are there "toxic" inlaws?  Sure.  Are there ones that you absolutely should go no contact with because they are horrible people?  Sure.  Is that a good majority of these?  Probably not.  Most of it sounds like a lot of selfish and oblivious people, or just people that have a polar opposite thought process as you and are used to doing things a specific way.  They probably feel the same about you as you feel about them with your different preferences and ways.  And I hate to break it to you, but you are likely going to be the topic of these same types of conversation when your kids have their own families......YOU will be the toxic in-law.  I remember my sister absolutely hating her mother-in-law for doing the exact same things with her son that my sister does with hers........I pretty much guarantee that her future DIL is going to despise her.

In other words, it may be beneficial to a lot of your situations to stop throwing around extreme definitions that are just going to make you more and more bitter and resentful when it stems from someone just being different from you.

  
Just a thought.  Do with it what you will.

ANSWER: I think some of this stems from the perspective of “well they’re family” vs. not believing that marriage makes them family. My in laws are just that, I have some sort of legal tie to them. That’s it. Therefore, even if they are just selfish and oblivious with no real malice…I don’t want them in my life. My husband can have whatever relationship he wants but he knows to speak up when they say something impolite regarding our family. I think a lot of these posts get to that point because the husband refuses to correct behavior and it goes on and on to the point of going nuclear. 

Everyone’s definition and vision of family is different and for many of us we are exhausted with the concept of tolerating people just to keep them comfortable.

My husband and I have been together for 5 going on 6 years. Married for 1. Throughout this time his mom has been toxic and horrible. Any major event turns it to about her and makes a problem. My husband is always on my side and stands up for me and our girls. When we got together it was small comments about things like “do you pay for everything for her” or “are you giving her money”. We lived a state apart. I had a great paying job and would come down almost every weekend to see him. He would come up sometimes but was easier for me because he has a son with someone else. I moved to live with him from my home state away from all my family and friends. This is when things really started. She was upset of the fact he was spending more time with me at our house and not going there at the drop of a hat. And it was said in comments of “you don’t come around”, “we never see you anymore”  and many other guilt tripping ones. We live 5 mins from them. When we found out we were expecting our first the comments started of “we hope it’s a boy they are better”, “girls are all brats” and “all girls do is scream”. When we told his son that we were expecting my husband’s dad told his son “don’t worry you will always be the favorite “. I was angry. Because you are saying to be with that you won’t care about your other grandchildren. When we got engaged. She started a huge fight. Were she told his to “f off” or “f you” when we would counter something she was saying that wasn’t true. It ended with us not speaking to them and planning to move away. Well that changed when we got a phone call that his younger brother passed. We put the argument behind us and went to be with them. I walked in and the first words his mom spoke to me were “will you forgive me now”. We just moved on. Fast forward again. We are expecting our second baby. The comments about hoping it’s a boy again started. While pregnant we made the decision I would no longer work and my husband made a career change. When we told them about this change they were very negative and rude. Kind of made him second guess himself but my family and I encouraged him. After our second girl was born and she was a month old, he had to leave for 16 weeks for training. They never reached out once. I have a toddler and new born and I was expected to be the one to reach out. Mind you they are both retired and live 5 mins from us. While he was gone I was also planning our wedding. Comes time for his graduation and at the graduation in front of his bosses and online she acted that they supported him the whole time and encouraged and were so proud. This is the first time she ever told him she was proud of him. I was not happy. Because it was all lies. My family and I were the ones that supported and encouraged him. Week later was our wedding. The rehearsal dinner I gave them all a paper with the plans and times for the wedding. With my husband next to me I tell her it’s this time but please be there 30 mins before that just incase we move things. Comes the day of the wedding. They weren’t there when asked. I was frustrated because it was already a stressful day. They walk in and she comes to me and starts yelling at me about how I never asked her and they had no intentions of being there at that time. I stood up calmly and said you will not yell at me at my wedding. My sister stepped in and tried to talk to her and she told her to “f off”. We got things calm took pictures went about the day because I wasn’t going to let her ruin my wedding. End of the night we said bye to them to be nice and she looks at me and says “ I didn’t deserve today”. I just turned and walked away. I had a conversation with my husband that I was done and will no longer be around them. 2 weeks later his mom asked him to stop by and pick up a letter she insisted he read then. It was addressed to both of us. He did and short version of a 4 page letter she wrote how horrible be were to them, how we were never their for them when his brother passed, and many other things that were untrue. I again told my husband I was not going to be around them again and on the fence about our girls being around them but I would never tell him he couldn’t go see them. He didn’t want to after all this. His son had a birthday and the comments again about how horrible girls are were made because my husband had to leave for a min and my daughter was upset her dad left. They called her emotional and said she was overreacting. I have not been around them other than that and will not. When she calls my husband or he takes the kids there she does this I call her crying victim voice telling my daughter how she loves her and misses her or and wishes she could see them more. They haven’t really around my youngest but pull the guilt card on my husband of we are missing their lives and so much of them. One of the last times my husband went there his mom asked him how she can fix things to have her family back. And when he said apologizing is a start she looked at him and said not to rude but what do I have to apologize for. He said the wedding would be a start and she said but for what. He came home and talked with me about her wanting to apologize but I don’t trust her. I know she doesn’t care about any of us being around it’s for show. I know it’s hard on my husband not being around his dad, he doesn’t care to be around his mom either. My husband has never been close to his mom because she always favored his brother over him their whole lives. She expected my husband to do what his brother did of calling her daily or going there all the time. But that was never the relationship. She has always favored my husband’s son over my husband and over our girls. It’s very obvious with holidays and birthdays when they spend hundreds on his son but like 50-60 on our girls. I know the apology won’t be sincere and it gives me anxiety. But do I suck it up. Or continue with I will not be around the toxic lies and narcissistic behavior. 

Sorry this is long. It’s been a lot in the past few years but my husband is very supportive of me and my decisions with his family.

ANSWER: I wouldn’t even deal with her. She doesn’t even know what she’s apologizing for. She sounds very much like a self centered person and I wouldn’t care to have her back in my life.

QUESTION: Am I the crazy one?

This is a very longwinded story so thank you if you stick around to read the whole thing.

Back story I 31(f) have been with my husband 44(m) for a little over 10 years and we have lived together for about 9. We have 3 kids together 5, 3, and 1. We had no plans of ever having children before our first and it was definitely a surprise but we were happy. For context before getting pregnant I was very career oriented and my husband works an on-call job that takes him out of town constantly, like 1-2 days at home and then 2-3 days gone depending on the time of year. We both worked a lot before kids, I was in management and working 50 to 60 hours a week and when we decided to get married I had just received a promotion to district manager. This was in January of 2020 we are both pretty private reserved people and so we wanted a small wedding and didn't want a huge event so we told close family members and decided we were going to get married the next month. Hind sight is 20/20 but my first red flag should have been our wedding. His mother took over everything, I wanted simple I wasn't even going to buy a dress and somehow I got pushed/guilted into wearing her wedding dress (which had also been her mothers). We said no gifts and then his family all showed up with gifts. I said no flowers, they are not my thing...she bought flowers anyways and tried to force a bouquet on me which i "forgot". It was a micro wedding but I felt like I had to do things her way since we did it at their house, and at that point neither of us cared that much. Up to this point in our relationship we both worked a ton and spent our free time with friends or vacationing. His family always had big events, camping trips etc., in their hometown that is about 4 hours away from us and is 45 minutes from where I grew up but prior to us getting married and having kids we never went to anything.  Two weeks after our wedding I found out I was pregnant and the next day the world shut down. It was the strangest time in my life. I had just got promoted, married, found out I was pregnant, and then found out everything was shutting down. After the initial shock my husband and I were excited and we told our families and they were both over the moon. With everything going on with the world my mother in law offered to quit her job because day cares were impossible to find at the time. Side note: she had already retired once but went back to work because she was bored. This is one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made. My husband has one brother and 3 step daughters and his wife was done having kids before they got together. My oldest was the first biological grandchild and my sister-in-law swears that when he was born some switch flipped in my mother in law. As a new mom I questioned myself on everything, including the role a grandparent should play as both sides of mine passed away when I was very young. Post-partum was rough on me and I went back to work after 6 weeks and started traveling for work at 10 weeks usually 1 night out of town a week (it was required for my job). I was trying to breastfeed/pump and it was not going successfully I was stressed to the max between work, parenting and being post partum and my mother in law took advantage of that. I look back now and realize I should have set boundaries far sooner. Every time I said I wanted something or asked for something to be done a certain way she would respond with "Well I did this with my kids and they turned out fine." That's where my frustrations started. My husband would just shrug it off and say that she was just excited to be a grandma and I just don't understand their culture (I am white and he is 1/2 japanese MIL is full japanese her grand parents immigrated). I had no context because all of my grandparents died when I was very young so I never had relationships with them.

I started hating my life and hated being away from my baby so when he was 9 months old I quit my job and started working closer to home with way less hours and no traveling. She immediately set in with guilt tripping me that she didn't get to see my oldest enough even though we were over there multiple times a week. Two months later I found out I was pregnant again. I honestly do not have a lot of memories from that time, I was exhausted and just trying to keep my head above water through that whole pregnancy and then after he was born I had no paid maternity leave and I was only able to take 4 weeks off. Where we live waitlists for daycares at that time were extremely long it was hard to find one with a spot, also cost of living increased dramatically because there was an influx of people to our area due to the events that happened in 2020. I felt trapped and my mother-in-law was my only option to watch my kid's at that point and I felt like I couldn't not work. I tried ask for certain things with my children, i.e. I was breastfeeding and wanted bottles to be fed with the paced feeding method. I shared the article on it with her and asked her to do it. She did not, and said that she couldn't because my baby didn't like drinking his bottles slow. This was one of many things like I was very insistent that my children call their body parts by their proper names. She refused and insisted on using the term weewee. I said I wanted to do whole foods/baby led weaning and she argued with me about it and so many situations like that. There was also multiple times where she would want to go out of town and not give me notice so I either had to let her take my kids or I had to try to find last minute child care, which if you are a parent you know that is really hard to do. 

There have been so many situations of overstepping over the last several years that I could write a book a few examples are signing my kids up for things without asking me, MIL took my oldest son to a preschool screening after I said no that wasn't her place to take him, purposely asking my husband and I for permission to do things separately so that she can get the answer she wants and if she gets what she wants she will brag to people that my husband lets her do whatever she wants and she is such an involved grandparent. I feel like she treats my children like trophies. If she is present and I am trying to parent my children she will try to insert herself in between me and my child either verbally or physically ex. my kid gets hurt and they run to me for comfort she will try to step in while I am talking to them, or I will be addressing a certain behavior and she will try to talk over me to my children and if I say something she will say "This is how Grandma does it". It feels like if I ask for anything she will purposely do the opposite to try to undermine me. I took steps and got my kids into daycare so that we weren't depending on her for childcare and she just helped out intermittently but it also made her pressure me to spend even more of my off time with them.

Things took a turn for the worst towards the end of my last pregnancy, when I was about 28 weeks along my older sister who I am very close to came forward that my oldest brother had molested her as a child for years. This devastated me, my brother had always been my idol. With the state of my mental and physical health my husband and I decided that I needed to quit working and later on we decided we wanted to try me staying at home at least for a couple years. I also sat my MIL down explained the situation and told her that there was certain things that needed to change because I did not have trust in people at that time.  Instead of respecting this she kept pushing, 2 weeks before my due date she wanted to take my older kids on a week long camping trip 4 hours away  with no cell service where there would be people I didn't know, I said no. She approached my mother right after I gave birth and tried to convince her to tell me I should go back to work. She bought me a breast pump without asking (or researching) and had it shipped to my house. She got upset when I didn't facetime her an hour after I gave birth. She would constantly drop by my house even after I asked her to please text me first. If she finds out I'm doing any activity with my kids she will invite herself. She also completely disrespects any requests I make as far as my kids diet and has lied to me about things she has fed my kids. My older boys got a sun burn and I made it clear I wanted only aloe put on them and she decided to use MLM hair oil on them and their sunburns blistered terribly. The final straw that broke the camels back was her keeping them up past their bed time when they were at her house for a sleep over and sending snapchats to other people about it and intentionally not including me when I have made it very clear how I feel about keeping secrets from me. Being around her makes me feel like trash. I decided to go low contact with them and told my husband he was responsible for handling interactions with his parents because I was done. They came over to my house and let themselves in using my sons door code (I had removed their access because of all the drop ins) and when I was clearly pissed they got offended. She texted me and asked me what they did to upset me and I told her I was not going to have a conversation through text and if she wanted to sit down and have a conversation we could but not if she would dismiss me or get passive aggressive with me. Instead she decided to try to recruit my family members to try to convince them I was being unreasonable and after   several months of them having almost no contact with my children  my father in law reached out. I attempted to have a conversation and I started listing the things I was upset about and she at first her response to everything was either "I don't remember that" or she tried to blame me and say it was my fault that she did those things because I am just mean and nasty, and they do so much for everyone and no one appreciates it. I left in the middle of her rant after I told her I will not facilitate a relationship between them and my children if I'm not respected. Now she is calling her family and they are calling my husband to tell him how unreasonable I am being and that grandparents are so important. I don't know what to do I feel like I have begged my husband to set boundaries with them but since it doesn't affect him as much since he is gone for work he doesn't. He also brings up our cultural differences a lot he says going no contact is a "white people thing". These situations are not the only ones it has literally been constant the last 5 years. I love my husband and he is an amazing father, I just want to divorce his parents.

I just don't know where to go from here. Do I have any hope? Any advice is welcome.

Side note: I started going to therapy and that's when I started setting more boundaries with consequences but its hard when I feel like my husband doesn't back me up.

ANSWER: I'd suggest couples therapy, your biggest issue is your husband not your MIL. He's supposed to deal with his parents, not you. Tbh the age-gap is kind of a red flag.
In the meanwhile, if the in-laws try to let themselves in without your invitation, tell them it's not convenient and if they don't leave, you'll call the police for trespassing. And follow through if needed.

QUESTION: Advanced notice for non-emergencies?

Just curious what are the boundaries in your home regarding helping when asked? The current discussion is about how much time or prep do you prefer before going over to help with non-urgent chores or favors? This is assuming you live within driving distance.

ANSWER: We/he are asked to do anything from moving heavy objects to yard work to helping fix the computer or do taxes. Sometimes there is a heads up of a chore needing done, but others it’s a last minute ask. Historically, one chore turns into a couple or more since we’re there anyway. It’s certainly not the helping I mind, but last minute can be frustrating. Especially when it interferes with our plans.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Tied up with so many holiday plans

I apologize in advance because this will be a long post but I want to set up as much background as possible.

My husband and I are from the same metropolitan area where we both grew up and now live with our 6 month old baby. This is our first year as a family of three and I have dreams of beginning our own traditions while also seeing family. I am already stressed about the holidays and here is why:

My husband’s father’s family had a large Christmas Eve party and his mother’s family has a large Christmas night party. The Christmas Eve party is a one way one hour drive from us and Christmas night is a one way 1.5 hrs drive from us. 

I used to do something similar in my own family when I was growing up (with less driving) but since then both of my parent’s families have created holiday parties that don’t fall on Christmas. This allows individual families to focus on the nuclear family on the actual holiday and have everything a little less chaotic.

I’ve always disliked that I now have to travel on Christmas Eve and night for the last five or so years. I have always been eager to setup more of our own traditions while also just relaxing in our home for the holidays. My husband’s response to this is “it’s the holidays, you need to see family, we are doing this for family.” His parents also agree it’s too much driving but they just keep doing it anyway.

I appreciate his loyalty, but I think the expectation to travel both days every single year is annoying and unfair. Especially that we now have a young baby, I don’t want to suffer two nights of shitty sleep because I had to keep him up for these parties and then do a long drive home.

Am I unreasonable? Is my husband being unreasonable?

To me a fair solution is to choose one party every year and then switch the next year.

Outside of the holidays we see the extended family of my in laws approximately 4-5x/year.

ANSWER: When you partner up and then have kids (or if you don’t have kids), your “family” shifts from the one you grew up with to the one you made. 

My parents insisted on a quiet Christmas Eve & Day.  Those were about our family, so we could be present & engaged with each other.  No driving, no uncomfortable clothes, no family drama.  

I think it’s important for you & your husband to dig down to his underlying reasons.  I suspect there is a mix of not wanting to be perceived as abandoning his family, bucking tradition, wanting to see his family of origin, and not really getting your side of this.  

Lots of options.  You all can alternate years on whom you spend the holiday with, visit them on a different day, host so you don’t have to drive, meet at a central location, have him go with you & kiddo staying home, and so on.  

It’s important that you both establish traditions for your family, and it’s worth sitting down and exploring why you each want to do these, and then figuring out what that looks like together.  You don’t have to lock this down now, if something doesn’t work now, you can try a different way next year.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My MIL is a kind and nice person but she never made effort to get to know me

(I guess I just need a place to rant). 

My husband and I have been married for 5 years and known each other for 10 years. His parents live overseas and we’re in US so he doesn’t see his parents often. We’ve been visiting pretty consistently since 2019, and we returned again in 2023, 2024 and this year 2025.

My husband came from a family that absolutely does not talk about feelings and emotions. They went through some serious stuff as a family but never actually talked it out. As a result , all of their conversations are very surface level. It’s a classic avoidance type of family where every issues just stay because they never made attempt to resolve it. My husband is quite different because he spent his college years and adult years separately from them. And when we started dating, he started learning about the importance of emotional awareness and sharing his feelings. 

On our visit this year, there was a day where my husband was spending time with his childhood friends and left me with my MIL and BIL since we’re going somewhere after he’s done with his friends. We waited for my husband for almost an hour and in that hour, MIL and BIL never made any attempt to converse with me, even if it’s just casual “so how’s work” or “how’s life in general” … They were just scrolling on their phones.

I felt so annoyed in that moment. But I should clarify that this isnt  something new. Even since we got married, we never really talked much whenever we visit, and I try to be understanding of it because that’s just how they are with each other. I understand every family dynamic is different and I should not expect them be any different than me but boy, that was the worst hour of my life. Just sitting there like we’re all strangers. 

The day before, I was literally helping her applying for a tourist visa to visit us and that took time and energy and when the process took longer, I made every effort to try everything. We send money to her quite often. And just literally a few minutes ago, BIL asked me to pay for a jacket (which I don’t mind because it’s cheap but this dude never even said anything except, hi or bye, never really interacted with me whenever I’m visiting). Mind you, every time we visit, we ALWAYS pay for everything. Everytime we take them out, they never had to worry about money because we got it. Every time we took a trip, we pay for nice hotel and nicer train class. Everything we gave them is ALWAYS the best, and yet, it just seems unnoticed.

I guess after 4 years of intentionally choosing to visit them when we could’ve gone anywhere else, I feel a bit under appreciated. It seems we do so much and it just seems that they expected that from us. 

and I do not want to tell my husband. Not because I can’t communicate it to him but because I refuse to fight with him because of other people, especially his family.

ANSWER: Tell your husband the truth. You don't want to visit them anymore because they make you uncomfortable and they have zero interest in you other then gifts or favors you might supply. Stop doing that as well, no more gifts, money or favors to people that can't even be bothered to have a polite conversation with you.


He needs to hear and understand your side of this and respect your feelings on it. Make sure he knows you won't be bothered by them anymore. If his mother is planning on visiting you in the US make damn sure you set clear rules on how long she can stay if you allow her to stay at all, she needs to know there will be no six month long visits and when or if she does visit you won't be catering to her or any of his family. Ideally they don't stay with you, make that clear as well, you don't have to sacrifice your comfort for people that treat you like a piece of furniture unless they want something from you.


You need to have a long talk with hubs about expectations regarding his family and where you stand on those expectations. You're not a hotel, a maid, a cook or concierge. Male that crystal clear. They also need to provide for themselves if they come to your area, that means housing, food, travel, etc. You aren't the bank of OP and husband. 


Good luck. Get on that talk.

QUESTION: Paying for dinner

I don't know if this is the right sub but I just have to get something off my chest. My husband, child and I recently visited his father-in-law in California. The flights cost nearly $1,000 and then we had car and a short term rental that was another $1,000. We are a single-income family right now and I stay home with our son. We are also building a home. Our monthly expenses are quite high right now. We are burning through a lot of our savings but we thought it's important to see his father. His father is 90 years young and can no longer travel.

While visiting, his adult siblings, some of their adult children, their spouses and his father joined us for dinner out. When the $500 bill came my husband offered to pay and no one offered to help. His sisters work in finance (senior manager, VP) for large investing firms like BlackRock.  His brother is fishing guide. I come from a family where everyone fights to pay the bill; I'm frustrated no one stepped up. 

TLDR - my in-laws are cheapskates!

ANSWER: your issue is with your husband who offered first.  Just because  your family might fight to pay, some families may think they would be insulting your husband. Is there reason for them to know you are on a tight budget?

It is always better to be up front before anyone orders anything to say - hey are we splitting? this is our treat? separate checks?

That is the only way to avoid feeling of resentment.

================================================================================

QUESTION: What do you think? sorry its long but please read!

Alright this will be a long post but I need to vent. Some context: My husband and I have been together since senior year highschool (12years). His middle brother has been with his gf for about almost 9 years. We are all aged between 28-31.

Anyways, she and I have known eachother since middle school since we had a friend in common. Years pass and we lost touch until she started dating my husbands brother. We were cool with eachother for a while until we did'nt. (I dont remember the reason why) When she would come over to my mother in laws house (before i got married) we would keep our distance and not acknowledge eachother which was fine by me. Time passed and we decided to put it behind us and have a cordial relationship for the sake of the family. Cool. Then I got married last year. 

My husband told me days before our wedding that his brother and his gf broke up bc of some issue. So, we thought we shouldn't invite her and didn't want to ask his brother about it which lead to us not adding her to the seating chart. Well, they made up right before the wedding so my husband and I made last minute changes literally 2 days before and reprinted the seating chart. She went to my wedding rehearsal (idk why and i said oh wow youre here nice) and she was helpful during rehearsal. Well she saw the seating chart that day and let us know her last name was spelled wrong and I said oh shit, sorry. 

Day of wedding comes and everything is great. Fast forward maybe 1 month later and my husbands brother tells his mom who tells my husband and I that his gf is upset at me bc her last name was spelled wrong on the seating chart and that she was seated at a table away from her bf. Obviously my husband and I didnt catch this and was an honest mistake. 

My husband reaches out to his brother and asks and brother says its true but that the gf doesnt want to talk about it yet bc shes so hurt. Okay, 3 months later she sends us a text to have a sit down with us so we can discuss the issue. My husband and I, his brother and his gf we all meet up one afternoon. The gf starts by telling us that she may start crying and shaking when she gets upset....okay.? She pulls out her phone and says she has a list of things she wants to talk about that I've done that made her upset. I thought WTF. She starts off by saying she has a problem with ME and these are the issues. She starts going down her list blah blah. One of the issues was the misspelling of her last name and the seating chart mistake. She said it made her feel embarrassed and angry that she was almost in tears and ran out of the wedding reception. \eye roll\ I explained it was an overlooked mistake and my husband chimed in and apologized to her. She said okay. She then said how would I feel if I were in her shoes and I said honestly I wouldnt be offended. I know mistakes happen. And she called me a liar and said she didnt believe me or forgave me about that but whatever. 

She moved down her list of things and brought up things from our past. like wtf. then she asked me and I quote" to respectfully back down and not ask her about when shes having kids, when shes getting married or make a big deal when her and her man show affection towards each other." FYI, they never show public affection so when they do I say awww look how cute or stuff like that. i guess that bothered her. i said to her okay I wont do that again sorry. Its funny bc my husbands family and everyone else can ask her those things but ME. I get it. She said im not being a girls girl. 

This sit down lasted atleast 2 hrs and at one point she started shaking bc she was so upset and my husband and i just sat there. My husbands brother didnt say 1 word. He sat there and let her speak almost like allowing her to get it off her chest for her sanity. I know he doesnt have a problem with me bc he hasnt told me that he does. throughout the sit down we apologized to her if she was hurt by anything we did. Towards the end she said i know we wont ever be best friends but we can be cordial. i agreed and we all hugged and said goodbye. 

On our way home (husband and i in the car) i started balling. I guess it finally got to me and i was feeling overwhelemed and targeted. We were defenitely blind sided by her and it ruined my whole week. I cried that whole day. Thinking about what I did wrong that made her attack me like that. eventuallly i forgot about it but i cant seem to let it go. It really hurt me. 

  
Side note, over the summer I invited her over to my mother in laws house to watch my wedding video with my husbands family. She came over while the movie was playing and went straight to her bf's room for a couple minutes then left. But had the audacity to ask for a copy of the video a month later bc she wanted to watch it. really? BS. 

To say the least we tolerate eachother. I keep my distance from her. I dont sit next to her. Occasionally we'll chat here and there about the brothers when we are around them but thats it. I've never really liked her and now I have my reasons.

ANSWER: She doesn't want you asking her anything so don't, don't even talk to her again. If she this sensitive then she does not need you around her at all. Pathetic little crybaby can happily be left alone.

QUESTION: Baby announcement fail

Burner account, but thought it was too funny to not share. Husband announced our second pregnancy to his family by sending our announcement photo via text. Well, no response lol. Husband family doesn’t really talk to him but were extremely pushy with our first baby, we had to set boundaries. I don’t like his family in the slightest, reasons like this. But anyway, I find it funny no response. Couldn’t even say congratulations!

ANSWER: They think they are "punishing" him for setting boundaries.

Petty. And very rude.

I mean, who doesn't at least say congratulations? 

Now you know, they have big feelings that they can't handle. Since they can't have things their way, they are going to pout about it. Proceed accordingly.

QUESTION: Social Media Monitoring

Years ago my jnfil deleted me off of his socials.  Taking it as a cue to avoid him, when he visits from out of state I am not present.  Spouse and I agreed if he tried any weird games with our children, jnfil would be cut out (spouse is also LC with him).  Flash forward, jnfil's wife (not bio mom to my spouse) is still on one of my socials - she rarely posts and I forgot she was on there. She reached out last spring letting me know it's "nice she still access to kid photos so that 'grampa' can see them." I respond "well he would have access had he not deleted me. ". A week later jnfil sends a friend request.  It's been fine for the last 7 months but yesterday on a birthday post for my kiddo, he goes through ever picture and likes it except for the picture of me with my kiddo.  Spouse says it's 'weird' but we both decide to not engage with it because it's petty and jnfil loves to stir the pot.  Jnfil calls my spouse by the end of the day.  Spouse rejects call.  Jnfil sends a message saying "to wish 'x' a 'happy bday'." But not jnfil has asked for a call today from my spouse. I can't stand that he is so incessant on low-key targeting me and trying to get my spouse to take sides.  Spouse barely wants anything to do with him at this point.  Jnfil has done other things directly to me in the past i.e. calling spouse to say he didn't feel welcomed at our because of me (I tend to leave before he comes over - that has since stopped and spouse meets him at a local neutral location). What is this guy's issue?

ANSWER: I would block him and his wife tbh

I blocked and deleted for far less. You don't owe explanation either.  "Bad vibes" is enough

He doesn't like you and made it clear but still wants some control. He doesn't even need to like you to be respectful and he isn't. He deleted you because he felt like it now you do same

================================================================================

QUESTION: In-laws Make 0 Effort and Then Get Mad When We Don’t Accommodate

My in laws have always been terrible grandparents in that they’ve made it clear (through actions) that they don’t really care about the grandkids. From my husband and his brothers’ stories, this seems pretty typical for their parenting too, so we never expected much more.

Lately, however, it is like they are trying to blame us, or set up to blame us, for their lack of relationship with our kids. We stopped putting in much effort because of their lack of effort. We always had to be the one to FaceTime, invite them places (and they’d often say no anyway), send pictures without requests, etc. So we decided we’d let them communicate a desire to see the kids instead. We have barely heard from them since other than the few times we still call because our daughter requests it.

Then, last Saturday, they text my husband and request seeing the kids that afternoon. We already had two play dates scheduled that day: one before nap, and one after. And we had plans Sunday afternoon with some of my family who we had not seen in 4 months. We tell them this. The response was something like “we didn’t know you had all this going on” which felt pretty passive aggressive considering they don’t communicate with us ever and are not entitled to know our daily schedules anyway. So we say next time let us know a little more in advance and that next weekend will probably work if there’s a time they’d want.

They then don’t make any effort to plan anything or communicate with us the whole week. Our daughter calls them once and they only talk to her on FaceTime (which results in a lot of silence because she’s 2 and she doesn’t pay attention to them for long). This is par for the course with them though—they’ve always just asked her questions during FaceTime calls and it’s weird and we’ve started not answering the questions because she’s not directing them to us. If she’d like us to answer, she can communicate like a normal adult.

However, my husband did bring up them maybe going to a movie our daughter wanted to see all together. Silence on their end.

Then we get to Saturday morning, still no request to see the kids. We ended up making plans with friends for Sunday afternoon. We then text the in laws Saturday at 9am because we thought it was strange we still hadn’t heard anything, to let them know we have plans Sunday so if they want to see the kids, to come that afternoon instead. They respond saying they have stuff to do and were actually planning to come Sunday.

Neither one of them work or have any friends in our city. There is no way they have actual plans that they can’t do during the work week or any other day (ie they often say grocery shopping is their “plan” for the day). My husband tells them they can come over Sunday morning before naps instead. They don’t respond all day. My husband texts them again around 7pm and they respond “that won’t work” and that’s it.

It seems so passive aggressive and strange to us. Granted, that is how these people always are so it’s also expected. Not really sure what the intention of this post is but here we are.

ANSWER: Your venting

Drop the rope 

Your daughters 2. Just misdirect her when she asks to FaceTime with anyone that doesn’t do any of the following:

1. Cherish her
2. Adore her
3. Make time for her 
4. Love her using actions, behavior not just words 

You already know why. You guys sound like you are completely fine without them.

ANSWER: What I find irritating about my in laws is that, while they immediately “accepted” me into the family, they made zero effort to get to know me and assume everything about me is exactly the same as them or my husband. 

Also, my in laws are horrible guests, they “make themselves at home” to the point of being rude… like rearranging our cupboards, leaving their laundry, personal items, garbage strewn all over our house, and going into our bedroom without knocking…etc. 

They bawl every single time we part ways. They’re just emotionally exhausting and immature. They’re difficult to make plans with and will constantly push boundaries.

QUESTION: Sister in law is righteous AF. I desperately want to leave the family chat!

We've been trying to work out Christmas gifts given there are 15 in the family and it gets costly at the usual $100+ea. 

We've just doubled our mortgage, other BIL also bought a house this year, and SIL has a toddler with another on the way. 

We're all just average wage earners..So early Oct, I put a poll in the family chat with something along the lines of, 'Given everyone has big mortgages/baby on the way, how do you want to approach gifts - just for the kids or $50ea etc' (we've done capped price gifts before).

Anyway sister in law chimes in with her righteous self: "I think the point of Christmas is being missed, it's about being with family, not about gifts. Buy for who you want at a price you can afford". (Obviously it's about family, but it's nice to know plans so I can get gifts sorted).

TODAY.. Sister in law drops a $200 gift suggestion for her toddler in the family chat.

My husband (her brother) says, "A little out of our budget given the bigger mortgage this year sorry".

She goes: "Welcome to the real world like the rest of us".

I'm fuming. We have double the mortgage they have, but we also had a mortgage for 8 years prior to this new home, so it's not like we just joined the "real world". I naively expected her to be like, 'Oh all good guys, here's a list of options at different price points'.. but instead I feel like her comment was condescending. Like she's indicating it's hard with a mortgage yet didn't like when I tried to cap the price of gifts..  

I don't know..am I overreacting?? I'd like to leave the family chat at this point. 😂😂

ETA: Hubs and I had a chat and we have both muted and archived the chat for a few weeks. Temporary freedom!🤞

ANSWER: Reply back with - We are choosing not to do gifts this year. You are right, spending time with family is more than enough.

QUESTION: Advice

I need advice. My in-laws are visiting us for over a month. My husband and I are both professionals, we have 2 very small children and neither one of us is living close touch our families. I just want to say I love my husband very much and I do believe it's important for my children to have relationships with their respective grandparents. I need help navigating this. 

They're currently visiting us in our small 3 bedroom place. They're here for over a month. My youngest sleeps in a crib in our room and my 3 yr old sleeps in his own room. The in-laws have a bedroom and bathroom to themselves. They're lovely people. But I find them constantly crossing boundaries especially the mother in law. My husband is great he deals with everything I bring up but I can see how the time goes on he is tired and just is becoming more and more passive. I'm wondering if I'm the problem. Maybe I'm just not amenable enough. Our 3 yr old goes to Montessori during the week but on the weekends is obviously at home. He needs to nap during the day. He does at school without issue. At home it's a bloody struggle. Recently I put him to nap in his bed and he started screaming the usual, I want to get out. I waited 10 minutes watched him on camera and then I went back in there to soothe him.  I then left again. He again was upset. But he then quieted down. I was like great. I looked at the camera and my mother in law was in bed with him. I was like wtf. This is just one issue that we've had to address while they've been here. I'm unraveling here. I told my husband and he was not enthused. I was just livid. I'm still livid. I did not want blow up in the house where they can hear me so I left the house for a cool down walk. My husband met up with me and we had a blow out fight.  I'm upset. Of course the fight just wasn't about this one issue it's every issue we've ever had. I digress. I'm at my wits end and I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm constantly telling these people no you can't do this. Please don't feed my kid sugar, please don't get him from the crib before 630... My husband thinks we need to have sit down conversation for everything and we aren't clear with the rules and need to explain every rule. His mother raised children. These are our children. This is our home. 

How do I navigate this. Am I overreacting.

ANSWER: I don’t think you are over reacting. I think your husband’s idea of sitting down with them is a good one.  Clearly go over your expectations.  Remind them that you make parenting choices for a reason, and they need to respect them.  They are there as guests.  

After that, your husband needs to take on equal ownership on calling them on their behavior if they continue.  This is too much on your shoulders.  

If they cannot follow boundaries after that, I would not agree to a month long stay in the future. It is clear that what has been going on is not good for your otherwise strong sounding marriage.

My husband and I have 3 kids… so I have a strict no shoe rule in the home. Honestly, a lot of my friends and children’s friends also have a shoe free home. My in laws hate this. They refuse to take their shoes off when they come over. Drives me nuts. They are not old and are in good health. Looking for any and all advice on what to do or think about this situation! 


An update to this  in laws are here today. Husband and I both made it clear before they came over about the no shoes. They brought slippers and took their shoes off at the door. No fighting or arguing was needed to get the point across! Thank you for everyone’s advice and input… I will still be purchasing slippers and shoe covers for them and any other guests for some more options :)

ANSWER: We have the same house rule. I personally don’t negotiate with people on it if there are no mobility reasons as to why shoes cannot be removed. 

I’ve purchased disposable shoe slip covers for my dad when he visits, since he has trouble reaching down to remove and untie his shoes.

QUESTION: Advice/reality check needed

Hi everyone, I would really appreciate some advice and/or a reality check if needed. 

My partner‘s family has an enmeshed, dysfunctional dynamic, and it is very hard for me to be around. My partners sister (my SIL) is a narcissist alcoholic, and every family event revolves around her. I know that she will never change and I have accepted this. My problem is not with my SIL, but with all other family member responses to my SIL. 

  
For example, my SIL will get drunk, put her son in danger, threaten the family with violence and/or calling the police, make a huge scene. Family gets upset and tells her the behavior is unacceptable and that drinking is bad. A few hours later or the next day, she will apologize and the family makes every effort to include her in all family the activites the next day. She will get immediate praise for wanting to stop drinking, being an awesome mother, and being an empathetic person. The experiences of my SIL are prioritized above everyone else. and the cycle begins again. 

I know that my SIL will never change. I’m not bothered by the substance abuse or the abuse of the family members. I have no hope of this ever changing. What I am struggling with is everyone’s efforts to include SIL in every family event, the prioritization of her experiences, and how the family seems to experience total memory loss between the occurrence of an incident and SIL‘s “apology” hours later. 

please give me a reality check or advice. I have absolutely 0 trust with my partners family members because of this.

ANSWER: They love her, you don't. 

They see somebody they love and somebody who wasn't always the way they are, somebody that they have known all her life, they still see the giggling baby she once was, they still see hope. 

You see a narcissistic alcoholic that you don't particularly care for, see as a lost cause, and I'm guessing you'd prefer she wasn't in the equation at all.

QUESTION: Another update on going NC with my MIL

I got served with a temporary restraining order and have to go to court. I went no contact with my MIL after she called and made a false report to animal control regarding me. I guess she was searching for some type of contact or reaction and chaos, but never got it. She put that I have been stalking her and harassing her since October. The dates she listed was our last conversation where I told her I can no longer take her daughter home from school. She alleged that I have been showing up with a “weapon” to places she is at and that I am “coercing” her family members to be against her. I still haven’t contacted her. Then later this week she called my husband’s place of employment pretending to be a worker from a vendor and alleged he physically assaulted her while servicing a store, but the store she claimed it was at is not on his service route, and his work has GPS tracking, so they knew he was not there. She also claimed she saw him smoking weed on the clock and yelling at people. The next day my husband started getting texts from things as if his number was signed up for text alerts from places. 
I’m sure the restraining order will be dismissed due to lack of evidence on her end, and I believe my text messages will prove no harassment was made, but this is annoying.

ANSWER: File your own protective order based on her false allegations. Worst case scenario, both are granted and you have mutual NC.

If you don't already have outdoor cameras, get some today so you have evidence if she tries to come to your house to do something stupid.

================================================================================

QUESTION: What level of involvement is okay for Grandparents?

Hi guys 
So basically we have a 3 month old and my mil was very helpful after my wife gave birth. She basically stayed with us (my wife really) and helped us for almost 6 weeks. 
This but also because fil went overseas so she it was good timing she could stay with us but at the same time it was like she was also in need you know?

Anyway I have had a lot of issues with in-laws where basically they were very nosey and tried to tell us how to run a house. They still are to some extent I guess but idk if that’s a them problem or my wife just sharing every single detail with them about what we buy, eat etc

Anyway besides the point but also I just mention the above for context. 

So now my in-laws come visit us weekly or sometimes twice a week. And sometimes we go over once a weekend for maybe 2-4 hrs. MIL sometimes stays over which I find a bit awkward even though she usually cooks and helps prepares food for us. I find it awkward because like we’re a young couple and she lives 15 mins away so it doesn’t make sense. 

My question is now when my in-laws do come over I’ve started feeling a bit of jealousy or idk why I feel like they’re taking over my son. Idk if I’m just overthinking things and they just want to play with him or they’re trying to make him like them more than me (he’s still a baby but I imagine seeing them a lot as he gets older he’d develop attachment to them).

Idk it’s little things like when I’m holding him they just come and take him off of me like even though they were already playing with him before and have already put him down. I just get this uneasy feeling when they stay too long that they just want to hog him. Yes they do only see him once or twice a week but idk it makes me feel some way. 

Should I discard these feelings or should i navigate around them with caution?
I’m worried as he gets older they’ll start dictating how to raise him up etc. my mil already gets mad at my wife when my wife doesn’t dress him up in the clothes she likes :/ How often should in laws see grandchildren? What should their role be? Any advice is much appreciated :)

ANSWER: First - in my humble opinion NO ONE should just take your child out of your arms.  

Second - how does this involvement impact your marriage?  Even if they are not doing anything "wrong" - that much "company" would drive me crazy and I would start to resent my spouse.

Have you had a discussion with your wife?  Hey - want more time with just the three of us - can we limit visits to x?  I am guessing you are working - if outside the home, then you already have limited time with baby, so let her know you want more.

You should not ignore, or as I said you will start to resent everyone.

congratulations on the little one.

QUESTION: Engagement overshadowed

So me and my boyfriend told his family a few weeks ago that we where officially looking at rings to get engaged sometime soon and then randomly a few days ago his mom invited us to a dinner with all the boys girlfriends and said it was a family thing. (Backstory one of the girlfriends is really mean to me. Tells my boyfriend’s ex where I live so now she’s my neighbor, take pics of me at family events to send to her group of girlfriends to make fun of me, got her sister to assault me in a bar etc. so we don’t get along and I won’t go to any events with her there) we decline this dinner bc my boundary is that I won’t be there if she is there since she can’t be mature. Well for some reason his mom was super insistent that we go and said they won’t seat them until the whole party is there. All fifteen of them. With all of us there is eight so we were confused and she just casually sends a picture of the engagement ring. No warning. Her whole family was going to be there for their engagement dinner. I’m so upset because they knew we were about to get engaged and I feel like we deserved a heads up and not to be blind sided by her whole family being there especially since they all treat me really bad and I don’t like the girl, I wouldn’t want to go to her engagement party regardless and I feel very disrespected right now and so disappointed that now we can’t get engaged bc they just did. I feel robbed and I don’t want to be apart of this family at all anymore after this.

ANSWER: Planning to get engaged "sometime soon" could mean anything; days, weeks, months. They were ready to get engaged, so they got engaged. It's not cool to expect other people to put their own timelines on hold for the sake of your vague future plans. In the future it's best to keep those plans to yourself until you're ready to make a more firm commitment. 


That said, their engagement doesn't need to put a damper on yours. The initial excitement of theirs will wear off in a few weeks anyway. Or do yours privately if you're worried about public scrutiny. Marriage is a long game, and who got engaged when relative to whom will feel pretty trivial once you're settled into married life down the road.


It definitely wasn't cool for your MIL to try to blindside you into attending an engagement party you didn't want to attend though.

QUESTION: BIL makes me uncomfortable

I needed to vent what happened to me last weekend. To start I wanna clarify that in no way am I leading my BIL on. 

Ever since I met my (step) BIL he has always had some sort of lust towards me. Like when i was home with my husband and he was outside staring at me from the window. He hadn't even knocked. He gave me "creep" vibes. From there it has been escalating. I have always tried to keep to myself and dress very modest around him because he's always watching me. A few yrs back I was sitting with my baby and he came up with a pretense of looking at my baby. He got close enough that he sniffed me. I don't use any perfume or scented lotions. I could also tell he got aroused. Recently he stayed at our house. I kept my distance, lived in over sized clothing and did chores. He was talking with the hubs while i made breakfast for my son. He came into the the kitchen and was saying "Hey, thank you for letting me stay, i really appreciate it. If i got a hotel it would have been so much more expensive. I know ur not a hugger but I am." And he came in trying to hug me. I replied, "No, i dont like hugs." He still tried to hug me, but i put my arm out to push him away, all he could do was grab me by my shoulder. Then he walked away laughing and saying. "She's like get away from me" Then he started saying how he missed sleeping with his wife and he couldn't sleep without her. Husband was in the living room and he said nothing. Needless to say this past weekend i had little to no sleep thinking this man would barge into my bedroom (husband gets home past midnight). Interaction with him is limited by me.

I have brought up every single instance i notice his step btother has tried something towards me. My husband will either brush off my concerns or laughs (the time he sniffed me). He in no way sees his brother as threat towards me and thinks this is normal "man" behavior.


Update: We talked when he got home. I told him how uncomfortable his brother made me feel in my own home and how he looked at me. How i couldn't sleep, and was always on edge. He did apologize and hadn't grasp how it affected me. He did say his brother wouldnt stay with us next time. Like I said hes a great man, but hes bad at reading people.

ANSWER: Ew. If this is normal “man” behavior would your husband act this way with another woman? Your husband is acknowledging that something weird is going on even if he’s trying to dismiss it. A woman can tell when someone is being creepy towards her. He needs to be listening to you and making sure you’re comfortable.

================================================================================

QUESTION: BIL's girlfriend is a criminal, need advice.

My BIL is in a relationship with a woman that has a criminal past that I can’t see passed. The background includes assault, theft, forgery, fraud, reckless driving and child endangerment (her own). I looked into her background because she had mentioned things that made me uncomfortable. My in-laws have decided not to prohibit this woman from their home because they “don’t want to cause tension”. They are also of the mindset that a woman is not dangerous but if it was a man then maybe they would have a different opinion.

She has “stories” for why she has a criminal past and they are all “it wasn’t my fault but someone else”. My BIL is an idiot and believes her version of things even though court documents and police statements prove she is lying. He is also benefitting from her financial support so that may be impacting his opinion. 

I have no direct proof, but I believe her mishandling of medications resulted in the death of an elderly woman she was living with and providing care for. She became the beneficiary of the elderly woman's estate prior to her death which is how she is able to support my BIL. Since I have no physical proof and the death certificate states congestive heart failure I don’t know what else I can do to try to prove this. She has made statements that this elderly woman was abusive and controlling of her when she was living with her and she is thankful to have “survived” the situation. (I do believe that people can be abusive to their care providers, but I don’t think that was this situation.)

This woman makes my skin crawl. I intentionally do not invite her to things at our house but I know that eventually she will come as a guest of my BIL. My husband is equally creeped out by her but has the opinion that not interacting with her is the best course of action. He believes that only bad things happen when she feels threatened or wants something from someone else, and as long as we appear to have nothing she could want she will leave us alone. He thinks that drawing a line and saying you are not welcome in our home will only provoke her. I kind of agree with this but I still don’t want this woman in my home. We do have children and they are aware of her past and avoid her. We do not let BIL spend time alone with them or take them places because of her.

Looking for any advice on what to do in this situation.

ANSWER: I wouldn't be inviting them over, and if you do, have cameras and lock the bedroom doors.

I have a couple of distant relatives (second cousins) that I’ve  met in real life like twice. My profile is private and I only have around 60 people on it, all people I actually know.

The problem is, these cousins are extremely annoying. Not malicious, just oblivious and weird.

For example, one of them clearly sends photos of my child to people I don’t know. I figured this out because she accidentally sent me a message meant for someone else with a picture of my kid attached. I know that technically once something is online I can’t control it, but it still felt odd, like why send pics of me and my child to random people that don't even know me? 

She also constantly compares my appearance to random older relatives I’ve never met, and herself, in a weird way. She made collages of my face next to hers or other relatives some being older ladies that look nothing like me to show how much we “look alike.” Besides being unflattering, it was just… odd. I can't imagine doing this and it's just cringe to me. I'm not being a bish like I wouldn't harass some girl that's 20 years younger how we look like twins either and honestly taking my pics to make collages with them is odd.

Then there are also the odd comments. For example, I posted an ultrasound with a joking caption like “looks like his dad,” and she commented, “It’s way too early to determine this.” Like… ok.

I posted a photo of McDonald's and got comment of how its unhealthy. Lots of mildly patronizing things like this here and then. I don't get super angry but it accumulates and I'm now just completely annoyed.

None of this is evil. They’re not bad people. They’re just obnoxious, and honestly exhausting. I don’t know them, I don’t interact with them in real life, and their whole side of the family is similarly overbearing online. They also spam my messages with that glittery art with cheesy positive quotes and dumb jokes even after I said repeatedly I'm not into it and trying to ignore it. So I finally blocked them all.

Maybe I'm a jerk but I feel relief

ANSWER: They're annoying and exhausting.     What took you so long?

QUESTION: Need advice.. bad MIL

I need some advice.. maybe just to vent too.. a little backstory: my husband and I have been together for 10 years, married for 5 and have 2 little children together. In summary, my in laws have been pretty awful to my husband and I. We’ve really tried to force a relationship that isn’t there, have countless conversations, lots of tears and stress. My husband I NEVER fight, our only arguments have been his family trying to come between us. His parents are extreme narcissists so it’s near impossible to reason with them and we made the extremely difficult decision to cut them off about 8 months ago, it was more so them walking away but we decided to make it pretty clear we were done and it has been great for our family. We are really happy. Anyways, my MIL has tried getting my husband to have a relationship with her recently because the holidays are approaching and she asked him to choose her over me, etc.. We made the decision that we do not want our kids around their hateful/toxic behavior after years of trying to fix this VERY broken relationship. My sister in law and mother in law are really the root of the toxic behavior and I will say my husband has handled everything really amazing. 100% takes my side, has made it pretty clear if they don’t get along with me/the kids, he won’t have a relationship with them, etc… Anyways, my MIL has been trying to talk to my husband and he will give her short responses, but she is constantly trying to go behind my back with communication, trying to get them to meet up, etc… I’m just very uncomfortable with everything. His family has done and said horrible things about our family and I have no interest in having them around. I know they are family and his parents but they have broken too many bridges at this point. I’m pretty uncomfortable with his mom reaching out to him, and really honestly don’t like him responding back to her… is that unreasonable of me? I’m not really sure what to do. I don’t ever want to be controlling or anything, like if he wants to respond back to her, that’s up to him, but idk… I’m just uncomfortable and it’s been eating me alive on what to do… any advice would be helpful. Thank you!

ANSWER: Ultimately,  it’s still HIS family.  You need to let him work thru it.  Speaking from experience, it is much easier for you to go NC, than it is for him.  You don’t have the ties to memories, siblings, etc.  \HE\ has to be ready as well. You don’t want years to go by with him resenting you for alienating his family. And what if one of the in-laws dies?  That’s a lot of guilt to carry. (trust me……it’s a LOT…..went thru it when MIL died last summer)  All of that said………him figuring out what type of relationship he will have with her doesn’t mean that YOU or your kids have to deal with her. He can deal with her crap on his own.  When I finally that I was done, I told him that I wasn’t going to let our kids be around them either.  The behaviors were toxic and unhealthy.  If these people were neighbors, we would never want our kids around them.  The fact that they are related doesn’t make their behaviors any more acceptable

QUESTION: in-laws threatened “grandparents rights”

We were no contact with my in-laws for a while because of multiple issues. Recently, my husband and I decided to meet up with them to try to smooth things over and see if things could be better. They didn't acknowledge our hurt and only theirs was important (hurt bc they couldn't see grandson).  Instead of apologizing or trying to rebuild trust, they told us they were going to take take us to court to try to get grandparents rights if we never "made up" or go no contact again. We kind of made up but this whole thing isnt sitting right with me.

I was honestly stunned. We went there to see if we could repair the relationship, and their response was basically a threat to drag us into court over our own baby.

I looked it up afterward, and legally they wouldn’t get anything — they have no standing and my husband and I on are on the same page about no contact, and a judge would probably laugh at the situation. My state only allows grandparenting time if my husband and I aren't together. But the point isn’t whether they’d win. It’s that they said it. They were willing to use the court system as leverage against us just to get access to our child.

My husband says they “just want to be grandparents” and will “do anything to get that,” but to me that sounds even worse. If someone is willing to do anything, including threatening legal action against the parents, that doesn’t make me feel safe or comfotable with them. It makes me feel the opposite.

He’s moved past it, but I can’t. It broke any trust I had left. I can’t pretend it didn’t happen. It makes me anxious and angry every time I think about it, and it changed how I see them completely.

I’ve told my husband how bothered I still am, and he understands, but he also knows his parents will never change. Even he doesn’t know what to do at this point. He doesn’t want to go no contact again because he still wants them in our lives because they are his parents and "family is everything" to them. But it’s hard when I’m the one who feels unsafe and disrespected.

I’ve been trying to convince him to move out of state to put some distance between us and his parents. He’s actually on board with that, but he’s struggling to find a job that would make it possible. In the meantime, we’re supposed to see them this weekend for my husband and sons bday dinner, and honestly, I’m dreading it. Every part of me is anxious and uncomfortable, and I’m hating every second leading up to it.

ANSWER: When you are threatened with legal action, you cut contact and tell them they can talk to your lawyer. They threatened you now you need to move. Get ahead of this and go see a lawyer.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Am I overreacting or is my MIL being condescending?

My husband swears she isn’t, but given the context, this message instantly irritated me and I need outside opinions.

We have a distant but polite relationship with my in-laws. We really only see them during birthdays or holidays. Anytime my MIL does try to make plans, it’s always extremely last-minute often the night before or even the day of.

Example, last year on New Year’s Eve, she invited us for dinner on December 31st at 8:30pm. My husband and I both work demanding jobs, and we’re pretty structured people. Our weekends (like most adults) involve errands, obligations, and coordinating with friends/family who have kids meaning we need more than same-day notice.

We’ve politely explained multiple times that we’re happy to make plans but we need a bit of notice. Even a heads-up earlier in the week would help. But she never changes her approach, and then complains that we never make time for them.

Now I’m 4 months pregnant, and we actually haven’t seen them in person since before we found out. Out of nowhere, she sends this text. My husband still insists she meant nothing by it. I’m not convinced. Am I being hormonal, or does the tone of her message come off as passive-aggressive.

Update: Husband called MIL ON Friday to let her know we would come to them on Saturday after our errands, gave her an estimated time range. We called 30 minutes prior to let them know we would be on our way. His mom and sister were 2 hours away at a salon getting their hair done and said they did not know when they would be finished. But this is once again why we have put up boundaries in regards to our time because she is simply disorganized and does not respect anyone's time except hers.

ANSWER: I think she was being polite. I thought your response of needing even more notice was unnecessary

QUESTION: Im about to be done with my partner due to him and his family

My partners family is horrible. First of all they asked for money when I first met him. Second he tends to tell his family our business. He will sit on the phone in front of me and tell his mother our business from day to day. He doesn’t have a car so I let him go places he needs to go. His family says I control him cause i apparently don’t let him drive an hour away in my car to see his mom when he wants. His sister had threatened to siphon my gas because she had to come pick him up one time. They want to be in our business so much I told him to just go live there again. Yes it’s one issue but it’s definitely been a big issue for me. Also his sister is addicted to drugs(coke and pills) and I don’t want to be around that. I’ve always gotten along with my partners family but it’s horrible. It’s gotten to the point where I told him I don’t even like him talking to them or being around them. He admits they are horrible but still talks to them, is in their business and drama and then turns around and talks about me. I’ve begged him to stop talking about me like that and he says he needs to vent to his mom. This is a man who calls his mom multiple times a day. Not to mention they keep in contact with his baby mom in an unhealthy way and also tell her our business. This is literally a family from hell.

ANSWER: Ask yourself why you’re with him. What are you getting from the relationship? He doesn’t sound loyal or kind or caring. Sounds like he’s still a little boy way too attached to mother. You have a whole life ahead of you and deserve a good life. Find someone who’ll love YOU more than mom.

QUESTION: Normal relationship expectations

TL;DR -- How do I deal with my dad's expectation that my spouse be best friends/super close/a confidant to his girlfriend?

Full disclosure: In this case, the "in laws" are my dad and his girlfriend (we'll call her "Shelly"), and my question is about their relationship with my spouse and my brother's spouse (the son- and daughter-in-law).

There is a LOT of tension in the relationship between my dad and Shelly and our spouses. Most of "us kids" think a huge part of this problem is unreasonable expectations of the "in-law" relationship. 

The prime example is that Shelly will text our spouses incessantly, fishing for a reaction/sympathy/a response. And when she doesn't get it, she complains to my dad who tells my brother and me that we're being mean.

Gifting is another issue. We tend to get Shelly pretty generic gifts for Christmas (a scarf by a local artisan, locally grown tea, etc), and my dad always gets mad that our gifts aren't personal enough. 

In contrast, I don't get my husband's dad's wife anything for Christmas! My husband's dad's wife has never texted or called me. Ever. She doesn't even call my husband. When she did last month, we thought something terrible had happened to my spouse's dad.

Anyway, we go round and round in circles because our spouses aren't "closer" to my dad's girlfriend. But I don't think there should be an expectation that they are best friends, super close, or even have a family-like relationship. I don't even know where these expectations came from.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Any thoughts or insight? How "close" are you to your parents-in-law? ...and their partners?

ANSWER: If a handmade something from a local source isn't a good enough gift for a non-stepparent girlfriend,  I'd be all done.  They can go find their own friends.

QUESTION: Updated| Abusive Father in-Law from H -- Cutting Ties with Toxic People

Updated Saga:   
I wrote a post in this thread a few days ago while my in-laws were still visiting us (staying in our home) and since writing it we had a major falling out-- probably the first time I had actually engaged in a direct discourse with him (my father in law) -- ever! 

Back Story:  
My inlaws live about a 2 hour flight from us as of today. For the last 7 years we lived in Canada (they are in brasil) but now we are back in Brasil thus-- closer. Father in law has a history of physically and emotionally abusing my husband and his sister by doing horrible discipline methods like making them kneel on dry rice for for and hour, hitting them with frying pans or wooden spoons. Was obsessive with my husbands sister to the point of her not being allowed to date until she was in her 20s. Hated every single partner she had including her child's father. He has since turned his obsessed to his only granddaughter, spoiling her, telling her that her parents don't love her and that her dad is gay (this is so bizarre). He no longer has a relationship with his daughter, and his daughter doesn't let him visit his granddaughter unsupervised.   
In general, he is the type of constantly farting, spitting, burping unpleasant sort who treats waiters and sales people horribly, talks extremely loud, eats with his mouth full and spits and has borderline personality disorder. He repeats himself 3-4 times, we have to eat at restaurants he likes or he refuses to eat or complains. Treats his wife (my husband's mum) terribly, by constantly calling her annoying, and threatening to leave her. He is however, wealthy and super generous. Which makes everything he buys for us feel haunted and poisoned. 

This week, after a few major falling outs (which I managed to avoid by literally keeping my head down around him -- I AM DONE.  One of the falling outs being because he was screaming and encouraging my husband to beat my dog with a shoe because the dog was begging by the table. When I told him to stop, he screamed "I am talking to my son!" to which I replied "He is your son, but he is also My husband, and this is MY House, and that is MY Dog".   
Ultimately he showed me such disrespect and contempt, and when they left for the airport he didn't even say bye to me. I told my husband today that unfortunately I have reached the ending point of my desire to pursue a relationship with his dad, and moving forward I would support my husband 100% in visiting his parents without me. If we do need to stay in the same city, we will be getting a hotel or air bnb. Really sad because his mum confided in me yesterday that she ignores her husband and purposefully finds reasons to stay home so that he travels to his beach house alone-- just to get time away from him. My husband of course is extremely sad, but as of this moment understands why I would want to cut off communication. Being around him makes my blood literally boil and is too stressful. 

Does anyone have this situation where you really like one in-law but have severed ties with the other?

ANSWER: Sounds like MIL should visit when he goes to his beach house and maybe you can convince her to leave the POS she is married to.

QUESTION: Sister in law says I stole her brother from her.

We (sil) have always had a weird relationship. It started off as us becoming fast friends and then when I got engaged to my now husband, she completely turned. A lot of insane shit happened that I won’t get into, I want to make this short. After we got married and live together, she said I stole her brother from her, not directly to me but to someone else. She constantly shit talks me behind my back. She is very manipulative and always wants free work done around her house by my husband. She wants every free second of his time, actually.

ANSWER: Yes, that's messed up. We usually hear that from mothers about their son being "stolen" from them by their DILs. It seems like your SIL is just as disturbed, with an unhealthy attachment to her brother. 

She can be as loony as she wants but what's your husband doing about it? He obviously can't change her but he needs to make sure it does not impact your marriage. Like, with her wanting free work done around her house. That would not be okay if it was excessive or got in the way of your couple time. 

If your husband capitulates and tells you it's normal for his sister to infringe on your marriage, then you have a husband problem. I hope that's not the case.

You don't have to have a close relationship with her, or much contact with her at all. She obviously doesn't like you, so don't bother with her.

QUESTION: Reasonable Visiting Time

Alright, I feel like I may be a little out of touch with how long family should stay for the Holidays.  My inlaws are planning to drive to us for Thanksgiving (we had previously offered to drive to them because we haven't been to their house in a little while), but they insisted it was too much trouble/inconvenient for us to do that during the holidays with the kids (7&9). But now their plan is to drive in on Tuesday before and not leave until Monday morning following Thanksgiving.

I feel like this is an overstay, and also puts us in a weird spot of still hosting people while trying to get reset for the return to work/school after the Holiday weekend. We also typically decorate the tree/house the weekend after and I really enjoy doing this just as an immediate family. So now we either do it before or have to wait until the following weekend. To top it off, they are bringing both of their dogs which are extremely sweet but we have two dogs and a cat of our own and that is just A LOT for 6 days.

Am I in the wrong for thinking this is too long of a stay?

ANSWER: I’m sorry, but they wouldn’t be staying at my house. That’s entirely too long and your husband needs to tell them.

QUESTION: Are we justified in distancing ourselves from my husband’s family after repeated exclusion?

My husband and I have dealt with years of being excluded and talked about behind our backs by his family. They’ve never liked me, constantly make excuses for their behavior, and never take accountability. They also believe I “control” my husband, which couldn’t be further from the truth.

Recently, my SIL’s ex-fiancé reached out and confirmed everything — the dysfunction, the gossip about me, and how unhealthy their circle is. Hearing it from someone who was actually inside their group was eye-opening.

The latest incident: at my in-laws’ anniversary party, we arrived a bit late (long story, plus my husband is in a wheelchair so everything takes extra time). When we walked in, ALL of the in-laws and their partners were sitting with the bride and groom at the main table. We were told to sit at a different table entirely — conveniently the only one with exactly the number of seats for us. No explanation, nothing. Just another “coincidence.”

This isn’t new. They excluded us last year from a graduation celebration too. It’s always something.

We’re exhausted, disappointed, and honestly done. With Thanksgiving coming up, we don’t even want to go. We’re tired of being outsiders in a family that seems to enjoy making us feel that way.

Are we wrong for stepping back and protecting our peace? Or is this justified given the long pattern?

ANSWER: In your shoes I would just stop having anything to do with them and make your own family.

QUESTION: Wife’s Aunt pressuring her to make plans.

So since late October we have been dealing with having our second born in the NICU. We were already pretty hygienic people, but we’ve definitely stepped up our game considering our situation. In a perfect world we are hoping to be able to take our baby home early January.

Now we’ve talked with multiple families who have had the NICU experience. Some have said, extreme or not, that they went no contact(visitors) for half a year after returning home. Considering their babies were still on oxygen. Other people have mentioned letting their family hold their NICU baby immediately after being released. 

We’ve talked about it, and we probably lean more to going with no visits at least the first 3 months. With nobody holding him besides us for the next 1 year.

Given our projected release date, my wife’s aunt has been trying to schedule events for us in November and late December. Baby showers, babies first Christmas, etc. Like we couldn’t plan something ourselves? She adds on the fact how her parents, my wife’s grandparents are in poor health. 

I’ve been thinking about everything, and it is all just so complex. If we are going to do anything with one side of the family then we need to include the other side. By that time we’ve already hung around 200 people possibly a week before our NICU baby comes home… we’ve already mentioned taking only our parents out to eat somewhere close to Christmas time(where nobody can hold our first born). The aunt however seems to be pulling plans out of her ass to get included. I’ll note that she has 4 kids who are at the child bearing age, but none of them have gave her a grandchild yet. I feel like she’s trying to be a grandmother through us.

ANSWER: just say "thank you for thinking of us, but this does not work for us at this time".  and keep it on repeat.​  don't give explanations, she will just tell you why you are wrong.

after the 3rd time of telling her no, say "Auntie, we are done discussing this.  we are not going to go out with baby or have anyone in.  please don't bring it up again".  if she does, just end the call.

be repetative and do not feel you need to explain.

QUESTION: Random Inlaws Rant

I live in a separate city but me and my husband often visit my in laws during festivals, occasions and anything whenever they feel like. Visiting them means I change my routine. Or they will have some gyaan to share which doesn't apply to her sons at all. If I question that they start saying no no..everyone must follow this. I am a long sleeper naturally and so does my husband. Waking up at 7 and serving everyone tea can just not be done. Earlier my MIL used to complain about it to my husband and give me gyan about health and waking up early only to help her with chores before logging in for work. I work from home, yet I am expected to make tea, ask for tea in the evening when everybody wakes up after a nap and then cook dinner for everyone. If I log out late, everyone waits for me to come downstairs and cook. 

I used to think they're good souls and I never had to do much, but that's because I am already working. I see my MIL and her sister (she visits us during festivals) often keeps track on my work, when do you logout, whenever you do, let's get done this in the kitchen or that. My husband is a freelancer and I work full time, but their tendency to expect me to handle all chores along with work makes me scream and be passive aggressive to them. 

For the context, my MIL and FIL are extremely lazy people who depend their lives on servants and honestly I feel they just want a few more hands by calling us. They get so disturbed if their maid takes a sick leave for a day. My MIl/FIL doesn't get out of bed, or washes her own clothes or dries them or waters garden, or cleans her own room. Even the smallest tasks like thinking about what to be cooked gives her headache and she goes back to bed..even changing a bedsheet takes her to call the maid twice in a day to get it done. 

My parents live in the same city as my inlaws and I am expected to seek their permission everytime I go and let them know when I am coming back. This time she suggested if I can stay back for taking care of them as she was getting a Cataract surgery done. (Just cz I work from home). I asked her to come in the city we live but since we don't have many servants around, she got scared that she might have to clean her own space and carry the plates to the sink. My husband found this new place to shift from 1bhk to a spacious flat so that she could come here (as she used to constantly nudge us that 1bhk is too small for her,go for another flat and we shifted). It was too heavy for us and had it not been because of her, we would have taken our own time and planned it well. I lost weight, energy in the process of these few months. And then she said no, I can't come (which in a way is a good news for me personally).

I have been putting aside my life, we hardly travel to get a break from my routine.. I feel tired all the time there and the feeling of resentment never leaves me. Recently she posted an AI generated reel in our common group which said how a DIL should make a balance between her parents' home and in laws. This irked me to the core..why?? Cz I left your home without asking for your permission to meet my parents. I feel so fucking agitated with this behavior. The audacity here is that you call helping hands your home, ask them to run the chores, help with your surgery, expect them to put aside their own life for you and then ask permission for the slightest thing they wish to have. Also, even a day's delay feels like a year to them if I don't come back. And they start behaving like people in misery without me around, that there was no one to do this or take care of that. Okay, so that was with 6 members and 2 maids for cooking and chores. I just don't like them anymore and my ears ache when I listen to them complaining all the time over phone to my husband how their life is miserable and they want a full time maid for their support.

ANSWER: Permission to see your family? Get real. That is insane

QUESTION: Rant about two-faced inlaws.

I had 30 people at my wedding. two inlaws were already throwing shade, and it was the first time they met me. then mother inlaw was a snake in the grass. mom inlaw was very kind and seemingly welcoming. only to find out she was bad mouthing me behind my back. called me a gold digger, and conceited. one time I cried on the phone after she wished me a merry christmas and I asked her if she meant that. she said of course, youre family. then, before she hung up the phone I heard her suck her teeth, and say to whoever was next to her "she started crying". very fake woman. i told my husband that I am glad they live in a different country, because when we have kids, I don't want them around my kid. you want to bad mouth me? i'll give you something to talk about. you will never see me again, and I don't want you around my kid. the one time I will bring my child to puerto rico will be at one of their funerals. one thing I can't stand is fake, two faced, passive aggressive people. my family is not liked that. we are very blunt. we will tell you how we feel to your face, and if you cross one of us, we will simply cut you off. we will not pretend to like you, but gossip and talk shit about you behind your back. i don't vibe with people like that. if i'm going to talk shit about you, it's going to be to your face, or while you are cut off. not while smiling in your face. my in laws are very fake people.

ANSWER: I like your family’s method of dealing with falseness and meanness. I’m blunt too, increasingly so as I age. If you act like you don’t like me I’d have to say “t’s easy to tell that you don’t like me.  Why? Did I offend, do I owe you an apology?”
That may make them even faker, but they know that you know. 
I’m quite prone to dumping people out of my life if they are too much to take.

My MIL is a very sweet lady, but has intense and very untreated anxiety. She's also retired, on a fixed income, and lives several states away from me and my husband (both in our early 40s).

I'm having surgery next week, nothing life-threatening but still requires several weeks of recovery. Today I got a card from her in the mail, addressed to "Mr. and Mrs. [husband's last name]". 

Inside was a note - "I was always there for [husband]'s medical needs and I want [OP] to know I want to help her too!" - and a $50 Amazon gift card "for movies while I recover," which is kind and thoughtful.

There was also a check for $1,000.  She knows we're not struggling financially, in general or to pay for this surgery. And this is a LOT of money to her. I am 100 percent sure she means well, or at worst this is some kind of coping mechanism for her own medical anxiety and/or guilt about not flying here to nurse me back to health or something. But I would feel wretched cashing this check.

Husband is planning to call her about this tomorrow. He agrees with me that taking her money is gross, and that not taking it is also going to really hurt her feelings. Any advice on how to approach this?

ANSWER: Tell her you are so touched by the gesture and don’t need the money so you are going to frame her check and keep it over your desk where you’ll see it everyday as a reminder of her love and sacrifice. And take a nice picture it framed and hung, then take it down and put it in a closet or something

QUESTION: AITA/ my inlaws want to take only my husband to the bahamas for 11 days and leave me and the kids at home. Am i wrong for being angry?

ANSWER: Mine tried this with me when we got married. Ski trip was planned and paid for by in-laws for the whole family. That is, the whole blood family! I was not invited so my husband refused to go. His dad wouldn’t speak to him and didn’t understand why I would go. Said I could pay my own way. First of all, we were young and broke. Secondly, why would I pay my own way and no one else? Ridiculous They’ve tried to pull this many times since then too, but they acted the worst in that situation.

QUESTION: Is it me!?! Am I the drama!?

Sometimes I can't help but wonder if it's me. Like, am I thinking too much ... overthinking it?

I don't know why the things she does or say irks me!!! they drive me crazy that I am starting to wonder if it is me!!! if I am the drama.

My husband and MIL is going to a bday dinner that I declined to go. It's my husband's friend's mother bday dinner. I just don't want to be the third wheel of my husband and MIL at these things. And most of the time I dont end up talking to anyone, just sitting by myself so this time I said no to going.

They are going to give cash for the friend's bday. My MIL wants them to put the money in the same envelope with the bday card and address it from them, no one else. My husband said to put my name on there as well. My MIL responded and said. no we will not be putting her name on the card, I didnt put dad's name or your brothers name, they are not going. and that they should give the gift as one. 

My thing is, if the table was turned around, no doubt the card would have said it was from me and my husband whether he was there or not. and I wouldn't have combined it ....... 

Am I over thinking it?!

ANSWER: it isn't you - and I get the impression this is just one of a thousand cuts.

I sincerely hope your husband has your back.

QUESTION: Undecided 😭

I’m feeling conflicted and emotionally drained because of my in-laws. My husband of 2 years is wonderful, loving, and treats me like a queen, but his family’s behavior causes me constant stress, anxiety, and sadness. 
Even small interactions with them leave me tense and crying. I feel like I can’t fully relax or find peace while they’re around, and while my husband comforts me, I don’t know how long I can tolerate them. My mom advises me to ignore them and not go around but I feel like it’s easier said than done. I’m torn between wanting to stay with my husband and protecting my mental health. I keep asking myself: if I have to shield myself this much, do I even belong in this family?

ANSWER: I think you should show your husband this post and discuss it. He needs to know how miserable you are and stand up for you. Your marriage MUST come before any family of origin. ❣️🙏🏻

QUESTION: Second time ranting about father in law living with us

i posted a few months ago how i was tired of my father in law living with us and how the invasion of privacy has taken a toll on me. he moved in in January of this year so about 11 months now and i see my relationship with my husband becoming worse. i absolutely hate my life just because I’m paying half of the bills and i don’t get to enjoy it at all he’s in my space i hate it. i took a vacation day and i couldn’t enjoy it i jsut stayed in my room all day and cried because what is this. my father in law is a 58 year old man and he has no job he’s always staring at me, everytime I’m cooking in the kitchen he’s just watching me. if i go in the living and i start watching a movie he thinks it’s okay to just start talking to me instead of just allowing me to enjoy the movie. idk what to do anymore. i am studying so i can have a career and once I’m self sufficient i plan on just moving out it sucks bc i love my husband dearly and i don’t want to make him choose between the two of us because I’m positive he would choose me i just don’t want to have to make him make that choice, plus his dad has nowhere to go. but the loss of privacy has made me a shell of myself. I’ve become irritable and angry for no reason it feels like. the sound of his dragging feet on my floor infuriate me. for the next three years while i finish school can somebody give me advice on not caring when he looks at me or when he asks me questions how can i just ignore the fact that I’m being watched… im tired of being watched. I’m tired of being angry. i just want my privacy back. i feel like an zoo animal on display or something. Hes also said comments like one day we went to the grocery store and i made a list of things we needed and condensed milk was the last thing, he said where is it? I said I’m not 100% sure but i think it’s in the baking aisle and he said i doubt it’s in that aisle and it actually was but he does comments like this all the time 😖😖😖

update: what he does for us, he washes the dishes for us and will sometimes watch our child.

ANSWER: You sit your husband down and tell him the situation is not sustainable anymore.  You are not comfortable in your own home and you are beginning to resent living there.

His dad is 58 and needs to get a job and move out.  Give him 30 or 45 days notice, and stick to it.  Stop enabling this hobo and get him out.

If you're at your wits end, tell him either dad goes or you and baby will.  But before you throw out the ultimatum, have a Plan B in case he picks dad.

QUESTION: Am I being dramatic?

For reference, my husbands family has always been close and I grew up only seeing family on holidays. We lived with my in laws for 2 years before getting our own place 30 minutes away. My MIL is my boss so that doesn’t help my situation. Anyways, we got pregnant and immediately the in laws said they’ll be in the waiting room to which I immediately said please no….nobody listened. I told my husband several times I do NOT want anybody in the waiting room because I don’t want to feel rushed with visitors. Fast forward to me having our baby and we tell all of our parents we will text when I’m out of surgery to let them know I’m okay…his parents took that as an invite to come back and walked in on me fully naked trying to breastfeed. Husband immediately told them to get out. His mom was constantly trying to show up at the hospital during our three days there and tried coming over the first day we got home which my husband thankfully said no. His sister flew out the day we got home to visit without even asking so we had a full 3/4 days of visitors in my most vulnerable time. I should have said something and I’m sure my husband would’ve kicked them out but I was SO out of it. Fast forward my baby is 9 months and we’ve constantly said I will be making my babies food at home and Everytime I see my in Laws, my MIL is trying to feed him anything she can to which I say no. I’ve been asking my husband to please tell her to stop since it feels like she doesn’t respect my choices if she keeps asking the same question….ive mentioned how important it is for me to make him food at home myself since he was a newborn. I know my husband loves me and I know if I really told him to stand up for me, he would but I don’t want to put him in that position. I know I could loosen the reigns and I’m working on it but it’s so hard when MIL is pushing every boundary she possibly can. Please someone tell me I’m not totally crazy

ANSWER: You are not crazy. It is YOUR child. If you want to make food for your child, she needs to respect that. She made food for her kids, now its your turn. Be more stern.

QUESTION: Am I wrong?

Some context first I am 23F my fiance is 25M and we have a 8 month old daughter who we will call bear. 
While I was pregnant with bear my relationship with some of my inlaws became very strained because of my FIL leaking the gender before the reveal as well as snarky remarks about how sick I look and intentionally ruining my baby shower. My relationship with my MIL is amazing however it is strained because of all the other stuff. 
Fast forward to now bear is 8 months old and I am a SAHM no one has ever watched her for more than a few minutes so I can run to the bathroom or eat and that’s how I prefer it I don’t believe she is at an age where she needs to be left with anyone other than me and her dad. Last week I got a call from my fiancés grandmother and was told that the family is falling apart and that pretty much it’s because I refuse to let fiancés parents watch bear and that if we didn’t let them they were thinking of cutting us out of their lives. There are a lot of other things that have strained our relationship such as me being talked about behind my back but then when my fiance confronted them with me in the room they back tracked and told him he misunderstood(BS). But I don’t know what to do my fiance said if that’s how they feel then they can go ahead and cut us out but I feel like this is all my fault and I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to leave my baby with anyone and also I don’t think threatening us is helping me feel any better about leaving my child with them. I feel as though we’re being manipulated into doing what they want. It’s also worth noting that they 100% do not respect any boundaries we have set for bear. We were told at 4 months old to put her in another room and to let her “soothe herself” also was told at 6 months old to give her a slice of a cake they had bought when we went to their house for a visit. I can count the amount of times they have seen her on my hands and I have not seen them around her enough to even feel slightly comfortable with leaving her with them. Am I in the wrong or should we just say 🔩 it and let them do whatever they feel they need to and focus on what we think is right and raising our baby. 

Thank you for any response please just help me figure out what I need to do.

ANSWER: Let them cut you off and celebrate that you no longer have to deal with them. You and partner are the parents. You two are in charge of your child. Anyone who tired to make demands about my children would no longer have anything to do with them. Do not back down. It's your and your partner's job to protect your child at all costs.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Ah, the holidays....

Let me just preface this by saying that I've dropped the rope a LOT in the past 8 years and basically put up a ton of boundaries. They've fiddled around and found out a lot since then. My husband is a good guy, but enmeshment and his family's programming runs deep like a malignant cancer. And no, I didn't realize the full extent until after we were married (we were both pretty young). He has come a LONG way since we first got together, and my backbone is getting spit shined. 

My inlaws are JustNos. I've been patiently dealing with them for 16 years. We gave his parents "first dibs" at holidays for YEARS, but they never make any plans more than a week to 2 days out, despite being asked. This of course meant that we ended up firming up other plans and doing holidays on separate days (my parents are super understanding about it all, even though Christmas especially is a HUGE deal). Every single year, his mother complains about it until one year, she got snippy that we weren't coming on Thanksgiving day (we asked her 3 times about plans) and she said "Well, don't expect me to cook Thanksgiving all over again on another day!" My husband laughed, then came back at her and said "Mom, you've had the opportunity for first dibs for 9 years, but you refuse to plan. We don't expect a meal. It is what it is." She still complains, but more passive aggressively. 

  
Their house always causes me allergic reactions, despite medication, and we really cut back on our visits the past few years. Last year, we went to their house for Thanksgiving, and it was just horrible. Their kitchen was piled high with junk, old food, and filth. I don't eat uncooked food there ever, and usually feign lack of appetite to skip it all, or dietary concerns and only eat my food (which became an actual thing when I developed a common food allergy and they refused to stop cooking with it). I heavily control what the kids eat for safety (which of course my ILs make fun of me about). It's become worse over the years, and they've intermittently had roaches. Their house is very dusty- I'm talking everything is covered in a thick gray haze. Their walls are completely lined with furniture and books and clutter, mildew is an issue since they rarely turn on air conditioning during our humid summers. At Thanksgiving last year, we found out they knowingly had a roof leak for 3 years (that they did nothing about) and there was unremediated mold in the attic. They have the money to fix it, they just don't. 

The day after this visit, all 4 of us became really sick with upper respiratory issues, and I finally conviced my husband it was their house. Unfortunately, this began a health spiral for one of our children and we ended up 2 months later with major breathing issues and a $4k out of pocket ER stay.  

I have now told my husband we will not be going back to their house. He can go, but neither I or our children will step foot there. He agreed after seeing what happened to our child. This isn't a big deal except at Thanksgiving... we aren't going at all. My husband decided to wait till they brought up plans to tell them they could come to our house, but we will not be visiting (yes, we've already asked what their plans are). This isn't going to go over well, but I get to plan my first ever time hosting Thanksgiving (I'm honestly really excited!), and we don't have to drive for 4 hours round trip!

ANSWER: Are you saying you've spent 16 years visiting a filthy health hazard house to be polite?

QUESTION: Holidays..

So I am needing some advice.

To he brief my husband is wanting to spend the  Christmas holiday with his parents. We just had our first child this year and I was excited to spend the first holiday together as a family. Intimate yes, but that's typical for us. 

He hardly ever sees his family and I believe hes just insisting on seeing them now because he told them we would go. (He's very non confrontational). 
Am I being to emotional for the day? I barely know them and last time we went a few years back they were cold and distant to me so its not very "cozy" to begin with? 

Also, baby is still young we would have to fly with a 5 month old which is another whole beast to begin with.. 

Edit: Thank you everyone for the advice. I suppose I already new this, but its noce to see im not just in my own end. Being postpardum and all its a transitions emotionally and mentally... 
Its been a discussion for sure we both have come to a stand still on the matter. If it was just telling the inlaws something that's one thing, bug husband wants to go and is worried about disappointing his family and he just generally wants to go as well. 

What other solution can there possibly be? I did offer he can go by himself. Which hes already stated he wasn't interested in doing.

ANSWER: You or baby might need to be “sick” and therefore unable to go (Christmas Covid).

Or with the air traffic controller situation, you might not be able to purchase or afford to purchase airline tickets.

Can’t get time off from work (not everyone can get Christmas off).

I’m sure something will pop up, and you will be unable to go.

Good luck

QUESTION: Honestly, am I being petty or reasonable. (Holidays)

Every holiday we would be “ forced” to spend with in-laws because my husband refused to change his mind.  15 years!  Finally last year I won the battle.  I can do thanksgiving with my side & on Christmas we will do his family.     Both families there’s a 15-30 minute distance.     While my fathers family is no longer living my mothers family is and is very active with my kids. Calling, visiting, school functions.  

This year I was told that my mom wants to go to a friends thanksgiving instead.  Last year was the first time in 15 years I spent with them, and honestly bums me out. 

Now my husbands all excited he gets to go to thanksgiving with his family (and Christmas because I haven’t won that battle yet) but absolutely none of them show any interest in my children, they give me the cold shoulder and I feel sad and uncomfortable.    They won’t call my kids, visit my kids, birthdays, etc but they want to be able to spend thanksgiving & Christmas with them.   My kids are hurt because they never visit and I don’t see how my husband doesn’t see that! 

I’d rather stay at home and not cook food (Turkey for 2 sounds exhausting since my kids won’t eat it anyway) but my husband thinks that’s selfish and petty because my other plans fell through and it would “hurt his moms feelings”

QUESTION: Anyone else realise that your husband is treated differently to other sibling?

I’m so upset tonight as over my entire relationship I’ve seen my in laws treat my husband differently and unfairly compared to his sister. This behaviours gotten worse since he fell out with his sister after she spend years bullying me. 

Some examples of their unfair treatment have been: texting, calling, seeing her more and helping her out more financially, emotionally and even with housing. 

I’ve called this out and have been met with excuses like “oh well he has you and she’s single” or they just blanket deny it. 

It’s very upsetting to see as my husband’s a big softie who loves his parents and I can tell how badly this impacts. They basically act like he doesn’t exist unless they need something from him.

ANSWER: this type of favoritism always extends to grandchildren, sadly. it may be tolerable to some degree now, but once you have children and you see how they treat certain grandchildren less than others (your children vs SIL's).... it will become intolerable to you both. better your partner grieve that relationship now rather than once you see your kids mistreated.

QUESTION: Partners parents keep overstepping boundaries and it is causing arguments

I’ve posted before about my partner’s parents crossing boundaries, but things just keep piling up.

Recently, we decided to bring a puppy home (he isn’t home yet). As soon as we got back from meeting the breeder, my partner’s mum called wanting updates. Then his dad started pushing us to bring our puppy over on Boxing Day to meet their dogs. I had already said no — our puppy will be too small, and one of their dogs is overly excitable while the other gets anxious and barks at new dogs.

Today I found out that my partner’s mum shared our news about getting a puppy with my partner’s sister — without telling us she’d done so. I know it might sound small to some people, but I feel like this was our news to share, not hers. It’s yet another example of her inserting herself into things that don’t involve her.

I’ve told my partner many times that I’m fed up with these constant boundary issues. It feels like she wants to be involved in every decision we make. He says he’ll talk to her about making him feel guilty for not spending more time with them, but I don’t think he’s ready to address the larger issue — that she consistently oversteps.

At this point, we’re arguing every day about it. I don’t know what else I can do. How do I get him to see that this is a serious problem before it really affects our relationship?

ANSWER: He's still on the tit. Until this enmeshment is dealt with, he will always let his mama come between you. Therapy.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How soon is too soon to banish a future MIL & family from my partner and I’s home?

Context: 
My partner and I have dated for 7 years. We grew up in the same hometown, lived together for almost 2 years, have a pet, and purchased our first home all as young twenty-somethings. My partner is the legal owner of our home only because we are not married yet. We plan on marrying in a yr or two… we are only in our twenties and just starting at life. 

Future MIL in question: 
In the 7 years we have dated one mom was always a “tiger mom.” I consistently received from the mom unsolicited photos, links, videos, social media posts, and more of that mom’s youngest offspring who is my partner’s sister. Its also all that I saw her post and comment about when I was scrolling on my phone. The mom would somehow also find a way to bring back anything said outside of phones about or around us to her daughter. To be fully transparent: we feel this daughter is in a completely different life situation than ours post-college that doesn’t have any legitimate grounds to stand on when throwing upon others. It makes the bragging done by the mom so very awkward every time she does it as she is clearly blinded by the fact her daughter just breathes. When we confronted them politely multiple times in various mediums about this behavior, the mom blew up. She openly made it a me problem by making fun of me, my career choices, friends, and my personality right in front of my partner. My partner and I finally agreed it was just smart after setting the boundary multiple times for me to just block the mom and the sibling on all the socials. Then it got weirder. After we purchased our first home together, the mom sent things in the mail to our home with the other sibling’s name and photos on it as “gifts.” 

Triggering “nail in coffin” event: 
This past month my partner’s family wanted to come visit a weekend that I was away working 3 12 hr shifts in a row. They know I can’t change my schedule. We said yes, but set very clear ground rules of our home. We said to not bring any alcohol or food as we will provide and cook for them. The mom still brought many bottles of wine and food in a cooler because she was afraid her “food would go bad if left at home.” Noone needs to bring that much stuff for a mere 2 day visit. When my partner confronted the mom in our home while I was at work the mom stated “well, this house is only in YOUR name, isn’t it?” Did (insert my name here) only make these rules?!” To talk behind my back like that, and to egg on to talk behind each others backs in an attempt to separate us, is insane. She continued to defy my partner‘s wishes for other smaller less important things throughout our home, but more importantly wouldn’t even listen to him when working with fire in our backyard (very dangerous!). 

We quickly reached an agreement that at least for the holidays this year they cannot be around us and they are not allowed in our home. But do you all agree it is the safest option to ban them even after the holidays until they can prove themselves otherwise? This is so overwhelming and nasty for someone to knowingly put all of this on a couple before marriage. I feel like we are just now getting to our feet in life.

ANSWER: Unmarried couples own homes together and are both legal owners. Is this not the norm where you live?
Your partner's mother is an extreme psycho. I would not have even allowed the visit after the mail situation. It is no surprise she disrespected your home when she visited. She aint right. The ban is not unreasonable. Good luck!

QUESTION: Angry VM Pt. 2

https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/s/bIJJkmEACJ

I received very solid and helpful feedback on my last post (link above). Because of that, I’ve decided to continue sharing the saga between my husband and I and his parents as we’re currently all at a standstill. The texts above are what my husband received from both my MIL and FIL. Names of both me and my toddler have been redacted for privacy but I assume you can read between the lines. 

I’m pretty confident in saying that I refuse to apologize, bend or fold to their behavior, comments, and now their silence. Even with the holidays that lie ahead. My husband shares the same feeling(somewhat), however, I’m just not sure it’s the RIGHT choice, if that makes sense. I’m not their daughter and with their history with us, I don’t stand to lose anything if we refrain from contact. In fact, I lose the stressful relationship they put forth with us, which is a win. I’m just unsure of what to do because it would by  my husband and toddler’s loss.

Some background details that I think are important - I’m a fulltime WFH mom. When I’m not working, I’m busy taking care of our toddler and being a housewife. My husband works as a supervisor and his schedule varies from day-to-day. When he’s not working , he’s also busy with our toddler and taking care of the house. We both have phones however and will respond to calls or texts when we can. We do not call or text anyone unless we need something. If someone expects one of us to initiate every conversation, that’s a huge problem and not fair. If someone wants to communicate with us, the expectation is for them to initiate.

ANSWER: Why does your MIL feel so entitled to be involved? Has anyone ever told her that you sometimes want to do family stuff on your own. Your husband needs to tell her that she's being ridiculous, imo. You are underreacting hard here.

QUESTION: To invite or not invite BIL to wedding?

I don't even know how else to frame this. I'm embarrassed.

My BIL is a 33+ year old man that works a decent job, lives in his mothers apartment and doesn't pay a dime in rent or groceries... really anything. He is a selfish human being, and as hard as I try, I do not like him. My MIL is ALWAYS venting about him, but doesn't do a thing about it. She lives paycheck to paycheck and he doesn't care. For example: he caused a huge argument when the MIL got a new 1 bed apartment, since her previous one was in an awful neighborhood. He complained how it's too much financially (even though he doesn't pay?). He literally took his 20 year old bed frame, stuck it in her living room, and sleeps there. MIL re-arranged her furniture around his bed to essentially hide it from plain view. She will complain for days about how he is so mean, how he does nothing for her, how he doesn't love her. But he still lives right there. We have told her to just kick him out at this point, he's a grown man that is sucking her dry, and she just counters with a sob story on how that's her son. 

The only time he calls is when it's about himself. He never asks how we are, he never congratulated us when we got engaged. As a family, all of the "younger gens" get together and split holiday meal responsibilities. He never participates, and if he does, it's like he'll fuck up on purpose or just ask his mom to make it on his behalf. 

Cue wedding planning. BIL lives with MIL. I hate this man. I am trying really, really hard to just let it go but I can't. At the very least, my fiance is well aware how much I hate this guy, and she hates him too. I have 2 invitations printed. 1 to MIL + BIL, 1 to just MIL. I am stuck on which one to send. I know if I exclude him, MIL will feel like I am taking a stab at her baby boy that literally lives right in her living room. Of course I am, I don't like him. On the other hand, as I've said before, I hate him. I don't want to spend a dime on his plate of food, I don't want him at my house. I don't want him in my photos.

Out of everyone I am inviting, he is the 1 person I just don't want there. Has anyone else faced something similar? I know I will be surrounded by so much love by everyone else. Do I just use that as my way to cope and ignore him?

ANSWER: In my opinion you should just invite MIL, but I would love to know what your fiancee wants to do.  It is her mother and brother, correct?  That really makes it her decision, or a joint decision for the two of you. It is not your’s alone to make.

QUESTION: How to have the hard conversation with in laws

Hello ladies!  
My partner and I are getting married in January 2027.  
We do not wish to live with his parents, they’re Gujarati and quite narrow-minded. Even though my partner and I are on the same page, his parents have now moved to Dubai with him, so for them, living separately will feel like a big blow.

Even though we know we’ll be staying separately, we’re unsure how to tell them. He gets super anxious about bringing it up, even though this is something we’ll definitely stand firm on.

If anyone has gone through something similar, I’d love your advice. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this ❤️

ANSWER: So I know nothing about your culture but in general it’s best to be direct and leave no wiggle room. Do not JADE - justify, defend, argue, explain—that gives them the impression they are in charge.

Something like, “Mom Dad, I need to tell you about a decision I’ve made that you may not like. I am getting my own apartment effective X date and alarmedmajor will be moving in with me X. This decision is final and not up for discussion. I hope we can continue to have a good relationship but that ultimately is up to you.”

Any questions about why are met with “because this is what I’ve decided” or “not up for discussion.” Any threats or insults or guilt trips with, “I’m sorry you feel that way. I understand if you need to take a step back from our relationship.”

When family calls to berate or pressure you, tell them the best way they can help in the situation is to help the parents accept that the decision is final so he can have a relationship with them.

Logistically he should be prepared for a complete and immediate cut off - make sure he needs nothing from them, they aren’t on his accounts, don’t have his important papers etc.

QUESTION: My husband’s family traumatized me and I don’t know if I can move on with a connection to them


TL;DR: My husband’s family has hated and tormented me since the day we started dating- stalking, screaming, sabotaging our wedding, and turning him against me. I’m traumatized and don’t know how to move on while he stays in contact with them.


I don’t even know where to start. My husband’s family has been absolutely bonkers since day one. When we started dating 7 years ago, he was still living at home and completely attached to his mom (dad was emotionally absent). The second I came into the picture, she decided I was her rival.

She’s done crazy things- like listening to our conversations through a stethoscope and poking holes through pictures of me in collages I made of us. Then the whole family joined in: his sister and brother mocked me through texts and sent nasty voicemails saying, “The biggest mistake you’ll ever make is being with [my name].” I still have all the receipts, if any of them ever want to act innocent😮‍💨

When his older sister got married, I wasn’t invited until a week before. When we showed up, they excluded me from pictures, so my husband refused to participate. At the end of the night, his psycho mom grabbed me and screamed in my face, “You will NEVER be part of this family.” I left crying.

And it didn’t stop there. She called our pastor to tell him we were “bad people.” (He ended up officiating our wedding, so that was my little karma moment ✨) None of them congratulated us on our engagement. No one showed up to my bridal shower. Only his parents and two random sisters showed up to the wedding last minute, like it was some pity visit.

During grad school, I kept my distance- I didn’t have room in my head for their chaos. But now that life’s calmer, everything they did still haunts me. Every time my husband even mentions them, I tense up. It’s a trigger. I feel sick when he talks about family dinners.

He refuses to cut ties, and I get it- they’re his family. But I can’t do this anymore. Every reminder of them feels like reopening an old wound. I love my husband, but I hate that these people are tied to my life forever.

I don’t know how to live with that. I don’t know how to heal from people who never apologized and never faced any consequences. I’m angry. I’m exhausted. I’m traumatized.

If anyone’s been through something like this- where your spouse’s family destroyed your peace-how the hell did you move on? Or did you ever?

ANSWER: What has your husband done to make you a priority in his life over his family?

QUESTION: Drama, Drama, Drama

My husband moved from California to live with me in Wisconsin. Months later, his parents convinced us to move and live with them, so we thought that it would be a great opportunity to focus on his career and also be closer to his family. Before the move, we mentioned 6 months to a year of help. The FIL said when we both have a job, we can start contributing to small bills like water and electricity and save the rest to move out. Once we moved there, the first month was great and then everything started to go downhill. We were told we are taking advantage of them so we need to start paying rent. We had many complications with finding jobs, catching up on bills and etc. We relied on our savings. They had a talk with my husband saying that they are giving us 3 months by the end of December to move out or we get kicked out. A week goes by, they moved it to the end of the month. We were confused about everything. 

I assumed everything started to go wrong when my MIL opened my Amazon package that didn’t have a name on it. She didn’t ask whose package arrived. Instead, she opened it and kept it. My sister told me that my package had arrived. My husband and I searched for it, and when she heard us, she brought the item to us, claiming it arrived without a bag. I mentioned that Amazon takes photos of where they leave packages. She then changed her story, saying there was no name on it and threw the bag in the trash outside. I was upset and told her not to open packages if she wasn’t sure who it to belongs to. She kept apologizing while making excuses and bringing up about my culture. What does a package have to do with my culture? I asked for respect and she was offended. After that day, she held a grudge against me for a week and then acted as if nothing had happened.

In another situation, my husband and I took two weeks of our time to teach his younger brother how to drive. He graduated from high school, so we had a conversation on what his future plans are. We offered some guidance and encouragement. Mentioned he should work at least a part-time to earn some money for his own usage. Days passed, and the mother-in-law told us they didn’t want the brother to work but to focus on school, while still claiming to let him do what he wanted. The brother wanted to party every weekend so the parents allowed it. The brother also wanted to work and to do boxing, so he came to us for that support. They let him box, but not work. Since he was underage until fall, he couldn’t use his high school ID anymore to get a job. He needed to get an identification ID. His mom wouldn’t pay for it. Weeks went by, and we checked in with him. His mom still wouldn’t let him work. I shared my thoughts, advising him not to let anyone stop him from making goals in life. The mother in law was upset I said that because the younger brother tried talking to her again about working. Since then, it got worse for us.

My MIL went from calling me her DIL to my son’s wife. She also texted my husband that we need to buy our own dish soap and sponge. If we have dishes, put them away. I always put hers away without a complaint. No reason to. She “gave away” the air fryer that she knew we use at least 3 times a week. We had to borrow his grandma’s air fryer. After use, we put it where the old air fryer use to sit. She told us to put it in our room instead, but we didn’t have space. It was such a small room with half the wall fixed that could only fit a full bed and a small space to take 6 steps from the bed to the door. We sent the FIL money to build that wall, but he only put sheet rocks on his side of wall while ours look like a storage room with no sheet rocks. Telling us to be patient he will fix it when he has time, but it never happened. 

We came home from church and something felt off. As we walked into the house, his family rushed into their car. When I saw our bedroom door lock unscrewed, I got super angry and cried. His grandparents were home so we knocked on their door and ask if they knew anything. We told them the whole situations and the grandma was so hurt by it, she cried with me. My husband called his dad about it and all he said was we aren’t paying rent so he’s going to slowly take everything away. The locks to the walls. By the way, the talks about kicking us out and unscrewing our door lock was all within 2 weeks. 

We were going to keep it a secret, but I told the grandparents I was pregnant, but lost our baby just that week. We were still grieving, but the door lock was it for me. My parents sent us money that day and we left the next early morning. Since then, we haven’t spoken to his family on call. We tried to fix it through text, but it didn’t help. My husband sent a last message to his mom saying, when you’re ready to talk maturely, let us know. 

Could I have done better? Did I go too far? How can we fix this complication?

ANSWER: His parents were not ready for you two to be adults in their house. When they made the offer for you to live with them, they assumed you both would be more ”children” in the house. 

Once you got there and started helping his brother in a mature way and giving him life advice and wanting your own privacy, that burst their little dream bubble. They could not handle  having the two of you with your own opinions and methods for doing things in their home. 

You did nothing wrong. This is one of those hard lessons learned in your life. You both will be much happier once you get back to your old hometown.

QUESTION: MIL does not know boundaries?????

AITA- my husband (26M) and I (26F) are married for 2 years. During the first 18 months we lived on our own in our own apartment. However my husband got laid off due to the company rebranding which forced us to move back to his parents house for the time being while we catch up on our debts. Fast forward to now and it being a year since we moved back, I have been noticing things that my mother in law(53F) does that I’m not okay with. One of the bigger things is her going into our rooms (for who knows what the reason is) when we’re out of the house. Sometimes she would vacuum and clean our bedrooms. My sister in law who lived in their house previously too informed me that she also had similar experience. She endured all that for 3 years. There was a time where my husband and I were sleeping in and we forgot to lock our door the night before. She freely went in our room, without knocking and when her and I made eye contact, she all of a sudden asked if my dog is okay like ?????. The other time, my husband was at home and she just got off work, she was already in the bad mood and started cleaning our rooms and other areas of the house. She complained how our rooms were never clean when it was the only time my husband didn’t make our bed. And then she would also take our laundry and wash them without informing us. Maybe she was doing it out of the goodness of her heart however I am extremely picky with how I do my laundry and prefers to really just do it on my own. For reference, I have a set schedule (usually Friday evenings or Saturday) where I do my general cleaning and laundry because my husband and I work throughout the week and this is the only time that makes sense for us. She would do the cleaning on days she knows we’re not home then complains about how our rooms are not cleaned. And today, I’ve had it. I saw her in our bedroom without asking me if it’s okay to come in and then put up some Christmas lights at our window. She then told me to turn on the lights at night, I didn’t say anything first because I didn’t want to offend her by saying anything, however she started inspecting everything in our room and giving unsolicited advice. I texted my husband and informed him of the situation and told him that it doesn’t matter what she was doing or that it’s her “house”, she needed to ask our permission first before going into our rooms and then inspecting everything. I felt like my privacy has been invaded. I told him this weekend we need to change the locks in our rooms and I will start to lock our rooms when I go to work. Thankfully my husband agreed. Don’t get me wrong, I’m extremely thankful for them for allowing us to live with them when my husband got laid off however, I still think there needs to be some boundaries especially in our own space. We are in the process of moving out in the next year or two, just saving up for a house. There’s also an instance where she looked through my auntie’s Christmas shopping bags and just freely goes in and out of their room as well then told us that my auntie have started their Christmas shopping. My husband and I called her out and said “Mom, you shouldn’t go through their stuff like that”. She just brushed it off. FYI, we all pay a portion of the bills at home as our share/“rent” to them. I feel like there should be some boundaries there. How do I tell my father in law that we want to change our door knobs without offending them?

ANSWER: You don't have many options when it is in her house. I mean, how much do you expect to push back when her response could be today leave? I know it sucks. I would never do that. But she can go nuclear and then you'd be out of a place to live.

QUESTION: Brother in law

My husband and brother in law hang out once or twice every week at our house. That only doesn’t necessarily bother me, it’s more so that I find him rude.

I get out of work later so they already hanging out when Í get there and he never greets me. I walk in saying hi and he says nothing.

However, he has no problem asking me what’s for dinner, because we always have to feed him or making comments about finally being able to eat since I’m finally home.

He is much younger than my husband being in his early twenties but I don’t think that should be an excuse for being rude.

Am I blowing it out of proportion or is it really him being rude?

ANSWER: Eat before you get home. When BIL asks what's for dinner, look at hubby.

QUESTION: My in-laws have been laying into me about everything

My (23F) fiance (24M)’s parents constantly nitpick about what I do/say. It’s definitely more his dad than his mom, but I sometimes feel uncomfortable talking to him about it. It bothers him when his dad texts/calls him about what he perceives I did wrong, so when I go to talk to him about it, he’s also upset. We’re going to pre-marital counseling soon to talk about it there, but I wanted to rant here as well just to get it out. Here is a list of things his parents have done that upset me:

- We went to a wedding where I had two drinks (his parents don’t drink at all) and they were upset I drank at all and made comments regarding it.
- His dad once told my fiance he needs to ‘put me in my place’ because I didn’t want to text my FIL
- FIL insists I need to be texting him regularly and checking in on his life. I told him I was uncomfortable with this and he said it was an excuse. He says that I have bad communication because I don’t reach out to him asking a bout him and don’t respond exactly how he wants me to. 
- Every single time we’re with his family (Dinners, holidays, whatever), his dad will find something wrong with what I did and text fiance about it to complain and essentially insinuate he needs to fix it.
- FIL used to say that we (FIL and myself) needed to bring up our issues with each other as to not upset my fiance. I agreed and used to, but gave up when he was texting my fiance upset with what I was saying anyway. 
- Fiance and I recently moved in together and FIL was VERY upset with it. To the point that he was texting fiance daily about how he disagreed and we were ‘going against God’ and such. He tried to claim that he wasn’t going to talk to my fiance anymore if we proceeded to move in together. He basically lied given that he texted fiance like 2 hours later. He also tried to say he wouldn’t be coming to our wedding, two weeks later he offered (we denied) to officiate.
- Along the lines of the last one, he offered to officiate, saying that it would be a great opportunity for him to be an important part of our big day. I could be being overdramatic about this one, it just bothered me that he only talked about HIS benefits of doing it. 
- MIL tried to arrange birthday lunch for my fiance. I told her we should be fine but had to check. Fiance later told her we could in fact go. MIL and FIL texted later that night (at like 11) saying we would no longer be going to lunch the following morning because I also did not respond. I want to reiterate that fiance said we could go, I just didn’t directly respond because I figured I didn’t need to. 
- FIL said my parents weren’t being good parents since they were letting us move in together
- FIL regularly posts on Facebook and gets upset when I don’t interact with the posts. At one point, he unfriended me on Facebook and got mad when I didn’t reach out asking why. He regularly asked my fiance why I hadn’t reached out to him to ask why he unfriended me and why I didn’t care he was mad at me. Fiance knew I knew, we both decided to let it be. 

There’s more, but it feels nice to get that rant out.
Feel free to ask questions.

ANSWER: Your FIL sounds obsessed with you and not in a good way.

QUESTION: “Instead of worrying about wanting a relationship with your grandkids, how about fix the relationship with your kids first. They aren’t your do over”

This quote really got me. It had me figure out why I’m so uncomfortable and a part of why I absolutely can’t stand / don’t want to be around my in-laws. I figured it was because, it feels SO FORCED. My husband didn’t have a great childhood with his parents, some abuse, emotional neglect and so on. He has a hard time talking about it to this day. He’s been at a distance with his family all the years I’ve known him. 9. He doesn’t really talk to them, they don’t really talk to him, however they have tired more since we have started having kids. It made us uncomfortable. When we started dating we only saw them holiday times usually. Nothing more. Then fast forward we started having kids, unannounced drop ins, back handed remarks to myself when the unannounced drop ins happened while I was home by myself. We did address this problem and has since stopped. Demands for our time, back handed comments when we say “no”. More things have happened as to why I don’t like them or want to see them, you can read my posts. 

I spent all this time thinking why, why am I so uncomfortable and why all this anxiety about these people, well it’s because people who aren’t nice to my husband, stranger people to me, rude people to me, people who don’t even have a great relationship with husband, WANT to be involved with my kids and INSERT into our day to day lives. NO.

ANSWER: I really don’t understand that if you do not have a good foundation, you will have absolutely nothing to build on.

QUESTION: Struggling with My MIL’s Overbearing Presence, Seeking Advice

Hey everyone,

I need some advice on how to handle my MIL without it causing tension. She’s a kind person, but lately, it feels like she’s overstepping a lot of boundaries. Whether it’s constantly giving unsolicited advice, showing up unannounced, or making comments on how we’re raising our kids or running our household, it’s starting to feel like too much. I understand that she means well, but I can’t help feeling overwhelmed.

I’ve tried gently setting boundaries, but it doesn’t always go over well. My partner is supportive, but he’s also very close to his mom, so it’s tricky. I don’t want to cause drama or make things uncomfortable, but I also don’t want to keep letting these little things slide.

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? How do you manage your relationship with your MIL while still setting healthy boundaries? Any advice on how to approach this without escalating things would be greatly appreciated.

ANSWER: If even gentle polite boundaries don't go over well, then you're in a position of being forced to choose your own happiness over her happiness, because it sounds like it can't be both. She's likely the type who won't be happy unless everything is her way. Are you willing to do that for the rest of her life just so that she's never offended or upset? 

She knows what she's doing. She comes across as kind and well meaning, but if reasonable boundaries cause tears or tantrums, she's not as kind and loving as she appears. 

She had her turn to be in charge of her children and household, it's your turn to be in charge of your household. 

I know how difficult it is to feel like the bad guy by being confrontational, but the alternative is to be a forever child being told what to do all while handling the responsibilities of a full grown adult.

================================================================================

QUESTION: How often do you see your in-laws who live a couple hours away? Am I being unreasonable?


My in-laws live about 2 hours away from us. My husband and I have a 2-year-old and a 5-month-old, so we’re deep in the trenches right now.

Before kids, we saw them probably once every 2–3 months, and everyone seemed happy with that. Since having kids, it feels like everything changed. They’ve been upset that they “don’t see us enough,” even though we see them on average about once a month — sometimes more, sometimes every couple of months, depending on what’s going on.

They actually travel a lot themselves and are often busy — they’ve even taken multi-month vacations since we’ve had kids — so it’s not like they’re sitting around waiting to see us.

We don’t have a spare room, so there’s nowhere for them to stay overnight, and honestly I wouldn’t want overnight guests right now anyway. Between a toddler, a baby, and two exhausted parents, we just don’t have the bandwidth to host anyone.

They’ve also complained that they have to “make appointments” to come visit — meaning, they can’t just drop in. Which… yeah. We have little kids, a routine, and a life. We make plans most weekends, and the rare ones we don’t, we just want to be home as a family.

In the next month and a half, we’ll be seeing them three times, which honestly feels like a lot to me.

The constant complaining and guilt tripping make me want to see them less honestly, and dread the visits. So I guess I’m wondering — how often do other people with young kids see their in-laws who live a couple hours away? Does once a month (give or take) sound unreasonable? Are day long unannounced pop ins okay with you? Because sometimes I feel like I’m being made to feel like the bad guy just for having boundaries and a busy life.

ANSWER: Omg. Once a month with a 2 hour drive with a newborn and toddler?! Wow. It’s pretty sad that little babies have to sit through that long of a drive so often, just for the feelings of grown adults. My in laws live only 1 hour away, but my son has never been a fan of being in the car for that long, nor do I wanna see them that often, so we go once every 3 months or so. That too, on our time and if it works for us. We’re doing them a service by going, it’s not like I get anything out of seeing them, so they should appreciate the effort. When he was a newborn, we rarely went. As a sleep deprived mom I didn’t want to make that trip either. I make no sacrifices when it comes to my children or myself/my husband. Everyone else can wait. We come first. Sure there was tonnnnns of guilt tripping and drama and bs lol and sure it was hard for my husband at first, but shortly we realized we have to prioritize ourselves and put our own family’s feelings and health first. And absolutely no pop ins from them are allowed. If you want to see babies and toddlers who are living on schedules, then you have to be willing to abide by those schedules or F off.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I am divorcing my in-laws after over 18 years of their BS.

My hubby and I are in our late 40s. Married over 18 yrs. From the moment we announced we were getting married my in-laws in particular my MIL have been difficult and rude. A few years ago we moved out of the state we lived in near my in-laws. We only saw them 3-4 times a year. They have never been wonderful grandparents. One of our children has a chronic life threatening medical condition that has to be managed, but many people do so and live long lives. When my child was first diagnosed as a toddler, my FIL stated he would never watch her again. Mind you, my oldest was 5 at the time and they had watched that child maybe twice in five years. So…. Ok. Anyways they clearly favor my husband’s sibling. Despite all of the siblings legal and personal problems they suck up to the parents big time. Pretty sure the parents are this sibling’s retirement plan. We have two wonderful teens now. My oldest just graduated high school with honors. We were very proud of our grad. We invited my family and my husband’s parents. Last minute, my husband invited his sibling. We knew if we invited the sibling the in-laws would make the visit about the sibling and not the grandchild graduating. They did just that. We booked hotel rooms for everyone on our dime so everyone would be comfortable. At first we booked 3 nights. Then they said they only needed two nights. Once we invited the sibling who lives three hours away, the grandparents said they only needed one night. They flew up to the sibling’s house, drove down the day of graduation. Stayed 2 hours at my house. They acted inconvenienced all day. Went to the hotel and left the next day without swinging by that morning. While they were here two hours they tried to talk politics the entire time. All the kids left to play pickleball. 
These people are so miserable. I’ve had it. I told my husband that this is my last straw with them. I want nothing to do with them. My MIL tried calling me a week later because she realized she never took a picture of our child. I didn’t send the pictures I have. She just wants to post on FB like she’s a good g-ma. 
Not that they have ever called me on a regular basis. I’m done with taking their calls or entertaining them in any capacity. They truly suck. So yeah I’m divorcing these people. Finally.

ANSWER: What does DH have to say about all this?  Is he on board with LC/NC?  Best.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Am I overreacting or getting screwed over by my in laws?

My husband and I have been married 3 years. He’s my soulmate, we have a baby, life is good in so many ways…except our housing situation makes me feel increasingly resentful and stuck.

Before me, he owned a home with his ex. When they divorced, his parents bought out the ex and now HIS PARENTS technically own the house we live in. We pay the mortgage to them.

Here’s where it gets messy:
- My husband has ~$70K invested in the house.
- That investment is only “word of mouth.” No contract. No paperwork. Just trust.
- I pay about $1,200 of the $1,700 mortgage every month… on a house I have zero ownership or protection in.
- If something ever happened to us, I’d be forced out with nothing.
- And the best part? When his parents pass away, this house is split between my husband…and his brother. Meaning my money has been building equity for someone who isn’t even me.

To add salt to the wound:
His parents let him and his ex live in their beach house for FREE so they could save up for their home… meanwhile I’m handing over cash that goes straight into their pockets. I feel like the financially punished wife.

I’ve tried doing this the calm, adult way. We have approached his parents three different times asking if they’d sell the house to us or restructure it legally. Every time it ends with:

“You can’t afford it.”

I love my husband and I don’t want to leave him. This isn’t about the marriage, I adore him. I just don’t know how to stop feeling financially trapped and taken advantage of. I want practical ideas before resentment eats me alive.

What would you do if you were in my position? Can anyone offer me practical advice other than to “leave him” because that’s not an option for me.

Reddit, thank you in advance.

ANSWER: Can the two of you buy or rent elsewhere for $1200 a month?

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I deal with my so caring MIL?

It’s really frustrating — I don’t even know how to say it, but I want my husband and I to live on our own because my mother-in-law has gone too far. She tells everything that happens in our house to my husband’s sibling, and she has this meddlesome attitude — she interferes in every decision we make, especially when it comes to our child. She always contradicts us and insists on applying her own beliefs to our baby.

She doesn’t trust our decisions as parents, and it feels like we always need her or my husband’s older brother’s approval before doing anything — when in fact, this is our child and our family. We’re the ones who should be disciplining and deciding for them, not anyone else.

But the thing is, she says she wants to live with her grandchildren because she loves them so much. How can we move out and live on our own without making her feel hurt, especially since she’s already a senior and a widow?

ANSWER: Have her live with the other adult children. She is going to be hurt and your husband is going to have to be firm and tell her you need your own chance to be a self contained family. Good luck

================================================================================

QUESTION: What’s it like living across from your in-laws? Any advice or regrets?

Hi everyone,

I’m 24 F getting married within a year, and my fiancé’s 29M house is literally across the street from his parents. He’s really close with them, which is a good quality, they have a great relationship, and I love that he’s family-oriented.

Right now, I don’t think it would bother me much living so close, especially since I get along with them for the most part. My MIL keeps to herself however my FIL can be nosy. But I can’t help thinking ahead once we have kids or just start settling into married life, I feel like things could get complicated. You know… feeling pressured to visit, lack of privacy, unspoken expectations, etc.

I also know my fiancé loves me deeply, and I’m sure I could convince him to eventually buy another house if it ever became too much. Still, I want to go into this with realistic expectations and not resentment later on.

So I’m curious if you live (or have lived) right across from your in-laws, what was it really like? What were the pros and cons? Any advice for setting boundaries early on or keeping things peaceful?

ANSWER: We live next door to my parents. It goes really well because my parents treat me and my husband as one unit. If we are struggling even with relationship issues, my parents give advice or help in ways that support us as a unit and not individuals. 

I did once tell my mom "if you say something unkind about my husband you are saying it about me because I chose him."

My husband is not perfect, nor am I. My parents are not perfect. We do not always get along. Any of us. Yet we all want to see each other succeed and maintain mutual respect. I love it. 

My husband did not have the best parental examples and being so close to my dad has been life-changing for him. My dad has really stepped into a fatherly role for him. He teaches him things his dad never did. My mom gives my husband the same birthday dinner she does any of her kids. They see us as a unit so they treat him no differently than they do me.

Now, if we lived by his father and step-mom it would be a totally different story. They do not see my family as a unit. In fact, they really do not value even their own son how they should (and I am an enemy in their eyes). 

I really think this has the opportunity to be a wonderful experience for you. Have a sit down conversation. Explain you want to be seen as a unit. Talk to spouse also, make sure they are on that same page of defending you as part of a unit. If all goes well with that, embrace having bonus parents!

I pray this goes well for you ❤️

QUESTION: MIL is guilt tripping about Christmas

We decided to do Thanksgiving with my in-laws this year (which we do every year) and start the tradition of waking up at home on Christmas, opening presents as a family with our toddler for the first time and then doing dinner with my family in the evening. MIL can’t accept it and has tried to guilt trip us saying to my husband “you need to put your family first. ” He told her “I have a wife and child now, things are different.  In laws live 2.5 hours away and we spend the night every Christmas Eve and then spend half the day on Christmas driving to each of my parent’s houses an hour away. I end up exhausted and stressed out having to pack up the car with our baby’s things and gifts for everyone. My husband is starting to get manipulated by her guilt trips and feels bad because she told him they are getting older and won’t have many christmases left and that they need to see their granddaughter too, and it causes us to argue. I’ve offered for them to come to us, but they won’t break their Christmas Eve traditions to do that. I don’t know what to do or say anymore!

ANSWER: tell your husband that if he is weak enough to give in to his mother's obvious manipulation and guilt tripping, that you hope he enjoys his holidays without his wife and child.  only nicer than I did 😃

honestly, tell your mother-in-law that she got to make her own traditions, and obviously is still following them and now it is your and your husband's turn with your child( ren ).

the selfishness of these adults just blows my mind.  ​​you can get together anytime, let the children enjoy their holidays too.  do they really think that they enjoy endless car rides?

Bit of context me and my fiancée are expecting our firstborn in a few weeks however he’s always had a rocky relationship with his dad due to him prioritising his new wife over him when he was still very young etc. Since he found out we’re expecting he’s tried to step up a bit (got me an expensive breast pump and a few items etc) BUT last week he made a comment to my fiancée saying 
“I know I’m not going to see the baby as much as like as I know OP is so close to her mum” so because I’m close to my mum and want her help and support more after birth he’s getting funny about it. I know it probably sounds minor but his wife also has herpes and keeps making comments about kissing baby which he doesn’t try and shut her down.

QUESTION: I Have the Most Annoying Father-in Law - Prove me Wrong

My in-laws are visiting and I am at the point where I wear headphones in the car or pretty much any time I have to be in an enclosed space with him because of his mannerisms. A habit of sucking his teeth every 30-60 seconds, constantly repeating everything someone said in a weird voice or mocking everyone with weird noises- basically non-sense and he does it CONSTANTLY. If he asked what the temperature is, and you tell him, he HAS to confirm for himself and read aloud the temperature as though you didn't say anything. Sometimes he repeats this multiple times.  Constantly complains, insists every restaurant to be his pick or he will whine and complain, sometimes refusing to eat.  
He is rude to my dogs and constantly calls my mixed bread a vira lata and makes disgusted faces at him (we are in brasil, this is português for basically garbage puppy/trash tipper).  
He eats with his mouth open and spits in everyone's food because he gets so excited when he is eating he spit talks. He is unbelievable rude to waiters and people in stores (snaps and dog whistles at people). Starts fights with everyone about nothing. Farts and burps everywhere and constantly. Talks horribly about my mother in-law in front of her.  -- oh and has no relationship with his only daughter because he was so possessive of his grand daughter that it caused a massive family rift-- his daughter is an excellent mother and a lawyer with a great constitution. To top it (if your still reading) Was extremely abusive to my husband and his sister growing up. Obviously from what you read, continues to be verbally abusive to everyone.

My mother in law is a gem tho.

QUESTION: i cannot stand my mil

for context my MIL kicked my FIL out of the house (rightfully so he’s a pos) but she had no plan whatsoever to care for her two children who still live at home. My husband has two sisters 9 and 4 years old. Their mother has always been a stay at home mom, nothing wrong with that. But now that their dad is gone he only pays for the mortgage and the bills on the house and gives her $500 a month. But she refuses to get a job and work to provide for her children. And always ends up guilting my husband and his younger brother who’s 22 and has a daughter of his own, to pay for things for her children. I’d be more happy to help out if she was actively working and trying to pay for things but she doesn’t she sits at home doing nothing. She barely takes care of her kids they’re both addicted to their tablets. And I just genuinely HATE going to her house to visit and I don’t want to help her anymore. I just feel bad for the kids because they don’t deserve this. And that’s the main reason my husband always gives in to help. Like it’s gotten so bad that i literally want to move across the country to get away from her cause i feel like it’s the only way she’ll leave us alone.

ANSWER: That is the elephant in the room. Unless you and your husband sit down and explore boundaries with his mom, your marriage foundation will start to rot. Down the road a financial stress will come when you start to expand your family with kids. Money only stretches so far.  His mom will get addicted to the financial help you are providing.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Are my FMIL and FSIL jealous of me and my family?

Have been with my boyfriend for 5 years, and soon to get married in 3 years (getting our house keys in 3 years). I’m 26 while my bf is 28 and we both work full time.

For cultural context, we are all Singaporean Chinese. My ILs grew up lower-middle class and they current stay in public housing apartments. My FMIL was previously a SAHM but is now currently working full time while my FFIL ran a failed business previously and is now a Grab driver. As for my family, my dad got a pay bump when I was 11 and we were able to move into a private condo, and my mum works too although her pay is about national median pay. We are able to afford yearly trips and I recognise that this is a huge privilege and am very thankful for this. My parents have not given me any allowance since Uni, and I give them a small amount every month now as a form of gratitude. I also got a full-ride Uni scholarship based on my grades that came with an allowance, so was able to save up quite a bit from that. My bf on the other hand gives a rather large sum as allowance to his parents. My ILs are aware that my family and I stay in a condo too.

I somehow keep having this feeling that my FMIL and FSIL are jealous of me and my family because of my family background. This is because of the comments below:

- FMIL has made passive aggressive comments about how I probably don’t do chores at home because of my long nails (insinuating that we either have a helper to do chores for us which we don’t and never had, or that my mum does everything for me which is also untrue.)
- FMIL watched me iron clothes and said that I probably don’t iron clothes at home (same insinuation as above).
- When I told my FSIL that I was going on an overseas trip with my mum, her response was “Wow, you’re travelling again?”. When I told her this, the last trip I took was a short one to Bali with my friends a few months earlier. On the other hand, my FSIL goes Bangkok every other month.
- Whenever my bf tells them about our trips (Vietnam, Thailand etc) or the things we bought (eg. tailored clothes in Hoi An), my FMIL’s response is always “Wow, too much money to spend isit?”

Perhaps this is me and my resentment against my FMIL who happens to be an extremely traditional Teochew woman, but it seems like she looks down on me for my spending habits, for being able to afford trips with my bf, for my family being able to sponsor trips for me. 

TLDR: vibes are off with my FMIL and FSIL, would like to see if I’m overthinking this

ANSWER: Chances are that yes, they are jealous. They've certainly given clear hints that they are with their passive-aggressive comments. Perhaps you and BF should info diet them and lessen what they hear about your personal activities. Not because it will make them feel better, but because it's none of their business anyway. You shouldn't be judged for having a different living background from theirs. They are being ridiculous and unfair.

QUESTION: advice re FIL and toddler

My FIL has always given me the creeps, taking my hand without warning to massage it, coming up and rubbing my shoulders, giving my husband foot massages… He told me while I was pregnant that he thought my pregnancy was not my mine but the community’s. Since my son was born, he has refused to follow any of my requests. For example, they met before my son was 2 months old, he refused to wash his hands, then kept putting his fingers into my son’s mouth after I told him not to. Needless to say, he gave my son COVID that week. He also used to hover next to me during diaper changes and that always made me uncomfortable. Now my son is 2 and my FIL still likes putting his fingers into my son’s mouth. My FIL will lick his fingers first and then try to feed my son. He also disregards my son’s food allergies and laughs about it. At playgrounds, my FIL goes up to random children and cheers them on, clapping for them, trying to help them get up the steps or use the monkeybars. In pools, he does the same thing and is always trying to pat children’s backs/butts or touch them in some way. I find all of this creepy but am I overreacting? A few people have suggested that this type of behavior was just more acceptable in my FIL’s generation (he’s in his 70s) and also perhaps because he thinks of himself as everyone’s Sunday school teacher, but I don’t know anyone else who behaves in this way. How can I confront him about this since he doesn’t seem to pick up any normal social cues? My husband acknowledges all these odd behaviors but is adverse to confrontation… he was taught never to disagree with anything growing up, so I feel like nothing is going to change unless I do something

ANSWER: Gross. My mom is in her 70s and not once has she put her fingers in my kids mouths. Not generational, just gross

QUESTION: In Laws Want to Move Near Us

I’m completely panicking. To give some background my husband is an only child. I find his mother to be overbearing and can be quite strategic/manipulative to get what she wants and my husband doesn’t see that. She has broken boundaries or engaged in manipulative tactics in the past. 

I am 6mos pregnant with our first child. When I first got pregnant they really overwhelmed me saying things like “you’re going to move away and we won’t see the baby” (I’m from another country and they assume we will move back there). Other  weird/pushy comments were made that had me feeling really uncomfortable the last time we saw them. 

They came to visit this weekend and said they plan to move to our city but “not for a couple of years and we’re not moving to be near you because we don’t know what your life plans are. We need to move for the weather”. But it’s ALL they talked about all weekend. When we dropped them off they said “well there will be less of you dropping us off at the airport soon”. I think I’m going to give birth and they’re going to want to move immediately. I am so beyond panicked. My MIL does not understand boundaries and I’m already envisioning her rocking up to my house unannounced for time with the baby. 

Has anyone else encountered this? I wish my husband could tell them not to move here. This is my nightmare. I’m fine w seeing them for 3-4 days every 3 months. Not seeing them every week.

ANSWER: she's priming you for the future with her comments and telling you exactly what she's going to do and the second you have the baby all this will be 10x worse. your husband needs to start responding to every comment like this with boundaries . she's taking your silence as you being complicit with her plans

================================================================================

QUESTION: Secret phone call from MIL asking for 35k....

Not for her but for a BIL who currently is not in good graces with us after he messaged us saying after a family get together and he did not want to be around our ASD son....

A couple weeks ago she called my husband and I. 
He picked up the phone first, spoke with her briefly, he laughed at her and said "no absolutely not, I gotta go bye" and that was the end of it. 
When he said what the call was about, my idiot ass called her back on my own immediately because her asking for that kind of money sounded REALLY off and not like her at all. 
I just HAD to know what was going on and if everything was ok. 

Turns out this money was for my BIL who has always been somewhat spoiled anyway by them. He is the youngest of theall the kids, doesn't have a.famoly.of his own yet, and is just now at the age of 30 suddenly engaged and buying a house with his significant other. 
She told me that he did not have enough money for closing costs on this house the two of them are purchasing near the beach (because she just HAS to live in a rich area near the beach) and needed help making up for the rest of the money. 
Her family is extremely well off from what I've been told so far and already gave them 100k for this property so asking them for more was not an option. 

I asked her why have we not met this to be SIL yet? They been together for a year, are already engaged and about to close on a house but none of us (besides her and his father) have met her. 

My inlaws HAVE money. They don't need to ask us for any and especially not call us and ask on BILs behalf. 
She then tells me that we haven't met yet because my BIL is embarrassed of us because our house isn't "nice and clean" and where she lives in the rich around of town she's used to houses being really nice. 

So apparently now BIL is embarrassed of us but not our money according to her....
But since my husband and him are not exactly on speaking terms after he told us both that he didn't want to be around our now 14 year old son "until his behavior changes" then why would we help pay for a house we most likely won't even get invited to....

MIL quickly realized the call wasn't going well and asked that we not tell anyone that she even called. 

I'm very confused, this is very unlike her, BIL is moving things along with his fiancee very quickly and purchasing a property less than a year into even being together, planning a wedding, and none of the inlaws to be have even met her yet, then we have MIL calling us asking for a large sum of money... 

Ive been feeling a mix of insulted, hurt, disrespected, and excluded all at the same time. 

Of course BIL is an adult and he can do what he wants but I don't understand why if he needed that kind of money he couldn't just call us himself. 
This isn't like MIL at all. I think she might be trying to impress her soon to be DILs family because she knows they are extremely wealthy. 
 

Any advice from an outside POV would be appreciated. I have two children with ASD, one more high functioning than the other. One completely nonverbal.

ANSWER: If he can’t afford the closing costs then how can he afford to buy it?  He might not be able to afford his gf’s tastes. 
Don’t expect to be paid back. If you give, it is a gift.

My husband (30M) and i (30F) got married during the covid pandemic in 2020. 
My husband's family( mom/dad /sister (31F) /brother (21m)  were from another town and came down for the wedding. The issue was that after the wedding-starting from the 2nd night-they decided that they didnt want to stay at a hotel to save money-and they stayed with us in our ONE BEDROOM /ONE TOILET apartment.It was a tiny apartment. No windows/ no balcony. Just a livingroom/kitchen and a bedroom with attached toilet.My husband tried to talk them out of it (he offered to pay) but they refused.
We had to keep our bedroom door open so that they could use the bathroom.
I woke up one night with my clothes in disarray due to sleep, to find my father in law staring at me in the dark. He didnt say or do anything but just went into the toilet when he saw that i was awake.
To make matters worse-they used all the new appliances that my husband and i bought(iron/washing machine) for the first time without my permission. It really sucked that we had waited till marriage for sex. And out first time was with his whole family talking in the living room.Not at all the way i had planned it out.
Its been 5 years since then. I have kept my distance from them( moved abroad for studies).but once in a while that anger flares up inside me.That they ruined an experience that should have been amazing.
My husband and i are planning to have children soon. And i wonder if they are going to pull similar stunts during my pregancy journey as well.

ANSWER: "No" was all the explanation your husband needed. Their refusal to get a hotel does not create an obligation for you to host them.

If your husband doesn't learn how to enforce boundaries, that experience will be repeated again and again until one of you learns to say no and actually mean it.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I dread my in laws spending time with our children.

My (32 M) husband and I (26F) live with in-laws whole our house is getting finished for next year. 

We appreciate our in laws socub for letting us stay here but there just one thing....

They WALK ALL over us and our children. 

No boundaries respected what so ever, so much so to where we are debating on moving into an extended stay hotel until our house is finished. 

This has been going on for a while. 

Our 2yro daughters feelings aren't respected; my FIL will hold her and kiss all over her even though she doesn't want it and he says " it's okay she likes it she's just shy" or " I'm just playing." 

My MIL would defend my FIL so swiftly and today they tried to use me against my husband while he defended our 2yro daughter from getting affection she didn't want while crying to be let go from my FIL. 


We are just so drained from having to walk on egg shells and our boundaries stomped all over. 

Anytime we go and have space from them our FIL write a note:
" Guess we won't see our grandchildren until we die." 


Should we move out early? 

What should we do?

ANSWER: You need to get out of there. If you can afford the hotel, leave. Not only are they disrespecting you as parents, fil is abusing your daughter with full approval. That wouldn't be allowed if he was anyone else, and it sets her up for molestation. I think it's really creepy. At this point, I wouldn't worry about how they react. It's all their own fault

QUESTION: I can only dream of inlaws like this

This comment on someone's Facebook reel brought tears to my eyes. The reel was a new grandma explaining how she (graciously) responded when her son-in-law gave her some gentle feedback that she had overstepped. 
I could only dream of having inlaws as communicative, emotionally mature, and thoughtful as these original poster and this commenter. My inlaws cannot tolerate any direct discussion and take boundaries as personal insults. When my first was born during COVID, I'll never forget my MIL scoffing at our request for masking and handwashing and saying she wasn't going to wear a mask during pictures and it wasn't fair she didn't get the newborn scent because of the mask. This is a minor example but hurts so much remembering how emotionally vulnerable I was then! I wish they cared about supporting us and connecting instead of just pushing for the most access to my kids possible (and then sitting on their phones half the time they are with us).

ANSWER: Oh to have understanding and emotional intelligence MIL

================================================================================

QUESTION: What finally pushed you to go No-Contact with your In-Laws?

Hey I m from South Asia. I m newly engaged to my love. I didn’t start on the right foot with my in laws. I come from a very relaxed background. My parents are just be and let others be kind of people. They don’t take things very seriously. Not my in laws. Especially MIL. She has been angry at me for several reasons even before she actually met me. And made me even cry the first time we met. 

I have ADHD and high sense of justice. I have struggled to have friendships because of this (never really regretted it). I don’t like to keep people in my life who are negative jealous egoistic not genuine especially un empathetic. I don’t even tolerate them. Anything I feel shows in my face. People and my parents always tell me ,you don’t know how to act. It’s a boon and a bane. Now with my in laws, it’s extremely difficult to put up a face. I m trying though. I will try for my fiancé. To live a peaceful life with him. 

The question is, for me some things hurt me so much which probably may not hurt other people. Even though my hurt is real, I want to know what normal people tolerate with their in laws. And up to what level to gauge my sensitivity. I want to be true to myself but also adjust a bit so I can also live peacefully. Because this shit and drama is occupying my brain a lot which I absolutely hate. I want to let it go. So please tell me at what point did you feel the need to go to No Contact.

ANSWER: I was tired of always leaving every visit in tears, feeling like I had to sacrifice my own wellbeing and constantly feeling disrespected. My partner had multiple sit down conversations about how I felt and constantly set new boundaries but nothing helped. So I decided to just drop the rope and go no contact. No relationship is worth it if you're constantly sacrificing your own mental health and wellbeing.

QUESTION: Should I care if in laws don’t like me?

I have a great relationship with my husband and after 10+ years of living together we are still in love like day one. My only problem or fixation is his family. I cannot wrap my head around the fact that I am not accepted by my in-laws. 
It keeps coming to me every now and then and I keep asking why am I not loved especially I have a brother in law who is also married 2 years ago and it always feels like I am being compared to her in every level. Plus they have done all the things to discriminate between two daughter in-laws.  
I will be visiting them soon after a few years for 2 weeks and it wrecked my mental health even the idea of being around them. I really feel heart broken and cannot move on. Any help?

ANSWER: I think you should share your feelings to him. His support will make things thousand times better. I promise you. Him acknowledging that you are putting effort and accepting your feelings would mean a lot to you. Which he should have probably already done. 

I got engaged recently. I cared if they liked me on the first few days , but I understood now whatever I do, they aren’t going to like me. So I don’t care anymore as long as my fiancé is on my side for support.

QUESTION: In laws

So my in laws are from Fiji, they’re indian. They’re not very sanitary bc they didnt grow up like that. I guess nobody told them to wash their hands before cooking for people or cover your mouth if you cough or sneeze lol 
I gave birth about 2.5mo ago and they wanna hold my baby everyday. But i get really disgusted giving him to them bc they do not wash their hands and if they do, its not with soap, only with water lol they even don’t wash their hands after they use the bathroom. Yup, believe it. Disgusting. 
When my husband was a kid, he and his sister got really really sick but thats bc one they dont vaccinate their kids in the islands and two well im sure they weren’t very sanitary either. 
It really bothers me and irks me but im too afraid to tell them to go wash their hands bc i feel like they’ll get butthurt. 
My mother in law once said, we don’t wash our hands before cooking bc we are from the islands and thats not how we were brought up… like okay????? I’m at a loss. 
Even when they’re sick, they dont bother covering their mouth as they cough or sneeze. My mom is a nurse and washing my hands before and after everything i do is embedded into my brain. So me being a clean freak while they’re dirty just doesn’t work out. They also don’t brush their teeth twice a day, only once in the morning. Then they question why their teeth are bad or why my father in law has to get dentures bc his teeth are rotten.

================================================================================

QUESTION: WITAH if I'm not willing to stay with my BIL after my in laws passed on?

My husband(35) has brother(34) with ASD and they have a really close relationship. To the extend that they will interlock hands and walk in public.

While he is high functioning, his parents way of love is to do everything for him, chores such as buying dinner for him, washing dishes and clothes etc. I understand each parents has their way of loving their children, but I find this an issue because his parents are not going to be around forever, and so he should learn how to be independent.

I've mentioned this to my husband before and have seen some improvement over the past few years. Like he learns how to do more things on his own. My husband has mentioned that when the time comes, his brother will then learn how to step up accordingly and adapt to the change. He is also confident that his bro will do fine on his own.

However, looking at how things are, I'm truly not confident that his brother will be able to managed on his own. I'm ok with my husband checking in on his brother and visiting him like once a week, but WIBTH if I refuse to live together with his brother in the future?

ANSWER: Info: what are the things that your BIL CAN do? Does he have an official diagnosis? Do you think BIL actually WANTS to be independent, or does he prefer to be pampered? 

If I were you, I'd contact a patient association and ask for advice. Maybe become a member. I myself have a daughter with autism and the autism association here in Sweden has tons of information on learning to live independently and assisted living. 

Furthermore, you are def NOT the AH for not wanting to take in BIL. It's not your hub's job, either. His parents should see to it that the proper arrangements are in place when they're gone.

As I said, my daughter has autism. Severe autism, in fact, and a learning disability as well. We have a son, too, and my husband and I would NEVER ask of him to take care of his sister. He gets to live his own life.

Hugs

QUESTION: I became standoffish

I am with my wife for 11 years. At the start I felt like I did not belong with them. They expected a practical handyman, a more farmer-type kinda guy. I am not that guy. Over the years altough I felt 2nd best, the feeling of acceptance grew and grew. To a point where I disrecarded these initial memories. We were in a good spot.

A couple of months ago, FIL and I had a heated exchange. And since that time I became standoffish I feel as if I am inadequate to them, all these initial memories have come flooding back, that they disapprove of me and generally do not know how to handle myself. It might be in my head, but you can tell by my body language that something has changed.

I want a positive change esp. for my wife and son. Anyone that can talk how they navigated this? It is making me feel depressed as I lay in bed for hours before a family gettogether.

ANSWER: You have a wife problem. She should have stopped this immediately. There is no reason for these people to be in your life or in your children’s lives if they don’t respect you. Only God knows what kinds of things they may be saying behind your back, among themselves, or to your child. She should be much more firm and say that if they are not willing to respect you, there is no place for them at all. You must be a united front.

QUESTION: Kinda aita for Christmas

Lot of nuance for this. Last October my spouse and I spent two weeks in Germany with my in-laws. So this made work decline all future time off requests for the rest of 2024, including holidays, but my hubs went back home for Christmas and I used my one day off to spend it with my sister (from another state) and kids and her in-laws.
The past year has been the worst year of my life, myriad of losses and hospital visits etc. I want to just get away from where I live and have a vacation to somewhere nice and warm. Enter Christmas debate. 
My family all lives apart and doesn’t gather for thanksgiving so we’re planning on Christmas at my sisters in AZ. Sounds like a win to me, plus Christmas for me is more for the kids so spending with my nieces just makes sense over my hubs (he’s an only child and we’re childless) family so it’s literally us two and MIL&FIL. Didn’t think much of the decision. But my in-laws are in town and my MIL said how heart broken she was that I wasn’t with them for Christmas last year and will be this year but that “she understands”. 
We see my in-laws like 4-5x a year and my family 1-2x a year..
Do I owe it to the in-laws to have Christmas with them?

ANSWER: Nope you don't owe it to them; if she doesn't (want to) understand then MIL's the AH. She gets to see you often enough and should understand you wanting to spend x-mas with your own family, especially after having had such a difficult year. So sorry for your losses, hugs 🌹

QUESTION: Naming issue now i m 8th month !

My husband wants to name our child according to his mothers will , where his mother choose the name (raihanna) name of the MILs daughter who was dead while born and also include (moosa) his fathers instead of my husbands name ☹️ i m not okay with this and he try to fight me while i say no to it what shall i do?

ANSWER: I have never heard of a will that could force a parent on what to name their child. I'm pretty sure that won't hold up in ANY court of law. If I were you, I would not allow him in the hospital when it's time to give birth, OR put his name on the birth certificate. YOU name your child what you want. Make him take you to court to get his name added to the birth certificate. I can pretty much guarantee a judge will laugh him out of the courtroom when he tries to claim his mother gave a name to an unborn (and unknown of) child in her will, regardless of what the birth mother might want to name the child. He will have to pay child support, though.

Best of luck, he sounds unhinged.

Edit: I didn't realize there is a language barrier. As another person commented, maybe think of alternative names and suggest those. You're not trying to be disrespectful, you just also need to be on board with the name. This is also your child, and you have input in their name.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My inlaws are upset about my husband not calling them more often

The title says it all. They want to see him and talk to him more (I think they also want the same things from ME but they are afraid to talk about this expectation) but they never initiate phone calls or gather-ups. They also always complain subtly about how he never calls, causing him not wanting to call and this creates a vicious cycle. We invited them for a wednesday night dinner and I think they might bring this matter up. If they do, I wanna say things like “phones work both ways, we work and we are busy but you are not so you can make the effort too” and stuff like that but I’m afraid to put my husband into a worse situation, because when I make my point I can be harsh or mean sometimes due to the anger. Should I still do that, or should I let my husband handle this? He kind of freezes in such situations probably due to childhood trauma or something. My husband also thinks he has to call more but he stresses out when he is going to call because theya are never satisfied with his effort and complain. He calls them more for two months, great! He neglects them a bit one month, they immediately start complaining.

So, what should I do? Do you have similar experiences with your inlaws? How do you cope with this?

ANSWER: I’d let your husband take the lead but back him up calmly if needed. Setting gentle boundaries helps more than reacting in anger.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My in laws enable their awful child.

This will all be very summarized. My husband has a brother the same age as our daughter, six. (Also important to know his family has a big history of very serious trauma and sweeping things under the rug.)He’s had multiple issues with aggression in the past and I’ve always been very leery of him around my daughter. Today I noticed he kept trying to watch her go to the bathroom. I stood outside of the door and while doing so my SIL tells me he locked her son in a bathroom recently and keeps trying to watch when she changed her daughter’s diaper. Naturally already not trusting him this had me on high alert. Sure enough I heard him say “let’s do a secret” and lead my daughter away from everyone to a corner on the side of the house. I then saw him stick her in the corner and tell her to kiss him. I naturally lost it but here’s my issue. My in laws rationalization. They said “they do what they see on tv” but my daughter watches bluey and there’s no secret kissing on there. I’m really uncomfortable as I feel my opinion was dismissed and now I look like the crazy wife overreacting to kids. I just know this isn’t right and this isn’t the first thing he’s done that was suspicious. My daughter has had the safe body talks and read the books but she tells us that he just makes her do things and given he’s hurt her before I’m sure this makes her uncomfy. I really don’t know how to move forward. In an ideal world they’d never play but obviously that’s not an option here.

ANSWER: I really hope it isn’t the case, but a lot of the time when children act the way he is acting, it’s because someone is doing the same things to him. He may need some therapy. 

Your in-laws make me sick. 

Screw what they think of you. Trust your instincts. Keep your daughter safe!

QUESTION: You, Your Husband, and His Mother

I have been part of the reddit in-law boards for a few months and the stories sound so similar to those I've heard in my therapy room over the past near 20 years of working with couples. As a psychologist and couples therapist, I was frustrated with NO resource being available for DILs. The tensions between MIL-DIL. Husbands not knowing how to stand up for their chosen families. The implicit sexism from MILs. The changes in how we show up today as parents and women. 

And seeing couple after couple struggle.

Which is why I wrote my new book, and it is now available! 

The early reviews are positive and people are finding my 5 step VAULT method helpful! Plus, learning the "type" of MIL you have will help you better respond to her (and/or your FIL) at the next holiday event.

ANSWER: I will order your book. Please tell me, which kind of MIL do I have? I have one who talks down to me like I'm stupid, tries to put me in my place in front of the rest of the family / exert dominance over me, and has tried at times to "reparent me" throughout our relationship. She was abusive to my husband when he was a child and she has been emotionally abusive to me, mostly when others are around but sometimes in private. 

She can also be very kind at times. When she's feeling better about herself and she's in a better mood. It's hard to predict that.

QUESTION: My in laws are depressing me

For context, my husband is the youngest of 14, so he’s also the same age as a lot of his nephews/nieces. My husband and I got married at age 27 in 2024. His family has always been “a lot” because there are so many and I’m quite shy. I felt many of them were very friendly when my husband and I first got together but slowly it seems as though they’ve stopped liking me. We go to almost all the family events, I try and make conversation and have a good time but it doesn’t help. There’s almost always hidden drama. We had a baby in June and most of the time they make comments about only wanting to see the baby and not us, it doesn’t seem like a joke but we try and laugh. We just had a family event and my husbands brother and his wife hugged my husband but snubbed me when I went to hug them. It’s just little stuff like this that make us feel so unwelcome and like we don’t want to be there. My husband said he’s always felt this way but since getting married it’s gotten worse. My husband does stick up for me and has decided he wants a break from them, which inevitably, I feel they’ll blame me. This post is all over the place and probably not describing things well but I just need advice on how to cope with this because I’ve never experienced this. Or if anyone has any similar experiences.

ANSWER: Exactly. If they don't want to see you, are unfriendly and your husband sees this, you and baby stop oing he can go and tell them the truth or spare their feelings. Find mom groups or playgroups near you if you don't live near family.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Someone please tell me how to stop feeling this way.

For context I’m white European and my in laws are South Asian. We both live in Canada but everyone immigrated. (They arrived 25 years ago and me 15.)

I have always had a harder relationship with my in laws. The factor my husband brought home someone who’s not the same race and culture as them has always been an issue. Even on our wedding day my father in law told my husband white women only marry brown men and get divorced and take everything. (Where he gets this from, no one knows but he’s convinced it’s a stat) He also told him I’m incapable of making him happy because I’m not from where they are from. Just to understand for context. To make matters harder, myself as a human, I’m outspoken, and always try to be kind and stand up for what I believe in. Which doesn’t go down well. (My communication is respectful but the issue is the factor I will say I’m not comfortable etc) For my request, I had a baby 6 months ago. Our little one is the light of our lives. He’s the first grandchild on my husband’s side and the 8th on mine. Everyone was excited (outside of my BIL and SIL as they don’t celebrate us. White people are a problem apparently) What I need actual help with is, I constantly feel incredibly disrespected by my in laws and they don’t seem to care about what my hubby or myself feels, especially in terms of our child. It’s their grandchild and somehow that supersedes how we feel. They come to visit once a week, and spend 1-2 hours with the baby. In that time we’ve corrected them with things we’ve asked them not to do, such as kiss the baby on the lips or hands. Common sense stuff. They just ignore what we say and now I legitimately dread them coming over. I don’t want to see them and their time in my home causes me anxiety. They tell me a time and I schedule my day around it and then they always show up when works for them with no notice. (As in say they are coming at 1.30 and turn up at 4pm) I don’t want my little one to not know his grandparents but even talking to them they just freak out on me or ignore me. Even when my husband speaks to them they are combative and keep saying it’s their baby and they can do what they want. I don’t know what to do anymore as I don’t even want to answer the door.

ANSWER: Stop enabling them.

They show up late, don't be home.

Hubby can go visit them alone. You and baby are safe at home.

Hubby needs to shut their shit down and be a husband and father, before he is a son.

QUESTION: MIL called me lazy, and my 4 years old disabled moron.

My son turns 4 in January. He have a speech delay, he is in nursery where he have a SENCO advisor (Special educational needs coordinator), spends two sessions in enhanced provision room, and we are awaiting a speech therapy but the waiting list is long where we are. On top of that we try different ways to engage him in different activities encouraging him to speak. What we are usually told is that he is just very shy to speak, cause he knows many words, and say them, just very quietly. He is making really good progress, even though he is still far behind his peers. Due to that he is still not potty trained (decision we took after trying two times, both making him very conscious and stressed). Otherwise he is well developed, starting to write, draw an actual objects not just scribbling, and he’s getting very good with his social skills. Still have bit trouble with emotion regulating, but nothing too different from other kids. 
So this week a hell opened, and my MIL decided that she is making us appointment, with her own specialist (who isn’t even speaking in English- but her native tongue- while our son is specifically preferring English). She didn’t told us  what kind of specialist it was, didn’t ask us what date we preferred, or even the name of the "specialist". I said I’m not taking my son to some stranger, who I know nothing about. I told her multiple times what kind of help my son is receiving, and that we have made all the arrangements to ensure he is getting the best help he can. In return she called me lazy (cause I’m SAHM, I have a younger daughter to look after too), incapable of raising my son, said he is disabled moron because of me, and that he is already irreversibly pathologically damaged. Added that I’m same as my mother, and that my moms divorce was her karma, for the fact that my stepfather raised me in rather harsh ways, and she didn’t do anything (I don’t hold it against my mom, and I love her deeply, she knows her faults and we got over it long ago). She told me that my mom is a failure, not helping with kids (she literally lives 1k miles away), or financially. When my partner stepped up for me, she told him that he is acting like a dog on a leash, that I’m manipulating him and that he shouldn’t listen to me, cause she knows how to raise kids better. The thing is that she literally don’t, up till 7 he was mostly raise by his nana, then she would leave him to neighbours for 2 weeks, when she was travelling for work, and from 12 up he was staying alone. I told my partner after that I’m no longer going to engage with her, visit her, or stay in the living room if she visits. I told him that he is free to see her, if he wants, same goes for kids. I’m just simply not going to spend time with person, who disrespects me in front of my children. I have suspected she thinks the worst of me for long, we had a bumpy relationship with me not letting her dictate our life many times, but in the end I always just let it go for the sake of my partner. It honestly hurts even more, knowing that she is so double faced, but at least now I know what she talks behind my back. Am I overreacting, and being asshole, or am I valid for going no contact?

ANSWER: Keep her away from your kids. She is verbally abusive.

QUESTION: My MIL's "Gifts" Are Actually Just Her Clutter

Okay, I need to know if I'm being an ungrateful brat or if this is as weird as I think it is.

My mother-in-law, Brenda, is a lovely woman in many ways. She means well, I truly believe that. But she has this... habit. She doesn't give normal gifts. For my birthday this year, she gave me a half-used, very expired bottle of fancy perfume from the back of her cabinet and a decorative plate with a chip in it that she "just didn't have room for anymore."

This isn't a one-off. For our anniversary, she regifted a vase we gave her five years ago. For Christmas, it was a set of mismatched towels that smelled faintly of mothballs. She always presents it with this grand, generous flourish, like she's bestowing upon us the crown jewels.

My husband just shrugs and says, "That's just Mom. She hates throwing things away. Just say thank you and donate it later." And I do! I always smile, say thank you, and then the items go straight to the donation bin (or sometimes the trash, if they're truly unsalvageable).

But it's starting to get to me. It doesn't feel like gift-giving; it feels like she's using our house as a dumping ground for things she feels too guilty to throw out herself. It feels less like generosity and more like... delegated hoarding.

The kicker? Yesterday, she came over for coffee and said, "I don't see the lovely plate I gave you out! Are you saving it for a special occasion?" I had to lie and say it was packed away carefully.

I feel insane. Am I wrong to be a little offended? It's not about the money or wanting expensive things, I'd be thrilled with a heartfelt card or a batch of her cookies. It's the principle. It feels thoughtless, and it's creating this weird cycle of clutter and white lies.

Has anyone else's in-law turned gift-giving into a passive-aggressive decluttering service? What did you do?

ANSWER: Sorry, the plate broke when hubby was washing it.

We couldn't get the smell out of the towels; we used them as rags.

Start being petty and start telling her no thanks for gifts.

================================================================================

QUESTION: “Pass the baby”

Has anyone ever addressed the “pass the baby” issue (if it bothers you! It doesn’t bother some people and that’s great).

I don’t even like going to events because I hate when people want to play pass the baby. I almost always say no especially because in public people likely have touched a lot of things and have washed their hands and it’s harder to control who has my baby if they’re all trying to say “my turn”

If you have addressed this - how did it go? Were people offended? I’ve never called out that they’re trying to treat my baby like a doll but I have just said “no” or given the baby over for a few mins and then asked for the baby back.

Additionally, has anyone addressed the “I haven’t gotten to see the baby in x time” or “so and so loves the baby you should send pictures / visit” or the weird competition that seems to happen with who sees the baby more. How did these conversations go to you?

I’m ready to just tell everyone to stop treating my baby like a fricken toy! But that does sound harsh and I’m sure everyone’s comeback would be that the baby is their family and they want to see the baby / bond / whatever. What’s worked for you?

ANSWER: My son in law literally put the brakes on this sort of thing by announcing that no one kiss the baby and do not hold the baby without washing hands. 
One person gave a surprised “oh?”
When he told me about that reaction I said that anyone who has a problem with that must live under a rock. There’s RSV, influenza, herpes, Covid plus the common cold. New baby does not need that and neither do their parents

QUESTION: Husband constantly goes to his parents

My husband and I live about a mile down the street from his parents. They live in a mansion on 65 acres. That being said he never likes to be at our home especially when he has his son and our daughter. It hurts my feelings because then the kids never want to leave there and hang out at our house plus his mom and dad become extremely involved in our life. I understand it is fun to be in a mansion and riding golf carts on 65 acres. But it really makes me feel like I’m not in charge of my own family when his parents are constantly involved and the kids like it over there better. Is there another way to look at this or would you feel the same way too?

ANSWER: Feel you. It's undermining your role as a parent and your home as the kids' base.

================================================================================

QUESTION: In-laws altered my face in group photo, posted on my MIL’s Facebook account.

Just a rant. Not sure why they hate me. Context: All of them are friends with my husbands ex. My husband and his ex have a grown daughter. He and I have been married for 6 years now. She- the ex wife- decided she didn’t want to be married anymore to my husband. I have absolutely no problem with his ex. They were over before I met him, living apart for over a year and getting divorced. 

Anyway we had a family holiday party at my MIL’s. A young niece set up the camera to take some group family photos. I was asked to be in the photos.  
My MIL is older and although she has Facebook she doesn’t even know how to post a photo. She knows basics like “liking “ a post etc. 
the photo that was posted on MIL’s facebook was posted there by her daughter (SIL). The photos were taken by SiL’s daughter. 

When I saw the photo, I could tell my face was altered. My lips were down turned and my face looked melted slightly and like the worst resting  bitch face you could imagine. I KNOW that I was smiling in the photos . 
It’s just a rant but I just needed to tell someone. I know if I say it to my husband he will say I’m crazy. 
The in-laws are all close with ex and I think they did it because she wasn’t there but I was. That’s just my opinion. I don’t give them any reason to not like me or to do that to me but I feel like they are fake people. They have had the ex over for a holiday when my husband and I were away. We didn’t care as they have a relationship with her.

ANSWER: Oh I’d comment 

MIL why did you alter my face ?  Post the original unedited one please ? The one where I’m smiling?

================================================================================

QUESTION: Going Low-contact with my inlaws and grieving

I've spent years in therapy discussing issues with my in-laws and recently decided to go very low contact, as close to no contact as I can get. I’m going to be gray-rocking them, stop engaging or feeding into anything, and do whatever I can to limit exposure and contact from now on. My therapist has strongly advised this and seems to imply that my progress with depression etc. is contingent on this, although it's obviously my decision, it's now clinically recommended.

I won’t be spending time with these people anymore, I won’t attend their events, and I’m going to let my partner handle all communication with them. I’m grieving not only because I’m lonely and wanted it to work out, but because I know this will affect our children’s relationship with them. It’s already impacted their childhood, and that hurts. I’ve done everything I can to help, far beyond what I should have had to give.

 I live in their city without much family support of my own, and it would have been wonderful if things had worked out, but it wasn’t meant to be. I don’t want to go into specifics, but I’ve experienced things that have deeply harmed my mental health, and now it’s time to stop trying and let things fall where they may.

I know this decision will have long-reaching consequences for our sons, and that’s what weighs on me the most. The problems have already touched their lives, and it breaks my heart to think about it. They’re so little, but they already understand more than I wish they did. They talk about how they know I don’t have a good relationship with Daddy’s family, and it’s painful to hear.

I can’t overstate how bad things have been for me personally. I’ve struggled to stand up for myself throughout my life, and this situation has taken a real toll on me, especially on my mental health. I’ve been going to a weekly support group for people from dysfunctional families, just trying to work through what I’ve experienced. Long story short, there’s abuse in this family, some of it going back decades, and no one wants to face it. They prefer to sweep their problems under the rug and pretend everything is fine.

They’re the kind of family that cares a lot about how they look to friends and on social media, but behind closed doors, they’re a mess and treat each other terribly. They’ve treated me the worst of all, mostly because I'm different from them, and I've never fit in or become the version of myself they wanted me to be. My partner has never been good at standing up for me with them, but is supportive of me cutting off contact, even if that lasts for years or forever. That’s not how I wanted things to end, but I don’t see another choice. I wanted us all to be a happy family together, and I'm having a tough time accepting that's just not going to happen.

I’ve reached the point where I can’t stay in contact with them anymore. My mental health and our marriage can’t take any more strain. At this point, it’s either I step back completely, or my partner and I may not make it as a couple.

People often talk about going low contact or no contact as if it’s an easy, obvious solution, but it isn’t. For me, it feels like giving up. Still, I can’t keep doing all the work for everyone when I’m surrounded by people who clearly need help and aren’t going to get it.

ANSWER: Letting go of all this will be wonderful. Focus on you and your kiddos!

QUESTION: MIL always buys holiday clothing

My daughter is 4 and ever since she was born, my MIL has always bought her holiday outfits and expects her to wear them on the day of the holiday and also for specific events we are seeing her for. Shes already gifted my daughter 2 outfits including one she wants my daughter to wear for when she meets Santa and one she wants her to wear on Christmas Day. 

I know in the grand scheme this sounds trivial but it’s annoying because:
1. I want to buy my daughter clothes to wear for at least some holidays (this bothered me for her “first” holidays but I backed off the last few years), and
2. A lot of the clothes are super impractical/extremely frilly and festive, not something you can rewear beyond the holiday which is so wasteful IMO. 

When my daughter was a baby & young toddler the outfits weren’t a huge deal because we were going through 5-6 outfits a day sometimes so I’d put her in whatever my MIL got, snapped a pic and when she soiled it I would change her. Now that she isn’t as messy, that’s not something I can do. I don’t really know how to approach the conversation because it’s 4 years in and everytime I have mentioned it previously she shuts me down and says grandma gets to spoil the grandkids. Wondering if anyone can relate and what you do?

ANSWER: Dress your daughter how you want, no discussion needed. If MIL complains: 'This is what she's wearing today'. Don't JADE, she's not a third parent.

We did get to meet the baby one time and no offers to visit since that even with us suggesting we would love to. We have checked in and asked for baby updates but hear nothing back. We have even gone as far as stopping by to see if anything was needed, which was met with such disgust that we have never gone back since. Our children don’t know anything of their cousins and we don’t know anything of the babies either. We are much more involved in trying to know their children than they are with ours..it’s just beginning to feel wrong and tiring. 

Should we just stop trying to communicate and stay involved with them? Feels really icky now when we do make efforts and we are not loving being left out of their kids lives for no good reason (as far as we know).

Am I wrong for not wanting to see my in-laws over Christmas??? I saw them last in September. Ever since January, when our wedding planning kicked into high gear, they made my life a living hell. Then when I got married, I moved into the FAMILY house and my life was further made a living hell. We just moved into our own apartment in late September and i have no interest in seeing them for at least a year. I told my husband, and hhe apparently doesn't want to go to Christmas there without me because then theyll think I don't want to see them. I said that's bullshit and that it's better if they think that than if they think I'm preventing my husband from seeing his own family.

I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place and looking for advice.

Me and my husband have been married 2 years. Over the 2 years his parents have been overbearing, disrespectful towards me, and very controlling and judgmental of my decisions and our marriage. It has escalated the past 2 months as they are doing housework on the house we lived in, kicked us out with very little notice and now we are staying with them. 

My husband only sees what I’m doing wrong and thinks they are perfect. He never acknowledges the hurt they have caused me “because they only want the best”. He continues to take their side. 

I will say we had a decent relationship before they started making comments about how I spend my money and the food I eat and more stuff I just don’t want to get into. 

Does anyone have any experience with this situation resolving? I have tried to suggest therapy because I am aware I may not be handling the situation the best either. But he doesn’t seem to want to do that. It seems like they will always come first and I feel stuck and alone.

ANSWER: I'm sorry this is happening, and your husband isn't helping. Unfortunately, it's time for the two-card solution. Present him with the business cards of a divorce attorney and a marriage counselor, and tell him to choose.

QUESTION: What do you think of this poem my MIL sent me?



TO MY SON’S BEAUTIFUL SOULMATE 🤍

It is hard, so hard, to imagine a day where I will not be the moon, the sun and the sky to my little man.
When he is sad, he calls for me. 
When he is scared, it’s me he wants. 
When he feels excited, I am the one he rushes to tell first.

I am the keeper of his secrets, the finder of anything which is lost and the solver of any known problem in his little world.
I am his everything and he is mine.

One day, you will have the pleasure of being his everything.
One day it will be you that he comes to, and that is, of course, the way it should be.

But I wonder if you will ever think of me sometimes, perhaps let me be the first to share some good news with you – or allow me the honour of pulling you both out of some trouble life may throw at you.
I will be waiting, ready and willing.

I will not meddle or fuss or pull you in opposite directions I promise you that, and should you be blessed with children of your own, there will be no one, no one on this earth who will love them more than I.

The bond between a mother and a son is divine, this much is true, but I wish for him the very same bond with you.

And I pray the circle of love goes on and on and on, much further than me.

After all, that is what I brought him up to do.

Love.

 Mom

ANSWER: What's the relationship like otherwise?

Devoid of context, this reads like enmeshment and boundary testing. People who don't meddle don't announce their intent to not meddle. It feels less like a welcome to you and more like a story she's telling herself so it functions as a self-issued permission slip for future meddling.

Judge the poem by her behavior, not the words.

My boyfriend and I just moved in together. We are having a kid as I’m currently 6 months pregnant. His work is about 35 minutes from our apartment and his parents house is next to it. He stops by his parents house every day before coming home. Sometimes he just will go on his day off to hangout. He also purposely makes plans out that way to stop at his parents house everyday. He said he’s happy living on his own, and loves our apartment, but has also started suggesting he spend a night or two there a week due to early work schedule. We already don’t sleep together because I’m pregnant and he snores.

QUESTION: I don’t like my boyfriend’s parents but I love my boyfriend. What do I do?

My bf and I are 25 and have been together since we were 16. The positive experience I had with his family lasted about a year and then it started to go downhill from there. His mom started off our relationship by telling me she wanted him to marry his childhood best friend instead. Then after that it was just normal things that tell you parents don’t like you: not getting to know me, criticizing me, ignoring me when I’d speak in a group. Then for a brief time I lived when then his mom would scream at me when no one was there.  After that, we moved into our last apartment that we stayed at for stayed there for 2 years and they never visited us. The way I was raised, if I’m come into a family I have to be polite and build relationships. I reached out to his mom to help out when his grandmother died (she declined), bought his mom and Mother’s Day gifts, and the family Christmas gifts, came to all holidays they invited me to. I finally gave up when I graduated college and no one in his family ever said anything about it. That’s when I gave up (2022). Now I never talk to them and never go to family events. We’re having a housewarming party tomorrow and the thought of them there makes me want to pull my hair out. 

Before anyone says anything. My boyfriend is understanding of my experiences and doesn’t force a relationship. They often did hurtful things when my boyfriend wasn’t present. He has no idea the extent of the trauma I’ve gone through so it makes it hard for him to agree that I need no contact. In his eyes, this is the personality of his mom and he has familial love to fall back on. All I ever feel like is no one ever wanted me in the family.

ANSWER: So your boyfriend allows his mother to disrespect you? He does not hold his mother accountable for her actions towards you? And you think this is ok. You see a future with his family and him? Next time alone with his mom, keep your phone ready to record and video is she starts saying shit. If he is not willing to defend you with his family that is not a foundation that will support this relationship.

QUESTION: In-laws want to WFH with me

I posted this on another feed but was told I may get more feedback here. Feel free to delete if this breaks any rules. 

I have been fighting a boundary war with my mother-in-law since my child was born. Before my daughter was born my mother-in-law offered to quit her job and be our full time daycare. The pay she wanted was not something we could afford and so we expressed that wouldn't work for us. She responded that it was not about the pay but that she wanted to spend time with our daughter. She was not in a financial place to be able to quit working however. The compromise was that she would babysit one day a week in our home. We offered to pay for the day but she did not want to be paid. 

Well the baby came and I took my twelve weeks of maternity leave. It was magical, exhausting and really such an honor (we had to do fertility treatments to have our daughter so every moment feels extra special). I had some struggles and was diagnosed with postpartum OCD. This was found very quickly and I was able to get on medication that helps me to live a completely normal existence. Once my maternity time was up the baby went to daycare Mon-Thursday and on Friday was cared for in our home by my in-laws. Please note the baby can go to daycare on Fridays but does not so they have the time to spend with their grandchild. 

I am a wfh employee. As all wfh employees know this means that everyone you are related to thinks you have endless free time and can work whenever you want. After all there is no boss to yell at you if you are late right? Well my in laws took this to mean they could show up whenever despite me giving them a specific time. They are consistently 30mins- 1 hour late then want to ask questions and chat when they get here. 

They also quickly decided they needed to do housework while in my home. I originally asked that they not do that and just focus on babysitting. I expressed that cleaning is an activity I enjoy and like to do on the weekend. Specifically I stated that I liked to do my own laundry. They continued to do housework even after this request. Stating it was not trouble at all. They make lots of noise vacuuming, loud music and pots and pans banging. Mother in law loves to cook huge meals using every dish in the kitchen as a "favor to us". 

Well one day I walked down to grab my lunch and found father in law folding my laundry including my underwear and mother in law was cooking while the baby (walking age by the this point) playing on her own. While she was still being supervised I was very annoyed that my boundaries were not being listened to and they were not focusing on the child they were meant to be watching.

When my husband got home I shared my continued woes with him and expressed that I did not think this arrangement was working. By this point I was now seeing a psychologist at least weekly and was not sleeping from the stress of this scenario. He offered to use his leftover paternity leave to stay home on Fridays while they were there to train his parents.

I agreed that if he could get them to act in an acceptable form so I could get work done that was worth a try. I think family is very important and it is never my wish to stand in the way of it. I just need to be able to get work done. 

That solution did seem to help for awhile but as his paternity leave started to dwindle so did my mental state. While things had improved boundaries were still being pushed and I still did not feel comfortable being able to work in the house. Things were quite heated between my husband and I during that time. He argued that I wasn't seeing the value in family time and that it was saving us money ($40/week). I argued that he wasn't valuing my mental health. We went round and round in circles both of us unable to see the others view. 

Finally, dear audience I with the help of my therapist decided that I needed to figure out what I could control in the situation. I could control where I worked. So I found a co-working space in town that costs $100/ month.

Please note that our savings from having in-laws watch our child is $160 a month. My husband and I split daycare costs. That means my share of that would be $80 per month. So essentially I am personally PAYING an extra $20 a month to have to leave my comfortable home office and drive across town. Not ideal but other than this situation my husband and I get along perfectly well. I figured $20 is a fair price to pay to keep the peace in my marriage. 

This arrangement has worked for awhile. For the most part I can work from my office with no trouble. I'm gone by the time they get here and return at the end of my work day. I'd still be slightly annoyed when I would come home to my home rearranged or food I had planned to make already cooked another way. But I would be keeping the peace. And that was worth it. 

However, I only get so many hours of private office space and only have two screens instead of the three I have at home. Usually I can work with this but I've been on a new project that requires both of those things. 

Today I received a text from my mother-in-law asking if she should come over at the normally scheduled time (she never makes it by that time) tomorrow. I texted her back to let her know it wouldn't work out for her to babysit tomorrow (after checking with husband to confirm that was okay). Please note I have done this before when one of us had a doctor's appointment or a day off on a Friday. My therapist has me working on not explaining my actions so I kept it vague of it doesn't work without a specific explanation. 

She proceeded to call me. I answered. We covered a few major points during this call.

1) I expressed that is hard for me to focus on work with my daughter home and I have a lot to get done this week.

2) She can not take my daughter elsewhere to babysit her. While we often drop her off at their house and don't have an issue with her being watched somewhere safe we don't like her out on the road with other people. Because really why does she need to be? There home is much farther away than daycare so driving him there isn't a reasonable solution. 

3) My husband will be gone this weekend and I have other plans. My plans were near her home  so I said if it worked out we would stop over or if it didn't we could all go grab dinner together next week. 

4) We passed recipes back and forth. This is something we do to bond with each other as we both love food. I felt this was good as it seemed to get us both in good spirits. 

I was super happy that I was able to find a way to communicate my need for a calm work environment and figure out how to still have family time. Again what I felt was a good compromise. 

Thirty minutes later I got a text from my husband saying his mom called him devastated. 

In her words she had been banned from watching our daughter ever again and that she wasn't allowed to drive her. She also said that I stated I was too busy to see her over the next week. She expressed to him that I was taking her light (my daughter) away. 

I quite frankly lost my mind. I told my husband that his mother needs to learn to respect boundaries and that all of this is getting out of hand. That I did not say any of those things to her and this is basically a tantrum because she did not get her way.  BUT even if I had why would she try and get him & I to get in a disagreement over it. 

His mother had requested a family meeting to discuss the scenario and there is a strong possibility that I will not be able to remain calm any longer. So before this meeting I need to ask am I the problem?


Update Here & Answers to Questions:

The Family Meeting- I got a lot of comments saying that we should not have a family meeting but I believe there is some relevant history here. My husband and his family have had this tradition of family meetings since he was a small child. They allow anyone to bring up their thoughts uninterrupted and then allow everyone's voice to be heard. My husband is an only child and they do not have any nearby relatives. We are their health care proxy and these meetings have been used to discuss their health. They are not something I would wish to end because they are actually quite a healthy form of communication. They have in fact helped with some boundary setting in other areas of the relationship. 


Extenuating Circumstance-
Another note I got a lot of was that we need to cut off contact and that my husband should support me more on his parents not needing so much time. I think it is helpful to know that his father has a deteriorating disease. While he is doing well and it does not impact his ability to watch our daughter at this point, it does mean that time is now limited. This has been especially hard on my husband who feels he is slowly losing his hero and mentor. It creates a different dynamic to why he puts emphasis on wanting our daughter to spend time with her grandparents. 


Multi- Dimensional Characters-

I fear that there has been some stereotyping of each of us (understandable that a decade of dynamics cannot be represented in a single post). So to ensure I am not misrepresenting anyone I want to give some more context. 

MIL:

My MIL is not an evil Disney character. While she does push boundaries more than she should (obviously) she is not mean spirited. She is honestly someone I look up to in many aspects of life. She is a girl boss that got into leadership in a male heavy career path and helped others to do so. Which I often attribute her pushiness to. 

She also has a big heart and took in many of my husband's friends who had poor home lives. She collected donations for the homeless not for praise but because she thinks it is the right things to do. She is also a woman whose partner and best friend of multiple decades is slowly slipping away from his disease. 

It is also important to note that my husband and I are high school sweethearts. So she did quite literally watch me grow up. She is fond of me and I am fond of her. This is not the typical mother-in-law is jealous of the wife scenario. When she introduced me to people I am her daughter not her daughter in law. 

Husband:

My husband is also a more dimensional character than I was able to capture in the original post. 

While we have our things as everyone does he truly is my very best friend. He's chased an ice cream truck for blocks for me. Hand carved me a ring out of wood. Watches my games shows with me even though he hates him. If that isn't love what is?

It's also important to note that he does care about my mental health and is not the toxic macho male stereotype some have assumed. He brings me chocolate on my bad days, talks through my thoughts with me and even offered to go to therapy sessions and pay for them. 

The dynamic with his family just often puts him between a rock and a hard spot. Some in the comments section seem to believe that he never stands up to his mother. This is not accurate. In fact, the reason they often communicate through me is that they are both a bit too harsh with each other.  They both prefer to talk to me. 

Me:

I too am not quite the door mat this seems to have made me out to be. In many facets of these relationships I do make strong boundaries. 

For example Holidays. I set the boundary that we (husband, daughter & I) are to have time for just our nuclear family. Everyone knows I won't budge on this and accepts it. They also all agree it makes sense begrudgingly of course. 

While I am capable of this it does become difficult when hubby and I are not on the same page. Which is why this scenario has occured.  I will also say that while I can set boundaries their family dynamic is very different from mine.

My family accepts softer boundaries. "I prefer to do my own laundry." Boundary accepted and action stopped 

They require a hard boundary: "You doing my laundry is not acceptable to me."

Despite being together for an extended period of time I still struggle with the hard boundary creation as this isn't something I was raised around. These still feel like I'm being disrespectful. This is an area I need to improve on without a doubt. 

The Office Situation-

I fully understand that this element is not fair to me. Which is why I put my foot down about this week. However, in-laws are not aware of the reason I got my office. They do understand that I have a hard time working while they are here but don't understand the lengths I've gone to or my mental health struggles. In this way I may very well be the asshole. I've been doing soft boundaries and shifting things (doing all the laundry during the week so there isn't any for them to do). Instead of being more direct and allowing them to understand the full picture of the distress this has caused me. 

The Phone Call-

While I'm still not happy that she got off the phone with me and called my husband I don't think it was quite as calculated as some of you are interpreting. I genuinely do think she jumped to the dramatics of what our phone call was about not necessarily an outright lie. More of an extreme misunderstanding. Please note my husband did not automatically believe her and fully listened to my side. He also backed me up that she would not be babysitting this week before we even got the chance to talk.

They did talk about other things on the call. Such as upcoming appointments and another argument that they are in that I am staying out of. You'll be happy to know that was a hard boundary to both of them. "This argument has nothing to do with me and I will not be involved". This is not an option for me with the situation regarding my daughter as I will absolutely be involved and invested in those conversations. 

Next Steps-

I have no desire to go no contact with my in-laws. While this situation has been incredibly stressful I do believe they are good people who mean well. 

I do think I have learned I need to stick up for myself a bit more. I also think my husband and I need to work on being a united front where she is involved. He agrees and we are working on that. 

The family meeting will happen. As I previously stated I do believe that it is a good tradition that will only grow more beneficial over time. I plan to put it all out there so they have the clear picture. They are traveling so it will be a few weeks before the next update.

ANSWER: Put your daughter in daycare on Fridays, this has gone WAY too far.

Hard to break down, but I’ll do my best. 

My little brother recently got engaged to his long term girlfriend. 

I love them together and they’re great, happy for both of them! 

BUT, she is the younger sister of a friend of mine from high school, her and her now husband used to date. 

Her current husband is also best friends with my ex fiancé.

The wedding will be interesting regardless. 

But does this now mean, my ex boyfriend will be my brother in law?

================================================================================

QUESTION: My mother-in-law took my car without asking… now what?

Hey everyone, I need some perspective because I honestly don’t know if I’m overreacting.

My mother-in-law is visiting for a few weeks, which is usually fine, but today I noticed my car was missing. I called her to check, and she said, super casually, “Oh, I needed it for some errands this week, hope that’s okay!” Um… okay? I literally wasn’t asked, and I had plans that involved using the car.

I get that she probably didn’t think it was a big deal, but it just feels like a boundary thing to me. I’ve tried in the past to be polite and let small things slide, but this feels like crossing a line. I’m worried that if I bring it up, it’s going to start a fight or make the visit awkward, but at the same time, I don’t want to just keep letting her assume she can take my stuff.

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? How did you bring up boundaries without making things super tense? I want to handle it calmly, but I also don’t want to feel like my stuff isn’t respected.

Thanks in advance, I really appreciate any advice.

ANSWER: That is incredibly rude. Have your spouse sort it out.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Her words hit harder than she’ll ever know

Last night, my mother-in-law said something that’s been echoing in my head ever since. It still stings — and every time I think about it, I feel the hurt and anger all over again.

She and my husband were talking about something ( I was half listening because I was doing the dishes), she said to him,“You don’t have a family.”  She said it more than once, in this flat, smug tone. Her tone... it almost sound like there was disgust? dissapontment? I don't know but I know it didn't sound like she was playful or joking and hearing it felt like a slap. I was standing right there, yet it was like I didn’t exist.

My husband asked her, “Then who is your family?”  
And she listed: “Me, your dad, Matt…”  
Only at the end, almost reluctantly ... she added my name. I’m sure she only said it because I was standing there.

 I don’t care if she doesn’t see me as family, but the truth is… it wasn’t just about me. It was about how she dismissed us — me and him — the life we’ve built, the love we share, the home we’ve created together. Aren’t we a family, even if it’s just the two of us?

What made it worse was the timing. Lately, I’ve been quietly trying to make peace with the idea of stopping IVF. After years of hope and heartbreak, I’ve been whispering to myself that maybe it’s time to focus on other parts of life — travel, rest, rebuilding joy. I haven’t fully accepted the idea of a childless life, but I’ve been taking small, brave steps toward it. and earlier that day I even had just got enough courage to ask / told my husband, that maybe its time we stop IVF and focus on other things......

So when she said, “You don’t have a family,” it cut right into that soft spot — the one where I’m still learning to accept what might never be, while trying to believe that what we already have is still whole and meaningful. That it’s enough. That it’s all we need to make a family of our own.

We may not have kids, but we are a family. Love makes us one. Effort makes us one. Choosing each other, day after day, makes us one. why can't she see or understand that? or even if she didn't understand that, isn't she smart enough not to say something so rude like that?

Her words hurt so much.

ANSWER: OP I lost count of the evil daggers MIL spewed 1:1. You have to accept MIL is mentally ill and also immature, jealous, bitter and insecure. 
She should be serving as a matriarch of the family, but does not respect herself enough to respect you. She will never step up and do the right thing. Ever. 

In fact, if she is anything like my MIL, she will use any opportunity to be spiteful and mean, since that is who she is. She sees you as a threat. 

Let me guess - your spouse very deliberately married someone polar opposite MIL, right? No mystery there!

QUESTION: In laws family not congratulating or acknowledging birth of our baby?

Hi there,

I am currently few days postpartum from giving birth to our third baby. Please be kind on the comments as we are in the thick of it ❤️

Little back story…

My husband is from a family of four boys. We see his brothers, their wives and children almost weekly and fortnightly for family dinner. We spend a lot of time with them and we do value having support from them as we show up for them in the best ways we could. We also have a family chat we use to keep each other updated and chat regularly.

When we had our second. We announced his arrival on the family chat with few photos of our son. One of the siblings and his wife congratulated us and genuinely excited to meet him. And no one else had said anything to acknowledge or congratulate us on our new addition like a normal person would. We gave them the benefit of the doubt that they must’ve been busy or forgot to reply back to the group message so we waited and waited to hear something in person during our regular family dinners. Well, nothing has been said at the end and left us feeling really unsupported, like family weren’t excited for the new member of the family or cared enough to check in or make a little fuss. Well, two new babies were born few months later within the family and everyone congratulated, comment how beautiful they are and wishing them a great recovery etc. I moved on trying to not let it bother us and steal joy but can’t help to compare.

Fast forward two years, we welcomed our third. And same scenario has happened where the same two siblings and their wives I speak to every few days has said nothing to acknowledge the birth of our third and final baby. It hurts knowing this same thing happened again. To know that this isn’t likely another accident but possibly deliberately not have said anything. This hurts to my husband because its his brothers not showing up to support but also my sister in laws whom i show up in different ways when it comes their milestones and they haven’t been able to be there for us the same way.

What would you do? Would you be honest in how you feel because it’s something you had to bury within you even though it bothers you?

It’s going to be awkward no matter how we word it but wanted to get some insights from other new parents in what you would do.

Thank you for reading ❤️

ANSWER: I am sorry you are feeling this way. It seems like these other family members don’t deserve this much of your attention, specially when they aren’t giving you any. 

I know that they have done this previously and that being postpartum is a roller coaster to say the least, but take their very clear hint and don’t try to engage anymore. And I say this not because of them, but you — you deserve to be surrounded by loving and caring people, so does your new baby. 

Take this time to rest and recover, spend it with your immediate family and whoever truly appreciates you!

================================================================================

QUESTION: My future sister in law might be obsessed with her brother.

I need some advice on my future in-law situation. (Fake Names) 
My boyfriend and I just celebrated our 4 year anniversary (he’s M23, we will call him Dev, I’m F22). We’ve talked about marriage and we’re getting to the time where we want to think about moving out and starting our adult lives and our professional careers. Long story short, we’re in a serious long term relationship. 
As a quick backstory, he didn’t have a great childhood. His parents are immigrants and quite traditional, they have suffered war and don’t speak a lot of English. When he was a kid, his twin sister was diagnosed with cancer and underwent multiple surgeries and treatments. We will call her Aveena. Her illness affected their family a lot and HEAVILY impacted the way they raised the two. Dev suffered abuse from parents and felt guilt all the time. Aveena was given most of the attention due to her illness and still is treated as if she is a child by her parents. 
Today, Dev is outgoing and personable and makes friends easily. Aveena is shy and reserved and does not do much outside the house unless she’s with her mom. 

When Dev and I started dating, his family never really got to know me or made an effort to. I don’t think they considered our relationship to be “serious” and were more reserved with their words. Aveena never really made conversation with me. I thought either she’s just shy or she didn’t want to talk to me. We had some conversation here and there but not the way I would with my sisters. 
Throughout the first year of our relationship, Dev invited Aveena to a lot of the things we would do as a couple including plans we intended as dates— to which I never said no to. A year-ish into our relationship, Dev mentioned a conversation he was told between his mom and Aveena. Aveena told their mom that she felt like I was “stealing” her brother from her. I kind of brushed this off. Since I started paying more into conversations and instances like these, it’s gotten worse. 
I let Dev borrow my iPad at one point and he mentioned that Aveena was using it. After I got it back, out of curiosity I checked the screen time and found that there was ten minutes of usage on iMessage during the time she was using it— which kind of confirms she was looking through my messages? And I’ve since found out she looks at our messages on Dev’s laptop too. 
One time, she got her nails done and said that she got the colour green because Dev said he liked the colour green. 
Another time, Dev included me in plans with their godsisters and she texted him privately and said “I thought you and I were just supposed to be hanging out today”. 
She’s also actually cried at one point when I slept over at their house. And she’s also cried when Dev can’t attend events or hangouts. 
It’s just really weird vibes and I don’t know what to do. DO I do anything? I get along great with his older sister and cousins and even his mom now. It always feels like there’s some sort of envy or jealousy. I can’t confront her or have a conversation because she gets like upset with confrontation and I’m afraid she’ll cry about it. 
I really love Dev. And obviously I want his family to like me but what am I supposed to do if this family / sibling dynamic is so ingrained in them. Will the problem solve itself when we move out and she doesn’t have him to rely on?

ANSWER: Talk to your boyfriend. Not in an accusing way but out of concern and confusion with some of his sister's behavior. Talk  about how you visualize his family's role in your future together. Ask him what he sees . Find a compromise where you both are comfortable. I know it seems scary and probably awkward to bring up but if you can't have an uncomfortable, honest conversation with your partner then you can't have a healthy relationship. - someone who has been happily married for 24 years

================================================================================

QUESTION: How do I approach this??

I got married about a year ago to my husband and we are very happy together. He comes from a broken home with a lot of family drama. Siblings don’t speak and at one point his mother claimed they weren’t hers. (They are) 
She has never apologized to them but he still makes an effort for a relationship with her, calling her and we also go to holidays with her and her husband “Geoff’s” family. 
Me and my husband lived together about six months before getting married- we had to move about a month before getting married and moved to the town his mom and Geoff live in. (Our plan has always been to move back to where I am originally from once I can find a job down there so we can buy a house.) 
Well, ever since we moved here to his mom’s town- the relationship between all of us has declined. 
To start, his mom offered to pay for the U-Haul and then when it came time to it- she said she would have to take out a personal loan to do so. So we ended up paying. (We weren’t mad- nor did we even ask- she was the one who offered) We had gone out to eat a couple times and they split the bill so we can pay our half and they can pay theirs. And we even went on a trip together and Geoff got extremely upset that we didn’t pay our share to him- he never mentioned this to us but his mom did so we payed them as soon as she said something. For my birthday my husband and his mom both chipped in to get me a blanket. And for my husbands birthday his mom said his gift was “shipping on Wednesday” and then backtracked and said she actually never ordered it (she ended up not getting him anything) 
This is the EXACT OPPOSITE of my family. They take us to dinner any time we are in town and always give us some money to pay for gas. My parents aren’t well off- both retired and living on a budget. His mom and Geoff both work- go on cruises, have brand new cars and a brand new RV. Earlier this year, Geoff’s mother got sick and I took her some flowers to the hospital and she later passed away. I try to make an effort for a relationship with them. 

About a month ago my husband’s mom asked him for 2,000$ saying she needed it ASAP because she needs to close a checking account without Geoff knowing and that she would take the money from her 401 k to pay my husband back- since it would take longer to process. My husband said he would give it to her because he didn’t know exactly what was going on behind closed doors- he didn’t want that on his conscious. 
After that, he told me he is done with that relationship and that when we move back closer to my parents that he doesn’t even want to come to see his mom for any holidays, because all his family has ever does is use him. (His dad has a long history of taking money and things that belong to him) 
Well, you guessed it - she didn’t pay him back and probably never will. He still calls her and they have an ok relationship. 
Now that Thanksgiving is coming up he wants to go to his mom’s husbands “Geoff” for Thanksgiving because Geoff’s dad was nice to him when he was growing up and also because Geoff’s dad just lost his wife earlier this year. 
I want to go to my parents because we don’t live near them and that was the deal- holidays there since we aren’t close by. But I understand wanting to show respect so I wouldn’t be upset if we went. 
Tonight he saw that Geoff has unfriended him on Facebook- not exactly sure when that happened, but tonight is when we noticed it. (By the way- his mom and Geoff are VERY active in their church lol) 

I could never imagine this kind of drama and bullshit and disrespect in my own family so- 
This is my question- should we be the bigger person and just show them that we will be here through thick and thin and show them that family is not petty and childish like that? Or just distance ourselves? I am at such a loss….

ANSWER: Why would you let them keep using you? Tell your husband you're going to see your parents for the holidays and he can do what he wants as long as it doesn't cost you money. Don't do anything until they pay you back. Why would you ever allow these people to "borrow" money from you? Stop that now.


You can be supportive of your husband without subjecting yourself to the disrespect of his extended family. Make that clear. You won't tolerate it.


Sorry you're stuck in such a shitty situation but stop this now before it happens again or gets out of hand. If there is a genuine emergency that he wants to help with then verify it and pay directly to whoever requires the funds if you want to. Never give them money again. Seperate your finances from your husband if necessary, don't get used.


Move as soon as you can. Stop paying for shit for them. They are using you guys. Don't allow that.

QUESTION: AITAH for not accommodating all sets of grandparents for Christmas?

 UPDATE  I added an update at the bottom of the post since you all were so helpful with navigating this!! 

This is our first year navigating splitting the holidays since having a child. We have the only grandchild on both sides of our families. 

Christmas is a two day holiday - Christmas Eve & Christmas. My spouse has only those two days off. We have to accommodate my family, as well as his. His parents are split & we usually are put in the position to see them separately. In addition, his dad remarried & his now wife has two sets of her own adult children (no grandchildren).


Our parents obviously already have their own traditions established. We cannot accommodate all previous traditions as they overlap. In addition, his family lives 3 hours away & mine are 1.5 hours away. I have vetoed traveling. It’s winter weather, uncertain road conditions, more traffic than usual, a kid that HATES her car seat, having to pack up everything a one year old might need. Plus, I feel like it may not matter this year but eventually she’ll believe in Santa and I want the traditions of baking Santa’s cookies and leaving them out for him Christmas Eve, with her waking up in her own home to Santa’s presents. 

Anyway, we offered to host his family Christmas Eve, mine Christmas Day. 

His dad & step mom declined as she likes to host Christmas Eve dinner at her house. 

My spouse told them if they can’t come Christmas Eve, we understand but we won’t be hosting a third time to accommodate them. 

I feel like my spouse probably would accommodate hosting a third time if I didn’t have a strong opinion, but honestly, I hate the idea of the holidays being something I have to stress about. Hosting 3 times in 5 days sounds miserable. 

I also feel like we have the golden ticket- the grandchild everyone wants access to. So I feel like it should be on our terms. 

AITAH? 

How do you handle splitting the holidays? 

UPDATE!!!!!

I didn’t realize it was common to invite sets of grandparents the weekend before & after. I was under the assumption everyone was gunning for the two main ‘holiday’ dates so Christmas Eve & Christmas. 

I offered to host my spouses family the Sunday prior to Christmas & he was really pleased with this alternative. He’s running it by his family today. We have discussed it’s either they take Christmas Eve of the Saturday before, we won’t be accommodating both & if neither of those work, it’s a them problem, not an us problem. 😅

ANSWER: You stay home and invite who you want. If they can't or won't make it then that's on them. You are a family now and you're building your own traditions, no one else gets to dictate how you spend your time. 


They can always drop by for an hour or two to gift your child presents, you don't necessarily have to "host". Coffee and cake is adequate.

QUESTION: MIL is 67 years old and single, where do you host the Thanksgiving and Christmas?

I am not from the US so this is not my tradition. I am curious to know what is the norm and what is pushing the line?
A little bit background story my husband‘s older sister is her favorite child, but she is hard to reach and often not responsive with text and phone call. So over the years of marriage, I found her to lay responsibility on my husband other than her daughter because my husband is more responsive. Two years ago when I just gave birth to my child, she asked my husband to host Thanksgiving and he refused because we have a newborn at home,. We ended up celebrating it at her place as usual. This year, We moved to a bigger house and she asked my husband to host the Thanksgiving again. My husband responded I don’t know then she posted to family group chat to ask where and When for Thanksgiving dinner. My husband responded the time that we are available and skillfully skip the where question. And of course, her daughter who is married and have no kids did not respond.

We have two children and living with my mom who has been helping with our childcare, which we are super grateful. MIL‘s personality is more reserved, self-centered and selfish. I always remember when my husband asked her to make pumpkin pie that he likes and she refused and ask him to go buy it from Kroger. And when my mom visited her place for Thanksgiving dinner she purposefully did not save a space for her at the table.

Regarding of all of it, I guess I will be more comfortable to hosting it if she asked her daughter to host another holiday not just us.

Wondering, what are you guys thought and am I overthinking it?

Updates: I feel if we celebrate by ourself without family that will make my hubby sad…. And make him a sandwich. I want him to be happy :(

ANSWER: She wouldn't be invited after not setting a place for your mom.  That's incredibly rude.

We have a small family, and we usually choose to go out to a restaurant for Thanksgiving. If you make reservations today, you may still get a table somewhere.

QUESTION: Culture clash with sister in law

I have stayed in my sister in laws home because we were visiting my husbands home country of Barbados. We are from Canada.  Within an hour of our first visit, find out her common law partner has other women, outside children, and only stays a couple of days a week, so pretty awkward situation.  My husband had no idea.  Ok we just minded our business and stayed in what is a beautiful house in the country side. The next day my husband and I unpacked, she and her adult daughter had to watch each and everything we had brought to family for presents - he has a large extended family.  So gifts I had earmarked for some of her family she said she would keep aside. So not knowing her and trusting her judgement, I allowed that. She also greedily claimed things, some of the gifts we intended for others I don't believe they even recieved them. Her daughter also asked for my own things, such as purses, hats, even though we were very generous in our gift giving (we recieved nothing, even she had visited us in Canada).   The house is comfortable, but what is discomforting is she has to have everything just so, every chair in place, furniture cover smoothed and pillows in proper position after every sit,  constantly sweeping, washing dishes. I left my bed unmade for about an hour, she actually was showing me how to make the bed?  All curtains need to be closed (said she doesn't like people seeing her business, who cares??).  Since there is no a/c and I like fresh air flowing in, I open them up.  Windows need to closed if there is the slightest hint of a dark cloud.  The woman is terrified of rain, we had to spend at least the first few days home bound since she didn't want to take us anywhere in the rain, discouraged us from going anywhere since no one goes out in rain, and woe be if she's caught in a sprinkle its pack up and go (she's terrified of her fake hair being ruined). She constantly was saying I would catch a cold if I get wet in the rain, which is absolutely ridiculous.  She also frowns on my sleeping in, implying I'm lazy, I'm on vacation. If I want to go out anywhere she intentially starts walking super fast, actually telling me to keep up with her, meanwhile is 35 degrees.  But this doesn't apply when were with her friends, who walk like sane people in a leisurely way, but she feels I'm the lazy, fat Canadian who can't keep up with her.  Speaking of fat, I bought a little foldable chair since its festival time and not much places to sit in crowds, she actually says "thats too small for you", implying I'm too fat, at 160.  Thankfully I had scored a little air/bnb for the last week right near the beach a convenient spot to watch the carnival parade (bands) go by. The whole time even before we arrived in Barbados she was trying sabatoge our stay there, saying that area is dangerous a lot of muggings, don't go out after dark, pfft. Barbados is a very safe country, had no fear there. She also insisted that we watch the crop over bands at some urban neighborhood miles away just because thats where she goes every year.  At the last minute I feigned sickness and we didn't go there as we had the best area, right beside a beach, in a shady, breezy uncrowded area.   Had the best week there because she was not around with her drama.  The final day we stayed at her home. She actually asked her brother, that I give her my JBL speaker so she could give it to her common in laws parents?  Who does this?  Yes I was also supremely p\ssed at my husband for most of our vacation because he didnt want to cause any trouble for her as we were staying in her home.  It was a terrible three week vacation, had I known it would turn out that way, I would have never went.  She made me feel very unwelcome and also that I was the lazy fat privileged Canadian white woman (meanwhile I am a Native/Indigenous).  The rest of his family is lovely, kind, and generous, she was selfish, greedy and toxic.

ANSWER: Make it clear to your spouse that you will be staying in a hotel or AirBNB in the the future when in Barbados.  Additionally - do not allow his sister or the niece in your place since they will take everything you have brought for the family as gifts.

QUESTION: Mil that doesn't give after about boundaries

Update: hubs and I have decided to not take kiddo to her house anymore. It's been made clear that it's not a safe space for our child. I'm not going to even give landscaper a chance to ever be around her again. I've been thinking about this ever since it happened and talked it over with so many. I know it's wrong down to my core to allow mil to have access to my kid alone and so we are putting that rule into place. If mil wants to see her, she can come here, meet up somewhere, or I can pick her up, which I'm also skeptical about. As for the narcissistic behavior, thankfully mil doesn't act that way frequently, at least with me. Hubs and I have been together for 12 years next month and she has only been that way with me 3 times now. And yes, 3 times is too many. This has been the only instance around my kid. I talked to hubs about that specifically and he said that he doesn't like it but it's important to show her that some people behave that way and that behavior is not okay. We won't be allowing that to happen again, either. It will be shut down and we will leave, even if that means abandoning her somewhere. She has a phone, she can use it. This is just it. We're not taking it anymore. I know yall thing it should've been a long time ago, which is true. We like to at least allow certain people a chance before we just cut them out. Anyways, idk that I have anything else to say except thank you to everyone who commented. Yall helped me a lot. 🖤



I'm not sure if this topic belongs here. I'm mostly wanting to vent but I'm also at a loss.

My mother in law (64) lives at her brother's house(70's) to help him with keeping up with the house and cooking. He has hired a guy to help keep up with landscaping. For a while now I've had a gut feeling that this guy isn't a safe person for my daughter (7) to be around. He's only had a handful of interactions with her and zi just have a feeling he is not a safe guy. The first time he's had a long interactions, that I'm aware of, with her is when he let her ride next to him on his mower. Now, this gets iffy for me on this story. My mil says that my daughter sat on his lap but the landscaper and my daughter say that she sat next to him. Idk what to believe. For clarity, I'm a stay at home mom and mil is the only person/family we have in the area to watch my daughter when I have appointments. That's usually over the summer or on a weekend when my husband (40) and I go on a date. Landscaper isn't always there but i'm also never told when he is, if we bring kiddo over.

That all being said, here is the problem. Over the summer I told her landscaper is not allowed to touch her, whatsoever. My intuition is telling me something and my intuition has a 97% accuracy rate. It is rarely ever wrong. By now, she has already forgotten my boundary regarding that issue. (Her memory has been extra bad over that last few months.) Sob, on tuesday, my daughter had an appointment immediately after school. We have a dog with bad separation anxiety and I had to take her to mil's, so she can watch my dog. It's never a problem (except when she wants to complain about never seeing kiddo even though she almost never calls to see her grandkid).

Landscaper was there and I didn't know until showing up with kiddo. I wasn't leaving her there; it was a quick visit. Landscaper walks into the house, grabs her shoulder, and kisses the top of kiddos head. I waited a second just to see if mil would say something because I know I've told her in the past. That one second passed and I said, "hey, please don't touch. I don't want you to touch her." He immediately says, "oh, okay. Fine. I didn't know. I'll never touch her again." And then all he'll breaks loose. At first, landscaper just went back outside to work. Cool, fine. I thought he was leaving it at that, which I was okay and felt a little more comfortable with that. Mil starts arguing with me "oh, he just loves her, so much." "He's family, he wouldn't hurt her." So on and so forth with a lot of berating and calling me an awful mom. (She's a narcissist but doesn't often show this side of her, thankfully.) Landscaper went in and out of the house 4 more times, saying how "i'm not a creep... I can't believe you think that... I have 6 daughter's, too, you know" good for you, I guess? I don't care. Something is not right here and all of this bs goes to completely show that I'm right. 

Hubs and ai have already decided that kiddo will not b e going over there without one of us, that's not a problem. Honestly, I'm concerned as to how this will go in the future. If he touches her again, Oklahoma law says there's not much I can do about it unless he's touching her in an inappropriate manner, other than step and tell him again, which I better not have to. Hubs is fine with cutting off his mother, he doesn't like her anyways. She is pretty good with kiddo, and so we've kept her active in our lives. I've had to cut off my parents due to them also not helping in keeping kiddo safe. I don't want to cut mil out because kiddo has already lost 2 of them. Mil's ex is present in our lives but travels a lot and doesn't call for her, and we see him once or twice a year. 

I guess there's a lot I'm asking here, but also not? I'm not sure where to go from here other than staying with kiddo and mil's. What do I do if Landscaper tries to do this again? I'll take my kid and leave but I also want to lay hands. No means no. However, the law says I can only do so much. I'm shocked that mil is on his side even though she's known him for about a year. I don't understand how she can choose Landscaper over kiddo.

And, yes, I'd say most if not all parents agree if you have to go above and beyond to defend yourself in these situations, that's saying something and that something is not good. Normal, good human beings would leave it at "oh, I'm so sorry. I wasn't aware. I apologize if I have offended you. I'll make sure to never do it again." and not say a word about it after that. It's just fishy. This is all fishy. I can't even get his name to look his records up, yet. I'm working on it.

I just don't know what else to think and do.

I apologize for the long post

ANSWER: I stopped reading. Stop exposing your child to unsafe people - your MIL and landscaper. Idk why this is hard to follow through on.

QUESTION: Am I in the wrong?

I have been with my partner for 12 years, lived together for ten and married for two years. We both live away from our home country. My relationship with my in laws is formal and I try to only keep it at a minimum. When I started dating my husband, my mother in law made some insulting comments on me which ticked me off. 
My husband has an elder brother who lives in his home country in a different city with his family (wife and a son). I have also grown to understand that none of my husbands family likes my sister in law.

Earlier this year, my husband lost his father and my mother in law moved in with his brother and his family. My brother in law got detected with cancer and had to go through some procedures as well. My MIL started developing a lot of issues with the sister in law. She had a problem with how she is not obedient, doesn’t care about her or ask her for food etc (even though they have a full time cook). She also bitched about the sister in law over video calls to my husband infront of his nephew. There were comments made about her upbringing and character which I thought were unacceptable. Apparently the sister in law also made some comments against her which she overheard and now wants to come and live with us. 

I have had issues with her controlling and disrespectful behavior as well, to name a few:
- on the funeral day infront of all family she asked me how I liked the country I reside in and when I said I like it, she told me you should have just agreed with me that it’s bad. She also said I will never allow my son to settle there
- while I was having a meal with the nephew, she told him to finish before me as according to her a man has to be ahead of woman
- I have overheard her conversations with my husband forcing me to keep certain fasts which they follow in their tradition (I come from a different culture, plus don’t believe in those traditions)

Given all of this history, I told my husband I wouldn’t be okay with her living at our house for more than two weeks. My husband thinks I am being disrespectful and is also very emotional about this topic. Am I being too strong headed and am I wrong to have such expectations?

ANSWER: I would not let her stay bc sil may slam the door shut and not let her back. Give no quarter

QUESTION: Traveling with your partner and leaving toddler with grandparents

Hi everyone, 

I’m curious about your opinion on this. 

My husband and I have a baby he is currently 14 months. The other day we were talking about taking a trip just the two of us next year. 
I told my husband that if we do I would like to leave our baby to my parents since they have the experience, the patience to take care a baby of this age. 
My in laws are in their 70s they have good health but they have no experience with babies/toddlers. My MIL temper is not the best. I have seen her losing her patience with her husband no matter where we are. Also they both lack of skills when it comes taking care of a baby/toddler I noticed this when they came to visit during my first year postpartum. I’m a little worry they won’t be able to keep up with the demands of my baby. 

My husband was def disappointed to hear this. Deep down I know he understands my points. He said if my parents can’t take care of our son then your parents can’t either not because I don’t trust them but because my parents will feel offended and they will feel that we don’t trust them. His parents are very sensitive people and selfish in a way. 

How would you handle this? What is your opinion? And have you run into similar situations? 

Thanks a lot in advance.

ANSWER: I am 71, in good health and walk 2 miles every other day. 

I love spending time with my great great nieces and nephews and their parents definitely trust me.  Once the baby becomes "mobile" I do not babysit.  There is no way I have the ability to keep up with a toddler or even the energy for a day let alone over night and longer. Once they are older and more self sufficient, they do visit me.

Your husband is missing the point.  This is not about being "fair" this is about what is best for your  child.  Is he saying he would rather a stranger take care of them than someone they know and love?  

Child care is about what is best for child, not the grandparents.

QUESTION: Baby #2

I’ll be delivering our second kid (and the second grandchild) at the end of this year and am already stressed about post partum with my in laws. What are some things you’d discuss with husband / in laws beforehand to make sure we’re all aligned in the postpartum phase. 

A bit of context about postpartum with our first:
- FIL called me vicious and said I was driving a wedge in the family when I didn’t want any hospital visitors
- MIL and FIL continuously ignored our asks to wash hands, not kiss baby
- All visits were so overbearing: overstaying their welcome (4-5 hour visits freshly postpartum), they didn’t help cook or clean up just expected my husband to host them
- ILs ignored me during all the visits. Never asked how I was doing, never acknowledged that I did a great job bringing child into the world, never said a single kind word to me
- A lot of annoying tongue clicking, making high pitched noises, getting in baby’s face
- constant whining that they didn’t get to see baby enough
- taking baby out of my arms without asking, grabbing stroller from me without asking, taking baby out of room when I had clearly asked them not to

Obviously, with all of the above - me and my husband decided to place some distance in between us and his parents. After giving them more than enough chances and trying to give benefit of the doubt as first time grandparents, we see them about once every 2-3 months for a 2 hour visit. They still ignore me during the visits and don’t make any effort to reach out to us between visits (never call, never text, never try to FaceTime -which I’m fine with).

All of a sudden, with 2 months to go - they’re all up in our grill. Texting my husband trying to coordinate visits. I know that they’re going to go back to the same pain in the ass style they were last postpartum,

My husband and I have already talked about how they were a huge cause of my PPA, and how disrespected I felt. He’s fully on board to support whatever boundaries I want to put up. I’d love to not see them the first 3 months - but I also think that’s unrealistic given the holidays (and FIL birthday). I’m thinking I’ll allow one 30-45 minute visit maybe 3 weeks after baby is born to get them off our case - and to let my husband know the first rude remark made, the visit ends instantly. I also will not be accommodating monthly visits, like they wanted the first time around.

Any other advice or suggestions? What has worked for you?

ANSWER: You have to get feral. I find that my mil will ignore my husband when he tells her not to do something the same way he ignores her when she does obnoxious shit. So I became a huge confrontational bitch. And I embraced the fact that even when she was getting what she wanted she still had trash to talk about me to the other family members.


 So now I stopped caring. I'm having another baby and I have a list of rules I'm gonna send her without even asking my husband because I DONT give a fuck. And at the end of the rules I'm letting her know she will be asked to leave or the visit will be over if she defies a single one of these rules or, her favorite, tries to find a loophole. 


She sat in my house for 3.5 hours after I gave birth last year asking over and over to.hold the baby despite me ignoring her requests. She rearranged my kitchen. She asked to bring a complete stranger over to meet my two day old new baby (who was her husband's colleague coming in from 7 states away via airplane) 


This is a person who does not give a F about me. Obviously.  Now I match that energy time a thousand because it makes no difference if I'm nice or mean she acts the same and the result is the same. I tried for ten years. All done 


I'm also gonna tell you, you have to scare your husband more than his momma does. Be a huge psycho if you don't get your way in your house with your child. Make it impossible for him to live with you when he crosses you on behalf of her. Otherwise he will take the path of least resistance and that's taking her side.

QUESTION: Weird mil

So Idk if maybe im thinking too of it or it does really seem weird but yesterday mother in law & i were going to return packages for her husband and we were just talking and she brings up my daughter when she had watched her and she said my daughter (2) called her mommy to ask for something and she said she smiled and said "oh yes im your mommy" like ew who says that when your son is the father to the child? Am I tripping or is she weird for this.

ANSWER: This absolutely MUST be addressed immediately. Her son is the one to tell his nutbag mother to NEVER get her grandparent role in your daughter’s life confused with YOUR role as her mother!

Your daughter does not need the confusion of calling two women mommy. Your MIL needs a stern warning that if you ever hear this again, there will be harsh consequences. Why? Because this is merely your MIL’s starting point to “boundary stomping utopia.” 

I wonder what other weird things she has said and done. I cannot imagine encouraging my grandkids (who I see regularly) to call me their mommy; they have mistakenly called me ‘mommy,’ but I have gently corrected them.

Please keep a close eye on that lady! She wants your child to call her MOMMY. I’m sure this makes your gut twist into knots. Listen to your gut. Put an immediate end to this!

QUESTION: MIL smears me to everyone we know.

I just need to vent because I'm still so hurt by my MIL. She smears me to everyone we know and blames me for not seeing her grandkids. This conversation happened over a year ago but I'm still finding it so hard to cope because I literally don't have anyone to talk to about this. Yes, she laughed about basically turning my parents against me. I shared this somewhere else and the comments made me feel so much worse because they all insinuated that I was at fault,  said that I was the problem or that there was more to the story so it was hard to believe so I've been alone in my hurt for a very long time. This is just one of the many and I mean many things she has done but I get the blame for.  

What prompted this conversation with her was that our dog got out, ventured over to their house and she called my parents because she was "concerned" about our dog but yet the next day after the text she sent (I/we didn't respond because I had her blocked and didn't know she texted/our dog wasn't gone very long) my dad came over knocking on the door, we didn't answer because we were doing something in the back of the house and didn't hear him. I called him once I noticed that I had a missed call from him.  When I called him back, he said that my MIL told him and my mom that she was worried that my husband was beating on my kids and I because  our dog ventured to their house. He said that him and my mom were worried about the kids and I and he came over earlier to check on things but when I didn't answer he figured he'd never come check on us ever again so when I received these texts from her, I felt so alone and not to mention betrayed. 

The betrayal opened my eyes to my own parents abuse throughout the years and in May of 2024, I told my dad when he came over for our daughters birthday that he had his sons and that he didn't need me. He asked me what he ever did to me and I said "you were gossiping with my MIL," he then said "I wasn't." And that's when I said "That's not what MIL said." Yes, the part where she says they said I don't control who they talk to, that sounds like something my dad would say. I didn't realize that it was control, I thought it was respect for me to prevent basically what happened but yeah. 

There is more but I'm already in tears because this is still so hurtful. Though, I will add this as a bonus. She tried to gaslight me into thinking she loves all her grandchildren the same but yet pointed out that my middle child takes more after her side of the family because her skin tone is more like theirs. (they are white, my family and I are Native American) 

Anyways, thanks for reading!

ANSWER: Get into counseling to help you develop coping skills and techniques to manage both sides of the family

QUESTION: AIO/Advice? In Laws....

Hey Reddit. First time poster. 

I wanted to get some advice on a situation regarding my(28F) husband's (31M) parents. His dad and step mom (Mom isn't in the picture) have been a bit difficult since the beginning. He has a complex relationship that I won't go too into, but he has a 8 year old and 15 year old brother from his dad's remarriage and then a 29 year old sister from his dad's first marriage. He lived near his family for 26 years. He and I have had many conversations about his closeness vs mine with our families, as I moved out and across the country at 18 and never have moved back. I am a therapist in a PhD program, he is a chiropractor.

I met my husband back in 2022, but we didn't start dating until 2024. We moved pretty quickly, but we knew from early on we wanted to be together, and that marriage was the logical next step. We got engaged in February 2025, then married the last day of May. My husband had been telling his family for a month or so before he proposed that he was going to do it. He told them he got a ring etc. They were super supportive. They've been nothing but sweet to me. I do love them all very much. The trouble however began after we got engaged and started talking about wedding dates. We already knew we didn't want to do anything big. My preference was to elope then do a party after we moved into a house within a few months. The agreement was we were doing something small so we could afford to put at least 80k down on a house. He, being closer to his family, wanted to at least do something that our parents could be at. This also includes his siblings. I was hesitant but of course agreed as it is the most important day of our lives, especially since we are and will be child free. My parents have been divorced since I was 2, but they get along great. My dad is remarried and my mom has a long term partner. So the idea would be my family of four, then his family of 5. He and I reached out to his step mom and his dad about dates saying we wanted to get married in the Spring. Mind you, we were thinking a court house marriage and then dinner. They said they were going to be busy, but they'd send the dates that would for sure NOT work. We got them a few days later, and we only had about 3 weekends to work with. We were pretty set on not moving out too far into the Summer since AZ is super hot, and my family is from the Northern part of MN and cannot handle heat.

  
We ultimately choose a date. We send it back to them, and they immediately respond that weekend likely wouldn't work because the 9 year old has baseball and the 15 year old may or may not have a track meet to qualify for state (he has never qualified and likely wouldn't due to an injury). My husband and I just stare at each other like....... Okay but you sent us these dates? We can't really go later into the summer? This is where I get upset.

They say we should just get married in OR since that is where they live and it is so nice there. Excuse me? No. I didn't even want to do a "wedding" let alone plan one for another state I don't live in? After talking with his family, my husband, and some of my family, we settle on having more of his family come as they live in the same area of AZ as us. So now it is 16 members of his family and only 4 of mine. I end up inviting my grandpa who is very old and doesn't travel well, but he really wanted to be there. 

Some back and forth later they let us know that they would come, but his two brothers will not due to being busy. My husband is not a very emotional person, but he became teary and upset feeling that he was such a low priority. Since my husband moved away and even before living in the same state but in school, he would go back for every holiday, birthday etc. We went for all the holidays plus an extra weekend last year. I made it clear to my husband that we are now family and that we split time between the two. My family vocalized they felt a bit left out and neglected last year which is totally fair. 

And now on the most important day of our lives, they cannot make it work. My husband and his dad go back and forth. His sister gets involved. It is a whole thing. At the end of it, we have to have a phone call because his parents are now so upset that we think they don't find us a priority. This goes on and on, and a week before the wedding, they let us know they had a fight with his sister (who was advocating for us and stating this whole thing is insane to not have his brother's there), they will be flying the boys out for 24 hours to attend the ceremony (which we did at a local park for free at 8AM to beat the heat). We of course were so happy they could come, but we ultimately were disappointed in how they treated the situation. Finally, when the boys needed to go home, their mom didn't arrange for the unaccompanied minor situation. The boys didn't want to go home because they were having fun, so both kids ended up staying the entire weekend...

AIO for still being upset and not wanting to go out of my way to visit them now too? My husband is also on the same page if not more. But they have made it clear they are upset we are not going to them for the holidays. Mostly, my husband is still really hurt. I have tried to encourage him to chat with his dad, but he doesn't know how to bring it up in a way which his dad will listen. I have offered my help, but as I said before, I am a therapist and he feels I already therapize him enough. I think he wants to do this on his own. What can I do to support him? 

  
\\\I am type this on my phone so surely there is spelling and grammar issues.

\\\A lot happened that I couldn't fit all in here. I can clear anything up if this is confusing to anyone in a reply.

ANSWER: Did you spend last holidays with his family? Then that’s the simple answer. We can’t spend two years in a row with you it’s not fair to OPs family. We will see you in the new year.

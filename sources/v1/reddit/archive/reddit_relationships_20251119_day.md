QUESTION: My fiance (M29) always eats things I leave for myself (F26)/or takes all of the food snacks


My partner and I have been fighting over food lately (or I've been fighting with him). He is always asking if im gonna finish what's on my plate as I'm eating. Or Ill buy snacks and they're all gone before I can have any. Or last week I had wings for lunch and didn't finish them, he just ate them before I got home from work and didn't feel bad at all. 

It's frustrating. I tried to bring it up today and he tells me I must have a problem with food because it's weird that I'm upset about it and I shouldn't be upset about wings from a week ago. But I'm obviously not upset about that specific thing. I feel like for me, its just like he doesn't respect my boundary which is why I'm upset. 

This feels like a stupid thing to fight over but I just can't stand that I food I want goes missing because I didn't tell him directly "don't eat my leftovers" or "hey save me some caramel bites because I'm gonna want some". 

How do I fix this? I don't want to fight with my partner about food. But now he's in our bedroom and told me to leave him alone. Ugh. 


TLDR - Fiance eats food I want to save for later every time or snacks in hoping to eat and told me I have a food problem because I'm upset about it.

ANSWER: It's not a stupid thing to fight over. You were looking forward to your little treats and he took them from you with zero consideration for your feelings. Partners shouldn't do that to one another.

Talk to him and tell him clearly: my leftovers are off limits to you unless I say you can eat it. You can share my snacks but it's rude to eat an entire bag of something I bought for myself and not immediately replace it. If he had a non romantic roommate he wouldn't be eating all their food without asking; it's the same thing here.

QUESTION: Is my (34F) husband’s (35m) terrible spending habits a deal breaker or is this salvageable?

My husband and I have been together 10+ years, married for 6, and recently I gave birth to our 2 month old baby. When I was pregnant I discovered that he accrued credit card debt among other things. His debt and loans amounted to $40k, he also spent $6k on a road bike and a mountain bike, spent unknown thousands on collectable cards (Pokémon, baseball), and had no personal savings. He makes great money ($150k+) so it’s extra shocking that he spent so much money to not have savings and end up with debt. He also hid it all from me because he was trying to fix it on his own without me finding out. In the past he also gambled some unknown amount and has also lost $14k by investing all his savings in one company’s stock. We had many fights about this and he has expressed remorse and that he is turning a new leaf. We cancelled all his credit cards and are gradually paying off the debt. Is this a deal breaker? Or is this relationship salvageable? 

Here are some additional pros and cons for context: 
Pros:
- we generally enjoy spending time together 
- he contributes and is involved with the family and household 
- he is a good father 

Cons: 
- bad with money 
- no physical intimacy 
- no sexual chemistry 

Tldr- my husband is bad with money and hid his debt from me but said he has changed. Is this relationship salvageable or would most people walk?

ANSWER: Apart from the “list” of pro’s and con’s you failed to mention that you clearly have lost respect for him. Add to that the missing intimacy and missing chemistry - your frustration levels are only going to increase while your tolerance levels for putting up with “bad stuff” will only decrease. Once those lines intersect downwards you’ve crossed a threshold. You might already be there given your post. Even if you salvage his spending (and thats a big iff) how can you salvage no chemistry and a lack of intimacy???  This has “doom” written all over it. Ugh.

QUESTION: I (22M) have a very complicated relationship with my (24F) best friend

I've been pretty much best friends with a girl for over 5 years, and there has always been chemistry and tension between us. We tried dating once but she backed out because of her own stated commitment issues and life circumstances. 

I'm the closest thing she's ever had to a boyfriend and the only guy to ever even take her on a date which is crazy because shes very traditionally attractive and could have any guy. 

We hang out 1-on-1 constantly, travel to motor races together, stay in hotels, and have slept in the same bed platonically many times. She tells me I'm very attractive and a great guy, is very flirty with me, we know everything about each other, her friends and family even say we should date, and when anyone has asked her for reasons why she wouldn't, she said she couldn't think of one. 

She even made a marriage pact with me (her idea) and wants to come to my work Christmas party saying we could joke that we aren't "dating" but getting married in 8 years. She once called me while drunk and said I'm the only guy she's ever felt really cared about her and that I might be the only guy she's actually loved. But whenever I talk to or date other girls, she acts like she doesn't care and just says she knows I'll "find someone," which hurts because I want it to be her. 

The worst part is that she completely deflects and shuts down any time I try to have a serious talk about us. We're also core members of our friend group so I'm scared of ruining things - but the limbo is draining me. How would you recommend I approach this?

TL;DR there's clearly romantic tension between me and my best friend but she shuts down whenever I bring it up. How do I approach this?

ANSWER: Well, since she doesn't want to talk about it, it's time to stop flirting and acting like her BF. She doesn't get GF treatment if she doesn't want to be your GF.

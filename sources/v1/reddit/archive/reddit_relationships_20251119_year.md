================================================================================

QUESTION: [UPDATE - 7 years later] For years, my [35F] husband [37M] said that if I want stability in our life, I have to make it happen. I did. And now things are worse than ever. Help?

I was recently cleaning out my bookmarks and [found this old throwaway](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9tdkqa/for_years_my_35f_husband_37m_said_that_if_i_want/), and obviously the two posts I made with it. I'm not sure why now, but I feel compelled to write a followup. Maybe it'll give people the bravery to change or at least an example of how sticking with what you know isn't always the best choice.

An obviously very long story short, with the help of those posts and a lot of long nights of thinking, I left my husband. In fact, it took him going away for a long weekend to realize how much happier and at peace I felt without him around... At first the split was amicable, but looking back I think he was just waiting for me to come rushing back to him once I "realized my mistake." When that didn't happen and he could see I was actually serious about building a new life for myself, a switch flipped. We only spoke when he needed something from me and eventually that stopped too. Enough about him.

I'm now 42, happier and healthier and more satisfied than I've been my whole life. I picked me and that was the best choice I could've ever made. I lived alone for the first time and my god, the peace of having my own space... unrivaled. I ended up staying in that apartment for 5 years, not a moving box in sight. I put art on the walls, I knew my neighbors. I made a home. I grew my career and went back to school. Made friends, built a little community.

I've done a ton of therapy and realized that the abusive patterns my parents created in childhood were just repeating with my ex. I fell in love, a real love, a supportive love that encourages growth and security. I'm doing new work, work that helps people and is so much more than just chasing money. All of those things have created a life that's more rewarding than I ever thought possible for myself.

I've gone through some really shitty times too, illness, cancer scares, deaths, loss... but I have no idea how I would've come out the other side without the community I'd built around me. Even something as simple as people at your local coffee shop recognizing you is a comfort after feeling adrift and alone for so long. Anyway, if I were to respond to myself from 7 years ago, this is what I would say.

>Leave the loser. He doesn't care about you, never did. He only cares about what you can do for him and now that you aren't serving him... well. Just go. You are capable of doing difficult things, and you are worthy of the work it takes to accomplish them. Trust your abilities, trust your gut - it's been screaming at you for years now, honey. Life can be so much more than you've experienced, but you have to make it happen for yourself. 

TL;DR: Left my husband, happier than ever.

EDIT: I'm surprised but happy this found so many people! I genuinely thought I was going to bookend this story and have it disappear into the ether. But whatever urge I had to write it, and whatever brought you to reading it... who knows? Maybe it was meant to. Thank you for all the messages and comments, I feel so grateful to have this perspective and experience.

ANSWER: It's really ridiculous the mount [edit: amount] of women I know who leave marriages and blossom, thrive, are so much happier for it. You don't see that much talked about in the outside world. It's really remarkable.

QUESTION: I am considering leaving my husband over keeping a lock on on of our doors and refusing to open it

Hi everyone. Very sad to be posting this but I F29 am considering separating from my husband M33 of 5 years over a big issue we just had a couple of days ago. My husband has always cared about his things, and he puts all his valuables in his office where he works remotely 3 days a week. He put a lock on the outside of the office door 6 months ago to supposedly keep his things safe from our destructive toddler. I let it go, but found it a bit odd since the key is usually no where to be found.

Anyways, I recently went in the office to get our bird's perch out the room, and he was hovering acting really suspicious. He defensively said what do you need in there? And I said the bird's perch...but then instantly felt he was hiding something from me. I also noticed he locked the door after that. After we put our toddler to sleep, I told him I needed to go in the room to change the sheets on our guest mattress because we have visitors soon. He was acting defensive again and said he would do it another time. That is when I said what are you hiding in there? You are getting really defensive, and its weird that I am locked out of a space in my own home and have to ask permission to enter. He got more defensive until I eventually said you need to unlock the door and let me see what is in there because you are hiding something.

Long story short, he admitted to hiding weed in the room and playing video games when I go to sleep. But he REFUSED to open the door. I told him i'm going to sit by the door until he unlocks it because I think he is hiding something worse since those things aren't that big of a deal. You guys, he literally refused. I tried begging, I tried getting the lock open, I tried everything I could think of. Not only would he not unlock the door, but he was gaslighting me the entire time telling me i'm crazy and it must be my pregnancy hormones thinking there was something else in there? He said that if he opens the door, he would be giving in to my pushiness. He also kept touching my leg and telling me he was sorry i'm going through this like I was making all of this up in my head.

Unfortunately, I got too tired around 2am (keep in mine i'm pregnant having to deal with this) and told him i'm going to sleep and whatever he is hiding in there he can get rid of in the morning, but i'm done. In the morning, the room was perfectly staged with his little weed pen out and switch game. He has changed the lock on the door to a normal one that only locks when someone is in the room, but still seems to see no problem with what he has done. He is still adamant that it is perfectly normal to lock a door from the outside if you have important things in there. He also said there was nothing else in there and he just couldn't for the life of him let me in after I said we needed to go through his stuff. He said that was controlling behavior and giving in would be saying that was okay.

I guess what i'm asking is...is it normal to put a lock on an office door even on the outside? Would a separation by the best next steps? I have a toddler and a baby coming, and really don't want to have to do this alone if I don't need to.

ANSWER: Yeah he was hiding something in there. If you’re lucky it’s something he’s just embarrassed by that he doesn’t want to share. But if it’s not that, I’d guess hard drugs or a porn habit that’s borderline cheating, since apparently he needs somewhere private to indulge. You could try asking him for a drug test to see how he responds.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My boyfriend turned me into a baby and I don’t feel like myself anymore

I (30F) used to be a very independent person. For example, I’ve travelled to over 30 countries all by myself by age 25. I knew how to survive anywhere in the world. My parents were abusive, so I escaped home and lived on my own as soon as I became an adult. I enjoyed living by myself and doing everything by myself.

Then I met my boyfriend (27M) a few years ago. Despite being younger than me, he treats me like a baby and started doing everything for me. He always takes me to work and picks me up after work since I don’t have a car. Without him, I would’ve walked or taken public transport. I’ve always been grateful to him for doing this. Not only that, but he also does all the housework. He does most of grocery shopping and cooking and cleaning and laundry. When we go on a trip, he plans everything.

Life with him was so convenient that I got used to doing nothing by myself in a few years. All my friends say they are jealous that I have such a good boyfriend who does everything for me. I thought so, too. But suddenly I realised that I can’t do anything by myself anymore? When he goes on a business trip and leaves me alone for a week, I find it so stressful and exhausting to do house chores like cooking and cleaning, which I always did by myself before meeting him.

I became much less independent than I was 10 years ago and I don’t feel like myself anymore. On the other hand, I feel like I’m finally receiving the love and treatment I didn’t receive from my parents and it’s compensating my miserable childhood. He says I need to be treated like a baby now because I didn’t have the chance in my childhood.

I’m aware that this isn’t healthy in the long term. What should I change?

TL;DR: I used to be an independent person, but my boyfriend treats me like a baby and does everything for me and now I can’t do things like house chores by myself. I lost the independent person I was and turned into a baby.

ANSWER: Girl you got a guy like this. Start picking up the efforts and put in 50% rather than him doing 90%, and you both are SET. If he continues doing all this, he's gonna be burnt out sooner or later.

QUESTION: Bf (19m) and I (17f) were mugged. He ran away and left me alone with the mugger. I can't see him in the same light anymore

Yesterday I was hanging out with my bf and we were in a not so great part of our city. Suddenly a guy approached us to ask for indications and asked us to help him get there and we helped him (stupid i know). After getting there he pulled out a knife and asked for all our money.

Bf ran away and left me alone with the mugger. Lucklily he just wanted my money so i gave him all the money i had and then he went away.

After that i went inside a bar and called my parents. My parents were furious with bf and tried to call him but he did not pick up. We then went to the police and then returned home and after maybe 2 hours i received a call from bf asking me where i was and telling me he alerted the police. I exploded on him and he did not even apologized but kept telling me he did the best he could.

My question is: is there any way to recover from this? My image of him is shattered 

TL;DR: boyfriend left me during a mugging. I can't see him in the same light anymore

ANSWER: >>  is there any way to recover from this? 

I personally do not think so. I am so sorry this happened to you.

QUESTION: UPDATE: I (26F) think my boyfriend (30M) is exaggerating or faking his illness

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jefjhu/help\_i\_26f\_think\_my\_boyfriend\_30m\_is\_exaggerating/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jefjhu/help_i_26f_think_my_boyfriend_30m_is_exaggerating/)

Thank you to everyone who responded to my post and was so compassionate and kind. It was incredible to hear from so many people who actively battle chronic pain/illness and those with loved ones who do. I hope to continue deepening my empathy towards anyone who is struggling with an invisible illness.

On to my update. Armed with some fresh perspectives (and some fresh frustrations, lol) I talked to my boyfriend and told him that he needs to see a doctor or I will no longer be able to support him financially and stand by while he remains unemployed and unmotivated to get the help he needs. I also addressed the idea of managing/balancing his energy levels differently so that we're able to share household responsibilities more effectively, spend quality time together, and keep him doing the things he loves with his friends. 

His response was...really bad. He told me that if I'm not willing to "step up and clean around the house" (something I'm already doing) that there's no use living together and that my efforts to clean are the bare minimum and not good enough for his standards anyway. He was also really mad that I haven't taken initiative to take care of yard projects and car repairs. He sat there and spouted off a whole list of things I'm not noticing and cleaning. And, once again, he was focused on this idea that I don't like his friends/am jealous of them and want him spending less time with them, which isn't true at all. 

This really stung. He basically brushed over everything I said and focused on my perceived faults. This told me everything I need to know and I told him I was leaving. He was just...mad. Not sad or hurt at all. I'm still crying excessively over his whole reaction. I still don't know how real or unreal his chronic pain is, but I guess it doesn't matter anymore. 

Thank you again, everyone, for your support and kindness. I'm truly at a loss. 

TLDR: My (26F) boyfriend (30M) of almost two years and I have separated over his inability to address his chronic pain.

ANSWER: OP, I remember your first post. I know you’re very sad right now, and you have a right to be. But don’t let grief overstay its welcome — you are so much better off and he just lost his bang maid, expect him to come crawling back when he realizes you’re serious. Don’t believe anything he says. 

This internet stranger is proud of you. You deserve someone who can be your partner regardless of whether they have an illness — that doesn’t mean they’re critical or cruel.

QUESTION: My Husband Told Me He’s Filing For Divorce Today


My Husband (34M) told me (32F) that he’s fed up and going to file for divorce.  We’ve been married for 1 year, together for 4 years. He is very angry, and I feel depleted and numb.

Backstory: 
My husband suffers from a type of OCD called Relationship OCD otherwise known as Retroactive Jealousy. It is where he fixates on my past sexual relationships, particularly on one person, a person who I have not even spoken to in over 8 years. 

He can get triggered anytime, anywhere. We could be watching TV and a character will have the same name and he will get triggered. Last weekend, we were at a concert celebrating our one year wedding anniversary and someone came on stage wearing a jersey that is for the same sport this person used to play. He wanted to leave the concert immediately, we ended up fighting and our anniversary was ruined. 

Anytime he is triggered, his energy completely shifts from warm, goofy and loving to ice cold and bothered and he shuts me out. It is a very sad, confusing, frustrating and isolating experience for me and for him, it’s mental turmoil.

Pretty much every single fight we have had in our relationship has stemmed from his retroactive jealousy. Other than that, we’ve been extremely happy. Unfortunately, every time he gets triggered it chips away at my happiness. I walk on eggshells and feel anxiety sometimes because I never know when he will get triggered next.

I thought he might get better with time / after marriage because he would finally see that I want him and only him forever, I was wrong. 

Ever since he was triggered on our anniversary last weekend and we fought, things have never been worse. Something feels different about this time, like I finally realized this isn’t going away or I’ve hit my breaking point. We’ve been cordial to each other all week and sleeping in the same bed but no sex.

Yesterday, he asked me if “I’m ready to go back to being loving again”. I told him my concerns and how he needs to seek support / medication for this RJ. I also thanked him for giving me space (which literally just meant not initiating sex) and he got an attitude and say “yea well I was upset too”. 

It felt clear to me in this moment that he wasn’t really listening to me and to be fair, I sometimes have a difficult time seeing things from his side as well. Sometimes his aggressive approach and victim mindset in conversation makes me automatically defensive. 

He ended up storming out of the room and slept in the guest room (where he always sleeps when he’s upset or for his everyday naps) and has been slamming every door he walks through ever since. 

At this point, there is so much tension that I told him I will move his things from the master bedroom to the guest room so that we both can have space to process what we’re feeling. 

He left for the day to go golfing, a new hobby he picked up that he has trashed for the last 4 years.. While he was away I moved his stuff. I did not move it to upset him, I truly feel broken and anxious when I’m around him now and just need a little space to process everything.

He came home from golf and was livid. He said he wasn’t interested in being roommates and this was no way to live. I told him once again that I need space to process everything and he said rudely “you’ve had enough space, you’ve had a week of space. Instead of moving my belongings all day you could have instead come up with a way to communicate.” I told him I did try communicating with him yesterday and he got upset. I told him that the way he is currently speaking to me is with an aggressive tone to which he replied “Because I’m angry! This is ridiculous. I won’t be married to someone who can’t resolve simple issues, I won’t have kids with that person, I’m filing for divorce.” 

I responded that I don’t want a divorce all I am asking for is a little space for us to work through this. I don’t remember what he responded but he didn’t care that I said that and I think again he just repeated he was filing for divorce. 

After he said that he left the house. The crazy part is I still don’t feel much? I don’t feel angry or sad, just numb. Perhaps I’m over it or it could be some kind of coping mechanism to protect myself.

I’ve never spoken to friends or family about his RJ because I love him and didn’t want them to think negatively about him. I think it’s finally time I open up to my mother about it. I feel very alone.

I’m not sure what to do or where to go from here. I’ve never been more in love with anyone in my life. He was caring, made me laugh, bought me flowers, supported me when I was laid off from my job, etc. but I am just not sure I can be in this relationship anymore now with how he’s acting. Not taking accountability, being rude to me and instead of giving me the space I need, threatening to divorce instead.

REDDIT: It would help to hear from you (an outside perspective) on this. I am too in it to think clearly at the moment. Even if no one responds, it felt nice to be able to type this out. 

TL;DR: Husband has ROCD (retroactive jealousy) that causes most of our fights. After a bad trigger on our anniversary, he’s now threatening divorce because I asked for space, claiming I am incapable of solving issues. I feel numb and don’t know if this relationship is salvageable.

____________________

UPDATE: I am blown away at the amount of support this post has gotten. Thank you to everyone who has responded and to the mod of this post for giving me a great book recommendation. As many of you guessed, his threat of divorce was not real.

For the first time in 4 years I truly put my foot down and told my husband that I will no longer put up with this treatment. I told him that if he continues to choose not to seek help and instead continue to hurt me, then I’m not staying (and he knows I mean it). I told him I love him, but I love me and my mental health more. 

Since this long conversation he has set up an immediate plan:

Daily plan: 
 Morning reflection / meditation
 Medicine / Vitamins: Fluoxetine, magnesium, omega 3
 Workout

Weekly plan:
 Meet with therapist / start ERP (first session is scheduled for this weekend)
 Read 50 pages of self help books: 
     The Art of Letting Go - read by 10/1
     The Happiness Trap - read by 10/1
     Overcoming Retroactive Jealousy - read by 10/15
     Brain Lock: Overcoming OCD -  read by 10/30 

I told him that I support him, but that he needs to do deep reflection and work on himself before we can start rebuilding our relationship. I plan on leaving town this week to spend some time with my mother and will be working on an exit plan to have just in case the day comes. 

I have found a lot of strength and growth within myself throughout this process,  and am very proud of myself. 

I can’t describe how it felt going from feeling so isolated and alone to feeling like I have a community who supports me through this post. So if you’re scrolling and see someone who needs help, just know that your comment can make a big difference. <3

ANSWER: This divorce would be a gift, honestly.  

I don't know if this is genuine, but its absolutely wild.

QUESTION: UPDATE:  My boyfriend [M24] and I [F24] have too much sex and I can´t handle it anymore. How do I explain it to him that it exhausts me and how do I negotiate new intimacy with him?

Original post: [My boyfriend \[M24\] and I \[F24\] have too much sex and I can´t handle it anymore. How do I explain it to him that it exhausts me and how do I negotiate new intimacy with him? : r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ge7l3a/my_boyfriend_m24_and_i_f24_have_too_much_sex_and/)

I spend a lot of time reading through everyone's replies and looking inwards about how I feel. I gathered my thoughts and spend a few days making a list of what I wanted to say when we have the big conversation. On a weekend when we had planned to spend the day together I sat him down and told him the following points: 

I love him to the moon and back and want to show him that I love him, make him feel desired, loved and appreciated

BUT

Having so much sex with such frequency is physically exhausting to me which causes me to avoid sex and even sex acts I enjoy because I don´t have enough energy and motivation to do it. This also causes me to orgasm not as often anymore. I also need time to physically recover before it may even start to become painful. I feel like sex has become the single defining aspect of our relationship and many other parts like doing activities together, romantic dates, just talking and cuddling have taken a backseat. I also feel exhausted emotionally and underappreciated from giving as much as I can (which I gladly do for the people I love) while little comes back from the other side of the relationship. 

I then proceeded to explain the things I like during sex and what makes me go wild, hoping to show him that I still want to have sex with him. I also made a few more compliments just to keep the vibe positive and because I meant it. 

He reacted pretty well all things considered. He listened and let me finish, but asked for a little time to think about it. Obviously I gladly agreed. We spend the rest of the day together without him initiating once. At the end of the day he said that he wants me to enjoy sex just as much as he does and that he loves me. 

I was really hopeful for the next week and a half. We spend our time together like usual and he asked for sex about one half as often as before our talk. We even had days without sex at all. He also started to ask "Do you want to have sex with me?" instead of physically initiating like he did before, like touching me somewhere, hugging me from behind and similar things. He also stopped asking for pictures of me and when he did it were just selfies. I was so happy that I even took the initiative once and he seemingly loved it when I asked for sex.  

Then one day he sat me down with a stern look and said that he hated what this relationship has turned into. To him it feels like we are now just roommates or platonic friends instead of lovers. He told me that the one time I initiated after he was overjoyed to finally "fuck me again" his heart was broken because I suddenly wasn´t as submissive as usually (I asked to be eaten out and was on top with some more dominant dirty talk) and that all of that is not what he signed up for. He doesn´t want to walk on eggshells waiting for when I am finally in the mood, but have what he deserves in the relationship. 

Basically he gave me an ultimatum: either we return to how it was before the talk starting right now or he leaves me. Guess who doesn´t have a boyfriend anymore?

I spend the last few days bawling my eyes out and eating lots of ice cream and watching some shitty shows. What he said hurt me a lot and I do not love him anymore, but still the feeling of loss and sadness is all too real.    He was my first relationship and for the past two years he was my entire world. No I have to gather up the broken shards he left behind. 

TL;DR: I took your advice and talked with him about my feelings. He pretended to be ok with it for a while and then left me after demanding more sex again.

ANSWER: Yeesh I'm sorry, but I'm so glad you stood up for yourself, because the way he reacted exposed even more red flags. 


Do not take him back if he asks, he may try to manipulate you with the breakup so that you're more submissive next time.

QUESTION: I don’t want to relocate to India with my husband

Tldr: I, European 26, f doesn’t want ro relocate to India with my husband Punjabi 29, m due to cultural differences and lifestyle changes being too much for me to handle. 

My husband is a Punjabi and I am a European NZ. We have been married for three years and he has been living in New Zealand for 10 years. I have been to India many times for three months at a time each go. 

My husband has decided he wants to relocate us to India permanently, I really don’t want to. I would never force him to distance himself from his roots but I honestly don’t think I could cope with India for atleast 6 - 8 months a year, he said we could visit NZ yearly apparently. I made a compromise with him that I visit India for three months  a year and he can stay 6-8 months a year. He says life in India would be better for us because we would have more money and he has more connections in business there etc. My husband didn’t agree to this and said where ever and whatever the husband says the wife should follow. He said he Weill buy me a car in India and I can get a job teaching English to pre schoolers. I can only speak the basics on Punjabi and no one in Punjab but his parents and a few of his relatives who don’t speak English anyway. 

I am really conflicted and cry about this often because I feel like I’m going to be giving up my freedom and individuality. 

The times I have stayed in India have been hard at some points as my husbands house is rural and I can’t leave or go anywhere without him. I don’t get to wear what I like and to be honest if I say I don’t want to eat or drink something that is culturally Punjabi I found his family judged me so much. His parents also told me to stop watching English tv shows in the house. I followed their instructions and turned it off but felt super sad after wards. 

I think that maybe I am being selfish for not wanting to live in India but I don’t want to be trapped with no where to go. I think I will go mad. Any insight on my situation would be appreciated. Sorry my paragraphs and words are all over the place, my thoughts in my head and just a mess at the moment.

ANSWER: “Whatever the husband says, the wife should do.” He’s telling you who he is. Just wait until you are isolated and surrounded by this belief/culture.

QUESTION: UPDATE: Boyfriend slept with someone else while we were on a break

Origional post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Z9RsQy6S1Y

Firstly, thank you for all the useful advice I was given on my original post. I was unable to reply because it was locked but thank you all. 

Since I found out my (39F) boyfriend (40M) of 14 years slept with someone else, I broke up with him. He stayed living in my flat for 2 months (on a tight deadline) so he could find a home as he is jobless. He didn't. He is now homeless. 

His mum pressured me to have him for longer as there is a cold snap here and he's on the streets but I said no. His mum can take him in if she is so worried.

I found out it was the lady he has been spending time with at the gym. I think he wanted to try that to see if it was better.

That is all. I now live alone (with dog). 

TLDR: I chucked him out. He's homeless.

ANSWER: If he knew he was going to be homeless that far in advance and didn't sort out any income then that's on him. Who would want to have anything to do with someone who behaves like that.

QUESTION: My husband (63M) goes cycling way too much leaving me, his (60F) wife alone. How do I help him understand he's losing me?

Good people, I need some help.

My husband (63M) and I (60F) have been happily married 30+ years. Five or so years ago he started cycling. He loved it and I was happy he found something he enjoyed and was good for him although I felt he was spending too much money on bikes, tools, supplies, rides in races and weekend trips.  

The last few years have been bad with the time he spends riding. It’s getting unbearable for me. He’s gone all the time. He takes two cycling classes a week at the gym, he rides there when he’s not taking classes and he’s out on the road or a path 4-6 days a week for 4-6 or 7 hours at a time coming home after 10 at night on weeknights. Oh, and works a full-time job on top of this.

Last month we went to Florida for three days to visit my family and of course he had to rent a bike and ride. In the last 5 months he’s left me alone to ride on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, Easter and Mother’s Day. He probably went riding on Valentines Day too, I don’t remember. As I post this, he’s in Chillicothe Ohio on a weekend ride and visit with friends.

This is not a communication issue as I have joked, talked, complained, yelled and cried and cried all many many times. I love my husband dearly and don’t want a divorce. But I can’t take being alone anymore. I'd rather be separated and alone than married and alone. But if I leave him, I feel I’d be letting our kids and grandkids down. I’m so lost and don’t know what to do. Nothing I do or say makes a difference to him.

I'm hoping a few people are willing to comment so I can show him this and maybe we can both learn something, or I can gain some insight. Thanks ahead for your helpful comments.

TLDR, My husband rides his bike and leaves me, his wife alone way too much and I have no idea what to do. Can you please offer some advice?

ANSWER: I'd sit down and talk about this and focus ENTIRELY on you and what you need. Do not say the words "you are cycling too much" or it will become an argument about whether he is cycling too much. Instead, say 'I need to spend more time with you" or "I need to know that you'll be physically present on holidays and vacations" and ask him how he's going to make that happen.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Wife is a whole new person after giving birth. I’m scared i’m going to lose her.

My wife [30F] gave birth to our daughter 4 months ago. She doesnt work so she is a sahm. She is NOT the same person she was before the baby. Before birth we got into a serious argument maybe once every few months, now it's almost every weekend for almost no reason. Monday we were supposed to have a date night (drinking wine, watching movies, playing games, ends with sexual relations usually I'm (32M) holding her while we're watching a movie and she randomly blew up on me for no reason. Said she's sick of me and doesnt ever want to have sex again then storms out and locks herself in the bedroom. I prioritize her wellbeing. Make sure she's fed, hydrated, doing well mentally when she's with our daughter. She doesn't even seem happy to see me anymore when I'm home from work. Past fights recently have been about how she's not happy with me anymore after i snapped back one time about her nitpicking everything ive been doing recently (she has never once mentioned this before the baby), she's snapped on me because the baby was crying and I couldn't get her to sleep fast enough, also screamed at me because i ran a yellow light with her in the car. When we fight it's really hurtful things being said to me and I'm always saying sorry trying to defuse. I've done maybe 95% of the feedings at night so she can get about 7/8 hours of sleep consecutively and take baby from the moment i return from work so she can get alone time. I also do a lot of the household chores for her and it seems to land on deaf ears. She refuses counseling and won't talk to me about it and doesn't think it's a big deal. It seems like our marriage is close to an end and I'm scared. I care so much about her I hate seeing her like this. Can anyone relate?

TL;DR: wife gave birth 4 months ago and now randomly hates my very existence.

ANSWER: It could be postpartum depression or anxiety. 

Four months post birth is a difficult time regardless, she may also be struggling to adapt to her new life. I remember there were moments where I felt like I hated my husband, especially in the early days. 

I would try and get her to speak to a doctor.

================================================================================

QUESTION: Update: I told my boyfriend I loved him right after we had sex. How badly did I mess up?

Sl I (33f) made a post the other night (which can be found here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/TvHzNz4WpV) about how I’m with my first ever boyfriend (37m) and told him right after we had sex that I loved him and he didn’t immediately say it back so I freaked out and tried to backtrack before shutting him down and saying I wanted to move on. I left shortly after and just shut myself out from him for most of the next day. This morning I got a text message from him that said he misses me and was really loved to go out tonight, so I figured what the hell and we went out. While we were out, there was a moment during dinner that I reached over and held his hand and told him I was sorry I ignored him and told him about my abandonment issues and how self-destructive I can be when I’m scared people will leave me. I’m sure it’ll come as absolutely no shock to anyone that he was lovely and patient with me. We went back to his place and were snuggling and I was starting to fade away to sleep…

…then he said “love you, beautiful” (“beautiful” is his pet name for me. Corny but he says it’s very fitting lol). I stopped and then looked over at him, and then he said “you don’t have to say it back.” I said “but what if I wanna say it back?” and he told me to go ahead and I said “I love you too.” I rolled over on him and gave him a nice long kiss and then put my forehead on his before I started crying a little bit. I cannot tell you how badly I’ve wanted to say that to someone since I was 14 and it doesn’t even feel real. Feels like some dream I had that was nice but didn’t happen.

Riding this emotional high I can’t sleep so I’m writing this while he’s sleeping next to me. I have to get up in four hours to have enough time to go back home and get ready for work, but I don’t care. One bad day of crap sleep is forgettable, I’m gonna remember this night for the rest of my life. It’s way too soon for this, but I’m already getting giddy about putting my name in front of his last name.

So yeah. I’m in love you guys <3

tl;dr: follow up to the situation with me telling my boyfriend I loved him. He forgave me for shutting me out and later told me he loved me too.

ANSWER: If we're talking about silly crap we did after only two months... I had a psychotic episode and ran down the highway trying to get away from a guy I met on tinder screaming he was trying to kill me.

We've been together 4 years.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I (43F) read my fiancee's (56M) journals and don't know if I can marry him now

I (43F) am using a throwaway for obvious reasons here. Before I start YES I know I am a huge jerk for snooping in his (56M) email and I definitely found trouble, I accept that. I was working on his computer and his gmail was open and I saw my name so I opened it and it was a Word doc that he journaled. Curious of course I searched his inbox with my name and saw his entries and read them. Some of what he said has devastated me and shaken me to the core. We have been together almost 3 years, the first year on and off and was rocky. We have been living together since the summer. He is not home and I have not brought this up yet. I think I might faint and need some space. Should I get some distance and go to a hotel for the weekend? I thought we were in a great place. Over the past 10 months these are some of the things he's written about me: For reference i put \\\\ in place of my name.

"There are moments, in my dark thoughts, where I feel like being with her is a compromise for me, like this somehow diminishes me and that I am settling for her because I have ruined all of my other prospects and I’m too old to find someone else."

"At times, I wish she had stayed out of my life.  I wonder if I had stayed on my own if someone better would have come into my orbit.  There is so much to deal with, so many bad feelings and darkness.  I find that I am thinking about Lauren a lot but who’s to say that she would be any better.  The reality is that I met her on tour and fucked her a day later.  What kind of woman is that? I feel like I have pissed my life away and this is all that I am entitled to.  I have pissed away all of the good things in my life."

 "Someone like \\\\ would never have been able to get to me. When I was younger, I had many opportunities to be with women like her but declined. I am uncertain about whether this is a good thought pattern to have."

"My mind wanders to places, like what it would have been like if someone like Lauren could have been in my life instead of \\\\.  Lauren has the advantage of existing in my mind as an ideal.  We never really got the chance to know each other outside of two nights and a week of texting and talking on the phone.  I know that she had a drug past but has been sober for over a decade.  I don’t think she was promiscuous; most guys that I know that knew her in the old days indicated that she didn’t have a lot of men in her life.  That’s not to say that there hasn’t been a lot of darkness in her life. It would have been easier to be with her.  There weren’t all of these men in her orbit like \\\\.  She was never married, so there was no divorce.  She’s not as emotionally damaged as \\\\.  In some ways, I feel like being with \\\\ is some sort of karmic thing, like this is what I deserve for being non-committal for most of my life.  I have my own damage.  Everyone likes to think that they are a good person but there are moments when I am not so sure about myself."

TL:DR I am not sure if I can go forward with this relationship after reading this.

ANSWER: One: if he could get with Lauren, he'd soon be finding fault with her, too.

Two: run as fast as you can. He doesn't even like you, at all. Don't be a placeholder. You're not even second best here.

I'm sorry for how you feel atm, but it's good that you know so you can make your own decisions.

QUESTION: Update: husband has a new chosen family he prioritizes and sees every week, I’m jealous and frustrated


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/JwBnrT9EL9

It’s been a while since- our little boy is 2.5 now. Thank you to everyone who commented - it was the kick in the butt I needed to lay down the law. Esp the folks that rightly pointed out I was a passive doormat without self respect — that stung but was true.

After my post, I had a big sit down with John on my the things I was upset about. My husband was traveling to be a groomsman for a good friend — I told him to stay out there for an additional week and decide: 
1. if he wanted to stay married and wanted to be a family
2. If he wanted the above, think about what needed to change on his part (not just Pam but other stuff too), how he was going to be a good husband/father going forward
3. Arrange to go over it with me and our marriage counselor on his return

Alternatively, if he didn’t do the above then when he got back we’d start logistics on separation and co-parenting. 

And surprisingly, he did all the above. Apparently he reflected a lot at the wedding (his friend and his wife are such an in love couple) and thought a lot about us and our relationship and what he wanted.

He came back and proposed changes (immediate break from Pam/company and stop to their hobby — he’d play some dnd / mtg online but that was it), he’d take over remaining baby prep (nursery, logistics), and   promised to lay out a post-partum care plan for me and baby. He stuck to his word and also worked hard to regain my trust.

Then we had our son and my husband was over the moon in love. He and baby have been inseparable ever since and have an amazing adventure filled life with all the hobbies (baby/toddler swim, gym, soccer, co-op, and a great local parent community). After our kiddo was born Pam lost interest in my husband anyway (she doesn’t like kids) and shortly thereafter cheated on her poly relationship. Kevin and John have actually become good friends since then, but John is straight so I have no worries there.  And as I’ve reflected — I think I also just actually hated Pam — she’s everything I don’t like relying on men for affirmation, no job/life ambition, frivolous and stupid. And apparently (according to Kevin) the feeling was mutual - she thought I was a controlling, stuck up, robotic ivy league workaholic who didn’t appreciate or support my husbands hobbies/quirks. I was also a lot more emotiobal during pregnancy than normal. My husband- upon reflection liked being needed and admired 

We had a lot to work through with us, but two years later we’re in a great spot (I also had a weird shift in hormones post-partum which made my sex drive really really high which for us helped a lot with our relationship). Didn’t want this to be too long, but there were a lot of changes we implemented to get back to a loving place. John feels a lot of purpose in being a dad and supported me as my career has taken off. Sometimes things are still hard (my job is really high stress, toddlers are a lot of work, etc). 

But we’re pretty happy. We spent this morning snuggling in bed with our toddler and dog pretending we were on a boat, making hair dryer sounds, and giving hugs. We live a pretty boring suburban kind of life - but it works for us.

Thanks everyone for the push for me to stand up for what I wanted and needed.

ANSWER: What a great update. I'm so glad your husband honestly reflected and chose you and the baby. Hope it stays that way!

================================================================================

QUESTION: Friend's [34M] Girlfriend [33F] Called Me [36F] A Pick-Me And Now My Friends Want Me To Apologize?

Hi everyone, I need some advice. I (36F) have a group of five friends. We hang out together a lot, playing video games, going to Friday Night Magic, watching movies, D&D, and just generally being nerdy. One of the friend group \[34M\], Bruce, has recently gotten a new girlfriend and we've tried to include her in our get togethers. The girlfriend \[33F\], I'll call her Silver, really seems to hate me, and I'm not sure what to do. I didn't notice it at first, if I'm honest. She came along to our May the 4th/Return of the 5th party/sleepover, one friend Peter \[35M\] helped her make a paladin to join in on a D&D one-shot when she said she wanted to learn, she's come along to FNM multiple times, etc.

However, the other night, while I was having a passionate debate with another friend, Steve \[36M\] about the atrocity that was Hush 2 from DC Comics, Silver absolutely lost it at me. She started yelling about how I was a 'Pick-Me' and how I was mad that she was in the group and that I wanted to sleep with all the boys \[?!?!?!\] but especially Peter. She yelled for like five minutes, while I just sat there like a deer in headlights, because I didn't know what to say? She accused me of making my Warlock sexy in D&D to make the boys want me, that I picked a "Pretty girl card" for my deck in Magic, that I tried to "dress sexy" for May the 4th. \[I wore an Ahsoka sleeveless tank top, no straps, just sleeveless.\]

I tried to tell her I have no interest in sleeping with Bruce, or any of my guy friends, and she just burst into tears. Peter said that maybe I should go, for now, because she was upset, so I did.

Now, on Discord, a bunch of them \[Peter, Bruce, Steve and Michael (33M) have all said I should apologize to her, with only Clark \[35M\] saying I have nothing to apologize for. There's been a lot of talk about 'keeping the peace,' but I'm not sure what I should apologize for? I didn't make a move on anyone. I haven't slept with or tried to sleep with any of my friends.

I'm not sure what I should do, or what I can do. I don't know what to apologize for and I feel like my friends are siding with her.

TL;DR: Friend's girlfriend called me a pick-me and went on a rant about how I'm trying to sleep with everyone and now my friends want me to apologize to her.

ANSWER: Sounds like she has major insecurity issues and sees you as a threat without really knowing you.  I would hold my ground and hopefully your friends come around since it seems like you are a decent person.

QUESTION: UPDATE 6 years later: I (F26) am in love with my best friend (M26) but he thinks a relationship is doomed to fail

Original post can be found  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dzdykr/i_f26_am_in_love_with_my_best_friend_m26_but_he/)

6 years ago I was here lamenting the feelings I caught for my fwb turned best friend (let’s call him Franky).

After the initial pain of rejection, we both agreed to stay best friends. We moved in together with 3 of our other friends, and lived as platonic roommates. We confided in each other all our dating woes, cooked together most nights, and continued having fun nights out. During that time I grew equally close to my other roommates, and had a casual Covid lockdown fling with one who is now one of my closest friends (shocker).

After 3 years of living together, I had finally (mostly) gotten over my feelings for Franky. We were both casually dating other people and in a good place. I had spent many holidays with his extended family as his best friend, and was content knowing that I had a life long friend. Then he had a big health scare. It ended up not being anything major, but at the time put a lot of things into perspective for the both of us.

The night Franky returned from the hospital we had a heart to heart. I cried as I told him how scared I was during the emergency and it ended with us both deciding to try dating seriously.

We moved out of the group house with our friends to a small condo together. It took some time to change from an awkward platonic relationship to a truly romantic one, but we allowed the relationship to take its own time and course.

It’s been 3 years together now. He is currently cradling our shared cat as we plan a romantic weekend get away to New York. He was right, after the one year mark we sat and had a big talk. We talked about what each of us needed to work on to continue the relationship. Instead of it being a relationship death sentence, it lead to both of us getting therapy, making positive changes, and brought us even closer.

We now have such open communication that even after 3 years we have not had a fight. I could not be happier to have my person, as well as the wonderful family that I now get to be a part of.

TLDR; after 3 years of remaining besties, a mortality check pushed us together. Celebrating 3 years of bliss and hopefully more to come :)

ANSWER: Love this for u both. also a good reminder that love doesn’t have an expiry date, it can come back around when both ppl are actually ready.

================================================================================

QUESTION: My (21f) bf (25m) is going on a week long trip to Italy. How do I not resent him?

So my bf of 2 years along with 7 of his coworkers got invited by his work to go on a one week trip to Italy. Everything is completely paid for. Meals, flights, excursions, they are renting a private yacht, they’re staying on a mansion on the beach. Literally a trip of a lifetime and he didn’t have to pay a dime

When he first told me I was honestly I was anxious because 7 months ago he had previously did something to break my trust and we were trying to build back. Come about a week away from his trip to Italy I found out that he had an option to bring a +1, expenses all completely paid for as well. literally all their other guys who were going invited their gf/wife. I was the only one left out.

That completely changed how I felt. It wasn’t just a work trip anymore. It felt very personal and left me wondering why he didn’t want to invite me while all the other men had no problem bringing girlfriend along?

When I brought it up he said “he didn’t know it would mean that much to me” and he views it as a “networking and making connections trip and doesn’t want to have to worry about keeping me entertained while he is busy networking and building connections”. Or something along those lines.

He told me I would basically just be sitting in our room the whole time which at least id be sitting in our room in a huge mansion on the beach and private yacht getting fed pasta every night. Instead I’m just sitting at the house.

I feel so hurt and excluded and now he is living his life across the world with him and a bunch of other happy couples while I’m at home trying not to spiral.

I honestly feel a lot of resentment building. He knew I was anxious of him going because of him previously breaking my trust and he knew he had the option to invite me but didn’t. He said he “never considered how id feel and was thinking of it from a different perspective.” Outside of him breaking my trust we have an incredible relationship. We never fight, he pays for my all school/bills, anything I want. Most importantly he is my best friend. And I don’t want to destroy what we have.

My question is am I being over emotional or is this a real red flag? How do I process this and not let it turn into long term resentment?

TL;DR: My bf of two years is going on a two week work trip to Italy along with 7 of his coworkers. All of who brought their gf/wife. I was the only one left out. Now I feel hurt, excluded, and unsure how not to resent him

ANSWER: Come on. He had the option to bring you and chose to spend the week in Italy without even asking you. That’s not someone who wants to spend time with you. Without knowing the details of breaking trust it sounds like Simone who wants to spend his vacation with another woman or at least keep his options open.

QUESTION: Dad (60m) is giving all his money to a 21-year-old he met while driving Uber. I’m at a loss.



My dad (60m) met a 21-year-old while driving for Uber and now I’m watching what looks like a slow-motion trainwreck.

She told him she was homeless, so he started paying for her hotel, got her a job, bought her a car, and in total has given her around $20k… in just two months. The worst part? He doesn’t have that kind of money. He’s borrowed some from me under false pretenses (which I now know went straight to her), and his credit score is in the 300s.

People have tried to warn him. Her friend called him saying she’s still with her ex and using him. Her ex’s mom said the same thing. Every time, she tells my dad they’re just jealous or dislike her.

It’s beyond surreal. He looks like Danny DeVito (no offense to the man), has nothing in savings, and yet thinks this 21-year-old is with him for love. They’ve known each other two months and he already tattooed her name on him. He’s even had the police recover the car he bought her multiple times—until the last time, when she got him to sign it over to her officially.

He swears she never asks for anything, but somehow he’s hemorrhaged $20k since meeting her. I don’t know how to make him see it. I’m torn between trying to intervene or stepping back until he crashes and then helping pick up the pieces… but it’s getting worse fast.

TL;DR: my dad gave 20k to a girl he met in 2 months and thinks she loves him, idk how to get him to realize she's 99% likely using him

ANSWER: Sometimes there's just nothing you can do. Don't give him your money, but on some level the attention this woman is giving him is worth the money to him.

================================================================================

QUESTION: [Update] I [27F] don’t know how to deal with insecurities from dating bf [28M] who is much more attractive (7 years later)

Ok, a brief, mostly sad update. Previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bbvhkg/i_27f_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_insecurities/)

We got engaged a year ago, which felt like one of the best days of my life. The universe decided no, and earlier this year I found out my fiance cheated on me in the first months of our relationship and slept with his ex model fling a few times even though he had denied there was anything other than friendship between them. Found out because she still shares mutual friends with him and is in the same field, we were all at an event and she made a snide comment about it after a friend heard about our engagement and congratulated me. 

I can't really put into words how betrayed I felt, our entire relationship built on lies and years of insecurity being validated after I finally put them to rest. We tried working through it, but I decided to break things off because I don't think I'll ever be able to trust him again. He made sounds about how it was an early mistake and that I'd be throwing away 5 years of our relationship, but tbh I felt like they never became a thing because she wasn't interested in more, not him. So yeah, I wish I could say all of the "but he picked you" comments were correct, but clearly it was too good to be true.

\\tl;dr\\ Starting over at 34 after finding out my fiance actually did cheat on me with his ex fling at the beginning of our relationship

ANSWER: > So yeah, I wish I could say all of the "but he picked you" comments were correct, but clearly it was too good to be true.

Just want to mention that him cheating has absolutely nothing to do with him being "more attractive" than you or even his ex being "more attractive" than you. Men cheat on beautiful women all the time, often with less attractive women and often when they themselves are unattractive.

Cheating is a character flaw. He would likely have cheated on the model too if they'd gotten together for real and will probably cheat on his next partner. I hope in all this you don't internalize that you were right to think he was too good-looking for you because that's absolutely not the problem.

QUESTION: (UPDATE) How do I (47M) tell my boyfriend (35M) that I'm a virgin?

Original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Rrnwj7gcmp

Hey everyone. I'm really greatful for all the advice and support I got on my original post. I posted another updates on the comments of the original.

Summary, I (47M) have been with my boyfriend (35M) for a little under a year. He wants to get physical, and I haven't told him that I've never had sex, because of my history of abuse. After getting advice in the comments, I ended up writing him a letter explaining that I'm a virgin, and touching on some details of my abuse.

I left the letter on the nightstand before I left for work. (My boyfriend works from home) when I got home, his daughter (2F) ran up to me for a hug like she always does. I scooped her up in a hug, and pretended to eat her little fingers.

We had dinner and put her to bed like usual, then my boyfriend asked me to sit on the couch. My stomach tied up in knots, and part of me just wanted to run out the front door.

I have to admit, you were all right. He immediately held my hand and told me he's not disappointed at all. He asked me a bit about my past and the abuse I suffered from my mother. I don't feel comfortable going into detail here, but I barely scratched the surface and I ended up crying in his arms. I never want to be without those arms in my life. His hands rubbing my back, resting my head on his chest to listen to his heartbeat, the smell of his cologne. It's the safest I've ever felt in my entire life.

Once I calmed down, we started looking for therapists near me, then the night went on like normal. Watching our favorite shows while cuddling on the couch, doomscrolling social media and showing each other funny posts. Then we went to bed.

I feel like a weight has lifted off my shoulders. I don't have to hide this about myself anymore. I don't have to live with the fear of my amazing boyfriend seeing me as a lesser man. I won't lie, I'm still anxious about not being able to satisfy him in bed, but we'll work on it together.

I have a therapy appointment for later this month. So things are going good!

Tl;Dr, I wrote my boyfriend a letter, we talked, and now I'm gonna go to therapy.

ANSWER: This literally made me tear up. I’m so glad you found someone who is empathetic and very understanding of your situation. Dealing with trauma in your past, does not invalidate you! You are more than just a body. You’re a living human being, who has gone through so much and deserves the world! Thank you for sharing this, and I’m glad to hear you will be going to therapy. Hopefully that helps you with your mental state, and overall well being. 🫶

================================================================================

QUESTION: Should I [F30] warn my coworker [M24] that he is alienating himself socially?

I [F30] work in a project-based profession. The projects take anywhere from six months to several years and you’re typically working with the same small group for the entire duration. 

As a natural consequence of working closely with the same few people, friendships usually form, and we’ll all take lunch together sometimes or go for drinks after work, that kind of thing. 

We have an especially copacetic group on my current project. We’ve been working together six months and we go out socially, we talk and joke around during the day. We’re not “friends” but it’s a tight knit group as coworkers go. 

We have one coworker [M24] who is alienating himself from the group and I feel awful because he doesn’t seem to be aware of it. 

He’s losing the good faith and camaraderie of everyone in the office and he doesn’t seem to understand why it’s happening. I can see that it’s upsetting to him and it’s unpleasant for too. 

That being said, I don’t know him well at all, and I feel uncomfortable approaching him about the issue. He’s an overall nice guy and has some excellent qualities but they’re overshadowed by his tone deaf conduct. 

The result is the entire team is spending less time together because we wouldn’t host an event with everyone except him, but most people also can’t stand to be around him more than they have to. 

Should I say something to him and if so, what should I say? 


His behaviors include but aren’t limited to:


—Acts like he’s the most experienced despite being one of the least; constantly interrupts or gives unsolicited advice to other specialties.


—Minimizes coworkers’ complaints; e.g., when someone said “the client keeps calling me on weekends,” he replied “maybe work harder so they won’t need to.”
	

—Gets angry if anyone uses a nickname version of his (very common) name, even from people who barely know him.


—Went to a bar with us and other teams then spent the whole night lecturing everyone about how he doesn’t drink because he’s healthier and has more willpower.


—Proudly and conspicuously tattled on coworkers for bending the dress code when no clients were around, leading to a companywide memo.



TL;DR: Younger coworker keeps alienating our tight-knit team with tone-deaf behavior (know-it-all, minimizes complaints, lectures at socials, tattles). He seems unaware. Should I say something?

ANSWER: The only thing I could see doing is questioning his inappropriate behavior in the moment. Addressing his interrupting- making sure the person who was interrupted gets to finish their thought, questioning if he thinks an unhelpful suggestion is actually helpful etc

Calling out behavior that shouldn't be happening may make him see that it's unpleasant, or at least give everyone else the license to also call out his inappropriateness.

================================================================================

QUESTION: I [29F] have lost attraction to my [27NB] disabled partner and I'm at a loss for what to do.

My partner and I met and started dating 6 years ago. When we first met they didnt identify as non-binary, and we started our relationship as a lesbian relationship. I am a lesbian and I am not attracted to men. I have tried, many times, it just does not happen for me and I cannot force it. That being said they were the love of my life. We fell very very in love and I have never experienced the acceptance they showed me. The love they showed me was magic and I look back with very strong fondness at that time of my life.

They started to transition in earnest 3 years ago. They were very hesitant to do so initially. They knew I'm a lesbian and was not attracted to men. And they didnt want to transition for that reason. I encouraged them to do it wholeheartedly, because being trans is something you do for yourself, not for anyone else. I assured them that I wasn't considering leaving them over that,  and that it was men i wasnt attracted to not non-binary people. I told them that they had to do it for themselves. That it was crucial, even. And they did, they've been on T for quite a while and are much more masculine and in general pass as a man. They're non-binary, but yeah even so we get read as a straight couple and theyre often referred to as my boyfriend (a term they like). Over time though... its just not the same anymore. I struggle with intimacy with them, I am still deeply attracted to who they are. But their body has changed and their demeanor has changed and it's just no longer within what I'm attracted to. Its starting to hurt me to force myself through it. I want them to be happy but I am unsatisfied in several ways and have had a lot of feelings that I'm not voicing because I do not want to hurt them in any way.

They are also disabled and reliant on me for a lot of things. I rely on them for a lot too, as I am not always in the best mental state. Neither of us has a relationship with our families. We both experienced a lot of abuse growing up so we're mostly by ourselves. I can work and am working but they aren't as they have been going to therapy. They wouldn't have anywhere to go if our relationship ended. They don't have support to fall back on. And their mental health fluctuates and at somewhat routine times they are suicidal. I'm so scared of what would happen if I did decide to leave.

I don't really know what I'm looking for. Someone who has been in this situation I guess? I feel so much guilt and fear. I'm semi-sick today because of how anxious this whole thing is making me. I'm so scared of being alone too. They do provide emotional support to me, which has been very helpful for me at times. I just don't know what to do. I feel like no matter how I look at the situation I'm in the wrong. That I'd be throwing away the life weve built together and that its my fault.

TL;DR my partner transitioned and I'm losing attraction to them but they are disabled and we are very dependent and I have no idea what to do.

ANSWER: This is pretty common for partners of people who decide to transition. There's no shame or harm in deciding that you are not attracted to their new self (with absolute respect for your partner — I am saying this as a transgender woman!).

You're allowed to feel the way you're feeling. I know it hurts and feels awful and it does not at all reflect how you feel about your partner. But you need to do what is right for you — just like they did for themself (with your blessing).

Edited to add that I'm rooting for you both and wish you peace and light.

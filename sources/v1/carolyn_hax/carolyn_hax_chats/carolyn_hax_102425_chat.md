Is it possible to be a happy working mom?
Guest Oct 24, 11:08 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, here goes. Is it possible to be a happy mom who works a 9-to-5 job?

I always assumed I would stay home with my kids, at least during the early years. That is how I was raised—my mom was home throughout our entire childhoods and eventually (when my youngest sibling was 18) went to go work as an in-home aide. On reflection, she really disliked working as an aide and often made comments about wishing she had other options. Those comments were in my head as I sought out my first adult jobs. I work in HR at a midsize company and my work is predictable but challenging.

My husband and I are expecting our first baby in March and I'm starting to plan for parental leave and beyond. I am finding that, despite my original plans, I don't want to leave my job. It also doesn't make sense right now, because I bring in roughly 60% of our family's income (my husband is a schoolteacher).

Most of my friends either don't have kids yet or are stay-at-home moms. I don't have a great model for what working motherhood works like except in my coworkers, who seem frazzled and complain about their kids all the time. Obviously it's because mine is still in utero, but I can't imagine complaining that bitterly about my baby and assume it has to do with the competing demands of their lives.

I guess my overall question is whether there are working moms who are fulfilled the way stay-at-home moms are, or whether I'm letting money make a decision for me that should be moral/emotional?

ANSWER: I have so many answers fighting to get out, they're all jammed into each other. I'm just going to pull them out one at a time and probably get the order all wrong.

First, I suggest you talk to your co-workers vs. observe them. Not in a judging way, either -- do not , do not come at them with, "I can't imagine complaining that bitterly about my baby." Because defenses will go up so fast they may knock you backward. If you approach in an "obviously there's some exaggeration here but you're scaring me" way, and, "I'd love to hear some good stuff," then you have a much better chance at truth. There could be an enormous gap between what they're blurting out in moments of exasperation and what they deeply feel.

Second, as long as we're doing the "most of my friends" thing -- most of my friends (vast majority) worked while they were actively rearing their kids. And not only were most of them also happy, the relatively few unhappinesses were often not related to the combination of working outside the home and being parents. So, that it might not be "possible" is astonishing to me, really. In the way that it would be astonishing to ask, "Is is possible to be a happy breather of air?"

Yes, it's challenging. Time is an issue. But being home is challenging for different reasons. Working outside the home or not isn't what makes or breaks a household. The trick is to choose what is right for your specific circumstances -- you and your partner, if you have one, and your kids, and your finances, and so on.

So, third item. If I were to construct an is-it-possible-to-be-happy scenario, I might use this phrasing: Is it possible to be happy with an "I had always assumed ___" outlook on life? Because to me, the building blocks for a satisfying life aren't in this choice or that choice or the other demographic. They're here: in openness to making a joyful, meaningful life of what comes.

You're a few steps into that with your epiphany that you don't want to leave your job. Despite what you "had always assumed," the life course you're on has its own ideas.

So, keep going with that. Keep challenging your assumptions with reality. Your husband, for example, as a teacher, might have a schedule that aligns well enough with your child(ren)'s over the years to tame some of the frazzle. You may be able to hire help or organize better around some of the stress. You may find that "venting" is not your parent-bonding language; no judgment.

In the doghouse
Guest Oct 24, 11:18 a.m.
QUESTION: My brother and sister-in-law have been using me as their dog-sitter since we moved close to each other about ten years ago. I never ask them to reciprocate, since one of my dogs can be a little destructive when unsupervised; I put my dogs in a kennel when I travel.

Their dog (we’ll call him Sid) is a bit of a hassle. I take care of him in my house. Sid is quite a bit older than my two dogs, so every walk turns into two—a long one for mine and a short one (distance-wise, but almost as long time-wise since he walks so slowly) for Sid. Sid needs five pills daily, eye drops, ears cleaned, teeth brushed—is not terribly cooperative for any of it.

They’ve stopped giving me food for him, since my dogs eat the same kibble, but it’s expensive (about $45 per week per dog).

They’ve even asked me to drop him off when they get home, since they’re so exhausted from their travels.

It used to be they would take me out to dinner for a thank-you, buy me a souvenir if it was a pleasure trip, etc., but even that seems to have stopped in the last couple of years.

I have confronted them on occasion regarding one thing or another. The first time they didn’t give me food, they said, “it’s just for the weekend.” The next time: “we have more at our house; you can come get some if you need it” (it’s a 20-minute drive each way). Once we went out to dinner together just after I had cared for Sid for several days, which I thought was my thank-you dinner. When they asked me to split the check, I “joked” that taking care of Sid for the weekend didn’t pay as well as it used to. They did not say, “oh, right, never mind then,” but collected their $60 (kennels in our area cost $40-$65 per night).

We’re all rather well-off, and on the one hand, it feels churlish to insist on them buying me dinner and gifts, or to refuse to pay for Sid’s food. But on the other hand, I feel I’m being taken completely for granted. Rather than a close relative who’s taking care of their dog for free, they’re treating me like some sort of expensive concierge pet-sitting service, or as if they’re doing me a huge favor when I take care of Sid, rather than the other way around.

They know I’m not going to refuse to take care of Sid when they need me to; I wouldn’t do that to Sid (he’s never been in a kennel in his life, and can’t start at his age). So how do I address this?

ANSWER: Draw lines where you hold the pen. Never, for example, drop off Sid for them. I mean really. I expect that will mean you have him an extra day, which will then mean more work than the drive would have been, but if the point is to make a point, then that will make your point.

QUESTION: It isn't a choice between you being taken advantage of or sending poor Sid to a kennel. Talk with brother and SIL, tell them you are no longer available, and encourage them to find a paid dog-sitter; surely in this economy, there is someone in your area who is qualified, capable, compassionate and in need of money.

Partner OCD / State of Our House
Guest Oct 24, 11:50 a.m.
QUESTION: Dear Carolyn,

This is my second time writing in. I wrote over the summer about my husband’s OCD (I was “Walking on Eggshells”).

My husband has a high-stress job, and together we’re raising four kids in a busy, blended household. He’s a wonderful man and deeply committed to our family, but he has strong OCD tendencies — his way of controlling what he can when everything else feels chaotic.

Here’s the hard part: when he’s on his way home from work or a trip, I can feel my body tense. I rush to clean the counters, vacuum, put away dishes, make sure no toys are out — all before he walks through the door. If anything is out of place (a cup in the sink, a blanket on the couch, a toy in the driveway), he immediately starts straightening and cleaning, often before saying hello.

By nature, I’m more relaxed about clutter, but over time I’ve come his way because I know how important order is to him. We’re both tidy now, but I feel like I’m living under constant pressure to keep things perfect so he doesn’t spiral into cleaning mode. It’s exhausting, and I hate that I sometimes dread his return because of the energy shift it brings.

For a while, we even had cleaners come every other week, but that ended up creating more stress than relief — if a plant was moved half an inch or a picture frame slightly askew, it really bothered him. I managed them, and eventually it became more work than it was worth.

I also worry about what this teaches our kids — that a toy on the floor or crumbs under a chair are somehow “wrong.”

We’ve talked about it many times, but not much changes. He refuses counseling, saying he’ll “work on it,” but I don’t see real progress. Medicine isn’t something he’s willing to consider either. I love him and want to be understanding, but this dynamic feels heavy and unsustainable.

How can I support him without losing my peace — or turning our home into a stress zone for everyone else?

Signed,
Walking on Eggshells (and Crumbs)

ANSWER: Obv you can't make him go. But you can present to him this breakdown of the unmet terms of the deal, and that the result is his untreated anxiety is affecting the entire family. This can't be what he wants -- can it? Ask him. Acknowledge that it's a hard threshold to cross for anyone, and you're sympathetic. But this stress is hard too and the alternatives only get harder.

You may have to initiate those alternatives -- separation for the kids' sake -- but that is many steps away and I hope wont' be necessary, once you make it clear that his getting help is not negotiable now that his anxiety is affecting all and his self-help plan is stalled.

Not wild about my daughter’s fiancé
Guest Oct 24, 11:51 a.m.
QUESTION: Oldest daughter is engaged to a young man; they have been dating three years. She is an accomplished professional with degrees to match, and he hasn’t come close to finishing undergrad and works as a grocery manager for a chain store. They are worlds apart (suburb vs. country living). He seems a bit on the spectrum and he takes everything personally. Both see therapists. Talking to him is difficult and we haven’t conversed in over a year. He wanted my blessings to marry my daughter via a phone call. He thinks my nose is out of joint.My husband and I are concerned with red flags that she will settle on this person and they are so disparately worlds apart that it is scary to see how she might be left holding the bag. She still lives at home but pays rent. Her therapist hasn’t nudged her to grow and evolve like a person her age should….she is socially awkward and doesn’t seem to want to do much beyond work, home and visiting her boyfriend. She wants to buy a house; we have suggested she rent and be I. Her own for awhile. i don’t have tough conversations anymore because it ends up in a screaming match.

Advice Columnist

ANSWER: By the end, you're admitting (I don't think that's too strong a word) that your daughter has serious challenges of her own ... but kind of blaming her therapist for them. And having screaming matches with your kid about how you think she should be living her life.

I want you to reread because maybe then you'll see all the finger pointing, all the things you think everyone else is doing wrong. With their lives -- not yours.

Then I hope you will see that as your cue to excuse yourself from this picture. Talk to your own therapist if that will help you with the difficult feelings. Yes, it's hard to watch people make choices that you think will make their lives harder. But they're not your choices to make. Not anymore.

And the more you try to impose your will on your kid, the more urgent you make it for her to push back against you. And the worst decisions we make (collective "we") are always the pushes back against a smothering authority.

Give her the space any adult deserves. Give her the trust you would have wanted to have at her age -- even if you don't think she's ready for it yet, or has earned it. Sometimes you have to put it there because it's (past) time, and let them figure it out.

Re Happy Working Mom
Guest Oct 24, 11:52 a.m.
QUESTION: The thing that struck me is that you work in HR, so consider that you are probably more likely to hear complaints than other professions and I don't even mean in a professional capacity. I'm a former therapist and either because people know my training or it's part of personality type that seems like a kind, nonjudgmental ear I am the person people want to vent their spleens to. I have to establish boundaries, but I know perfectly lovely, happy people who have tried to share every frustration with me while others in their lives don't hear a single complaint. This may be going on here. So don't assume that these people are miserable parents constantly complaining. You might just seem like a friendly outlet that will let them vent for short bursts.

QUESTION: Some people don't want to talk the moment they get home. (Not saying the OCD husband is like that, but some people are.) What if you let him clean when he gets home instead of rushing to do it all before he arrives? It might be a way for him to self-soothe after the stress of his workday.

ANSWER: "What if this is a way for him to self-soothe after the stress of his workday? Talk about this, and ask if it would help if you let him clean when he gets home instead of rushing to do it all before he arrives."

That plus this: I still think counseling remains a nonnegotiable if the stress is bleeding into the family beyond just one straightening up session per day. I won't get into the particulars, but I have run across the straightening thing as an anxiety outlet where it is a bottomless pit of fussing.

Former gym rat
Guest Oct 24, 12:16 p.m.
QUESTION: Prior to the pandemic, I was a huge gym rat and used to work out all the time. I got out of it when the gym closed and never went back. But my husband will. not. let. it. go. He keeps nagging me. (I have not gained weight, changed size or anything else.) I have used "Not happening. Next question." and he has now stooped to trying to embarrass me about this by mentioning it in front of friends who are all "But you LOVED to work out!" Yeah, and now I don't. Ugh.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist

ANSWER: Or, simpler, just leave. The room, party, restaurant, bar, whatever. Evening over.

Time to have this out with him I guess:

"What is it going to take for this to stop? Do I have to ask you something over and over, even though I have the answer, until you break? Do I have to embarrass you in front of our friends? Do I have to say out loud to you, 'Yes, I KNOW you liked me better when I was a gym rat, I KNOW you are really bugged that I don't go any more, but I am still not going back' -- will that do it? What? Please tell me so I can be free of this b-------."

The weight/size thing is a red herring. Even if you did change some, this is a one "back-off" issue. You get to manage yourself as you see fit.

Where a spouse gets to express concern is in engagement-with-life management, and even then, it's both nuanced and about you (you-indiv and you as a couple). Meaning, this I-want-so-I-embarrass-you crap would never fly.

For the working mom question
Guest Oct 24, 12:17 p.m.
QUESTION: One thing that I kept hearing when I was pregnant, and that I frankly found very annoying at the time, but which was totally true is that you really won’t know how you feel about staying home versus working until you actually have a child on your lap that you’re taking care of. I agree with all of Carolyn suggestions about preparing and having conversations, but ultimately towards the end of your parental leave, you will either be feeling like yes I’m ready to go back, or no I can never imagine being away from this baby, or maybe a combination of both I found out that more than anything informed next steps .

Congratulations to you and your husband. I hope you find an arrangement that works for your family.

Birthday Husband

QUESTION: I'm the letter writer with the birthday wife who is out of the birthday business. Thanks for taking my letter. It was good to read your response and Haxers. You were dead right that my wife wouldn't believe me that I was not planning anything. It all blew up when my wife kept asking her best friend about the plans. Her best friend reached out to me and I told her I was out of the birthday business. She blew up after talking to her sister. The kids were at daycare (tip the hat to you for thinking of safety). She wanted me to leave and called the police to get me to leave. My wife is still screaming mad but staying at her folks' house. I didn't see this being the spark that could end my marriage but I'm seeing everything from a different perspective now and more certain than ever that this was the right decision for me to take.

QUESTION: I’m maybe over rotating but this phrasing was triggering: that this decision should be “MORAL”/emotional. It feeds into the mommy wars and it’s just so destructive to think that any choice (working, not working, part time working) has inherently higher MORAL value. They are both valid, good choices.

Advice Columnist

ANSWER: 2. I think we can make moral calculations without Princess Bride-rolling down the slope into judging everyone else. (I am a cockeyed optimist, what can I say.) One family might decide it's morally imperative to have Mother home -- and yes, that has bad mommy war history. But one might also see moral value in having Dad home, to show that role model -- especially for a baby boy? Or for a girl? (Discuss.) One might see moral weight in having both parents contribute paid work. Etc. It's all on the table, I think -- when it can be of course. Practical considerations often make the rest of it moot.

how do people move on so fast?
Guest Sep 19, 11:05 a.m.
QUESTION: I recently found out that my ex-boyfriend has a new girlfriend. We were together for a year, which I know is not long in the grand scheme of things, but it was a really important, special, and impactful relationship to me. And to him, from everything he told me and what we shared while together (which I do not doubt that he was lying about or misrepresenting). It's only been a few months and I cannot imagine meeting or becoming involved with a new person. Most days I am still so sad. But it seems he met this new person a month or two after we broke up, and pictures of them together are already all over his social media. (A friend told me this because she thought I already knew, which I didn't -- I've removed and haven't looked at any of his social media since breaking up, because I knew it would make me too sad.) I know logically that him being with a new person can't make what our relationship was any less special to me, but it just hurts. How do people manage to move on so fast? We're in our mid/late 30s, in case it matters.

ANSWER: I'm sorry. People are just so, so different. About pretty much everything:

-How deeply they attach is different (you may be a 10 to his 5 in capacity).

-How any two people feel about each other is different (you may have been a 10 to his 5 in this particular relationship).

-How any two people break up is different. Some people do all the mental/emotional work of breaking up while they're still with someone, and the breakup just makes it official. Others start that clock upon breakup.

-How any two people recover from a breakup is different (maybe you were equals in capacity and attachment, but you recover through mourning and he through reattachment).

-How any two people present themselves is different. He could be more upset than you are, for all you know. It's social media, not truth serum.

-What any two people create in combination is different. What you had with this guy was impactful, special to you, that's important -- for some happy memories and for what it taught you about yourself and what you're looking for in a partner. Painful as it is, maybe this is a useful look now at some differences too big to reconcile.

Or it's just a setback as you're trying to get over him. Either way, he wasn't the guy. It's okay if you're not able to draw more from it all than that.

SIL wants my parents to be surrogate grandparents
Guest Sep 19, 11:18 a.m.
QUESTION: We live in the same town as my parents, and they are amazing grandparents to my two kids! We see them weekly and my parents occasionally take our kids on excursions to the park, movies, etc. Two years ago, my SIL (husband's sister) and her family moved to our town as well. This is also great, we get along well and see them almost weekly for dinner, etc. A few times, mostly at our kids' birthdays, my parents and SIL's family have been together at our house. My parents interact great with SIL's two young kids (now 1 and 3). The 3 yo even calls them "Grammy and Grampy" because that's how our kids refer to them, which I think is adorable. But it's now causing an issue. SIL/my husband's parents live a few hours away, and don't travel much due to mobility issues. SIL's whole family has been no-contact with her husbands' parents for years (just for context... I agree with their reasons, not that my opinion matters). My SIL recently started talking about how nice it would be for her kids to have a routine grandparent connection and she would like for us to include her kids on outings my kids take with my parents. I feel... weird about this, like it's cutting into my kids' bond with my parents. But I asked my parents, and they said they had no interest in a closer relationship with SIL's kids. Unfortunately my SIL did not take this well. I think she's working through some grief about the lack of grandparents and now she's lashing out at me for "selfishly" keeping my parents "to myself." So... advice on handling this in a way that doesn't destroy a relationship I hope can be close again?

ANSWER: Wherrrrrrre is your husband in this? Where. Seriously.

This was up to your parents, and they said no. So there you go.

I do feel for your SIL. If I were in your place, I'm not sure how I'd feel -- because it would depend on all the variables, like my parents' natures and their health, my relationships with them, theirs with my kids, my kids' relationships with the other kids and the SIL and husband, mine with the SIL and the husband, husband with everyone, all that. If everyone got along, then I hope I'd be in a more-the-merrier frame of mind. But I could easily see being more circumspect.

That's why the SIL took responsibility for not flipping out if she didn't like the answer. That to me was the prerequisite to such a delicate request.

Because if the parents weren't game for any reason, then she was forcing you to be their bouncer, and that role was always going to suck. "No, your babies are not on the list to be their grandbabies. Step aside."

Which brings me to my opening query. I would want my husband to absorb any lashing-out from his sister on the family's behalf. It's the right thing to do.

Worried abut litigious neighbors
Guest Sep 19, 11:37 a.m.
QUESTION: We’re starting to have problems with our next-door neighbors. I don't want to be enemies, but I also don’t want to lose a bunch of money because they decided to sue us. My wife and I have lived here since last January and the neighbors on one side have two tween boys. Recently I saw the older boy jump our fence to retrieve his ball. I was worried because even though he was the one trespassing into our yard, the fence is rickety, we have a large dog and a lot of uneven spots (we did what we could this summer but the yard still needs a lot of work). The father of those boys is a lawyer and I know if one of them gets hurt, they’ll sue us for every penny we’ve got. I told the boy to stay out of our yard, to ring the bell and ask for the ball when that happens. He said he would but I’ve caught him and his brother both in our yard since then. I went and talked to their father, but didn't get anywhere. He didn't take me seriously and told me that I was overreacting, that kids will jump fences and it’s no big deal. I felt like he was patronizing me so I snapped and told him that he better not let his kids trespass in my yard again otherwise I would call the police to start a paper trail. I’ve put up no trespassing signs but we can’t afford a new fence and I’m losing sleep over this. My wife thinks I’m overacting but my parents got sued by a neighbor when I was young. Their kid was playing with my older brother, tripped over a ladder in our yard and hit his head on a retaining wall. My parents had to pay all of the hospital bills and their insurance went through the roof. So I know how badly these things can go. Should I try to talk to my neighbor again or just take out a loan and put up a bigger, jump-proof fence? My wife is against going into debt but says she’ll go along with it if it’ll give me some peace of mind.

ANSWER: Whoa, wait a minute. You "know" you'll get sued because your neighbor is a lawyer? You "snapped" just because you "felt like he was patronizing me"?

It sounds to me as if your next-door neighbors are starting to have problems with you -- based on your assumptions about them that you've cast into hardened certainties based on a bad experience you witnessed as a child. Whew.

I am not an insurance expert or a lawyer, obvy, and this brings in both areas of expertise. But I am comfortable calling it when I see someone creating a problem they're blaming on someone else.

Is it great that the tweens are in your yard, no. But the parents can't possibly supervise their kids 24-7. That is unrealistic. You, however, can recognize when you're letting past results cloud current judgment.

And you can also recognize when you're worried about the wrong problem. You have a large dog and a rickety fence. That tells me you -- not the boys -- are your own reason to borrow money for a big, sound new fence. And to approach the neighbors with a peace offering and an apology for starting off on such an aggressive note. And looking into an umbrella policy if you're going to lose sleep over stuff like this to the point you can't be civil.

Moving Away/Left Behind
Guest Sep 19, 11:46 a.m.
QUESTION: My bestie — my daily ride or die! — is working hard on moving their family to Europe. Like, selling property, getting background checks, hiring lawyers, seriously trying to leave. And while they're excited and want me to be excited for them, I'm really struggling. I'm, frankly, devastated. I can't leave for a billion reasons (primarily, kids and husband are not on board with exploring this). How do I navigate faking excitement for them while my heart is breaking at being left behind?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Have you told the truth yet about your devastation?

It happens all the time that friends' new relationships, promotions, moves, births -- obvious additions to their lives -- turn out to be subtractions from ours, of their time or presence or attention. At some point we have to find a way to be happy for them, or else we're just peevish and self-absorbed and not very good friends.

But it's hard to get to that point in a genuine, good-for-the-friendship way without some sort of honest reckoning with the loss. Like, be peevish for your moment. "I know I am supposed to be happy for you, but I need to say out loud first that I am devastated by this. I want you around every day/week like always and my heart is breaking at being left behind." You can even say right afterward that you appreciate the chance to say this, will be on message with your excitement and support from now on, and have some thoughts about the decor for their guest suite.

If you have already aired your grief to your friend, then openness about your struggle can still work and be a fair part of close friendship, as long as you're not expecting her to fix this for you. Something like: "I'm still excited for you, I'm just having some breakthrough grief today for me." Good friends have their own sense of the right mix for them, but in general too much dumping and too much faking both can be a strain.

surrogate grandparent OP
Guest Sep 19, 11:56 a.m.
QUESTION: OMG thanks for answering my question! My SIL and I actually have (or had...) a very close relationship. We chat and meet up independently of husband, and I consider her a close friend. So it seems weird to offload this to my husband, like "whoa, this relationship got too hard for me, I'm out!" As for the dynamics... her kids are 1 and 3. Mine are 7 and 10. Both my kids love their cousins and are very sweet with them but doing the same activities is hard, given the age differences, and I think they treasure those outings where it's just the two of them. But I WANT to be in the "more the merrier camp" which is why I think I'm struggling with this... I do feel guilty, like I'm depriving my niblings of something the kids have. I think if I pushed, my parents would come around. But I don't want to push! My instinct is to just wait this out, it's out of character for my SIL so maybe she's just going through a rough patch. But it has me dreading our weekly get-together this weekend. Last time she started crying over it and I felt awful.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ah, this helps a lot, thank you.

Definitely sounds like SIL's whole campaign for surrogate grandparents is a proxy for a bigger something-else. Certainly the big feelings about it.

As for pushing your parents, agreed, not the move, for a bunch of reasons. Here's a capsule: So your SIL is going to start calling your parents and bring her kids over without any of the rest of you there? I get the general surrogate grandparent idea, but definitely makes sense to give it more time to happen organically.

But a little push to your SIL might be the right one, this weekend. A gentle, "Hey -- I hope you don't mind my asking. What's really going on?"

Re: avoiding the litigious
Guest Sep 19, 11:59 a.m.
QUESTION: As a non-litigious ex-lawyer (there are more of us than you might think), I’d also point out that with a rickety fence and a large dog, you’re running risks from the litigious general public, not just your immediate neighbors. Even though he believed that “something there is that doesn’t love a wall,” and that we should be careful to know what we’re “walling in or walling out,” I think even Frost would agree that this is an occasion where “good fences make good neighbors.”

surrogate grandparents

So much hatred
Guest Sep 19, 12:36 p.m.
QUESTION: Carolyn I'm not sure how to cope anymore. My husband and I have been married 20 yrs with no kids. In the beginning our marriage was fine. About 10 yrs ago his mom died and mine died 9 yrs ago. It was a hard time but we got through it. We've since relocated to be near family and life got better. His attitude started to improve. He came off his depression meds.

Lately though he has so much hatred for everything and everyone. He gets so angry for little things now and things he can't control (the firing of Kimmel for example). He's become lazy at home - never helping out with chores and never picking up after himself. For the past 11 months we have not slept in the same bed (he always has an excuse - not tired, needs to listen to podcast, dog took up the bed etc). And don't get me started on the romance - it isn't there.

He's clearly going through depression issues but I don't know how to help. I've suggested counseling and he doesn't follow through, I've suggested a therapist and he doesn't follow through. I've even tried to get him to see just a primary care but nope.

What, if anything, can I do at this point? Last night I put on a netflix show but he keeps his head in the phone and when I asked him a question he literally told me to "F off". Obviously I wouldn't take it so I left the room. He'll try and talk to me today when he comes home from work but never apologizes for his words which quite honestly hurt.

I am seeing a therapist but how can I help someone who is refusing to get help?

I'm feeling lonely in my own marriage.

ANSWER: You don't have to live like this.

Don't just believe it -- know it. It is your baseline.

It does sound as if his depression is back with a vengeance, yes, and so medical intervention will be the answer. It also sounds as if you will need to be more forceful in your "suggest[ing]" that he get professional help. This is still going to fall short of so-called making him get treatment, which we all know isn't a thing.

But you, in the meantime, don't have to live in this reaction place to his misery and mistreatment.

You can make any one of a series of decisions on a scale of disengagement from his misery. Just to use the sleeping apart example: You cite 11 months of his excuses. That means you keep trying, right? You could instead choose to formalize the new sleeping arrangement and make your room the retreat you want it to be.

This may hit you all wrong, and I can understand that. But it's an example of using your agency and working within your current reality to stabilize your well-being from one day to the next. Instead of dragging that nightly what-if into a 12th month, you settle it, and sleep well in your nest, and decide to focus on higher-percentage issues like urging him back into care.

You can go bigger or smaller than this. Smaller would be a sit-down with him on making appointments, for example. And/or, trying on a decision to switch from reacting to acting, and then going through the next few days noticing what things would change when you do that, and how -- then starting gradually to introduce those changes.

Bigger, separation. "I love you. Too much to let this keep spiraling. You told me to F off. You can make appointments to get back into treatment for your depression, or you can pack."

However big you go, though, do take the reins of your life back. Not only will it be healthier for you, but it will actually make you more effective in dealing with your marriage, however you choose to respond.

Nights to Ourselves
Guest Sep 19, 12:38 p.m.
QUESTION: My wife is an amateur singer. She is in a barbershop quartet. They practice one evening per week and go to regional retreats/competitions a few weekends a year. She's been doing this for many years. She loves singing, though she has told me on numerous occasions about various frustrations with her group; it often seems like she is not having much fun. Still, I support her activity because it is what she chooses to do.

We now have two kids, currently four and two. Since they arrived, I've always taken care of them on rehearsal nights. I go with her on the weekends away, bring the kids to her for nursing, and otherwise find ways to keep busy with them. It isn't easy, but it's fine.

Having two young kids in general is hard work for both of us. A year or so ago, I said that since she was taking one night a week off for herself, I should get one too. She agreed, and now I go out to do some activities I enjoy (gym climbing and poker) one evening per week.

This arrangement is fine with me. I thought it was fine with her. Recently, though, I noticed some body-language resentment. When I asked, she said that she kind of felt it was unfair that I got to have "personal time" each week to do things just for myself when she didn't. I was confused, and said I thought of her rehearsals as her personal time. She said that they did not really count as personal time because she had made a commitment to her group and, although she did not say this part, lately has not been enjoying it so much.

I think that if she chooses to spend her time with her quartet, that's great, that's her choice, that's her personal time. If she doesn't want to do it anymore, she can and should quit; other members have quit in the past, there is nothing forcing her to continue. We've agreed to disagree about this.

Her position seems absurd to me. What am I missing?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I suppose I could say, "Her quartet is her personal time," blam, and be done with it -- I want a curly white wig -- but if she needs some relaxation time, then she does. That makes sense, doesn't it? You can understand how her hobby isn't relaxing?

And maybe she isn't ready to let the quartet go -- those two things don't seem mutually exclusive to me, loving to sing and not loving the organizational headaches.

So why not two blocks of discretionary time each. Doable? Maybe get paid care for one of them, so you both get a break and it's not always paid for with the other's energy reserves. It doesn't always have to be expensive. We used community-center drop-in care for a while, for example. We had to stay on site but there was a fitness room and a pool, good enough.

Anyway -- I love the phrase "body-language resentment." And good job picking up on it and talking about it. But don't get so caught up in keeping perfect score that you don't prioritize finding ways to give each other what you need.

This morning's column
Guest Sep 19, 12:53 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, I was surprised at your answer to the expecting mother who is opposed to naming the baby for her MIL who detested her and said so to her. Why not counsel honesty? LW stated she didn't want to burden her husband with the truth. While his mother was dying that might have made sense, but it doesn't now.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Funny thing about that. I would have counseled honesty at the very beginning. That was the missed opportunity. Mistake, I'd say, now that we're talking about it. But that was not and is not a useful opinion at this point.

Maybe you're right that the truth wouldn't be a burden now, but I see your certainty as a failure of imagination. To some grieving children, this could be the exact worst time to be handed an ugly truth about Mother -- sainted, sainted Mother.

You see my point. (Everywhere you turn, perhaps.)

Without knowing the situation LW had to work with, there really wasn't a way to know what was informing the decision to let the mother's nasty back-channeling die with her. But I could definitely see a version of events that would make LW decide now wasn't the optimum time to drop this truth. Ergo, advice to support LW in that assessment.

Food Fight
Guest Sep 19, 1:10 p.m.
QUESTION: During COVID, I became the de facto cook in my household (it's just my husband and me). That included all the shopping, paying for groceries, cooking, and about half the time cleaning up. At the time, my husband's job was more time-consuming/demanding/stressful than mine, so I understood and did not resent taking on the chore. But, over time, I became burnt out. I also started a GLP-1 medication and my appetite is seriously reduced. (Most nights I could have a bowl of cereal or a smoothie for dinner and be satisfied.) I went from full-time telework to five days in the office.

I continue to purchase groceries, which involves some degree of meal planning, and cooking dinner occasionally. But some nights I get home from work and I just don't want to cook. I can tell this irritates my husband a bit and then, rather than cooking the food we already have in the fridge, he will order delivery. Then I wind up feeling obligated to cook the next night otherwise the groceries will go to waste.

Am I being unreasonable? I know I can't force him to cook. Should I just buy fewer groceries every week, knowing that if I'm not up to cooking, he's going to order out?

FWIW, and I swear I'm not saying this to count my chits, I also do all the cleaning, laundry, trash taking-out, and more than half of the dog care -- most of which I enjoy, but still. Do we just need a bigger conversation about household chores?

ANSWER: "Do we just need a bigger conversation about household chores?"

👆️

And about life changes. It's bigger than chores at this point. You're not eating as much and you're at the office -- why are you still shopping like nothing has changed? And asking me whether to stop?

This letter makes a great body-language bookend to the quartet story. You're reading the irritation, too ... and then "I wind up feeling obligated to cook the next night"? That's a whole nonverbal sequence. Interrupt it verbally with your spouse: "I'm reading irritation in your body language. Since I'm not even hungry for dinner these days, and I'm back at the office, I think our division of labor is stuck in the pandemic and it's not working for either of us. Let's talk this weekend to make some new plans. Sound good?"

Re: nights to ourselves
Guest Sep 19, 1:24 p.m.
QUESTION: I think one thing that’s missed in Carolyn’s response is: the parents should discuss and agree on how many nights they want to spend together as a family, and how many are ok with just kids + mom or dad or childcare. I know in my own family (two parents working full time, a 5yo, a 3yo, and a baby due later this year), I would have trouble supporting more than one night per week of solo-parenting, because I think our very limited time together as a family is so important. Other families will have other comfort levels. But it may be that, after agreeing how many nights per week they are ok solo parenting, there may not be enough time for the wife to have her weekly practice AND another weekly night to herself AND fulfill her family quota. Maybe she does the weekly rehearsals and then one me-night every other week, or whatever else works. But maybe THAT conversation is the one that gets her to rethink spending one night per week that she doesn’t really enjoy. The biggest issue is that when you’ve got young kids, there never ever feels like there’s enough time to do all of the things you wish you could, so you have to prioritize.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: It doesn't have to be nights. Weekend mornings, for example, were a natural break time Back in the Day. Sign the kids up for X, and one parent takes them there and the other one has ahhh time. If the family schedule is packed, then the parents trade off that Saturday breather. Saw this all the time.

There was something else we used to talk about and I put it in the column too, though it's been a while? Each parent in a co-parent situation feels like they're doing 75 percent or more -- it never feels like just half. That's when you know you're pulling your weight.

Point being, it's important to remain mindful of the value and exhaustion in what the other is doing, too. If you start getting possessive of time and accusatory with each other, danger.

How to manage annoyance with good neighbor
Guest Sep 19, 1:40 p.m.
QUESTION: Can you help me with some mantras or perspective for dealing with a neighbor who I engage with a lot and who regularly frustrates me? We live very close and our young children are friends and we naturally deal with each other a lot. I think she’s a good person but our styles are very, very different and I find it hard to organize things with her. I will acknowledge that I am on the more organized side and work as a corporate lawyer. She is a former teacher and clearly is more of a person who jumps in and does things on the fly.

That’s fine, but it’s very frustrating when I’m trying to handle logistics with her. For example, she asked if we could pet sit and I agreed. But then she didn’t offer a walk through so I had to ask for one. I then suggested a time and she agreed but then was not around. We worked it out but it’s an example of how I feel like I spend 3x the time and mental bandwidth on any logistics she’s involved in!

To reiterate, she is a good person and an excellent neighbor and has a lot of great qualities that I have not stated here. But on this particular issue, she’s obviously not going to change so I just need some help changing my mindset!

ANSWER: Oh this super bugs me.

The correct answer to your attention to something he finds important is gratitude. Or just not freaking crabbing about it to you after you do this for him.

When he crabs that it's not good enough, think of the message -- you have to look like you aren't tired, depleted, erased? It's not good enough that you're doing it for him, you have to pretend you're doing it for you? OHHH, it's terrible you have to pretend? You should be doing it for you? Okay!! So basically you can't win. You can't have an honest feeling. You can't be tired. You can't fake it, either. You have to give him the thing but not look like you're giving him the thing.

This is really crappy and not okay, and all I can do is hope that if he thought about it for a moment, he would agree that it's a crappy and not okay thing to do to you.

Yes, I'm sure you wish, too, that you had the energy to want it. It's not like this is your first choice of feelings.

Now -- I have sympathy for him and for anyone who doesn't think their partner is attracted to them, or with a strong sex drive whose partner's drive isn't there. Difficult stuff. But think of the limited menu that hands them: They can be told they're outta luck!! That right there. Or they can talk about opening the relationship, they can cheat? A lot of not great options. or ...

Their partner can make an effort to push past the low sex drive, understanding that's a part of a long-term monogamous relationship. That it's a mutual effort to meet each other's needs, with love and respect.

That's what you're doing. I wish I could beam thoughts into your husband's head that complaining about "good" because it isn't perfect is not a great look. Everyone is taking something from you, and he's whining that he's not getting enough.

That's all rant, no advice.

Condensed version is the advice: Tell him you would love to feel like your freer self. Currently, you are this self -- offering herself to him out of love. To be criticized for that is not setting a mood.

How to manage annoyance
Guest Sep 19, 2:14 p.m.
QUESTION: It might also help if you don’t attribute your differences to your professions, or former professions, but just focus on a solution that works for you both (speaking as a former lawyer and a former English grad student/teacher, who saw examples of organization and disorganization in both professions). Stereotyping doesn’t help anything.

ANSWER: Find your people, and let them help you when you need it. I don't know if there are more of us who want you to be safe and happy and yourself than there are people using you to score political points. But if you can find them, then that can be a refuge from where the "world" is online and anonymous and shouty. It will be something people want to do for you, if I can presume to speak for others. Even if none of you ever says a word about it and the deal is just to allow you to live in peace.

I am sorry you have to think about this. It's not right.

Re: marriage

QUESTION: I dunno - if I found out my partner was only having sex with me because I wanted it, and not because THEY did...no shower is hot enough for that realization. I get wanting it, I truly do, but...that feels like a much bigger issue.

ANSWER: It could be, but not necessarily. Esp over a long marriage, mismatches in drives are almost guaranteed -- and if they both want monogamy, then there's going to be some degree of welp-okay. Is it for the other person, or is it for the marriage? Or -- is it so bad that it's for the other person? Or, maybe the lower-drive person wouldn't initiate, but, welp, okay!

Having a fixed idea of how you'd handle "that realization" is the enemy of figuring it out.

Response to Marriage question
Guest Sep 19, 2:39 p.m.
QUESTION: I was just listening to a sexual health expert who said heterosexual couples are nearly always mismatched, and that it is the responsibility of the higher-drive person to take care of their own needs by themselves. The lower-drive person is the one who sets the pace for joint activity.

ANSWER: Sure, because you extend that out -- and you get to a point of the lower-drive person having sex they don't want? Yikes.

But short of that extreme, it is valid for the lower-drive person to see the life trajectory their partner is on, and make an effort to address the low drive, if possible.

For trans person
Guest Sep 19, 2:42 p.m.
QUESTION: I want you to be safe and happy and yourself! I'm sorry the world is scary for you. But I'll be thinking of you, and doing my best to let other people closer to home know that I'm a safe place for them. I hope others do the same for you.

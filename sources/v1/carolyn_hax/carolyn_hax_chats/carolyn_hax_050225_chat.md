Summer with Nephew...
Guest May 2, 11:03 a.m.
QUESTION: My sister (single mom if that matters) is having a challenging time with her 15yo son and asked if he can spend 8 weeks with us this summer for "change of pace." We have two teenage daughters and they are excited at the prospect of his coming. My husband and I asked to talk about expectations - contribution to household chores, cleaning up after one's self in the kitchen, do own laundry, and he needs a job or volunteer thing or participate in a sport. We have these expectations of our own kids. Nothing different. He's not welcome to scroll through social media for 8 weeks on our couch. My sister was indignant saying that of course her son would help out and of course he'd clean up after himself and that we are expecting the worse in her son and if we aren't going to support them, then why even bother? I really want to provide her a break and her son an opportunity to be some place new, but I know myself and I don't do well with kids just laying about all summer. I also know my nephew right now is disrespectful to my sister leaving messes all over the house, routinely skipping school, and doesn't contribute to the household at all. Our girls work at our local pool and we can probably get nephew the check-in desk job for a few hours a week and maybe a local rec summer baseball team could take him on, but it all requires planning. Ideas for how to re-engage my sister again? - so that she can hear we are trying to support her and our nephew but not at the expense of our sanity?

ANSWER: You've said what you need to say about your rules. If you mean to follow through with hosting your nephew, then this is one of those things best not over-talked. Say to her that you weren't "expecting the worst" -- or the best! -- or expecting anything. You were just spelling out *your* expectations to preempt any misunderstandings. Your basic abundance of caution. So now if he and she are on board, great, then you'll start the arrangements, "let me know."

The more you say, the more you validate the idea that you're worried about him and the the deeper you dig the hole.

Dog with cancer
Guest May 2, 11:18 a.m.
QUESTION: I read last week’s chat after the fact, but I feel compelled to comment on the person whose dog has cancer and the vet bills are pushing them to the brink. A lot of people suggested ways to pay for the dog’s care. If the OP can find a way to do that that doesn’t cause them irreparable financial harm, great. But I’d also like to give the family permission to say a kind, humane goodbye if they need to, without guilt. For every “my dog was cured and lived to 16!” story I’ve heard, I’ve heard three “we went into debt and got 3 not-great months and watched the dog suffer” stories. I have said goodbye to many, many dogs in my life—some when they were way too young to die. All of them were gut-wrenching and I sobbed for days, sometimes weeks. But every dog who has left me has also opened the door for another dog to come into my life. And that new dog helps to heal me, and because I always get rescues, I hope I’m helping to heal them, too.

ANSWER: Yes, thanks for bringing this back up. I meant to get back to it but got chat tired and never finished the thought. It is a completely defensible position -- for the family and the animal, not just the finances -- to choose not to subject a pet to extensive medical intervention in the face of a dire prognosis.

We decided upfront for our pets, for example, that for a cancer, we'd do surgery if that was an option but not a bunch of cycles of chemo, because making a dog sick over and over without being able to explain what it is and why was not something we had the stomach to do. Other pet parents and their vets might go a different way for different reasons, no judgment, but that was a part of our pre-adoption conversation.

Dogs and cats have short lives relative to humans, too, so it's fair to factor that into the calculation of suffering in treatment for lifespan gained.

The more comfortable we get with having conversations like this toward humane and compassionate outcomes, the better, IMO -- about pets and people. Thanks again.

My daughter wants me to be more excited about her wedding
Guest May 2, 11:24 a.m.
QUESTION: I accidentally hurt my daughter’s (“Lisa”) feelings and I want to make amends. Lisa is 24 and just got engaged. Personally, I think she’s a little young to settle down but since I had her at 21, I’m not one to talk. And I like her fiance, “John” a lot and do think they’re a great couple so it’s all good. On Easter Sunday Lisa announced to the whole family that she and John were getting married in 2026 and told the story of the elaborate proposal he’d arranged. Later my sister asked me why I wasn’t more surprised and emotional and I said that they’d been discussing marriage for months and ring shopping so there was nothing surprising about it. Lisa later told me she was devastated that I down-played the very romantic proposal John had arranged for her and wished she had a “normal” mom who would be as excited as she was. I apologized but Lisa still seemed upset. Last night we talked it out and she asked me to be excited about her wedding and behave like a “real” mother-of-the bride. It’s true that I’m pretty laid back about these sorts of things, probably because I’ve never been married or even interested in getting married. I love Lisa so much and am sorry she thinks I carped on her big announcement. I'm giving them almost half the money they need for the wedding but otherwise I’m not sure I can fake an 18-month interest in wedding details. What should I do?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I think this is a fascinating question.

Which means Lisa would probably wish I would behave like a "real" advice columnist and tell you to rally around your daughter.

Which of course I do advise, but you're only going to be able to do this well, credibly, in a way that is true. And while there's always some Lycra in that -- we can always find something new to learn about others and ourselves -- you're still you and you're never going to thrill at the idea of mother-daughter facials. (Or are you? Who knows.)

So I think the first thing you have to do is go back to Lisa to say you love her, genuinely 100 percent are there for her, and 100 percent want what is best for her in life. And you think John is great and great for her. Say you never want her questioning these things. [This is where you wait for her to nod or something.]

Then you point out that you can only be who you are. Which means if she wants a mother who is genuinely swept up in a lot of the wedding details, then you are going to disappoint her -- possibly many times over by the time the I-dos are all-dones. Which is exactly the last thing you want to do!! Truly. Tell her it breaks your heart that you let her down already. [Pause again for evidence of daughterly absorption.]

Then the message: So here is what you are proposing:

You will love her and love how excited she is about this and pay amply for it and, where it counts most, rally to be the mom she wishes you were.

And in return, you will ask her to behold you, the mother-of-the-bride she actually has, and find it in her heart to see you as "real."

(Also maybe note that if she zeroes in on a few top priorities for her Real Mother of the Bride to rally for, then this will set you up for success.)

Security person here on Tracking Stalker
Guest May 2, 11:38 a.m.
QUESTION: 1. OP should do a thorough review of all their computers and devices to ensure that THEIR devices haven't been compromised in some way.
2. They should also change all their passwords, ensure multifactor authentication is on for their email and all accounts possible.
3. They should also review the privacy settings and connections on social media to ensure their information isn't publicly available and isn't leaking to the tracking stalker through a shared connection.
4. They should document this most recent encounter.
5. If there is any further contact they should clearly tell the tracking stalker clearly and simply that the stalker's contact is not welcome or wanted and they are to stop making contact. That encounter should also be documented.
6. If the stalker continues to contact the OP, they should document it regularly, contact the police and look at other physical security measures like self-defense courses.

They boyfriend can/should do all this too but at this point the OP's focus needs to be on themselves and the tracking stalker is after them as well.

Take this seriously, read De Becker's Gift of Fear, take action. Do hesitate. Do not rely on "orders of protection". Assume this person is armed, dangerous, unpredictable and will take violent action.

Advice Columnist
ANSWER: This is in reference to last week's chat. I saw it only on a trip through the outtakes. I was not as concerned about the possibility of other access because OP mentioned the ex had access to the date's text messages, ergo the phone number. However, 1-2 is just good hygiene anyway, 3-4 is sensible after a weird encounter, and 5-6 apply to anyone who crosses a line more than once. I'm happy to post it.

Preemptive comment: A lot of people respond by seeing these as overreactions, but if you read carefully it's preparing, assuming, reading, documenting. I.e. not being the one who is surprised if it's the rare worst case.

Mental Load Backfire
Guest May 2, 11:50 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, I wrote a question about this to you a couple of months ago when it first erupted, but I don't think it ever ran. I'll try to summarize the background as quickly as possible to get to the awful new update.

Background: Husband and I both work full time, but I usually do 99% of the administrative stuff for my household, like lots of moms. Summer camp/activity planning has always been my domain until last year, when I got super fed up with it and my husband agreed to take it on for 2025. He disregarded all of my tips about timing, ignored the emails I forwarded with the kids' favorite places and their deadlines, and we ended up with 0 weeks scheduled for each one (later updated to 2 weeks of a crappy backup place that my husband's brother recommended). My husband knew he blew it and agreed that he would be in charge of keeping the kids occupied during 75% of work hours over the summer (I agreed to cover the rest). The kids, to provide all needed info, are 9 and 7. They can play together for a while but do need supervision and need help with food. Not the most fun summer for them, but doable because we both telework.

Okay that brings us to now. My husband's work abruptly called everybody back into the office effective June 1. I still telework. This means that even though we had agreed my husband would take on the primary responsibility for the kids, it's actually ALL GOING TO FALL TO ME. Our family focus right now is on my husband's frustration about the big change at work, but I am quietly seething with rage because I would have just booked the camps myself if I had known I would spend all summer being interrupted for snacks and noises. I am so mad I can hardly start thinking my way to solutions. Is there anything I can do to salvage the fairness of the arrangement?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Ooh, I remember this one -- it was in my queue to answer but I never got to it. And I have to tell you, just reading it gave me a somatic stress response. Then and now, with the update.

It's not just the camp fail. It's the underreaction to the fail and what it means. Saying the equivalent of, "My bad, I'll be in charge of keeping the kids occupied 75 percent," is not enough.

This, to me, is what enough would have looked like:

"You were trying to make a point by handing this to me, not only that you are overwhelmed but that I completely take it for granted that you will handle all the intricate details of our family's management. You do it seamlessly and I just let you.

"So the one time you make it clear you've had enough, you hand one responsibility over to me -- and not only that, you spoon feed it to me, with all the instructions and warnings and necessary links and emails and secret codes. And what do I do?

"I totally ignore it. And trash our kids' summer -- and yours -- because I can't be even minimally arsed.

"So. Obviously I am on the hook for their care this summer. That goes without saying. It will be only to the extent I can, of course, with my job, and I will need your help, but I will be the Mental Load Boss of their care. That's what I'm saying. This summer and ever after too. Because I get it now.

"More important, though, I am telling you -- I get it now. I have been a complete barnacle on this ship that you have been running singlehandedly for years. And there is no excuse for that. That injustice ends now."

Right?

So the fact that your household is now focused on his RTO feelings and not on your "enjoy getting that 75 percent child-care back!" feelings, and your rage is "quiet-seethe," is proof there's a way bigger problem than his biffing camp deadlines.

Fairness can be salvaged only if he can grasp fairness. Can he? Can he? (Said like Cam in "Modern Family.")

BTW -- if any camps are available still, at outrageous late signup cost, then perhaps there's something of his he can give up to finance them. That too would be fair.

Summer nephew
Guest May 2, 11:57 a.m.
QUESTION: At that age, nephew should be included in conversations about expectations, not just his mom/OP's sister. He might not want to stay at aunt/uncle/cousins home. And forcing a teen to spend the summer away from home when he doesn't want to, that's not going to help whatever "having a hard time" is about.
Also, OP might rethink the job thing. Certainly, chores around the house. But depending on what "having a hard time" has been, this might be a chance for nephew to decompress and have a [mostly] unencumbered time to get his well-being together. I was the same as OP - insisting my kids have a "productive" summer vacation. My pushiness got me a kid in the hospital because I missed that they needed to decompress. Just my 2 cents.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Well spent, thanks. The "include the nephew" part is the real value, because the job could be the best thing or the worst, depending. Maybe he needs to have a reponsibility -- or be relieved of any for a bit. It's hard for us to say what his stressors are.

I will note the job the OP referred to was quite small, "few hours" I think?

QUESTION: Not that you asked, but a good thing to do is also discuss with your spouse what plans *YOU* both have if those expectations are not met with your nephew. We had an exchange student that repeatedly failed to meet basic expectations of cleanliness and I thought I was prepared, but honestly, we didn't have anything to back up those expectations. Will you send your nephew home early? Will there be other consequences? It's good to chat.

I don't want my friends to go to ex's wedding
Guest May 2, 12:05 p.m.
QUESTION: My ex is getting married this summer. I know this because we have a number of shared friends, though I am closer to them than he is. (He is a very social person with a wide field of shallow friendships.) We were together for seven years spanning our late twenties and early thirties, and our breakup (2022) was lifechanging for me, a truly awful experience. A couple of friends have asked whether I am comfortable with them going to his wedding (they don't otherwise see or talk to him very often, but he apparently invited every person he's ever met). I know the right answer is to say of course they can go, continue to live my own life and worry less in general about what's going on in his, but I actually feel very sad, mad, and anxious about it. It's not ok for me to say no, is it?

Summer with Nephew
Guest May 2, 12:14 p.m.
QUESTION: I wanted to reply to the letter about the summer with the nephew. In my experience, kids treat their own parents worse than they treat other people. We had a nephew stay with us when his parents were at the end of their rope with him, and he was like a different kid - polite, helpful and happy to be there. And he has great parents - he was just at that age where they were butting heads! Assuming he wants to come and isn't forced to, I think you just talk to him about how things run at your house and tell him you thought it would be fun to work a few hours at the pool with your daughters as a way to be around people and make some spending money. I think if you engage with him instead of your sister, you'll be surprised at how well it goes. Fingers crossed for a great summer!

For not wanting friends to go to ex's wedding
Guest May 2, 12:22 p.m.
QUESTION: We asked our sibling if they were OK if we did the same thing (attend their ex's wedding) - sibling wasn't even married to ex. Just boyfriend/girlfriend in separate residences for 3 yrs. Sibling said "Sure, it's not my preference, but I can't stop you and I think I'll be OK afterwards". Sibling was definitely NOT ok. That was the catalyst for 2 major family eruptions and now we haven't spoken in 15 years, and all of it traces back to us attending that wedding WITH sibling's knowledge and "permission". Don't be that person. If you say you are OK with them going (which in all honesty IS the only right answer, you don't get to tell them what to do with their lives) then mean it. You cannot hold it over their heads after the fact.

excited daughter, mom not so much
Guest May 2, 12:22 p.m.
QUESTION: I was that mom as well. Although happy for her and her choice of life partner, I didn't jump up and down and do cartwheels--that's just not me. And then my kid took exception to everything I said or did, even slight facial movements or tone of my voice she deemed something negative when she was planning her wedding. So I stayed neutral and in the background, and when asked for my opinion would give it, but not otherwise. Husband and I decided to give them a gift of cash they could use whatever way they chose (wedding, trip, whatever), and I would stay the heck out of my daughter's way. And darn it if that didn't work out just fine for all of us. Weddings can have weird effects on people. Deep breaths and it's their upset, not yours.

Help, I need to fire my parents
Guest May 2, 12:33 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn,

We've had terrible luck with daycares and ended up without coverage for my 20-month-old daughter, so I was thrilled when my parents agreed to care for her during the workday. They are actually not quite retired, but they each only work part-time and completely from home, so they made the case that they could alternate shifts. Seemed great.

Several weeks into the arrangement, we have come to understand that they are basically plopping her in front of the TV all day, with occasional breaks for meals and errands. This is not what we discussed. We are a no-screens-until-age-2 family, which they know, but of course I understand that you take what you get with free family babysitters. However, I think the hours upon hours of TV are way past the acceptable threshold for a toddler. I asked them to please reduce (not stop!) the TV watching and try to steer her toward play and activities, but there has been no change over the past two weeks—she's still just watching TV, enough that it pervades all of her chatter and she fusses when we won't let her do the same at home.

I don't feel I've been left a choice but to pull her from Grandcare, but I dread the hurt feelings this will cause (and the impact to our wallets). Go for it anyway?

QUESTION: It would be so lovely if the husband so beautifully understood and followed through.
Absent that, what does OP do? Are acceptance and resignation vs Divorce the only choices?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I think there are a lot of in-between steps, all geared toward that overdue aha moment -- certainly a few that involve couples counseling.

I also think the "acceptance and resignation" side can include some bargains with reality that push it more toward a fair deal of some kind, just not the fairness we're talking about (50-50 domestic labor split). The carriers of 99 percent can extract 99 percent of something else of value in return, especially after the kids start to launch -- they get to choose where the couple retires, for example, or get to pursue a "dream" career later in life.

Actually, a version of this alternative bargain happens all the time -- the parent who does most of the work has most of the relationship with the kids. It doesn't always work out that way, but that is one of the known outcomes.

But it's super fraught. If the one doing less is actively shirking the responsibility, and also earns more, then the one carrying the domestic weight can get unceremoniously dumped into a bad financial situation as soon as their housework and childrearing services aren't needed.

So, better option is to keep talking and documenting toward that beautiful moment of understanding and follow through. If there is zero progress and acceptance is out, then, divorce.

For ‘mental load backfire’
Guest May 2, 12:39 p.m.
QUESTION: It seems your husband needs to find a caregiver for the kids for 75% of the summer. For kids aged 7 and 9, a college student or older high school student (especially if driving is critical where you live) is perfect: young, cool, probably have some fun ideas. Hubs needs to get on care.com, every neighborhood parenting social media group he can find, ping his parent-friend networks. With all of the money saved in camps, this should be do-able. For any gaps, I guess he’ll have to take personal time, or maybe trade time with other parents? This IS NOT the wife’s problem. She can HELP, but she shouldn’t need to SOLVE.

QUESTION: When I was getting married, I felt some disappointment over the fact that my mom couldn't be as involved in wedding planning as I would have liked because I live 800 miles from her.

She acknowledged that the distance was challenging and asked what I really wanted to do together (go dress shopping) and also if there were any wedding chores she could help with by phone (yes, please call the photographers on this list and tell us who is nicest!)

Maybe make that part of your conversation with your daughter, at the end of the script Carolyn suggested: "Are there specific things you would really like me to be part of during the planning process? What do you want me to prioritize?"

excited daughter, mom not so much
Guest May 2, 12:50 p.m.
QUESTION: My mom was not excited when I told her I was getting married (Her exact response: "I thought you were going to grad school!" (I did go to grad school. AND I got married.) After a few months, she continued to not be excited, so I just starting making wedding plans myself. At which point, my dad took me aside and told me it was hurting mom's feelings not to be included. (Mental table flip) So I think it took a taste of not being included to change her mind. And while she never was the most enthusiastic participant (all my stress dreams were about her not getting around to doing her stuff), she did make all the bridesmaids' dresses and my veil, so she did make it clear that she loved me, even if she didn't love the wedding planning.

ANSWER: 1. This is such a good story of how people can love you but be so complicated and difficult and knotted up about showing it -- thank you. (And I'm sorry.)

2. Are you sure she "change[d] her mind"? Seems possible at least that she felt the same way all along (loved you, wanted to be included) but all along was hopeless about expressing it.

Maybe your dad understood that about her, gave her time to try to figure it out for herself, then had the presence of mind to step in.

RE: Mom & Grasp of Reality Again
Guest May 2, 12:56 p.m.
QUESTION: It's not new-there's been some version of this going on for at least 20 years. What it's been focused on and the specific outlet for it has been different over time and seems to shift with changes in my life circumstances (college, moving out of state, getting married, having kids), but I'd say it's overall not new or worsening. I do take your point though regarding the doctor and full workup: I have asked her to get checked out or see a psychiatrist and generally the retort is that I should see one (maybe I should, but I don't think it's a reasonable response). I guess I will just try harder to get through to her on seeing a doctor? In the meantime I find myself searching for what I did wrong to provoke this, and somewhere I know that's not what this is about but I can't help but feeling bad about it.

ANSWER: (This is in response to last week.)

Please know everywhere that you did nothing to provoke this.

And no, I would not encourage you to try hard to get through to her. It's time for you to take care of you. Not a psychiatrist, though -- a psychologist. Please talk to someone about your experience with your mother. What you describe in these two posts suggests you have been subjected to a lifetime of her gaslighting and emotional abuse.

ANSWER: Fair point. A kneecap-me-twice situation.

Also? While the goal of his Actually Getting It (tm) remains in force, the intermediate goal of figuring out what the husband can be counted on to contribute reliably is completely reasonable. People are better at doing what they are better at, care about most, or hate doing less. We're just like that.

And while there are all kinds of things wrong with giving the worst jobs to the people who are selfless about getting things done, being a purist is a great way to stay stuck. Find out what he cares about most (or gets most annoyed at having undone, like an unstocked pantry or uncut grass) and there you go, that's his full responsibility now.

Seat at the Table - Follow-UP
Guest May 2, 1:09 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi - I'm the DIL in the seat at the table question. Thanks for the advice and for the reader re sponses.

What did you mean by, "FWIW: Drawing the hard line when the in-laws visit was totally within your rights to do, but you inadvertently stepped into a power struggle with them that you didn't need to have."

How did I not need to have this? If you were me you would have invited them for dinner and then been okay with everyone sitting everywhere for the next 30yrs? Or just avoided inviting them for a meal ever? That wasn't going to be possible. We invited them. I served dinner at the table and both FIL and MIL got up and sat in the living room and asked for TV trays (which we don't own for no specific reason - just don't have them).

We both asked if we could all sit at the table and FIL said no, he wasn't a kid, and I couldn't force him. So, we carried our plates to living room and watched TV as we ate.

We just haven't invited them back for a meal.

And the readers are too kind - there is no reason why they can't sit at a table. They go to friends' houses and business associates and sit at their tables. This no-table eating is what they do at their house and their other two sons families houses. I think they feel judged that we won't do it, too. FIL is definitely one who takes his role as "head of the family" seriously. In many ways, his feelings are most important.

ANSWER: So, hi! Thanks for writing back. This is a useful follow up.

He sounds deeply emotionally stunted. In a manner, in fact, to which we're all becoming a little too well acquainted these days.

The answer to your question is, yes, sort of -- I would have been "okay" with *their* sitting everyhere, letting them be weird for the next 30 years. You say, "So, we carried our plates to living room and watched TV as we ate," and that's where we differ. I would have let them go sit alone, then and forever. Their choice. We'd be at the table. My house, you see.

And for future meals, yeah, the menu would get super simple and I wouldn't be the one cooking -- and I and my spouse and whoever else was there would eat at the table. The invitations to dinner would also drop in frequency, sure. But not to zero if zero gave them the satisfaction of being able to complain to their friends about me.

I'm just saying my method would be to concede as little as possible and add as little fuel as possible and exert as little effort as possible. And to show as little irritation as possible, with this as my general unspoken messaging:

If you lunatics think this is your big dramatic power play, then go ahead and eat your reheated frozen cocktail weenies in front of the TV and gloat, congratu-freakin-lations. The grownups will be in here. [tight smile]

It's not for everyone, but it's a way of opting out of an overt power struggle by identifying and claiming all winnable turf in advance.

"better at doing what they are better at"
Guest May 2, 1:14 p.m.
QUESTION: No one is better at the "skill" of waking up at 6 am to refresh the browser until a summer camp slot is confirmed, then plunking down $500. There are just people who know it needs to get done and others who are insulated from that knowledge.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Of course. Please refer to my original answer.

But the conversation has moved to the, "What now -- divorce?" stage of the conversation. And for that, there are two unpleasant options: Yes, and not yet.

In the "not yet" space, there can be weeks and weeks of getting by while trying to get your exact message across.

So how are those weeks going to be spent -- more exhaustion while carrying 99 percent of the load? Or trying to rebalance the load in a way that has a better chance of being successful than the camp debacle?

That's what I was talking about.

Thank you very much.

Re: Mental Load Backfire

QUESTION: I would be LIVID.

I showed my husband that comic strip visualizing the mental load. He was hurt that I felt that way, but reflected on it and came back to me saying he was fully taking on A, B, and C and I could take them off my mental list. He's been true to his word and it's been huge.

My co-worker told me that my husband's reaction when I showed him the comic strip, compared to her husband's, is why she is divorced and I am not. I encourage your husband to reflect on that.

Should we move to avoid daughter's stalker?
Guest May 2, 1:40 p.m.
QUESTION: I’m wondering if I’m going to have to move because my 21-year-old daughter is being relentlessly stalked by her ex-boyfriend/father of her baby. He was opposed to her continuing the pregnancy and got violently abusive when she decided to have it (e.g. he rammed her car with his truck when she was 5 months pregnant and drove her into a ditch). She got a restraining order against him and doesn’t want child support or anything from him but to leave her and the baby alone. That RO hasn’t stopped him from harassing us and stalking her. His father is on the police force so they do the bare minimum when we report the violations. We keep detailed logs of all his behavior, which ranged from trying to get into the hospital when she was in labor, endless harassing calls (she blocks his number but he keeps getting new ones), banging on our door all hours of the day and night, slashing her tires, vandalizing our home, following her car home from work, the latest was him trying to break into my daughter’s room in the middle of the night. Our dog went berserk and that scared him off but it looks like he’s never going to stop. Like always, we turned over the logs to the cops and they said (like every other time) “call us if he actually does anything to her.”
I talked to my sister who lives over 400 miles away and she thinks we should leave quickly and quietly, letting no one know where we’re going except my boss who is aware of the situation. She said we can stay with her until we find a new home and jobs there. This is such a drastic step - the cost of living there is much higher and if I quit I won’t be able to collect unemployment. We can live on my savings for a while but I’m worried about selling our house remotely, and what happens if it takes me and my daughter too long to find jobs. I’m an administrative assistant and would take excellent references with me and she’s an LPN who can work in any hospital or clinic but in this economy, who knows? We’ve lived in this town since my daughter was 4 months old; my husband is buried here but I don’t know what else to do. Neither of us can take this much longer. Is moving the right thing to do?

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Call 1-800-799-SAFE -- the National Domestic Violence Hotline. You concerns for your ability to support yourself are real and valid, and of course this is your home where you have ties. This is one of the many reasons the stalking is such a horror. It robs all of you of your agency, your peace of mind, your security, your home -- this is the power the ex is abusing.

But being right means squat if you-daughter-grand aren't alive. So talk to the hotline and get trained support asap to develop a plan to get your safety back in one form or another.

The police inaction is an outrage. The "actually does anything to her" is a false standard if he's committing property crimes and trespassing, which are more than enough -- I don't think one needs a law degree to 2 + 2 that one.

Chronic guilt pit
Guest May 2, 1:50 p.m.
QUESTION: I am crowd sourcing the group here: What is everyone doing about the guilt pit they swallowed that sits in the pit of their stomach like a weight? What, is that not normal? Just me?

I feel guilt for moving away from my family, I feel guilty for not calling my friend more, I feel guilty for not going on that jog, I feel guilty for not paying my babysitter more, I feel guilty for not taking on that extra project at work, I feel guilty for not being 'in-the-mood' more, I feel guilty for not putting more effort into my hair, I feel guilty for not enjoying the weather UGH

Any one thing I could fix relatively quickly, but it just is feeling like a game of whack-a-mole. Knock one thing out and there are just endless more guilt pits of varying sizes!
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: By whose life instructions are you living?

That's my main question.

I for one can't be part of your crowd to answer your "guilt pit" question because I don't have the pit. I am, though, upon quick inspection, just as "guilty" as you are -- moved away from my hometown (5.5-8 hour drive, depending on traffic); crappy, out-of-touch friend (too long a rap sheet to document here); chair jockey (👋); hair tragedy (attached).

But you know what? Who gives a shirt. I loved my parents, and they knew it. If I felt guilty for leaving, then I wouldn't have moved or would have moved back -- but I didn't because my reasons for leaving were better than my reasons for staying. Are yours? If they're not, then consider moving back. (This is a walk I walked -- moved back-ish 18 years after I moved away, when circumstances changed.) And if you can't, then you can't, and it's not up to you so no guilt. It really can be that simple.

I love my friends, and they know it, and they aren't great about calling me, either. They've got stuff to do.

Yes, I sit too much. Arrest me.

And what is not to love about the free time made available by this hair.

Again -- for whom are you living? Not you, currently. That's the issue. In order of appearance, you see yourself living in service of family, friends, societal standards, your employee, your employer, your partner, societal standards again, and you're at the mercy of the passage of time. Whew.

It feels like the most flippant, heartless advice ever to tell a well-meaning stressed out person, "You need to figure out who you are," but I suspect you are in fact suffering the accumulated effects of working hard at checking what you were told were the boxes of being a good person -- without having fully reckoned with who you really are and want to be. Or why anyone's opinion of you matters.

I hope I'm wrong and you're just flat out freaking exhausted. That works, too, since you're a working parent of young kid(s) with a partner and well that's way more than enough for one person's to-do list. But it's enough for a lot of people not to need any encouragement to say "erf my hair."

So that's the arcing wire -- who/what is saying you need nice hair and muscle tone and a perfect attendance award to matter? You don't. You matter as-is.

How to be positive for teen
Guest May 2, 1:57 p.m.
QUESTION: I’m having a hard time balancing my own negative feelings about the state of the U.S. and the world with trying to be a positive example for my teen. He is autistic and has depression and anxiety, and has become even more negative about everything with the new administration. I feel very negative myself and don’t know how to help my kid be more positive when I am not feeling it myself. I don’t stick my head in the sand or want us to be fake happy, but I also don’t want to think about negative stuff all the time. ALL he ever talks about is very negative stuff. He is seriously Debbie Downer. Yes, there’s a lot of awful stuff going on, and yes, feline aids is the number one killer of domestic cats, but I cannot focus on that constantly. He is in therapy and on medication, btw. As am I. I feel like I am failing him. How can I be real without projecting a feeling of hopelessness.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Yes, there are objectively bad things happening right now that contribute to a sense of negativity, and yes this feeling will be heavier for a teen with autism and for a parent of a teen with autism. I won't try to fake-happy you either.

I'm reading this, though, as I look out the window on one of the more dazzling May days I've ever seen.

And this part of it all is not fake: The backdrop of the things dragging you down is a big noisy complicated world that has nature, art, music, dance, food, literature, crafts, sports, movies ... and love, and family, and humor, and about a thousand things at any given time that can break your heart with their beauty.

So I don't know. Maybe it will feel "fake" to drag yourself outside to look at a beautiful thing, like a crescent moon or a cityscape or a museum exhibit. Or to put on music in your home that you can sing along to, if your son isn't noise-sensitive. Or to put a game on TV and start following a team he likes. Or to make yourselves get in the car to go to a store to buy the ingredients or materials for a meal or a project you can work on together. Or go to your local library to take advantage of the progamming, classes, materials there. Or start doing yoga with him every day.

But at some point, maybe 15 or 30 minutes in, it won't feel fake anymore. Or maybe if you make a habit of it, after a day or two the practice won't feel fake anymore, and the anticipation of your walk or meal or project or music or game time will start to feel genuine.

There is a whole lot of life out there, is what I'm saying, that was there before all this and will be there after, because that's how humanity works. We over focus sometimes and forget that. I mean -- you're probably upset in part because so many of these great things are getting squeezed right now, or threatened even, I get that. But if anything now is the time to go all in and live them to show what they mean to you. So give your humanity a kick. That's the mood lift. And that's the antidote to hopelessness.

Re: Mom and reality
Guest May 2, 1:59 p.m.
QUESTION: My mother blamed us for things that we didn't do (and for things that never actually happened).

My sisters and I used to "go beige," as we called it. We wouldn't challenge her or ignore her. If she said something like, "I was really offended that you went on vacation with your in-laws again, but you never have time for me," we would say, "Oh, we're sorry that you're feeling bad. Let's plan something fun we can do together." If the in-law trip never happened, we didn't address that. If she perseverated on the phone or in person, we wouldn't cut her off mid-sentence, but when she stopped for breath, we would say, "Well, you've given me something to think about, thanks. But I have to go now."

We never addressed (with her, but we did with our dad) that she needed psychiatric care, and we didn't get angry or defend ourselves.

Our mother still went into rages and made bizarre accusations, but we reminded ourselves that it had NOTHING to do with us, what we had done or done done--and that we couldn't fix it with discussions, reality, or even love.

Dementia Breaking Boundaries
Guest May 2, 2:05 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn. My father wrestled with mental health issues for most of his life that led him to be unstable and emotionally and verbally abusive. Over the past decade, I have constructed a set of boundaries that keeps him at arms length to protect myself and my young family. Recently, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, which explains why things have gotten worse over the past few years. I am trying to figure out what to do with my carefully constructed and maintained boundaries now. My brother says that our father needs us and that I need to be there with my dad, engage with him by phone and text, and just take his abuse and let it roll off me when it comes - chalking it up to the Alzheimer’s over which dad has no control. Since my father was abusive before the Alzheimer’s, I’m having a hard time giving him a free pass on his behavior even now and feel like we cannot really tell what behavior is good-ole-dad being horrible or the result of dementia. But perhaps I am ignorant and need some education about this new diagnosis and I am willing to learn. It also feels like the impact on me and my family is the same, regardless of the cause of the abusive behavior. Having my father send me texts where he calls me a good for nothing piece of garbage hurts today just as these actions hurt 5, 10, 20, and 40+ years ago. And I do not want my wife or three children (ages 11, 13, and 16) to be exposed to someone who thinks nothing of ruining a family dinner with yelling, swearing, and name calling because there is too much butter on the vegetables in his opinion. (True story.) I do not want to be a bad son, brother, or person. But I don’t know how to be a good son while also being a good husband and father and while also keeping my own mental health in tact - under these challenging circumstances. Do I re-engage with my abusive father in service to him knowing it puts me and my family at risk? Or do I keep my guards up, protect myself and my family, and let my father and brother down in this time of need? I can’t find the middle ground here - or even any stable ground from which to approach this problem. It seems like heartbreak all around no matter what I choose.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You do not "need" to "be" anywhere or do anything. You are in charge of yourself and you make your own decisions. Your brother has no right to order you around like that.

You may decide your father's care is a responsibility you want to share with your brother, or feel you owe him, or your own sense of decency. Fine. But that's your call, not his.

You may also decide to help out at arm's length, which is valid and fair. Finding him good care, helping to pay for it as you're able, or not. Protecting yourself and family.

Here is the Alzheimer's Association. It has a help line. Lean and learn.

I'm sorry you were so badly mistreated. Don't let him anywhere near your kids.

For chronic guilt put
Guest May 2, 2:08 p.m.
QUESTION: This may not apply to you at all, but it did to me - sometimes the things I felt guilty about, or the people I felt guilty about, I was actually angry with - but I turned the anger inward, because if it was something *I* did, then I was in control of it, and then I could fix it. It doesn’t apply to everything, of course, but it may be something to think about in some cases, and it’s sometimes a way to move beyond guilt and deal with what’s really bothering you - anything from unreasonable personal expectations to unfair personal expectations.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I think this is not only fair, but more common than we realize. Women especially are not "allowed" to be angry. i.e., commonly socialized away from it toward self-criticism and peacekeeping. I'd like to say this has gotten better, in that more Baby Boomer and Gen X women will identify with this than Millennial and down, but it's still pretty pervasive.

Psychiatry vs psychology
Guest May 2, 2:22 p.m.
QUESTION: Why do you recommend psychologists over psychiatrists? It is true that a lot of psychiatry residency programs focus on medication rather than psychotherapy.
But not all of them—and not the best ones. Psychiatrists can be excellent psychotherapists depending on their inclination and where they trained. I think I am that kind of psychiatrist. My medical background and my expertise in medications are in the background as I do psychotherapy to be called on to rule out somatic causes for psychic distress. Also, the meds background helps me to prescribe appropriately to decrease the patient’s pain and suffering.
How do you find a psychiatrist that does psychotherapy? You ask them if they do or if they farm it out to non-medical therapists. Non-medical therapists can be good at what they do.

How do you tell if a therapist/psychologist/psychiatrist is a good choice for you?
1.) the relationship feels, on a gut level, like a good fit.
2.) Problems are on the way to being solved by 4 months.
3.) The professional understands you—on a racial/gender and background level. They should be willing to accept that your background/problems are just as severe as you say. Though, in a reversal, they may be able to point out aspects of the patient’s problems that are worse than the patient feels they are.
4.) Always, always there should be respect and acceptance.

Carolyn Hax

ANSWER: This is great to add to the search criteria in the caregiver search, thanks.

I recommended that as a shortcut -- the searching process is arduous, and if someone is calling practices, a lot of psychiatry offices will focus on medication or illness management and say no to psychotherapy. Trying to spare somebody some calls.

This is a dangerous situation and the dept. needs to have a functional response to it, which they have yet to provide.

QUESTION: Re: the psychiatrist's comment: decades ago, when still on active duty in the Navy, I regularly saw a psychiatrist to get my depression RX renewed. Like all his predecessors, I called him Dr. Drone, beause at each appointment, they always asked the same questions ("Doing OK? Any thoughts of hurting yourself? Sleeping OK? Meds working?"). That guy retired. Got a new guy. This psychiatrist actually asked if I would be interested in talk therapy. Nonplussed, I demurred, and asked for time to think about it. Went home, asked my clinical psychologist husband what he thought. Husband's advice: "WHENEVER A PYSCHIATRIST OFFERS THERAPY, SAY YES!" I said yes, and greatly benefitted from the time I spent in his care. (Still taking meds, still OK.) :-)

ANSWER: Yes, the social work family is the go-to in most cases for talk therapy for a lot of reasons. In this case the mom's apparent mental illness pointed to a Venn diagram situation of a talk-therapy provider with a doctorate-level credential. I should have explained my reasoning (clearly), but that was a one-off. Also clearly (from the past 25-30 years) I do not get specific about credentials in most of my recs

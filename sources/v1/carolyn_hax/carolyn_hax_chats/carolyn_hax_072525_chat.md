grandparents I never knew trying to give me money I don't want
Guest Jul 25, 11:37 a.m.
QUESTION: A few years ago I went to a lot of trouble to find and meet my biological father. Knowing that he left my mom pregnant and threatened her and my grandparents with physical harm if they tried to find him, I prepared myself for the worst. I’m not sure why I even wanted to meet him. With the help of my grandparents, my mom turned her life around, gave me a great childhood and an awesome stepdad. I guess I was looking for some clarity on where I came from. It was so not worth it. There was a reason he dipped, and it didn’t have anything to do with me or my mom. He’s a terrible person who chose himself over his child and everyone else his whole life. Even after I prepared myself for the worst, the awful things he said to me still managed to hurt me. I wish the worst person I’ve ever met didn’t happen to contribute 50% of my DNA and I’ve tried my best to forget all about him. Recently his sister contacted me saying her parents (technically my grandparents though I never met them) made a lot of money from the sale of their farm (they're retiring and moving away) and want to give me some of it to compensate for what their son did because they were always ashamed of his actions. My aunt seems nice and they all seem to have good intentions but I put that man mentally in a locked box and taking this money will open that box back up. My aunt admitted that he knows about this money I’d be getting. I haven’t even been able to tell my mom and dad (that’s what I call my stepdad since he’s the only father I’ve ever known) any of this. Can I refuse this money or is that a slap in the face to two people (three if you count my aunt) who seem like they're trying to do the right thing? It’s a nice sum that would help pay off my student loans but that’s not worth possibly inviting my bio dad back into my life.

ANSWER: I 100 percent support a decision to keep your bio-dad out of the zone of peace you have created in your mind. If it means face-slapping 2 to 3 lovely people, then that is what you have to do.

However. I am not as certain as you are that is what you have to do.

If this couple were, for example, to put the money in a trust for you (or your heirs), and if you (or your heirs) were not to receive it until your bio-dad shuffled off this mortal coil -- or until you decided you were good and ready to use it -- then could the money sidestep him entirely on its way to serving the emotional needs of the decent?

Or they could give it to a cause meaningful to you. Or a person.

These are just on-the-fly examples. But it seems worth some thought, at least, to try to connect the well-intentioned people. Call it a rebuke to the person who did harm.

Or call it off, the moment the effort feels like it's costing to much. You can, like I said, refuse the money, and say why, and say it's not meant as a slap in their faces because they seem lovely. You are not beholden to them.

It's your call, but talking to your mom and dad might really help.

For today's single mom
Guest Jul 25, 11:44 a.m.
QUESTION: You're doing AMAZING - a full time job, 10-year old, maintaining a home, I'm impressed! I did it too, I was a single mom and I know how hard that ish is - and how much I felt like I just wasn't getting it all done.

When I met my now husband though, and explained to him that therapy was just too much and I couldn't do that and then immediately jump into handling the bedtime routine - do you know what he did? He offered to do school pick up to bedtime on those nights so that I could do my appointments and then take myself out for an hour (or read on a park bench) to decompress after. When I struggled during COVID and difficult work schedules? He offered to take turns doing at home school with my child (week on, week off style). He worked to make my life easier, more doable, more manageable - he even did dishes some nights at my house, tidied up when he was "babysitting" (although he would hate to hear me call it that).

In turn, my bandwidth expanded, and I help with stocking his parents freezer when we do elder care visits. I run errands for his parents, helped find them a caregiver, etc. Partners HELP each other. They work TOGETHER to make life manageable and to take on all of the things life throws their way because they're in it together. Someone is out there who will work with you on life, until then you're better off single. Best of luck, you're still doing absolutely amazing at all the things.

My alcoholic husband rejects AA
Guest Jul 25, 12:02 p.m.
QUESTION: After years of not saying anything about my husband's drinking, I finally asked him to go to AA. He says he doesn't believe in AA and that he doesn't have a problem. He did agree to go get marriage counseling however. Do you have an alternative to AA to suggest to him?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: He doesn't think he has a problem, so you will hit that wall regardless.

Glad he agreed to marriage counseling -- that is a great start. Have a look at SMART recovery, which has information for family and friends. And my resource page has other options -- which at this point are for you, but support for family is a legitimate start. There's Al-Anon, too, don't forget.

X is controlling our special-needs adult child.
Guest Jul 25, 12:04 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn, I read your column every morning :-)
Trying to be brief, I have a lovely daughter who is almost 30 and has mild intellectual disability, autism and anxiety. We struggle trying to find things for her to do, and her father (we are divorced for many years) gets angry about things that she wants to do if they are independent – he is paranoid about safety and will not let her use WheelTrans, he also gave her a big problem about taking vaccinations because he’s into right wing crap- and generally, I feel that he’s holding her back. We both have trouble with his anger, as he will shout on the phone and sometimes stop talking to her when she does something he doesn’t agree with, which is just awful -but because of the hassle he gives her for every new thing she tries to do, it makes life difficult and she has a lot of trouble standing up and saying what she needs and wants to him. When she tries to do so he talks over her and does not listen, and he thinks that I’m controlling her. I’ve been trying to prepare her for fighting these battles with him herself, but it’s hard for her, and I’m wondering if I should still be inserting myself to help her with him- but I feel that that is undermining my point that he should learn that she has her own mind and feelings, and he needs to start respecting that.
Also would love some tips on how to deal with his bullying behaviour on the phone towards both of us when he feels that we’re doing the wrong thing. Honestly, I don’t know why I let him get under my skin, but that shouting and abusive stuff affects me a lot as well. I feel so ashamed that I also still feel controlled by this man, who doesn’t do any of the hard work for our daughter anyway, and has no real vision for her other than keeping her in a little safe box. If I can’t stand him and hang the phone up on him when he gets difficult, how can I expect my daughter to?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Your daughter needs to hang up the phone, too, when her father is yelling and talking over her. "We can talk when you're calm." Tap.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Please go to a few sessions of counseling -- just you -- to learn some basic strategies for dealing with a bully, and to talk through the merits of advocating for your daughter vs allowing her to advocate for herself. Ideally you want a therapist who has relevant training and experience (the American Psychological Association refers to this accreditation) but that's not going to include a lot of clinicians. Maybe you have someone already?

Also, while you're there, talk about ways you can teach your daughter these strategies through role play, or adapt them for her.

You have no cause to feel ashamed. But it is time to get formal instruction on how to stand up for your daughter's needs against someone who is actively working against them. Take care.

Proud Dad
Guest Jul 25, 12:25 p.m.
QUESTION: My parents were just 17yo high school seniors when I was born. My mom and both sets of grandparents raised me. My dad was around for taking me to the rare movie or driving me to the library (b/c I always have loved books), but the man never made me dinner or picked me up at school or visited my teacher or took me to the doctor. I played competitive soccer and went to state for track and he never, ever attended one of my events. Not once. Whenever I post something on social media or whenever I am in my dad's presence and something positive comes up about me, he says, "Proud Dad" or "That's MY girl - all the hard work of parenting has paid off!" In restaurants, he'll stop the waiter to tell her that I'm in college and my GPA and she is a chip off the old man block. I have a hard enough time being around my dad but when he takes credit for something he had zero part in, it makes me want to punch him in the face. But, at the same time, saying anything to him would crush his fragile ego, which seems just mean. Help.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: It depends on what you say and how you say it, though, doesn't it?

"Dad, stop taking credit for something you had zero part in."

Ouf.

"Dad -- you're here now. You got off to a tough start but now you're here. That story has its own kind of courage, don't you think?"

Invite him to join you in this line of thinking as an alternative to getting defensive.

If he accepts, then: "We both know you missed a lot. Talking as if you didn't can't be making you feel better. It feels uncomfortable to me. I'd rather we build on what's true -- that I'm your kid, that you're here now, that we're both doing great. That's what I'm proud of."

If his ego can't take that, then that's on him. Plus, it's yours to say. You aren't comfortable. And it's your best chance to have a relationship going forward. Staying silently angry means you just keep tolerating him at best while building up resentment.

Boyfriend needs a project manager
Guest Jul 25, 12:26 p.m.
QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been living together for 14 months now. Previously, we’d both been living with our parents and now we’re having some disagreements about him not being proactive. Even though I lived at home, I took care of all my own stuff (cooking, cleaning, laundry) while his mom did most of that for him. He’s a claims adjuster so at work I know he can be proactive and work on his own. I have never criticized the way he does things so it’s not like he’s afraid of doing the wrong thing but I am still expected to give step-by-step instructions when it’s his turn to do things. For example, if when we're putting groceries away, I hand him the toothpaste, later I’ll find it sitting on the bathroom counter instead of in the medicine cabinet because I didn’t say, put this away in the medicine cabinet. He says that if I want it somewhere specific then I need to say so - every time. When I asked him why he doesn’t just put it where he would look for it, he says he’s not sure if that’s where I want it. When I say it’s his house too and he can decide where things should go he just shrugs and says it’s up to me. Another example would be if we’re cooking together, I can’t say, please peel four potatoes. I have to say: get four potatoes out of the bin in the pantry marked potatoes, wash them off, peel them with the potato peeler that you can find in that drawer there, put the potatoes in that pot with enough cold water to cover them and then put the peelings in the trash. And I have to do all of that every time. Same with doing laundry or even making the bed. When it’s his turn, I have to tell him which set of sheets to use, where they are in the linen closet, where to put the dirty sheets. If I try saying, use any clean sheets he keeps bringing out sets asking if that set is the right one until I give up and say, yes use those. I’ve tried saying whichever ones you want, but then he says I’m not communicating well and it's unhelpful.
I want to add that living with him is not all negative: he’s a very loving, fun person, and he does do some chores without direction like taking care of the cat, watering the plants, and doing the vacuuming. The cat and plants are his and he says those are things he feels confident in. Is this step-by-step thing just something I’m going to have to learn to live with?

ANSWER: If there is only one man on earth, and if you want to live with a man, then this is something you're going to have to learn to live with.

Otherwise, I hope you never hear yourself thinking that thought again about anything of which there are about 4 billion alternatives.

I am seriously serious. The first step-thing here is to take much better care of yourself. Don't ever throw your agency away so lightly. Over potato-peeling instructions.

The second step is for you to read this Emma comic (scroll past the purchase info for the book version -- it's all there).

Then ask him to read this Emma comic. Then have a conversation to find out whether he now understands the problem with "he just shrugs and says it’s up to me." If he doesn't, or if he says he understands but then doesn't apply even a minimal economy of arse* toward figuring out how to function, then you have some thinking to do.

This?: "he does do some chores without direction like taking care of the cat, watering the plants, and doing the vacuuming. The cat and plants are his and he says those are things he feels confident in." Is an 8-year-old.

grandparents I never knew trying to give me money I don't want
Guest Jul 25, 12:27 p.m.
QUESTION: It is sad your experience was so disappointing. My adopted daughter sought her birth family when she became an adult. Her birth mother was a disappointment but her grandmother was wonderful and has played an important part in my daughter's life. Might it help to find that your DNA also includes a share of what appear to be very nice people? The money could help you and them and it doesn't necessarily open the door to your birth father and it doesn' sound like he is looking for an entry anyhow. No right or wrong here, just what works for you.

Sisters not mending
Guest Jul 25, 12:41 p.m.
QUESTION: I have two daughters that lost their father literally 2 days before one got married. The sister now married did not want to attend an elaborate funeral service the next day for her father. This, I might add was not something he wanted. He specifically wanted a small service in another state. Not only that but a relative got involved in a lengthy estate settlement teaming up with one sister against the other. Fast forward, i now have grandchildren in two states with siblings not wanting to have family get togethers and excluding each other from family events. Seriously can't we get over this?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: Apparently not.

Plenty of families can't ever gather all at once because of geography; it's still not great that they can't, but presumably they dwell on it less, just because the reason is less emotionally fraught than a grudge. Somehow a grudge feels more fixable than geography.

But it's not. Not here, not for you. You have what life handed you. So I suggest you make the best of it and alternate seeing your kids and grandkids in the two different states, and remind yourself as needed not to waste any of this time on the futility of wishing things were otherwise. Because no doubt you've already lost enough time and joy to this feud.

Controlling special needs adult
Guest Jul 25, 12:42 p.m.
QUESTION: I’m wondering if the daughter - who is an adult woman - lives independently. In any case, at her age Dad can’t “let” or “forbid” her to use public transportation, or anything else. I know a severely autistic man, 43, who not only lives independently (pays his own bills, shops, uses public transportation) but has acquired 2 associates degrees from a local community college. Keep encouraging daughter in all aspects of independent adult life. One day neither of will be there, and she needs to have faith in her ability to function. Also, likely she will run across more bullies like her father. She needs good tools.

striving to remain calm
Guest Jul 25, 12:52 p.m.
QUESTION: During this time of great change, I decided to try to remain calm, while still donating and volunteering to causes I support. Essentially, I decided against being wound up constantly because of politics. The outrage, stress and anxiety certainly did not help me or my family, and I concluded that the outrage did not do much to advance causes I support either. A progressive friend accused me of only being able to do that because I am in a position of security. I was flummoxed. We vote the same way and generally agree on many issues, but I guess I don't meet some expected behavior standard? Can we all try to be more open to others way of thinking, even within the same political party? I know many people are struggling with the amount of change going on, but can we strive not to attack others who may react differently?

Boyfriend needs a project manager
Guest Jul 25, 12:55 p.m.
QUESTION: I had the boyfriend (now husband) who didn't do things around the house without direction. It was frustrating. We had several task-related conversations, that, like the letter writer, didn't produce much change. However, when we finally had the conversation about WHY he didn't feel sure about doing tasks that I thought were 'common', I found he had never done them. Growing up, his mother did ALL the household chores. I was amazed, but also felt sorry for him: so much he had not learned! So, I made it clear that I was not his mother, I was not going to be his mother, and he would have to contribute. I would happily teach, but he had to learn AND then do it on his own. We set a 3 times and then you're out (I do and he watches, he does and I watch, he does it). He was great at learning and has adapted the steps (if applicable) to make the tasks easier for him.
Going on 21 years married. He's fun, loving, motivated, and we share all the tasks of daily life.

Re: Boyfriend needs a project manager
Guest Jul 25, 1:01 p.m.
QUESTION: While understanding the frustration and not disagreeing with Carolyn's points, there could be a couple of things going on with the passive boyfriend.

Does he have controlling parents? And, since he's a man behaving this way with a woman, does he especially have a controlling mother who is the uber-boss of everything in the home? This could be a lifetime of training for him that isn't going to be undone in just 14 months.

If he feels confident with the cat and the plants, he might be better off taking full ownership of a couple of new household tasks at a time, rather than pitching in with a lot of stuff that he still feels a need to get instructions on.

Is it possible he has an executive function issue? My husband and son are both brilliant in general and in their jobs, but they both have diagnosed executive function issues (one b/c of ADHD and one b/c of autism). They lack confidence in new tasks in which I have expertise--not because of ego, but because of fear of doing it wrong. People with that issue can develop incredibly strong functionality in some areas and struggle mightily in others. Practice and consistency helps, which is why I (with behavioural science training) say the boyfriend needs to work on mastering fewer things before moving on to others.

wanting to post a too-long poem as an offering to the woman who was tempted to say "no" to grandpar
Guest Jul 25, 1:03 p.m.
QUESTION: wanting to offer a too-long poem as wisdom and support to the woman who wanted to say "no" to a gift from her grandparents. The poem speaks beautifully to holding on to all of our ancestors, not just one, not just her awful father.
A HOUSE CALLED TOMORROW

You are not fifteen, or twelve, or seventeen—
You are a hundred wild centuries
And fifteen, bringing with you
In every breath and in every step
Everyone who has come before you,
All the yous that you have been,
The mothers of your mother,
The fathers of your father.
If someone in your family tree was trouble,
A hundred were not:
The bad do not win—not finally,
No matter how loud they are.
We simply would not be here
If that were so.
You are made, fundamentally, from the good.
With this knowledge, you never march alone.
You are the breaking news of the century.
You are the good who has come forward
Through it all, even if so many days
Feel otherwise. But think:
When you as a child learned to speak,
It’s not that you didn’t know words—
It’s that, from the centuries, you knew so many,
And it’s hard to choose the words that will be your own.
From those centuries we human beings bring with us
The simple solutions and songs,
The river bridges and star charts and song harmonies
All in service to a simple idea:
That we can make a house called tomorrow.
What we bring, finally, into the new day, every day,
Is ourselves. And that’s all we need
To start. That’s everything we require to keep going.
Look back only for as long as you must,
Then go forward into the history you will make.
Be good, then better. Write books. Cure disease.
Make us proud. Make yourself proud.
And those who came before you? When you hear thunder,
Hear it as their applause.

Second the recommendation for you to get counseling and attend support meetings. You may have to make the hard choice to leave the marriage and have a booze free life on your own. He will go through lots of emotions - denial, anger, guilt, and bargaining until he finally (if ever) comes to acceptance.

Parent with IDD Adult Daughter
Guest Jul 25, 1:27 p.m.
QUESTION: I’m not sure where LW lives but it sounds like the adult daughter is self directing her services. Dad gets zero say in how she conducts her life at this point if she’s receiving any aid from the state and she is able to advocate for herself. If daughter is eligible for self directed services and not in a program, please apply immediately. She has missed out on so much and it can now take years to get approved. You need this in place before you both die. In self direction there will be a team, that includes your daughter, and other team members like case managers, brokers, behavior specialists, nurses, etc., and together they will put together a person centered plan to outline what her life should look like and how it should be unfolding today and in the future. Stop involving Dad in this and get the daughter a team in place she needs to support her from here on out. And the state pays for all of it if you live in a self directed state. Good luck.

ex I blocked claims he's miserable and desperately needs to talk to me
Guest Jul 25, 1:37 p.m.
QUESTION: For Christmas my boyfriend gave me the amethyst ring I’d been admiring and suggested we view it as an engagement ring. I was thrilled since we’d been discussing marriage for months. I started planning the wedding right afterwards. There wasn’t much to plan since we wanted just the two of us at city hall but I did want to dress up and have photographs taken of the day. He kept saying he wanted it to happen “more organically” but wouldn’t explain what that meant. When he no-showed our appointment for the marriage license I asked if he was having second thoughts. He went on this rant about me pushing so hard that I was suffocating him and said he needed a break. He wouldn’t talk to me, just kept repeating that I was crowding him and he needed space. So instead of moving in together like we planned, I had to remove everything I owned from his apartment and not talk to him for a month.
I was crushed but after crying, not eating or sleeping for almost 3 weeks I realized if he didn’t want to marry me after 4 years, he was never going to marry me and I needed to move on. To make a clean break, I ended all contact with him on every social media site, deleted every photo of him, sent back the ring, then avoided him in every way possible. Before blocking him, I sent him a short message saying the break was permanent and wishing him well. His sister delivered a letter from him to me at work this week. He says I broke his heart (?!) because he knows we still love each other and both needed that break to avoid “emotional codependence”. He said he never expected me to "escalate things to pretending he never existed" and now he lost his best friend and is miserable. When his sister gave me the letter she said he really needs to see me. Is this something that requires any response from me or can I ignore it all and keep on healing myself?

ANSWER: So escalating to a license-appointment no-show, a blame rant and a month's suspension was okay, though?

🤦‍♀️

Both of you are emotional flame-throwers, standing on the earth you scorched and believing you're in the right.

Both of you also, for that reason, might want to take a moment to sit in gladness and sweet relief that you didn't get married. Not until your natural (or at least after a beat and a deep breath) response to conflict in your relationship is to regulate your emotions or pause until you can.

This is not to say you were wrong to end things with your boyfriend -- "if he didn’t want to marry me after 4 years, he was never going to marry me and I needed to move on" seems like the only call here to me. But then you brought out Harvey Keitel and his bleach bottles to remove all traces of now-ex-love-of-my-life DNA, and I got a little scared.

I can't talk to him (ex-BF, not Harvey), but for you all I want to advise is a big picture look at this whole thing. It is hard when relationships end, yes, it hurts, but this is just So Much Escalation. And I would absolutely tell him the same thing if I could, and nudge both of you to counseling (individual!) to work on communication. Or read about nonviolent communication and its practice, if the time/money/access is an issue for therapy.

In a basic sense, one of you really needed to talk to the other, plainly, long before it erupted. I think it's clear his contents were under more pressure, but it was a both of you thing, not just on him.

As for now, having the sister come to you is not cool. Responding rewards that. Terrible spot she put you in.

At some point, though, I think it would be appropriate to unblock him, when you are ready to talk. Not forever or at length, just when you're ready to stop this he's-not-talking, then you're-not-talking war.

QUESTION: The OP set firm boundaries. Cutting off contact on social media? Getting rid of stuff? Avoiding the guy? Where's the bad?

ANSWER: Deleting every photo of a four year, thought-we'd-get-married relationship. Damn.

Please don't make me spell out that i have no problem with boundaries such as blocking on social media and not seeing anything further to discuss.

Okay, that's it for today and then some -- scheduled vacation 8/1 and 8/8. Thanks for stopping by today, and have a great weekend, out of spite if you have to. Don't melt.

In-law correcting grandkids
Guest Oct 3, 11:05 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn & Nuts! I have an in-law question. I will preface by saying my MIL and I do not get along nor see eye-to-eye. I avoid her but my husband and small children (1 & 4) go to visit his parents when I'm travelling for work. Everyone wins. On the rare occasion I do visit with them, how do I handle my MIL correcting my children? I'm trying to understand the different balance of "my house, my rules" with "my children, my decision". For example, she wants the 4 yo to sit at the table to eat his whole dinner and not leave until everyone is finished, asked to be excused, etc. In theory, I agree and we are working to instil manners (please tell me boys eventually chew with their mouth closed without constant reminders!) but he's 4 and sitting longer than 10 minutes while adults talk is boring. It also grates me to have her correcting my children when it's not her job. Should I tell my children that Grandma has different rules at her house and to listen to her or should I push back when she corrects my children? She is not the type of person one can have a rational conversation with, so it's either stay quiet or push back in the moment.

ANSWER: I need a bomb suit to take apart this question.

First, please let go of the idea that no one else can correct your kids but you. Parents who give stinkeye to anyone who dares say "no" to their preciouses have always bugged me. You and your husband are the top of the discipline chain, yes, and therefore you get the last word. However, the "village" concept is a good and necessary one that absolutely falls apart if you refuse to empower the village to tell your kid "no" sometimes.

I (really really) get how hard it is to grant that power to someone you don't like or trust. But it is worth it to take the deep breaths and make yourself apply an across the board standard of village access. Meaning, the village can correct your kid, even villagers you loathe, as long as the correction itself is not actively harmful -- because the institution of the village is worth supporting. And yes, that includes telling your kids (and reminding often) that rules in Place A are different from rules in Place B. That's just life. Home to home, school to home, etc. There's nuance to who's in charge, but you'll get there over time.

There are also definitely times to step in and protect your kid from people who undermine your childrearing methods or who push really bad, unhealthy or outdated methods themselves. The actively-harmful exception. Your MIL has one that I see immediately -- the "eat his whole dinner" thing is a resounding NOPE, I don't care whose table it is. Insisting kids push food down past their satiety point is just so ridiculously moronic and unhealthy that it has to be a hill you die on. Food issues are notoriously hard to "uninstall" once they're in there (since you can't just quit food) so make sure your husband is extra super crystal clear on this too. No clean plate BS ever. Omg.

I am once again reminded how hard it is to type when I'm flapping my arms in exasperation.

BTW, sounds like your kids will quickly find MIL visits stultifying, which means you're going to win this one. Don't overplay your hand.

Suicidal teen
Guest Oct 3, 11:31 a.m.
QUESTION: My husband and I recently discovered that our young teen is depressed and has contemplated suicide. I found out by going through their phone after noticing they seemed “off” and didn’t want to talk to me. Teen feels betrayed and angry that I went through their phone. We took them to their pediatrician for an evaluation, and teen refused to talk at all or to consider an antidepressant or nonmedical interventions. We went to a therapist twice and teen refused to speak at all. I have tried drawing teen out, waiting patiently, explaining how suicide cannot be undone and we will get through this together, they are not alone…but nothing seems to get through. Teen did confirm that there was no event that triggered this. They’re just sad. They did say talking to their friends helps. But I don’t know what to do. I’m barely sleeping and every time teen is out of sight I’m wondering if they’re ok. I asked if they’d see a different therapist and got completely shut down. I am at a loss and don’t know how we continue in this liminal space where teen is suffering but refusing help.

My husband and I spend time with our teen, doing what they enjoy but also luring them outside for walks. It’s met with a lot of resistance but we’re trying.

ANSWER: Raising kids is a scary business -- you know that famous description, it's like having your heart out walking around in someone else's body? -- and what you describe here is just peak terrifying. I am so sorry all of you are going through this. The combination of the pain you're in, the fear and the sense of helplessness would keep anyone up at night.

Since your teen refuses to talk to a therapist, it's all the more imperative that you and your husband work with one, asap. One who has the training and experience to work with troubled adolescents. This is where you get your guidance to work with your kid. I would advise you to get this counsel even if your teen had agreed to talk to someone. Being a parent ends up being about 99 percent winging it on the fly, but there are times when you really need professional instructions, and this is one of them.

Something else that will be a therapist question but that I want to plant in your mind upfront: The phone is a problem. I know I don't know this, but I know. The link between it and depression and teens is established, for one -- and you say "young" teen, which means an extra degree of vulnerability. Talking to their friends helps because that is human. That is what we are more prepared to handle. I note this as a therapist question because I don't want to send you barreling in after their phone on the strength of my warning here. Proceed with licensed guidance. But until you get there, yes to the spending time together, on other things, outside, etc., off the digital feed.

Also -- get eyes on in school. This comes with a risk of ticking off your kid for saying too much, so you always have to weigh that against the value of more awareness. But a cautious talk with the counselor at school (ergo confidential) can be your starting point.

AITA?
Guest Oct 3, 11:51 a.m.
QUESTION: Hi, Carolyn! I recently made a spur of the moment plan to travel with a friend to Europe for an event taking place next summer. Tickets to the event, as well as travel, aren't cheap, but I can afford it and know that it will be fun. My husband was present when my friend I made these plans and immediately purchased the tickets. Later, he told me that he was hurt that I made plans for a big trip when he and I had discussed planning a big trip, as well, although we hadn't finalized our destination or time frame. I told him that the plans with my friend do not preclude or replace our plans together. At that point, he balked at the cost, saying that if I had enough money to make spontaneous plans for a pricey trip, he wished I'd put them toward a loan we took out last year for home improvements. I admit, I'm not as fiscally responsible as I'd like to be, and told him that I see his point. I am going to move some funds around so that we can pay off this debt together in the near future. Still, I think what stung him is that I do have the resources to be able to make spontaneous plans for a trip like this, although I don't do it often. We've been married for a little over a year, living together for almost 10 years, and have come up with system for managing our joint income and expenses that works for us. I typically pay from my personal account for any non-essential splurges that I want for myself. He knows that my income and investments are more than his own, due to many factors, but mostly because he raised and put two children through college, as well as suffered through an expensive divorce. I don't want to "flaunt" my ability to spend more freely than he does, but I also want to be able to do the things that I can reasonably afford even when they don't involve him. We discussed the issue the same night and he is not harboring a grudge, but what is a better way to handle this in the future?

ANSWER: If he knows all about the separate splurge account, including how much is in it, and is/has always been okay with it on principle, then I don't see the issue here. It also seems as if he knew it was there when you took out the loan, so I'm a little confused on that -- are you too spendy or did you agree to keep your separate splurge money no matter what? Maybe you and he need some better communication there.

But as for the emotional side of it: His feelings were hurt, he spoke up, you talked about it, you both figured out that your trip was just the manifestation in real time of what the splurge account allows, and now there's nothing to see here. Sure, maybe having the plans happen in front of him wasn't ideal, but spontaneity is pretty great, too, and he could also have spoken up, or tugged you gently aside to say "Hey, does this affect our trip?" and you could have assured him then that it didn't.

Even in a good relationship, it doesn't seem realistic that you'd never have hurt feelings ever. More likely, when mature people do feel hurt: 1. They're going to be able to talk about it. 2. They're going to find out it was a misunderstanding. 3. Or they're going to be able to admit/forgive mistakes. 4. Or find a way to accept each other's differences.

No one needs to be TA.

For suicidal teen
Guest Oct 3, 11:55 a.m.
QUESTION: I am so sorry you are going through this. I had friends who went through the heartbreak of a suicidal teen and if I could also suggest a qualified therapist for you and your spouse as well. This is a terrifying time and having someone with whom you can speak can help YOU as well as you navigate. Please know that what you wrote here sounds like you are doing a good job and that good, loving care remains whatever the outcome of your teen's depression is (as tough as that may be to acknowledge.) We are so hoping your teen finds a way out of this.

ANSWER: I am posting this because my advice was for them to talk to a therapist themselves -- so, it's the exact same advice? I want to make sure mine wasn't unclear.

I realize I noted the adolescent experience credentials of the person they see, but that was so they would understand the parents' situation. My intent was for the therapist to be for the parents. Thank you for writing in.

QUESTION: I also have teens with mental health struggles, and you're right - it's terrifying. And I know that it continues to be terrifying because when my best friend was going through a tough time last year, her mom called me to ask if I thought she was going to be ok. (We are in our mid-40s.)
That same best friend was hauled off to counseling in her early teens, and she has said that she felt terrible about it because she felt like her parents were trying to "fix" her because she was the different one in the family. So I'd say that's the small piece of wisdom that I've used from her struggles in dealing with my own kids - make it clear that you're not trying to fix them or make them different. That you just want them to be comfortable in themselves.
Good luck - and don't forget you're not alone.

QUESTION: I think it's important to normalize therapy and treatment for mental health issues for teens. Hey, kid, if you broke your arm or got the flu, we would take you to the doctor for the appropriate treatment. This is no different and there's no shame in feeling sad--but also no need to stay so sad when there are things that might help.

ANSWER: These are all true, and I've been at this same message for almost 30 years, and it's a great point to make with kids from the youngest ages (please!), though if you get to it late then it's still a great message -- but. If a person, even a kid-person, refuses to talk to a therapist, there is not a whole lot that other people can do to make them. And such accurate and well-meaning encouragement as you suggest, to someone who has dug in, can backfire.

There can be an involuntary commitment for someone who is at risk of harming self or others, but that's about it.

This is a major contributor to the sense of helplessness.

For parent of suicidal teen
Guest Oct 3, 12:22 p.m.
QUESTION: My son, now mid-20s, went through two terrifying, suicidal years in his late teens. One thing that helped both of us was NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness). I know they have chapters all over the country. He attended a support group for people going through severe depression, and it helped him immensely. And I attended the support group for parents, and I was relieved to know that what I was feeling and experiencing was not unique to me. Best of luck to you both; I would not wish this experience on anyone.

Follow-up about lousy hosting
Guest Oct 3, 12:29 p.m.
QUESTION: My wife did as you suggested and talked to her dad. I was right that we were unwelcome - or at least that they were mad about something. Their first issue was that our hostess gifts ($40 bottle of wine plus a flower arrangement) came from the grocery store! Biggest issue was that step-mom-in-law was annoyed that we showed up on Friday night expecting dinner. Also, I should have somehow known to bring back breakfast for them too on Saturday and Sunday, even though they told us they only ever had coffee and those cookies.
What a crock. The wine and flowers are the same no matter where it came from. And when we host them (3 times since they moved!) we not only have dinner ready for them on Friday night but appetizers and drinks too. Her dad's excuse is that it's different because "there are only two of them and three of us". Right.
I am 99% sure this is not a money issue since they spent the weekend talking about their recent purchases - a boat, fancy patio furniture and a newly landscaped patio to put it on. Also, there was plenty of fresh food in the house - they just weren't sharing it with us.
My wife and I decided in future we will get an Airb&b when we visit them and provide all our own meals. Since they live in an expensive resort area this will limit our ability to visit. Oh well.

ANSWER: Whew, yeah, that's what petty scorekeeping will get you -- guests determined to find every reason necessary never to come back. The stepmom-in-law sounds like a real charmer.

This flirts with a bunch of faerie tale stereotypes, so I type it at my own risk, but I wonder whether this played out exactly how she wanted it to -- with you as the bad guys on some made-up charge and thinking twice before crossing the Evil Stepmother's threshold again. If her husband is a pushover or dependent on her, then she wins, pesky stepkid and family are out of the picture. (Don't eat any apples, spin wool or befriend their mice just in case.)

This doesn't have to be so cartoonishly villainous, either. One or more of the elements in all of last week's speculation could still be involved.

And, too, you could be taking the exact wrong message from the boat and patio -- ie, now they're up to their face holes in debt -- but I think that's a long shot explanation. As expensive as food is, they could have literally fed you beans. That's what kindhearted broke people do.

Thanks for the update. I'm sorry you just had a firsthand reminder of how much people can suck.

Sibling’s shows of grief drag me into uncomfortable spot
Guest Oct 3, 12:34 p.m.
QUESTION: Sibling has a podcast and instagram presence that appears to be geared toward creating a name for themself and developing a clientele for coaching/empowerment/creativity consulting services. It is a side project of theirs, and since our parent passed away 2 1/2 years ago, there has been a marked turn toward including grief related content and “celebrations” of parent.

The content comes across to me as an attempt to monetize our parent, photos of our parent and other family members (including me and my kids) and photos of our parent’s art. This includes links to a clothing site where people can buy items printed with sibling’s collages that incorporate photos of parent and parent art.

We don’t have a great relationship, and that goes back many years. I’ve tried asking to go to family counseling, sibling hasn’t been willing.

Every time I see one of these posts, I get deeply uncomfortable. Do I have any standing to ask them to stop? How would I go about it without setting off a new round of fire (sib is reactive and can be nasty)?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You don't have standing to ask them to stop podcasting, posting or talking about grief or your parent, no. It's their business, you don't have to like it. Parent's art, depends on who owns it, I would think.

But you absolutely have standing to ask sib to stop using images of you and your kids. Since sib is reactive and nasty (sorry, I think we've all more than had it with that combination), I'd talk with a lawyer first to find out what recourse i have. Then, with that in my pocket, I'd talk to sibling myself, and go to my the legal Plan B only if I had to and still wanted to.

Once I was sure about the photos, I'd unfollow this sib's venture entirely after that. I can't see why you'd pay attention to something nonessential that upsets you. Hit "unfollow" and it stops, magic.

Eldersitting
Guest Oct 3, 1:12 p.m.
QUESTION: We are once again in the thick of fall sports season. My kids are finally old enough that when they aren’t on the field, they watch, hang out with friends, and I can relax, actually watch the games, chat with parent friends, and decompress a bit from work, shuttling kids around, cooking, laundry, etc. my in-laws recently relocated closer to us, and they want to go to the games, virtually all of them. Due to some mild cognitive changes in my MIL and my FIL never having managed these sorts of things, they need support. They are always cold but never dress warmly enough, even with reminders. They need chairs and water and snacks, which they can’t carry. It feels like packing for toddlers again. I like them as people and have a good, if not extraordinarily close, relationship with them. But did I clarify: all the games? My husband does some assistant coaching and team managing so generally isn’t the point person for this. When I’ve mildly suggested skipping a cooler evening game, they won’t hear of it: they have the link to the schedule and just show up. My husband says just don’t bring all the things, and let them adjust their attendance accordingly. I can’t watch them shiver and end up giving them my jacket, water, whatever. Can I set a limit on the number of games per weekend, or a minimum temperature, and tell them that’s it? Or do I just accept this is the highlight of their social week and keep hauling all the stuff, setting it up, etc.?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I just big-sighed this one. On the one hand, it's small stuff, it's the grandparents, it's tough to be lonely/old/slipping, it's a kindness you'll want from your kids or their partners someday. On the other hand -- really? It's all on you? You can't be hands-free for one freaking game? I do feel for you on the idea of gazing at the calendar at that mythical day when you are in charge of no one's care, then it suddenly flips forward years and years and you can't stop it 😱

So here's what I've got.

1. Your kids are old enough to chip in toward their grandparents' comfort, no? Isn't this a lesson in care, kindness, intergenerational understanding? Not every game, but one shift on a rotating schedule, a kid or kids can do the setup.

2. If your husband can't step out to help get them set up for one day of a rotation himself (can he?), then he can get involved in the stocking of supplies in 3.

3. The needs are predictable enough to pack most or all supplies in a car and leave them there. Yours, theirs, your husband's? And can you put the chairs, blankets, bags of snacks in a cart or wagon. There you go. I say if you have money to throw at the problem (it's not a ton), then start chucking.

4. The limit is fine, too. Number of games or minimum temp, fine -- but is that really up to you? I would think they could just go regardless.

For parent of suicidal teen
Guest Oct 3, 1:20 p.m.
QUESTION: I was that kid, exactly. Years later my mother told me she took me to see someone because I had stopped talking. They shuffled me around to well-dressed people sitting behind large desks, and I refused to talk with them too. Silence.

Eventually I told my mother I thought it wasn’t helping. She said ok, then we’ll stop. I remember clearly thinking the time, no, you’re supposed to say let’s try something else but I couldn’t get myself to say that.

At the clinic I remember being walked past art therapy rooms and thinking ‘that looks interesting’ but no one ever noticed my head turn as we walked by and I was never invited in.

So maybe if the kid won’t talk, try something that doesn’t require talking and maybe talking will happen eventually. Face-to-face in an office, sitting in a straight-back chair while someone stares at you and commands you to speak wasn’t helpful.

Maybe letting the kid know that it’s not that there’s anything wrong with them. They’re learning how the world works and trying to figure out where they fit into it. Maybe it’s that there are things wrong with the world (there are!) and kid is trying to figure how to live with that.

Some sincere, credible assurance of as much confidentiality would be helpful. A kid who won’t talk to parents isn’t going to talk to a therapist who is just going to report back to the parents.

Not at all to suggest that this is this kid’s issue, but I’m trans. After decades of depression and feeling suicidal I finally dealt with that, blew my cover, changed my name and a few other things. It’s been more than 15 years since I last felt suicidal.

QUESTION: Child psychologist here. Therapy is important- keep looking for the right fit. Don't forget group therapy options, becauee teens in particular are motivated by peer connection. In the meantime, leverage all the social relationships you can, because social supports are a major protective factor. Are there aunt/uncles/family friends who can send notes/go on outings? Encourage your village to reach out and nurture those connections (while maintaining your kid's privacy). Also, ask for a meeting at their school and talk about who their safe adults are. Your school social worker can be a great resource.

Re: suicidal teen

QUESTION: The parent OP didn’t mention whether they apologized for going through their child’s personal device…reading their diary. It’s a pretty serious boundary violation that the teen might be responding to by leveraging the power they have; to stay silent when expected to talk to experts. Also, as a person who has dealt with/is dealing with depression, it can be particularly hard to talk about in front of one’s parents, if OP means that they attended appointments with their teen. By definition, my parents want me to be alive; how can I tell them I could take it or leave it, or would like it to be over or have a plan? I’d be so acutely aware of my parent’s distress that I couldn’t tell the truth.

Food and Personality Sensitivity
Guest Oct 3, 1:37 p.m.
QUESTION: I have a friend who's diet is restricted to gluten-free products. I just had her over as part of a large group for dinner. A couple of other people were bringing desserts and bread. I requested gluten-free, if possible. As a back-up, I made sure to buy a bakery fresh gluten-free dessert and store-bought gluten-free bread just for her. It turns out we needed both. Not only wasn't she grateful that I went to the trouble to accommodate her diet, she was outraged that she was singled out from everyone. She said the whole meal should have been gluten-free and no one would have said a peep. She told me that all of her friends now know that she has a gluten sensitivity and she's embarrassed by this. She won't even speak to me about this anymore. My husband says I should apologize and promise to never do anything like that again. He said I should also ask her what I can do to make it up to her (take her out for an expensive dinner, free babysitting for a few months?). I don't see that I did anything wrong and I really don't like the idea of apologizing to someone when I went out of my way to include her. Thoughts?

ANSWER: "Outraged"? That hits me as a lot.

I also don't see what's even remotely embarrassing about a food sensitivity or limitation. (I have firsthand experience, so.) But she can have her feelings.

I do agree with the apology, though, no matter what -- in writing, since she won't talk to you about it. "I am sorry I made you uncomfortable. That was the exact opposite of my intent -- I was trying to make sure you felt welcome, and obviously that backfired. Next time I will run my plans by you first.

"Please do allow me a next time. We'd love to host you again soon."

That's all the makeup you owe; no need to lay burnt offerings at her feet for having the nerve to buy her a special dessert ffs.

last week follow up
Guest Oct 3, 1:40 p.m.
QUESTION: I wrote last week about the dog=kids question. I was purposely vague which prompte d many readers to fill in the holes. To clarify: the person who insists raising their dog is just like raising a kid isn't a friend but a relative: a middle aged gay male. I feel pretty confident in saying that it's not my constant talk about my kids that prompts this behavior as this relative is a conversational monopolizer so I hardly get to say anything at all. I wouldn't have bothered writing back but the mom who wrote in about their suicidal child is heart-breaking and I guess to my point. There are so many worries we parents have. Will my child harm themselves? Will they grow up to be a school shooter, a psychopath or any number of destructive things? That kind of responsibility is just not part of owning my sweet canines.

ANSWER: So ... huh. Okay. First, small thing, I already agreed with you that the dogs/kids comparison didn't work. But I do want to add, now that you put it the way you do here, there are so many worries a pet-parent might have that a typical child-parent wouldn't. Like, getting loose in traffic or fear biting, or not being able to say what hurts, or knowing when it's time (or when you jumped too soon or took too long) to euthanize. Plus a dog will never learn to feed itself or let itself out. So I think we did better just not comparing.

Second, big thing: You left out the fact. Had I known "this relative is a conversational monopolizer," I would have been able to talk about a broken clue receptor. That's the issue. Has nothing to do with dogs, kids, hurt feelings or broken dreams or whatever else. He's not reading the room, he's just filling it -- so of course all kinds of dubious stuff comes out, Stop overthinking it; that just sends it on a journey through your own sensitivities.

My wife's therapist is driving us to divorce
Guest Oct 3, 2:08 p.m.
QUESTION: This is a weird question, but I could use some help in how to deal with my wife's reliance on her therapist.

We've been married eleven years and have always been able to work through our disagreements with candid communication, compromise and empathy. Last year, she lost her mother, and decided to start seeing a therapist to help her work through the trauma, which I supported.

But since then, she's started talking about our occasional marital disagreements with her therapist, and the therapist always seems to have a strong opinion about how it should be resolved -- almost always in her favor. So now, when we have our disagreements (which she usually brings up right after her sessions), and we start what used to be our period of communication/compromise, she says "But my therapist says...", and then she becomes totally inflexible, treating it like it's some sort of binding appellate court ruling.

I almost always disagree with the therapist, who's only getting a once-sided viewpoint and a small slice of the big picture. But my wife won't budge, so now, for the first time in our marriage, we've had a series of blow-ups due to her unwillingness to budge from whatever her therapist told her to do. (I'm sure she'd say I'm the stubborn one, unwilling to acquiesce to what her "neutral" therapist says.)

At one point I asked to talk to her therapist to at least hear my point of view before rendering her judgment, but the therapist says we'll need a different therapist if we want joint sessions, and recommended her friend. But I've resisted as these therapists are really expensive, and I don't feel like I should cede control of my marriage to them.

It reached a head where she wouldn't budge on something important to me (my hour of zoning out with a video game when I get home from work to decompress), and I asked to separate. She bawled and said we could work it out, but then the next day, after her therapy, she told me I was "gaslighting" her and that I should go if I can't "respect her boundaries," like she was reciting lines in a play.

I feel like I could save our marriage if I could free my wife from her therapist's clutches, but I also don't want to disrespect what my wife says, e.g. that the therapist is just helping her "find her voice." What do I do?

ANSWER: "I've resisted [joint sessions] as these therapists are really expensive, and I don't feel like I should cede control of my marriage to them."

But you asked to separate. So, to me that says you will end your marriage rather than "cede control" of it, and pay for two homes full time rather than one hour per week of a "really expensive" professional's time.

Meanwhile, you don't know whether you "disagree with the therapist," because you are not in the room. You are hearing it from your wife afterward. You also don't know how your wife represents your arguments to her therapist. Her "one-sided viewpoint" could be pretty accurate. You're assuming she skews it to her advantage.

None of this adds up to a credible argument against therapy or this therapist. It's a lot of conjecture and nonworking math.

What it does add up to is this: You feel like your life was better, and your marriage was better for you, before your wife got therapy -- and you're angry. You want the changes reversed. And you really don't want to go to the place that you blame for breaking everything to try to fix it.

Fair assessment?

If so, then here's my response to it:

-If you want to hear how your wife represents you and your marriage in therapy;

-And hear what a trained therapist says about that;

-And to make sure your side of the story gets heard;

-And spend hourly dollars vs monthly rent;

-And try to "save our marriage" and "free my wife from her therapist's clutches" vs walk away from it;

... Then you have been offered that chance in joint sessions with another therapist. Find out for yourself what the conversation is about and join it, instead of railing about what you think they're saying about you.

It takes guts to get in there, open your mind and really listen. But if your wife wanted things to be the way they were before, then they would be. For whatever reason, what worked for you so well wasn't working as well for her, and that's not a therapist's fault. A significant death and grieving can be an eye-opening experience -- emotionally transformative. The therapist may be correlation, not causation.

Listening is the first step toward figuring out whether both of you can be happier on the other side of this.

Gluten-free friend
Guest Oct 3, 2:14 p.m.
QUESTION: I'm not the OP but I would NOT love to host this friend again. My friend told me for years she had celiac then later amended it to "just really sensitive to gluten." Now she refuses to consume oils but can't articulate a reason. I go out of my way to accommodate her and she complains I make her feel difficult. I'm over her food issues.

ANSWER: Yeah there is a point where I'd tap out too. Depends on the friend and the freakout. (This is all speculative; I've never had a friend or relative complain about accommodations, lucky me. At least not to my face 😃.) Anyway -- all scripts I offer are suggestions only.

Steisand effect?

ANSWER: Streisand Effect (google for the full description) is when the act of trying to suppress something is what makes it huge.

So, the application here = my hope that the relentless effort to dismantle the fed workforce will cause this largely invisible, unnoticed, underappreciated group of workers to achieve a kind of nerd folkloric heroism.

grumpy fed
Guest Oct 3, 2:27 p.m.
QUESTION: My brother was a contractor on some government project, and was locked out of the government facility where he was working during the last shutdown. He said that some of the federal workers had also shown up for work, thinking they could get into the facility and continue their work, as a deadline was looming. They could not get in, and my brother was very impressed that they stood outside the building and discussed what they could accomplish off site during the shutdown. So, grumpy fed, we salute you and people like you who just want to show up and do their jobs.

Wife's therapist
Guest Oct 3, 2:27 p.m.
QUESTION: Your wife's therapist is correct: She is an individual therapist, not a marriage counselor. If you want your voice to be heard within the context of your marriage in therapy, you need to go to a marriage counselor.

It is not at all uncommon for each person in the marriage to work with their own individual counselor and a marriage counselor in order to figure out how to support each individual within the marriage best.

If you don't like what's happening in her therapy, that doesn't mean the solution is to get rid of her therapist.

food stuff- main point
Guest Oct 3, 2:33 p.m.
QUESTION: Oh I forgot to add it totally makes me feel bad, vulnerable, embarrassed (all he shame words) when my friends make a big show of accommodating me- I don't want them to feel bad or others and I also want to keep my struggles more private. Maybe think about it that way. Maybe just ask in advance what they want you to do re: accommodations.

I also forgot we flipped a calendar page. Happy Nedtober.

That's it for today. Thanks for stopping by, and for being patient with an even slower pace than usual as we dealt with such a serious topic.

Have a good weekend, out of spite if you have to, and give each other and your creatures extra hugs.

I'm the tattoo person!
Guest Oct 3, 2:43 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi, Carolyn - I don't know if I am more thrilled or terrified that my question was opened up to so many readers, but thank you! To reassure everyone, I am not afraid of my husband and feel completely safe. And, to the respondent who asked why I love them if I can't see them - I can see them whenever I want! I just have to pull my hair back. The public just can't see them.
I am extremely rejection-sensitive and have been my whole life. My biggest fear/dread is disappointing someone. I spent most of my life making sure what I did/said/wore would be approved before trying it out, and still do often. The reason I told my husband I was going to get my first tattoo unless he forbid it was that I decided I wanted it Enough to live with any related disappointment, as long as it wasn't a marriage deal-breaker. (It wouldn't have been one for me if the roles were reversed, but I am the rejection-sensitive one and he is not.)
Now, while he knows they are there, he can't see them. This is why I was stressing about adding one where it CAN be seen by anyone if I am wearing shorts or loafers. I would instead do another hidden one with less fear, but my hair is only so long.
My husband hates tattoos because they are Permanent-with-a-capital-P. You don't like your haircut? Grow it out. Don't like your job? Get a new one. But, decide you don't like your tattoo? It's going to stay there. And, as people get older and their skin loses elasticity, it's not going to look as great as that first month. But, you can't fix it or take it off. The other reason he hates them is he is an introverted navy polos and khakis kind of guy. So, he is uncomfortable doing things that call attention to oneself. And you can't take off a tattoo for a special occasion like an office party or a wedding to avoid conversation.
I hope this is helpful. I still really want it and think I am going to ask the artist if it could be done without an outline, so it isn't quite as noticeable from a distance. Thank you so much again.
-Art!

Um. He can hate them for all those things, on his body. Right? On yours, you assume the risk of changing your mind or attracting unwanted attention. Seems like a no brainer to me.

What's wring with being happy?
Guest Oct 3, 2:59 p.m.
QUESTION: Hi Carolyn! Lately I've noticed a lot of my friends are really down about the state of the world. I totally understand and don't judge. However, I think I'm pretty good at judging the size of my hands, and exactly how much of the world's pain I'm able to hold in them, and *spoiler alert* it's not much. Therefore, I do my best to be a good person, and accept the rest as not within my control. It works for me and I'm pretty happy.

However, this seems to really rub people the wrong way. There are quite a few friends and acquaintances I know who seem to think if you're not consumed with hatred and rage and fighting and screaming, that you're not a good person and you're not "doing enough."

I'm not really sure what, exactly, I'm expected to do to make our dear president start acting with some sense, but until I have that answer, I'm not going to make myself miserable over it. Also, hating anyone (even "fascists") is against my religion, and I don't think it helps anything, and I simply won't do it.

My question is how to talk about this? Sometimes my friends make comments that I'm "burying my head in the sand," or they'll say "you can't look at what's happening and not be upset." It feels like I'm failing some litmus test simply for taking care of my emotional wellbeing. I read the news. I'm perfectly aware of what's happening in the world. I just refuse to be consumed by it. Do you have any suggestions about how to handle the people who believe that misery is a moral imperative?

ANSWER: Reasons to be happy:

-It's an act of defiance I: "You can't break me"
-It's an act of defiance II: Say of your opponents, "Look at these clowns" (this entire concept via tuba). To sulk is to concede how big and powerful they are. Come on -- look at these clowns. Grab your tuba.
-It's an act of defiance III: You can't lose sight of what you're fighting to preserve.
-It's necessary. You can't be effective if you don't rest. Joy breaks are restorative.
-The happy warriors, merry band concept. You have to do the work anyway, might as well play good music and dance.
-No one will join your cause if you're miserable to be around.

That's it for now -- I have to run, this caught my eye as I was closing the window. Lmk if this moves any of your friends.

Roommate's eating disorder is disruptive
Guest Oct 3, 3:11 p.m.
QUESTION: I share a relatively small townhouse with 2 roommates. We’ve been roommates for almost 2 years and everything was going fine until recently. My one roommate Patty and I are longtime friends and the third is Linda - a friend of Patty’s sister who moved in when Patty’s sister got married. Linda works from home. She has issues with food which she assured us, after years of therapy, were under control. She explained that due to her eating disorder she needs to prepare and eat her food alone. Okay, we could accommodate that. But it’s gotten to be a burden, especially on weekends and other days off. At first she needed 30 minutes of private kitchen time twice a day, plus about 15 minutes to eat her lunch. She used to prep her lunch and breakfast at the same time and be out of the way before we got downstairs in the morning. Now for vague reasons that’s no longer possible and she wants the kitchen to herself for at least 90 minutes at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We’re not “allowed” to go into the kitchen/dining area while she is prepping or eating. Last month she upped the ante by requesting that we not even use the living room since it’s within sight of the kitchen. That means she wants us to head directly upstairs to our bedrooms when we get home from work until she texts us that she’s done with dinner. That isn’t possible, same with avoiding the kitchen when we’re trying to get ready for work. When we interrupt her, Linda gets upset to the point of crying and throwing her food away uneaten. She will not eat in her room or anywhere but the kitchen/dining area because she insists that’s “disgusting” and she’d rather go without. Last week Patty asked her to contact her therapist but Linda screamed at us that her ED is under control if we’d accommodate her “simple rule”. This has become a daily problem and even though we’re very sympathetic, we’re paying to live here and want to be able to access the kitchen and living room when we want to. What can we do?

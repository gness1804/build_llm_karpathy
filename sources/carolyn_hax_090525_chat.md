College transition
Guest Aug 1, 11:09 a.m.
QUESTION: My 18 year-old starts college in 2.5 weeks, but has been gone all summer at a low paying, extremely demanding, exhausting, somewhat risky, but rewarding (to him) live-in job far away. He left the day after graduation and has only come home once for 24 hours. His college is 1,500 miles away…. Now the summer job wants him to stay for an extra week, so he said he’ll only come home (reluctantly) for about 24 hours before his flight to college. ….He has a laundry list of things he needs to do: rest up from the job, see the doctor (for a possible medical issue), visit the dentist for a routine cleaning, haircut, buy clothes/shoes, buy things for the dorm room… He thinks staying the extra days post-contract make him a shoe-in for a “promotion” at this summer job next year. The fact is that there are guarantees and the employer probably just wants more cheap laborers to exploit … I said if he doesn’t come home one week before the flight, I’m not paying for college. My question: Is this overstepping? A mistake on my part? Yes he’s technically an adult but I see this as a really dumb decision. College transition is a huge deal and the out of state college is jaw-droppingly expensive. He refused to attend the in-person orientation so he could stay at this job. I don’t want to pay SO MUCH when he’s showing almost no interest. PS back story is he didn’t get into the Ivy League type schools that were his first picks.

ANSWER: UPDATE: I posted this answer Aug. 1, when I announced the chat was going on hiatus -- I saw it in the queue and hoped the parent would see the answer and not threaten to pull the kid's tuition.

[I'm supposed to be off, but I can't help myself.]

An 18-year-old working this hard and owning it this much can't be the worst thing.

He sees the doctor in the 24 hours. Yes.

The dentist too if possible, but that can be at school. Check your insurance. So can the haircut and all the shopping. None of it really matters, certainly not the way it used to. He can click-click-click it all from where he is for delivery at his campus, or you can do it for him if you're both okay with that. A list and a budget and shipping instructions from the school are all he needs.

What neither of you needs is a power struggle right now. That is madness and it is not going to improve his college uptake prospects.

If anything, imagine the job as a relationship you don't approve of -- resisting it will only push them together.

But again, this is work! He's working and caring. I don't know how to beg you hard enough to pick your battles more carefully. Caring is good. Hard work is good.

Okay now I will be resting.

Family (?)
Guest Sep 5, 11:16 a.m.
QUESTION: My ex-husband and I divorced when I was still pregnant with our third and our other two were still in diapers. We became a great co-parenting team and when we each remarried, we welcomed our spouses and their children. We vacationed together, had holidays together. When my ex became ill with cancer, I was part of the inner circle taking him to doctor's visits when his wife couldn't do it, making dinners, being the taxi driver so ex's youngest kids continued with their sports, and supporting our older kids any way I could. My husband did laundry, shoveled sidewalks, and picked up the slack in our home when I was helping. When he died, his wife wrote a heartfelt message on social media and published a formal obituary and never once mentioned me. The larger family my ex and I created was a source of great pride for him. He even did public speaking about it - encouraging families to redefine who is family for the betterment of the kids and everyone. These announcements detailed his life skipping right over our marriage, co-parenting etc. They talked about the great care team and supporting and loving their two sets of kids (older and younger) - neighbors were named and thanked, aunts/uncles, ILs - and my husband and I were not mentioned at all. Our kids noticed it. I'm confused about my relationship with his wife. I thought we were family. Not friends, exactly, but family. Now I don't even know how to be in a relationship with her any more. Bringing up that I wasn't anywhere in any announcement sounds petty but my ex meant a lot to me. Our history meant a lot but maybe now that he's gone his wife doesn't want to be in a relationship with me any more?

ANSWER: Well that's weird and awful, I'm sorry, and I'm sorry for your loss.

As hard as it is to override the impulse, though, I don't think it's helpful to assume she wrote you out because you don't matter to her or she doesn't see you as family or wants to sever your relationship.

I mean -- they're all possible, sure. But it's bizarre to tell you that by erasing you; it's angry. And I'm not seeing anywhere that you were reading anger on her (though grief does mess with people).

She could also, say, have some weird hangup about his having an ex-wife -- like mentioning you in these carefully curated propaganda pieces for public consumption was inconceivable to her. There is still a whole cultural subset that treats a second marriage as a courthouse walk of shame. It's bad form to deny kids but erasing an ex? Pff.

That's one hypothesis. Another is an offshoot of the first -- that she whitewashed the official stuff because she didn't want to hear it from an uptight branch of her family.

Maybe both are a reach. The highest percentage explanation? I suppose it's probably in your own words: "we were family. Not friends, exactly, but family." Do I detect a mutual not-feeling-it? Without your ex to justify being friends, maybe this was her way of ... being done.

Regardless: As for "Bringing up that I wasn't anywhere in any announcement sounds petty," I agree, if it's for its own sake. But bringing it up as an "I couldn't help but notice ..." is an opening to talk about where things stand now. If you would like to remain a blended family of sorts, if way less involved day-to-day for obvious reasons, then float the idea with her. But say that if the announcements were a hint, then you hope she will tell you straight.

Glory Days Gang
Guest Sep 5, 11:17 a.m.
QUESTION: My boyfriend still regularly hangs out with some of his friends from college (several of whom also went to the same high school). My boyfriend himself has accomplished a lot in the decade since graduating, but some of these friends are stuck in old patterns and conversations about things that happened in school. When we hang out with them, my boyfriend regresses; he will never mention things he's doing now in his public health work or with the friends he and I have made together. Instead he retells the same stories about stuff that happened at a school I didn't attend, before he was finished reaching adulthood. It gets really boring and old, and it only happens around this particular group of people. His feelings get hurt when I don't want to be present for those gatherings. What is my obligation to continue hanging out with the Glory Days gang?

ANSWER: Zero.

That's the obligation. His being "hurt" doesn't take away your control of your social time. Plus, while he feels what he feels etc. and all that, the hurt is misplaced. It's not personal; it's just boring. You're not included in these conversations, so you're just an audience, and the stories are all retellings, so you're an audience to the same show on repeat. He'd be bored too if you switched roles.

Those are just the basics, though. There are other things to consider: Snobbery is one. Yours isn't even veiled, as far as I can tell. So that may be getting to him. You definitely look down on this branch of his friends.

There's also the element, if you're both willing, of trying to come up with a third option. Option 1 is that you go and get bored to tears, and Option 2, he sees these friends without you. Right? Option 3, then, is where you agree to go if he agrees to make an actual effort to have actual conversation instead of high school/college story hour.

That's his challenge: Does he want you there badly enough to do the work socially to make it inclusive? If not, then he and his feelings can zip it when you decide to stay home.

How do I begin?
Guest Sep 5, 11:34 a.m.
QUESTION: I have had an ongoing disagreement with one of my siblings which has resulted in not communicating for months. I was really hurt by their actions and I think I did my share of hurting too. What’s the best way to start off a way back? I feel really vulnerable.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: The way back is to admit your part of the hurting, and apologize for it sincerely.

But before you do that, prepare for the possibility that your sibling doesn't do the same, and just accepts your apology as the end of it without admitting any fault. It's a tough one, because the apology is only genuine if it's not intended as the opening of a quid pro quo. But at the same time, I expect you won't feel good about their walking away with the idea they did nothing wrong. It takes courage and a real commitment to owning your mistakes to be willing to do that.

It also may mean you choose not to reconcile for that reason, which obviously is a bad outcome in a lot of ways. But taking responsibility for your mistakes is the honorable outcome that's entirely within your control, so you do that. And you hope for and work toward the best on the rest.

New college student who is working
Guest Sep 5, 11:40 a.m.
QUESTION: I don't know if this question was meant to be posted to this week's chat, and I'm sure that family situation has resolved itself one way or another now (maybe he's off to school?). But I wanted to weigh in that what this kid is displaying is the value of pride in his work. It doesn't matter that it's a "low level" job according to the mother: This is where a career and lifelong ambition and responsibility begin. Too many people now think it's attached to college: Go to a good college et voila! You will be given the golden key to wonderful employment. Yes, it helps, and yay he's going to college. But what will make him successful are these values he is displaying. We battled one of our kids to work over the summer - when she started to take pride at last in a "menial" job we were proud and pleased. And finally, you can't make your kid want to spend time with you. Blackmail won't solve that.

Re: College Transition
Guest Sep 5, 11:47 a.m.
QUESTION: I am a 20-year college professor, and I spent the majority of this career teaching first-year students. Telling your student you will not pay their tuition is equivalent to telling your spouse you want a divorce: you are telling them you are ending their current work/living situation and their future life plans as they know them. Threatening to do this so they behave as you want is just as manipulative as when a spouse threatens to call the divorce lawyer "unless." I have had many, many students sit in my office, weeping, trying frantically to figure out how they will stay in school because their parents have threatened to stop paying for school unless they change their major to something they hate but that the parent prefers, go back in the closet, stop dating their partner, etc. Often the students ask for reassurance that, when they start lying to their parents, no one at the university will reveal the truth (because of FERPA, the student privacy law, as long as the student is a legal adult, the answer is almost always that we cannot reveal any information about them. Students, please think very carefully before signing FERPA waivers--and know that you can revoke them at any time). Alternatively, if parents make this threat too often, students stop caring, or they act first, rejecting their whole relationship with their parents along with the funding. I strongly encourage this parent to find other ways of resolving their disagreements with their adult child. Please make sure discussions about providing financial aid are calm, accurate, and only about your family's financial situation, rather than a leash to control your adult child's behavior.

Maybe the "second wife" didn't really want all that togetherness
Guest Sep 5, 11:55 a.m.
QUESTION: I think it is weird that she didn't mention you, but because it is so glaring perhaps it was a deliberate omission - to make the point that she did not want to be the "second" wife, but his wife. It would have been decent and honest to put your name in. But when you think about it, did she want all that togetherness? Or was it you and him and some unfinished business there? I have no doubt that your involvement was helpful, but maybe on some level it was also too much, and this is her way of claiming her space and family. So I agree that the, "Hey, I noticed..." approach is a good one. You might want to be prepared that she never liked the arrangement and maybe felt run roughshod over.

Was my daughter a great guest or a bad stepdaughter that week?
Guest Sep 5, 12:11 p.m.
QUESTION: My wife, our 2 children (5 and 7), and my mother-in-law spent two weeks at a beach house in August. My older daughter (Tess, 22) from my first marriage joined us for a week. Tess is very fair with blue eyes so is extremely careful about sun exposure. She got up early every morning to run on the beach and swim. I joined her several times. She would then head back to the house for a shower and nap and was back in bed when the rest of the family was eating breakfast. By the time she was awake again, we were all at the beach or out sightseeing. We’d return home at 4 or 5, just when Tess was ready for more beach time so we didn’t overlap during the day. Tess would fix dinner for herself (groceries she’d had delivered and paid for) about an hour or so after we were finished (we ate dinner early because of the kids). The kitchen was open to the living area so while she ate and cleaned up we were all able to chat. Tess would then head back to her bedroom to Facetime/text with friends or stream non-family friendly shows. She joined us for dinner out once and was always in bed by 11. She kept her bedroom and bathroom spotless. I was proud that she was so clean, considerate, and quiet so was shocked when I found out my wife was upset that Tess spent so little time with the rest of the family. I think it’s asking too much of a young adult on vacation from a demanding job to keep the same hours/activities as a family with small children. A lot of people her age would have been partying, chasing guys, leaving a mess so I thought she was a great guest. My wife and I can’t seem to reach an agreement here so decided to ask you which of us is being unreasonable.

ANSWER: So if your wife wins the Who's Right contest, then she wins the right to be mad?

I hope she takes a minute to think about that before pursuing this any further.

There is a chance here to think the best of someone vs thinking the worst, in an area (blended families) that is notoriously fraught with conflict and misunderstandings -- and to do so using the well-established channel of the benefit of the doubt. "Thanks, Pookie, for framing it that way for me. Now that I think about it, she was incredibly considerate of our space and our schedule." That's an example of what it looks like to make an effort to like someone, especially someone whose ways are different from one's own. Or just when there's a huge incentive to keep things warm and functional.

I could cast it in a totally practical light, too: You raised this daughter -- so it makes total sense that she'd be following your model of what makes a courteous guest under these conditions. Your wife, a different creature from I'm guessing a different set of habits, givens and customs, obviously works from a different model.

Now that your daughter's visit has exposed this difference, it makes sense to get rid of the whole "who's right" construct (yay) and have a happy "aha" moment where you realize this is what happened. Your daughter got an A+ on your test because that's the one she thought she was taking and you taught her to take. You and she didn't know, and it probably never occurred to your wife to say, that your wife was taught completely different things and so all along your daughter was getting a C- on your wife's test.

No harm intended or done. Right? (Right?) The whole point of being a great guest and stepdaughter is to contribute to the greater good of the family unit (which, in turn, promotes the health of the individuals in it -- it's cyclical). So it still makes sense to give benefits of doubts liberally and celebrate the good.

And if your wife would like your daughter to interact more next time, then she needs to learn from this to make that expectation clear to you, and you and she need to discuss ahead of time what that might look like while being respectful of her 22/23-year-oldness and thoroughly valid lack of interest in sunburns and elementary age field trips. Then you can talk to your daughter to float some ideas.

QUESTION: i am a married 41 year old trans guy, working at a very stable job at a family business. money is good, work is soul-crushing and boring, white collar industry that tends to lean to the right.

my wife and i are planning a potential move overseas (grad school for her, presumably new job for me) but i'm struggling in the interim. any tricks for 'making' myself more productive without believing in either the work or the future?

for what it's worth, i've been to a couple of marches, and have volunteered on campaigns in years prior. i plan on doing the same for the midterms but i feel like i'm part of the problem by not being a bigger part of the solution.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: You are not part of the problem. You have been relentlessly targeted, singled out and bullied by the problem.

That means, among other things, that if you need other people to be the solution for you right now, then that's absolutely fine. That's how compassionate people and civilized societies work. They recognize we can't (and shouldn't have to!) do everything all the time all by ourselves, and step up for each other when needed. That's the social contract.

To help you with your struggle in the meantime, I don't recommend "tricks." You're too smart for that. You know what just working and killing time are costing you. So I suggest instead that you think in terms of what can reconnect you with life and beauty. Think as small as you need to -- playing more music or going to more museums and galleries, for example. More walks. Gloriously trashy fiction or tv. If you have the time, then go bigger -- maybe a pet, a container garden, a new craft or hobby, a volunteer gig where you have regular interaction with the people you're helping. I'm giving a range because we're all so different, and what gives one life meaning can be a demoralizing drain on another.

And of course these things are always on advice-columnists' lists in do-something columns. But it's not what's on the list so much as the nature of it that I'm trying to convey -- get out of the "productivity" and "marches" mind set. Go to the "beauty of being human" well. That's the one I think will help.

How to treat kids fairly when it’s just not in my heart?
Guest Sep 5, 12:45 p.m.
QUESTION: My spouse and I are about to take on the care of our 14-year old nephew. His single adoptive parent is elderly and very ill.

We have a 14-year old daughter and an 11-year old son. They are wonderful kids and have always had the stability of a two-parent loving home.

The cousins do get along well.

I can already feel the tension of knowing that our nephew deserves our full efforts and love AND that I just do not love him the same way as I do my own children. Do I just fake it? The kids are clearly old enough to know, see, and feel the difference.
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm sure your nephew doesn't love you the way he loves his parent, either.

Why should he?

Things like that take time, and it's unrealistic to expect it to happen the moment life puts you together, just because. But that doesn't mean you won't ever form as loving a bond as any parent and child -- and that's where you can be the person your nephew needs. Just by opening your home, heart and family to him as another child. That means in standing, access, privileges, care.

It may seem cold to define it as a class of treatment, but that is what you can do honestly -- just not treat him as a second-class kid to the first-class daughter and son. To fake that you love him like your own child seems like it would be insulting his intelligence. And uncomfortable, no? Might he not resent that, even -- having anyone presume to be instant parent, especially as he deals with what must be scary feelings about his sick parent?

It's great that you're doing this, so please don't be so tough on yourself. Don't ask the impossible and then shame yourself for falling short. Be attentive and fair, be mindful of his comfort and need for space as he makes this adjustment, and, again, be open to getting to know him better and to having him as part of the family. Give it time.

panic when the work matters to me
Guest Sep 5, 1:14 p.m.
QUESTION: I am finally in a science ph.d. program, and the work fascinates me. I got through the grueling first year and am trying to write my thesis proposal, just a one-pager to start. I know what it is I want to say but an old panic is gripping me as I do it, imagining that everything rides on this. I can't seem to grasp the idea of allowing a draft and moving forward. Does this mean I'm not cut out for this? Is there a way to do this better?
avatar
Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: I'm just an opinionated stranger so I don't know what it means. But you say it's an old panic, and when it came out of your past and tracked you down, it found you in a science PhD program -- so I'm inclined to think it means you have an obstacle you've worked around in the past, which suggests you can probably work around it again.

Since dealing with old panics over and over again is annoying, and since proposals (grant vs thesis, presumably) are probably here to stay now, this would be a good time to workshop some permanent fixes.

Some ideas: There's the psychology-centered route, where you talk to someone who specifically addresses performance. There's the writing-centered route, where you shake up your techniques -- instead of typing, for example, you can talk your words into a file, just to introduce a small disruption in the pattern. There's the vagus-nerve centered route, where you walk, breathe, meditate, do yoga before your writing sessions. There's the logic-centered route, where you look back at your career to remind yourself of your ability to manage -- to quiet the doubting voice.

You get the idea.

Most writer's block is a matter of not knowing what you want to say, so if you really do have your points all teed up and ready to go, then you're in better shape than you realize.

Trying to be Switzerland
Guest Sep 5, 1:43 p.m.
QUESTION: My husband has had a strained relationship with his dad since husband's mom passed away seven years ago -- and his dad started dating (and having women stay at his house) literally four weeks later. Husband still loves his dad and sees him once or twice a year and they talk on the phone occasionally. The relationship is just not as close as it could be or once was. My SIL, on the other hand, has gone no contact with her dad.

About five years ago, FIL moved in with a woman (not the one he was dating so quickly after MIL's death) who is trying to repair/reinforce the relationship between dad and his children. And she's trying to enlist my help. I told her I thought the reasons for the estrangement were valid -- my husband's dad was really insensitive to his children's grief -- and I didn't think it was her or my role to broker any situation between my FIL and his children.

I told my mom this and she was appalled at my response, so now I'm second-guessing myself. Should I try to reconnect the family? Even if I wanted to, can I?

The other issue is that -- independent of everything else -- my husband does NOT like his dad's girlfriend...and that is rare for my husband. So any aversion my husband has to spending time with his dad is only worsened if it means the girlfriend is going to be involved.

Carolyn Hax
Advice Columnist
ANSWER: If your husband and sister-in-law learned from the experience of their mother's death and its aftermath that they really just don't like their father or think he's a good person, then so be it. Their prerogative and they've known him all their lives. This could be a simple actions-have-consequences culmination.

But if the sole basis of these estrangements is their judging him for being with women "too soon," then I'm seeing boundary issues here. His kids don't get to tell him how to grieve or when it is or isn't okay to be with another woman. They can have their opinions, sure, but it's not about them. Just as their parents' marriage wasn't about them. They grieve their ways, he grieves his way.

There's also no one conclusion to be drawn from his behavior. Some widow(er)s are so bereft without their spouses they kind of lose it, and grab the first person who walks by. Or, other extreme, it can be a sign the marriage was oppressive to them and they hung in there and hung in there like they thought they were supposed to ... and oops kind of go a little overboard a few weeks after the funeral.

Just two possibilities. Are they admirable? Hardly. But does "messy" justify seven years of not- or barely speaking as punishment for not handling his kids' feelings cleanly?

Or the other person was on the scene before the death -- which can be anything from a total betrayal to totally out in the open all along, because lives are incredibly complicated.

I'm 50 percent with you on your response to your FIL's new person. "I didn't think it was her or my role to broker any situation between my FIL and his children" is concise and sound -- but it was all you needed. There was no need to tell her what you thought of the reasons for the estrangement, and not just because I happen to think they got up in their dad's business ... disproportionately. It's not your place to be the broker whether their reasons were valid or not.

The upshot is, your second-guessing was founded and worthwhile, imo, but takes you to the same place: no to making it your job to reconnect the family. But if you ever want to broach the topic of anyone's standing to judge another's response to a death, then that might be a fascinating conversation :)

re: PhD writing
Guest Sep 5, 1:49 p.m.
QUESTION: As a practicing faculty member in science, pretty much all scientists get writer's block sometimes. And pretty much everything we write gets revised a lot. So first drafts are cheap--and you're the only one who needs to see your early drafts. I guarantee you can say your ideas in different ways. So start by saying it one way. See if you can say it a little better. Add an idea. Just start any old how, then refine a little bit at a time. After awhile, it'll be in enough shape to show it to someone else for some feedback.

Also, where's your supervisor in this discussion? good ones should be open to you naming this as an issue to work on throughout your degree. . .you're there to learn and get better at stuff, no? so this is a thing to get better at.

QUESTION: About adoptive and "thrown together" families. You don't have to love-love-love everyone the same, all the time. In fact, the story you describe, sometimes safety, strength, comfort and fun are more important than the "softee" feeling of "love". Love is something you can feel (or not) but a healthy person is "built" thru meals, comfort, conversations, board games, movie watching, eating together, comfortable space to just BE (a room, a seat at the table, a car ride)... small, practical, healthy gestures that say (and show) that YOU ARE SAFE HERE. goes a long way. is that love? i dunno, i hope so!

ANSWER: Ah, I love this. This is also exactly, perfectly described, what warm, welcoming homes offer all kinds of people who can use a place to feel safe. The ones that first came to mind were kids' friends who come over a lot because their own homes aren't so kind or stable. Thank you.

Daughter—Good Beach Guest or Not

QUESTION: Good grief, Carolyn, is it so hard to just answer the question in a sentence two? The answer is, “Your daughter was a good guest and your wife is too sensitive.”

ANSWER: When telling someone, "You're too sensitive," makes someone stop being too sensitive, then I'll start doing it your way.

QUESTION: Another trans guy here. What I had to realize for myself is that trans advocacy via marching/protests was not the correct lane for me. I am an introverted person, and just because I am being targeted in so many ways, it doesn’t suddenly make me an extroverted person. I’ve found the best lane for me is conservation with those around to me (family, coworkers, etc) to make sure they have accurate information and ask them to support me/other trans people when I am not there to do so myself. And then, as Carolyn recommended, I spend time walking through the woods and engaging in other solo hobbies to help maintain some grounding.

QUESTION: My husband and I (both in our late 30s) have very different approaches to conflict. I want to talk things through right away, while he tends to shut down and say he needs space. When we argue, I feel abandoned when he walks away, and he says he feels attacked when I keep pushing. We both agree we love each other and don’t want every disagreement to turn into a blowup, but we haven’t found a way to meet in the middle. How can we handle conflict without repeating this same pattern every time?

ANSWER: Start by talking about this pattern at a calm time, not in the middle of an argument. Name what happens in neutral terms: you pursue, he withdraws, and both of you end up feeling misunderstood. Then, instead of arguing about who is “right,” see if you can agree on a shared goal: “When we disagree, we want both people to feel heard and neither person to feel cornered or abandoned.”

From there, negotiate some specific ground rules. For example: if he needs a break, he agrees to say, “I’m overwhelmed; I need 30 minutes and then I’ll come back and talk,” and you agree to honor that time-limited pause instead of following him from room to room. In return, you ask that when he comes back, he stays engaged for a set amount of time before calling another break. You can also agree to use “I” statements (“I felt shut out when you left the room”) instead of global labels (“You always run away”), which lower the emotional temperature. If these patterns are deeply rooted, a few sessions with a couples therapist can give you both a neutral referee and practice tools that feel less personal and more like skills you’re learning together.

QUESTION: I’m a 29-year-old woman who recently moved in with my boyfriend. I’ve noticed that his mom texts and calls him multiple times a day about minor things—what he ate, whether he got enough sleep, if he remembered to bring a jacket. He usually answers right away and sometimes even leaves our plans hanging to respond. When I bring it up, he says I’m overreacting and that she “just worries.” I don’t want to be the person who makes him choose between me and his mom, but I also feel like we’re never fully alone. How can I set boundaries here without sounding controlling?

ANSWER: You don’t need to make this about his mother’s worth as a parent; you can keep it focused on what you need in your relationship. Start by describing specific moments instead of labeling the whole dynamic: “When we’re in the middle of dinner and you step away to text your mom for ten minutes, I feel pushed to the side.” Then follow it with a clear request: “When we’re on a date or having a planned evening together, I’d like us both to silence non‑urgent notifications unless there’s an emergency.”

It may help to frame this as a growing-up step rather than a rejection of his mom: “Part of living together is learning to protect time that’s just ours. That doesn’t mean you love your mom any less—it just means we’re building our own household.” Ask him what feels reasonable to him: maybe he checks in with her once a day at a predictable time, instead of constantly. If he refuses to consider any limits at all, that’s not about his mom; it’s about whether he’s ready to prioritize your shared life. In that case, the harder question is not “How do I change his contact with her?” but “Can I accept being in a relationship where our time as a couple is always second place?”

<END_OF_SET>

QUESTION: My partner and I have very different social batteries. I’m an introvert who needs quiet evenings to recharge after work, while she loves to host people and have something on the calendar most nights. When I say I need a night in, she takes it as a rejection and says I’m “never up for anything.” When she fills our week with plans, I start to dread it and feel resentful. We both feel criticized and misunderstood. How can we find a rhythm that doesn’t leave one of us exhausted and the other one lonely?

ANSWER: Treat this as a logistics puzzle, not a character judgment. You’re not “boring” and she’s not “too much”; you simply have different settings that need to be respected. Start by mapping out a typical week together and literally blocking off “quiet nights” and “social nights” on a shared calendar. For example, you might agree that two evenings a week are guaranteed quiet time at home, two are open for social plans together, and the rest are flexible.

On her high‑social nights, she can still make plans without you, as long as that’s discussed in advance and not treated as punishment. On your quiet nights, you commit to being present with her—phones down, some shared activity—even if it’s low‑key. Make sure you both have something to look forward to: she gets her people time, you get your recharge time, and neither of you is surprised by a last‑minute jammed schedule. If this continues to be a sore spot, a counselor can help you both translate “I feel rejected” and “I feel overwhelmed” into specific, negotiable needs instead of accusations.

QUESTION: My husband and I have been married for 10 years, and while it's mostly been a good marriage with the usual ups and downs, a toxic dynamic has evolved where both of us rush to blame the other during arguments. For example, last week our cat escaped and my youngest child and I spent several hours looking for her before a neighbor thankfully found and returned her. The relief of having her back should have been the end of it, but instead the incident sparked a painful argument about whose "fault" it was—-my husband blamed me for leaving the door open when I went out to tend to our plants (I was only outside for a few minutes), while I blamed him because the only reason I went out to water the plants was that he had neglected to do it after saying he would take care of them. The argument was unproductive, as almost all of our arguments are. We've been in couples therapy but haven't made much progress, in part because my husband doesn't take therapy seriously. How can we overcome this blame dynamic and develop a better marital relationship?

ANSWER: This is a common problem, so you're hardly alone in facing this. Your husband's reluctance to take therapy seriously is discouraging, but there are other approaches you can take. During a moment when both of you are calm, approach him and say something like, "Honey, I've noticed that when we fight, we often blame each other for problems, and this doesn't resolve anything. It just results in hurt feelings for both of us. What do you think we can do to address this?"

Much will depend on how he responds. If he doesn't respond well, particularly after repeated attempts to address this amicably, then it might behoove you to engage in solo therapy to explore any underlying problems behind this pattern. But if he is open to engaging with you, try this exercise: the next time you have an argument and one of you starts blaming the other, get out a piece of paper and each of you write down possible solutions, with a rule that nobody can write anything blaming the other partner—just focus on solutions. Blame is a dynamic that tends to be self-reinforcing: the more you resort to blame, the more it feels natural, but the good news is that it works the other way as well—the less you engage in blame over time, the less it becomes the default way of "solving" problems. Over time, this exercise should help change this difficult dynamic while also solving the original problems more quickly. I would also recommend reading John Gottman's book, "The 7 Principles for Making Marriage Work," which contains excellent advice about the blame game and other marital challenges.

QUESTION: My husband and I are facing a dilemma over how to respond to a problem with how his family treats his brother. Both of us have long suspected that my husband's brother is gay. At one point, the brother even came to my husband asking for advice on how to come out of the closet. However, in large part because of their family's attitudes, the brother has never actually come out to them. From time to time, I overhear some of my husband's family, particularly my father-in-law, make offensive and cruel remarks about gay people. I don't know if the father-in-law suspects that one of his sons is gay or not, but regardless, this creates an alienating environment for us and obviously especially for the brother.

Our dilemma is on how to respond to this, if at all. I would like for us, or at least for my husband, to bring this up with his father and to make clear that we don't approve of these cruel remarks. My husband has made it clear that even though he strongly disapproves of the anti-gay remarks, he wants to preserve his relationship with his father and doesn't want to intervene. I tend to feel that since it's his family, he should have more of a say on how to engage with them. But it really hurts to stand by and say nothing while my husband's father creates such an intolerant environment. Do you think that we should just let this go or do you feel that it's worth risking our relationship with his father to try to improve the situation?

ANSWER: What about the brother's opinion of all this? Before confronting his father, why don't you two, or just your husband, approach the brother and gently ask him what he thinks the best course of action is? Given that he seems to be the one most affected by the remarks, his opinion should be given special weight. Only confront the father if the brother is okay with that. You don't want to risk a backlash by confronting the father and then him responding by treating his son even worse. And even though what the father is saying is clearly abhorrent, the son that you suspect is gay might have his own reasons for wanting to preserve his own relationship with his father.

Regardless of whether you choose to confront the father directly, there are more subtle ways that you can send signals of disapproval about the remarks. For instance, you can limit your visits to those particular relatives when the father is around. You can also invite the brother to spend more time with you and your husband separately, apart from his parents. And the next time you happen to overhear a remark, you might consider going the route of asking a question as opposed to direct confrontation. That is, maybe you could ask the father, "If you were gay, how would you feel about other people saying that about you?" I've often found that when dealing with difficult people, asking them respectful but direct critical questions is often a more effective strategy than simply laying down the law and telling them that they're wrong. Although I admit, I'm human too, and often the temptation for the latter is quite strong in that type of situation. But regardless of what approach you take, remember that empathy and compassion should be your guiding lights. Make sure that the brother's needs are first and foremost in whatever solution you decide on.

QUESTION: My wife and I are expecting our first child, a daughter. As you might imagine, we're over the moon about being new parents and nurturing and loving this new human. Nevertheless, my wife and I are engaged in a nasty recurring argument over whether to baptize our future daughter. My wife came from a fairly secular family but experienced trauma in her early adulthood, including a sexual assault. She found an on-campus religious community that provided tremendous support to her in her healing. And after college she has continued to attend church in that same denomination. She's been a part of this denomination for about 15 years at this point, and I have nothing against her doing this. Obviously she's an autonomous adult, and we don't have to agree on religion. But in my case, I'm an atheist who had some very bad experiences with religion growing up, including multiple attempts to proselytize me. I also had a friend who was abused by a priest. And so for me, organized religion is the root of much evil with corporate greed being the root of most of the rest.

My wife wants to baptize our daughter in her denomination because she wants to pass on to her child the deep connection that she has to her faith. And also, I suspect, because she feels that on some level being part of this religious community might shield her daughter from the trauma that she went through as a younger woman. But for me, I worry that baptizing our daughter in this religion would essentially brainwash and indoctrinate her. I fear our daughter wanting to marry young and then becoming obedient to her husband due to our church's teachings. The denomination is one of the more conservative ones, and I don't agree with most of their teachings. I want our daughter to be a strong young woman, not a slave to her future husband because of religious brainwashing. Should I just give in and let her get indoctrinated, or should I fight harder for her to not be baptized?

ANSWER: It seems like you're falling into a trap that many religious and secular people fall into: framing a problem as a strict black-and-white either/or matter. Fundamentally, it seems to me that both you and your wife are coming from a place of love, and your differences are rooted in very different life experiences with religion. I don't know how much you've talked to your wife about this, but if you haven't, I would suggest first having an open and frank discussion with her about religion in general and what it means to each of you. Frame this in a way that respects her beliefs and life experiences while also reminding her that yours are just as valid, and agree to temporarily stay away from the subject of your daughter's potential baptism. This might help you two to get on the same page on religion in general, and not just over the question of baptizing your daughter. 

Then, when you two have found some common ground over religion (even if it is very limited), return to the subject of the baptism. There might be multiple ways to skin this cat that respect both of your viewpoints and beliefs. For instance, might you agree to having the daughter baptized in a more liberal denomination? This might satisfy your wife's wishes for her to be baptized as a Christian without being baptized in the same denomination whose beliefs you find so problematic. This might seem like an unacceptable compromise, but it's worked for a lot of couples. For instance, when I was dating my wife, I was very reluctant to convert to the dominant religion of her family because I found it unpalatable in many ways. But we compromised, and I converted into a more liberal denomination of the faith, which ended up working out fairly well for us. And don't forget to keep in mind the bigger picture of what your daughter herself might eventually want. Hopefully you and your wife would both agree that when your daughter is old enough to do so, she should be the one to determine her future path, be it a religious path or a secular one. So I think it makes sense to expose her to a mixture of religious and secular viewpoints. The exact contours of this will, of course, be up to you and your wife and eventually up to her. But by coming from a place of compassion and love, you will put her in a position to be well-equipped to make her own faith decision when the time comes.

QUESTION: I am the oldest of three daughters, and my family has always placed a heavy emphasis on achievement and success, conventionally defined—my father is a physician, and my mother is a renowned lawyer, and my younger siblings and I all followed in their footsteps, becoming professionals of various stripes. We're all reasonably happy in our lives, though we face a lot of stress. But I've been encountering one particular problem that has caused me to question some of the values I grew up with. Last year, when my car broke down on the side of the road, I waited 3 hours for AAA, but they never came. Just as hour 4 began, a kindly man around my age drove up in his truck and offered to fix the problem, refusing the money I offered as compensation. On a whim, I asked him if he might want to meet for coffee, and we really hit it off. Now we're in a promising relationship. He came from a working class family and aside from his vocational education, hasn't had much formal education; he's an auto mechanic. But after I told my parents about our relationship, they strongly disapproved, making harsh remarks about me throwing away my life with some "grease monkey" and emphasizing that both of my siblings were married or engaged to fellow highly paid professionals.

I love my parents, but I don't like the way they're treating me or my partner, and now I'm starting to question the ruthless Type A values I was raised to believe in. I have no desire to throw away my professional career, but I'm also queasy about obsessing over status the way I once did. When it comes to my family, should I just keep them at arm's length for as long as I'm in this relationship? Or do you think it's worth trying to confront them and getting them to see the light?

ANSWER: I would agree that your parents are acting inappropriately. We have enough problems with class and income inequality in our society without people throwing fuel on the fire by acting with such disrespect towards those who are different. (Gets down from soap box.) The fact and appropriateness of your relationship with a mechanic is none of their business. You definitely should not feel the need to "hide" your beau to "keep them at arm's length" Without first engaging with your parents directly on this matter. If I were in your shoes, I would sit down with the parents if possible (I don't know if you live close enough to them to do that; if not, then consider a good phone conversation.). I would convey to them that while you love them, you also don't like how they've been treating either of you or the snide remarks they've been making about him. You might say something like, "How would you feel if the roles were reversed, and you were a working-class person being looked down upon by an upper-middle-class professional? Would that make you feel good?" You might also remind them that assuming you're not part of the 0.01% in this country, there are people above you and your parents on the socio-economic ladder that look down on you just as much as your parents look down on this mechanic. You can also remind them that you're an adult capable of making your own decisions. If you want to flatter them, throw in something about them having equipped you well to make these decisions. But fundamentally, keep to the principle that it's your life, not theirs, and act accordingly. I wish you and your partner every happiness.

QUESTION: Like so many others, my teenage daughter is struggling with an eating disorder. In her case, she's lost so many pounds in the last few weeks that she barely resembles her old self. She's obsessed with the idea that she's fat, but in reality, she's dangerously underweight. Making matters worse, my husband seems to not take her situation seriously enough. While I fear for her life if she doesn't get treatment soon, my husband often brushes off the subject when I talk to him about it. He says things like, "Oh, she's just going through a phase," or "Maybe she just doesn't like the food that you cook." I think that my daughter is overhearing this and it might be encouraging her to starve herself even more.

I've always been the non-confrontational type, which I fear has contributed to my daughter getting into the mess that she's in. So I'm not sure really how to confront my husband about this. What do you suggest?

ANSWER: As you noted, this is a life-or-death situation. What I would do is urgently get both your daughter and husband educated on the serious problem of eating disorders, "tout de suite." First, if you haven't already, inform your daughter of the following resources: the 24/7 eating disorder hotline (866-932-1264) and the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD) Helpline (888-375-7767). I would also insist that both your daughter and your husband visit the website of the National Eating Disorders Association, particularly their helpful article "Busting The Myths About Eating Disorders" (https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/busting-myths-about-eating-disorders/). 

The immediate problem, of course, is helping your daughter to get healthy and overcome the disorder, and to learn the skills needed to prevent relapses in the future. This starts with a conversation with her primary care physician and also her therapist, if she has one. But I suspect you're doing most of this already. What you wrote to me about was really a problem of attitudes and education on the part of your husband. In addition to showing him the above-mentioned resources, I would have a serious conversation with him about how his attitudes might be harming his daughter. There is also some underlying sexism and misogyny in his remarks, particularly about what he said about the food that you cook. But educating him on eating disorders is the first priority. Then you can have a longer discussion with him (ideally also with a couples therapist) addressing some of these problematic assumptions that he seems to have about you and about gender roles.

Finally, by all means, whenever your husband makes one of these remarks and there's even the possibility that your daughter could have been around, seek her out at your first opportunity and emphasize to her that what her father said was wrong. Tell her the facts in a calm manner, not to demonize her father but rather to show that his harmful views aren't correct. Facts and sincere affirmation are the best antidotes to misguided and harmful ignorance.

QUESTION: I feel that I'm a walking, breathing cliche. I'm a 54-year-old woman whose similarly-aged husband cheated on me with his 24-year-old secretary. It's really the oldest story on God's green earth. I naively took him at his word when he told me that he was working late on Monday and Wednesday evenings. He told me that he had a big project to finish up, and his boss had laid off his assistant, so he was forced to do two people's jobs. Thus, he had to spend many hours at work outside of the workday to get it all done. 

Imagine my surprise when my best friend told me that she had seen my husband and a much younger woman out at a nice restaurant after working hours while my friend was on a date there! I confronted him, and after initial predictable denials, he confessed. He told me that she made him feel young and wanted. Again, you can find countless examples of this story down to the small details. But now that I'm reeling from this betrayal, I'm wondering whether to stay or to leave him. He has always been a good husband and provider, and I believe him when he told me that he hasn't slept with anybody outside of the marriage except for the secretary. He swore to me that he would change. However, a couple of weeks ago, after we tried to reconcile, my friend once again saw him out with the girlfriend at the same restaurant. (He could have at least been smart about it and gone to a different restaurant with her.) Clearly he hasn't ended things with her. He has many good qualities, but I don't know if I can forgive him for this. Should I stay or should I go?

ANSWER: I'm sorry that you're in this situation. Nobody deserves to be cheated on. Whether to stay or go in the event of an extramarital affair is one of those questions where good, reasonable people can disagree. Some are of the opinion that even one incident of cheating is too much, and that the trust can never be restored. On the other hand, others subscribe to the school of thought of allowing their partners a second or even third chance. Clearly you're at least open to the possibility of taking him back, but given that this betrayal has happened multiple times and that the deceit is continuing after his assurances that it wouldn't, I would be hesitant about taking him back.

If you haven't already, find a good therapist to discuss this question with. Try to look for larger patterns. For instance, have you been cheated on before and then taken a partner back? What happened then? Your husband told you that he hasn't cheated on you with anyone except for the secretary, but has he engaged in any other dishonest behavior, such as using family money for questionable purposes? Usually when somebody is deceitful or dishonest in one area, they act similarly in other areas. Ultimately, the decision on whether to stay or go is yours, but I would exercise caution regarding his ability to change given what you've experienced thus far. If there were a graveyard for all failed relationships and marriages, probably about half of the headstones would read: "She tried to change him."

QUESTION: I'm engaged to a wonderful man. We've been together for two years, and even though we've had our ups and downs, it's mostly been great. But we've hit a major snag when it comes to wedding planning. Since he proposed a couple of months ago, our first concern has been cost. We're both graduate students, and we're several years away from being able to earn good money. I come from a modest background where there was never much extra money growing up. But my fiancé's family is much wealthier. His parents agreed to pay for the entire wedding, which really floored me and was something that we gratefully accepted. But there was a catch. Since they've agreed to fund the wedding, they've been trying to dictate to us non-stop every little detail, right down to the color of the flowers. They've even hinted in a backhanded way that they might withdraw financial support for our wedding if we don't do things exactly their way.

I understand the need to take family concerns into consideration when planning a wedding, but we want to be able to make a lot of decisions ourselves. After all, we're the ones getting married. My dilemma is whether or not to just suck it up and let them dictate how the wedding should be done to the last detail, or whether we should push back. A third option would be to elope, which honestly part of me really wants to do. But I've always wanted a big wedding and really hope that we can somehow have our cake and eat it too. How do you suggest approaching this?

ANSWER: I'm sorry that your dream wedding is coming with so many strings attached, but unfortunately, that's fairly common. What I'd suggest you do first is have an honest conversation with your fiancé. Sit down and discuss: what are the essentials that you must have in your wedding? What are some things that you can negotiate on? And what are some things that you don't particularly care about? Then, you might want to make a list as to what your preferences are in each of those categories versus what his parents' preferences are. This will help you have a holistic view to see whether there's enough alignment with their preferences to, as you say, "suck it up" and go along with what they want.

If you're generally okay with their direction but have a few deal-breakers, then I would suggest talking to them in a compassionate and loving manner. Tell them that you're extremely grateful for their support for the wedding, but there are a few details that you want to have different than what they envision. Hopefully, they'll be reasonable and accept that not every little detail can be dictated by them regardless of who's paying. And then there's the nuclear option of either eloping or holding a much more modest wedding within your means. I wouldn't rule this out, especially if your preliminary discussion with your partner reveals that there are just too many differences between your vision of the wedding and what his parents' vision of the wedding is. Weddings tend to be unconscionably expensive, but there are definitely ways that you can reduce costs. Having a small guest list is the most obvious of these, though of course that comes with its own social politics. I'd also recommend that you check out "The Budget-Savvy Wedding Planner & Organizer: Checklists, Worksheets, and Essential Tools to Plan the Perfect Wedding on a Small Budget" by Jessica Bishop. It's chock-full of useful suggestions on how to economize wedding planning and still have a beautiful and meaningful ceremony without breaking the bank. Good luck.

QUESTION: My wife and I have been married for about 15 years. For the first few years, our sex life was great. We were, as the saying goes, "f***ing like bunnies". But as the years wore on, especially once we had kids, we hit a rough spot in the bedroom. Since we had our second and final child, my wife only wants sex once every few weeks, and sometimes once every few months. When we do have sex, I almost always have to initiate, and she's just not as, shall we say, vigorous as was the case before. I love my wife and want to respect her preferences, but at the same time, I feel that my sexual needs are no longer being met. Am I doomed to spend the rest of my days in a sexually unsatisfying marriage, or is there hope for us?

ANSWER: As you might be aware, this is a very common problem, but that doesn't make it any less painful. Since there is such a huge spectrum of sexual desire/libido among humans, it's very likely that any given marriage will have a mismatch in libido, be it large or small. Working this out depends on many things, particularly:
1. How large the libido gap is
2. The personalities of the partners
3. How open both partners are to compromise

There are, of course, a few basic ground rules:
1. Nobody should ever have sex that they don't want to have
2. Any negotiations about sex should be done in a loving and compassionate manner

With that in mind, have a frank discussion with your wife about this issue. Frame the problem not as her not giving you what you want, but rather as an apparent mismatch in sexual interest. Don't frame your own higher libido as better or normative. Approach this in a compassionate manner, and ask if she might be willing to compromise. For instance, ask if you both could have sex a little more often, but still within her comfort zone. Also, there is a lot of stigma around this, but there is no shame in satisfying your needs on the side as long as it doesn't involve an extra-marital affair. That is, as long as it's done ethically. By this I mean, well, sometimes taking solo flights when the dual flight is canceled or delayed. Almost all married people, even in happy marriages, satisfy themselves sometimes. And that's perfectly normal, as long as it doesn't substitute for your actual sex life. For a compassionate and common-sense view of such matters, and male sexuality in general, I'd highly recommend checking out Bernie Zilbergeld's book, "The New Male Sexuality." It's an oldie but goodie that even after a few decades still stands the test of time.

QUESTION: My husband has a habit of criticizing me when I do something wrong, or when he thinks I do something wrong. This behavior has unfortunately been escalating over the past few months. It started even before our wedding. For instance, he would remark upon my having chosen the "wrong" dress rather than telling a white lie that he liked the dress. Also, he would say things like, "You must be so glad you found me given how you were living before." Like most people in love, I brushed off these red flags, thinking that he would change after the wedding. But alas, things only got worse from there. Now that we've been married several years and have two kids, he started insulting me in front of the kids. He also tries to make me believe things that I know aren't true. For instance, by repeating lies to me, such as accusing me of losing our house keys, when in fact he's the one who misplaced them. They were found in the pocket of his suit jacket, for goodness sake!

My husband is mostly a wonderful man and a good father, and I dread the prospect of becoming a single mother, so I don't want to lose him. I've tried talking with him about the insults, but he always brushes me off. Is there a way that I can address this to salvage the marriage? Or do you think I should look for the exit?

ANSWER: Oh my goodness, you should run and not walk to the exit door. This is a textbook case of emotional and verbal abuse and gaslighting. Your husband insults you even after you've pointed it out and asked him to stop. He tries to get you to believe things that you know aren't true, and thus to undermine your confidence in yourself and your sense of reality, which is the definition of gaslighting. And he's doing it in front of your children. You even say that these are "red flags." This marriage is clearly beyond the point of no return. Rather than trying to change him, you should look for the safest and quickest way out of the marriage, which I know won't be easy.

The good news is that there are resources for domestic violence victims like you to get out safely. The first steps should be to find a time when he's not around and call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233. This service is available in many languages to everyone who needs it. They will help you devise an escape plan. Also, what support network do you have? Do you have a mother or sister or brother or best friend who could help you? Speak to someone who you trust about the situation. Hopefully, they will see the obvious fact that this is domestic abuse and they will rush to help. If not, don't let them convince you that what you're seeing isn't true. Go to somebody else you trust. If you don't have anyone around you who you trust, then find a local women's shelter. They can provide you with a lot of resources. And when the time comes, of course, you'll need to visit an attorney. But your safety comes before everything else. You deserve so much better, and you need to get out now. Good luck to you.

QUESTION: I'm engaged to be married to a wonderful man we met online about a year and a half ago. When he proposed, I was really over the moon. This has been a fairytale story, except for one major aspect: my extremely religious sister doesn't approve of him. Why? It boils down to the fact that he's divorced. In our religious tradition, if you enter into marriage with somebody, even if the marriage itself was not in this tradition, and you then divorce, our church has to find a reason why the divorce is invalid in order to permit the person to marry a second time within this church. It's called an annulment. My fiance has been willing to go quite far for my family with regards to religion, including even getting baptized, albeit not in our same denomination. But very reasonably, he's decided not to do an annulment on the grounds that it would be an unacceptable intrusion into his private life. And he's right. We don't need priests digging into his past life.

But this refusal to do the annulment is a deal-breaker for my sister, who will only attend my wedding if the annulment happens and if my fiance gets baptized into the "right" sect. It's looking like a real possibility that my sister will skip the wedding. I really want her there, and I've tried to explain this to her and get her to understand that even though she may not agree with the wedding or with my choice of a partner, she needs to attend because that's what sisters who love their sisters do. I am politically liberal, but if she were to marry someone who's a huge Trump supporter and conservative, I wouldn't hesitate to attend. (She is single now.) Because again that's what sisters do.

Is there a way that I can approach the topic that I haven't thought of that might help come around to seeing reason, or should I just deal with not having my beloved sister at the wedding? (Oh, and one thing I forgot to mention, I encouraged her to see a priest to discuss this matter on the hopes that he would tell her something along the lines of: "Yes, go to the wedding because you love your sister and it's the right thing to do. It's not anything that will undermine your faith or commitment to God." But she won't go, and my husband suspects the reason is because she knows that the priest will probably say something along these lines.)

ANSWER: Your predicament is unfortunate, and I'm sorry you have to go through that. Unfortunately, when dealing with other adults, there's always only so much that you can do to get them to do what you want. It seems like you have tried to engage her in a loving and compassionate manner, and try to convince her to come to the wedding, but it sounds like she won't budge. You might try one more time with something along the lines of: "[Sister], I know that you love me and I love you. And I would gladly attend your wedding if you have one in the future, regardless of the groom that you choose or what his faith is. So can you please find it within yourself to come to our wedding? It's not going to be any judgment on you or your faith. It's just an expression of love for me, and it would mean the world to me."

My only other real suggestion to try to get her to come around would be something that you've already effectively ruled out: talking to a faith leader in her tradition about the subject. You might still consider talking to a faith leader yourself and with your partner, but without your sister present. Not because you think he's going to give you some sort of argument to convince her to come to the wedding, but just to hear his perspective. (If this is the faith that I think it is, the priest will only be a "he".) He might give you a compassionate perspective on accepting your sister not coming to the wedding because realistically, that seems to be your only real option at this point assuming that your Hail Mary (sorry) doesn't pan out. As hard as it may be, don't take it personally and encourage your fiancé to not take it personally either. This is all about the sister and has nothing to do with you or your fiancé or your choice of a partner. So go to the wedding, enjoy it, and savor the time around people you love. Your sister will be there for other events. Above all, try not to let her absence dominate your experience of the wedding. Her absence is unfortunate, but it's one of those things that happens in life that one just has to deal with. I wish you and your fiance many years of happiness and a beautiful wedding.

QUESTION: My partner and I are both liberal, but most of my family is strongly conservative, as in hardcore Trump-loving conservative. As you can imagine, we've had our share of disagreements, but we've found ways to agree to disagree. We just try not to discuss politics, and we have a rule to never talk to each other on the day of a major election, like the midterms or a presidential election. This has worked reasonably well for us and has managed to keep us in relatively close contact.

The problem is that my partner, who's an outspoken activist in our local Democratic Party, refuses to come to family events. He came to our Easter celebration one year and was visibly upset by some of the things that my parents said regarding Trump and immigrants. Even though I 100% agree with my partner that those things were wrong, it's still important for me to spend time with my family. Lately, my partner will make excuses for not coming to family events. He'll say he's too tired or he'll say that it's too long of a drive (they live 3 hours away, but my husband routinely makes drives longer than that for work and to go to his video game conventions.) 

My family has asked why he's not coming, and I have to fudge it or come up with half-true excuses. They're smart people, and they've started to suspect the real reason for his not coming. I've tried to talk to him about it, but again he's always evasive. Should I sit down with him and ask him point-blank to please tell me the truth so we can clear the air? Or should I respect his opinions as a fellow adult and just drop the matter?

ANSWER: This is a difficult situation, I'm sorry. On the surface, I feel for your partner, as I have similar political opinions to the two of you, and I still get roiled up when I hear certain types of remarks, even after 10 years of Donald Trump being in the national political spotlight. But I still think that your partner is being a bit of a coward. He won't admit what's plainly obvious to you and what your family is starting to catch on to. It's fine to have differing opinions, but one shouldn't tell half-truths or be evasive when it comes to the reason for not seeing their significant other's family. At this point, this is starting to cost you time with people you love, and that's not okay. So, what I would do is sit down with him and have the conversation that you propose. Tell him that you know the real reason why he's avoiding them. And that it's deceitful and insulting to your intelligence for him to not admit that. And then tell him that you want to be around your family more than he's allowing you to be (assuming that's true). Ask him to reconsider his boycott of your family if only for your sake. You might want to reassure him about how you have found ways of accommodating political differences with your family, and tell him that he can use similar strategies with them to do the same. (And if your family is anything like conservative (and liberal) relatives that I know, they will care more about his character and how he treats you than how he votes at the ballot box.) Right now, frankly, his actions don't reflect well on his character.

If he still won't be accommodating to you after having a frank and honest discussion with him and laying out what I just said and anything else that you feel to be important, then honestly, I'd reconsider your choice of a partner. You don't want to be around somebody who's not willing to experience discomfort for the sake of their partner or to defend their beliefs in the presence of people who disagree with them. Because if you go on to marry this person or have a lifelong partnership with them outside of marriage, what would you be signing up for? Do you want decades with someone who won't stand up for you or defend what he believes in when challenged?

QUESTION: I'm going through a nasty divorce. My husband and I were married for about 20 years, and the marriage unraveled for a variety of reasons. Yes, there was infidelity, but that honestly wasn't the biggest part of it. The infidelity was really a symptom rather than a cause of what broke us up. Effectively, we just weren't communicating well, and we realized that we would be happier with other people.

The specific problem that I am writing to you about is our families' very different opinions about divorce and their impacts on me. Not to be stereotypical, but my family is from the West Coast, and they have a more relaxed attitude towards things like divorce. Obviously they don't like divorce, but they accept that it's sometimes necessary when a marriage has run its course or otherwise is damaged beyond repair. They're being very compassionate and graceful towards me and even towards him. My soon-to-be ex-husband's family, on the other hand, is much more religious and conservative. They feel that divorce is a sin and that he needs to stay in the marriage at all costs. Perhaps owing to the fact that their religious tradition is more than a little patriarchal, they've been venting most of their anger on me rather than him. Even though he's the one who cheated. They've been making snide remarks towards me about how I didn't cut it as a wife and mother. And they even called me a few times and half cajoled me, half insulted me into trying to reconsider ending the marriage.

Now I know that after the divorce, I will have less reason to interact with them. But the fact that I have three children with my husband means that they won't be out of our lives entirely. At least not until the children grow up. And that's assuming the children decide to cut ties with them, which is unlikely because our daughter in particular is close to one of her uncles and those cousins. Obviously, once our children become adults, they'll have every right to make their own independent decisions on whether to maintain ties with these soon-to-be former relatives. But I fear that keeping these relatives in our lives for the children's sake is just going to mean that the insults and other poor behavior will continue. How can I respect the wishes of my children to choose their own relationship with their in-laws while protecting myself from their vitriol?

ANSWER: This is a dilemma for sure, but like many relationship dilemmas, the imperfect but necessary solution is to create boundaries. You can't control how these soon-to-be former in-laws view you or your husband or the institution of marriage. But you can control, to the extent possible, the extent to which they can be in your lives. One suggestion is to try to have a conversation with them to clear the air and push for better treatment. Discuss how hurt you feel by their remarks and say that, while you disagree with them on the divorce, it's your and your husband's right as adults to choose whether or not to stay in the marriage. Maybe even invoke some Christian teachings to try to get them to rediscover their compassionate side around you.

But if this doesn't work, and my spidey sense thinks that it won't, your only real option is to set strict boundaries with them. For instance, make it a rule that you will never talk to them unless it pertains to your children. And while your children are still minors (I presume they still are due to the context of this letter), try to arrange meetings between them and those relatives where you have minimal contact. If possible, ask your ex-husband if he can participate in those meetings without you. Remember that you don't owe anybody anything except for your children, and to the extent required by law and common ethics, your husband as well. (For example, he will presumably be entitled to some amount of custody as the father of the children, unless he's a true monster.) And even while your kids are still minors, you don't have to agree to a Christmas or Thanksgiving or anything else with these in-laws. Those expectations collapsed when the marriage did. You can limit your interaction with them to the extent necessary to facilitate periodic visits between them and your children. And after these children become adults, they can conduct their completely autonomous relationships with these relatives if they so choose, without your having to be involved at all. Good luck and chin up. It will get better.

QUESTION: I'm a 37-year-old man, and I live with my long-term partner. No kids. My brother and I are not close. He lives just a 3-hour drive away, and we routinely make drives longer than that for various reasons, but we only see him maybe once every couple of years. And this includes Christmases and Thanksgivings. We are not actively hostile. We get along relatively well, and we have a few things in common. But we really are at the level of at most casual friends. I have co-workers who I'm closer to than my brother. I want to reconcile with him, but I really don't know how. You have any strategies for trying to connect with a semi-estranged but not hostile sibling?

ANSWER: It's hard to know exactly what advice to provide, given the limited context I have here. For instance:
- What are the reasons for the estrangement?
- Was there a fierce sibling rivalry growing up?
- Was there competition over grades or even over a person?
- Or did you or him do something negative to the other as children?

The general advice on family estrangement is that it's heavily context-specific. In the most extreme cases, such as abuse, the right and reasonable course of action is to cut off contact to the extent possible. But it doesn't sound from your letter like this is the case. In less extreme situations, it really depends a lot on the reasons for the estrangement and knowing the other person, how you think they would react. In these less extreme situations, it's usually a good idea to reach out directly to the person and try to clear the air. This doesn't necessarily need to involve a tell-all or a play-by-play recounting of what happened in the past between you. It could just be something along the lines of: "Hey [Brother], I'm sure you've noticed we don't talk very often and I'd like to change that. I value you as a sibling and love you and hope that we can have a good relationship. What do you think about that?" 

That conveys that you've taken the initiative to try to improve the situation, and that then puts the ball in his court. Ultimately, it will depend on how he responds as to whether or not you two can have a closer relationship. You will have done your part by starting the conversation just mentioned. Another thing I would suggest is to try to meet him at his place rather than the reverse. You can make that 3-hour drive as an additional gesture of your goodwill. Obviously with some advance notice, however. Good luck.

QUESTION: My daughter just came out to my husband and me. It happened relatively undramatically. We were all sitting around the kitchen table, eating dinner, and she mentioned that she had something to tell us. She said that her friend, who we will call Chloe, is actually her girlfriend, and that she's been pretty sure that she is gay for some time. She's 16. She says that while she's been attracted to other girls aside from Chloe, Chloe is the first one to actually reciprocate. And she says she's never been attracted to any boys.

My husband and I paused for a moment, not out of disapproval, but because we simply didn't know how to respond. Finally, we both said something about how we love her and that she's glad and that we're glad that she has enough trust in us to confide in us about this. Neither my husband nor I are homophobic. We have both long supported gay rights, and we've both been close to people who are gay. My husband even bought a small pride flag for her room. The problem though is how do we go about actually relating to her? While my husband and I are honestly elated that we won't have to deal with any teen pregnancy scares, we're also unsure about how we as straight people can truly relate to her experiences. We know that, when it comes to dating and relationships, gay and straight people have many things in common, more so than what divides them. But being gay in our still substantially homophobic society is an experience that neither my husband and I have ever known firsthand. Do you have any suggestions or resources on how to connect with her on this?

ANSWER: About three-quarters of the battle has already been won. She is very lucky to have such loving and supportive parents. Sadly, many people in her situation don't. When it comes to the question of how to relate to her better, you can start the conversation with what you mentioned to me: that there are many similarities between what people experience in gay relationships and what they experience in straight ones. The giddiness and euphoria of a first love, the experience of heartbreak, rejection, hope, physical and emotional intimacy-- these experiences are universal and don't conform to lines of sexual labels. You can probably relate a great deal to what she's going through if you had a relationship or a crush at her age.

And as far as the experiences that don't overlap between straight and gay people, compassion and proactivity is the name of the game. Reinform your unconditional love and support for her and for her choice of partner, whoever that may be. Be proactive without being overbearing. Initiate some of these conversations and discussions, while also knowing when to hang back. And above all, just be there for her. Gay or straight, teenagers need to have that affirmation from parents. With parents also granting them more autonomy, assuming that their behavior and maturity justify it. And yes, by all means, celebrate that when she goes out with her girlfriend, there's not the risk of a pregnancy involved. And remember that even though she still needs guardrails, as all under-18s do, she's also on the cusp of adulthood and is experiencing a situation that's novel for her. Be there with love, compassion, and common sense, offering advice when needed, but generally leaving her to have her own experiences and make her own mistakes. This is the best way to equip her to navigate not only her current relationship but all the ones that follow.

QUESTION: I'm 28 years old (female), and my boyfriend is 33. We get along well and he's a great guy, loves me, loves my dog, wants kids, is usually pretty low maintenance. The problem is, well, I suppose a common one. It's a new time and in many cases, women are working and earning more than men. We are a textbook example of this. Although in our case, I am the only one earning anything at all! I just finished grad school last year and I have a really good, promising job in the finance industry. Nothing like those Wolf of Wall Street financiers but still a good, sustainable job. My boyfriend, by contrast, has always been a bit of a dreamer. He dropped out of college once, then finished a couple years later after volunteering in several cities in America and earning very little money. I met him during his second college stint when I was finishing up college myself. We had a period of long distance but long story short, decided it was worth it, stuck out the long distance, and then started living together after he was able to move back to our town. He also got a master's degree somewhere along the way but isn't using it. He says he wants to change the world and has big plans to end world hunger and to improve global education.

Part of the reason why I fell in love with him was that idealism. But honestly, the situation is starting to become untenable. As I mentioned, he doesn't work right now. He's in a volunteer gig and he sometimes picks up shifts as an Uber driver. But that's hardly what he went to grad school to do. When I urge him to help pay at least a respectable portion of the rent, he keeps talking to me about how his dreams are so important and how so many people in third-world countries are living so much worse than us. So you shouldn't be complaining. I get and understand that there are lots of people who have it worse off than us. But that's still no excuse in my view for what he's doing. As I alluded to earlier, I'm interested in starting a family soon, but can't imagine doing it with him until he does a 180 with his life. And when I have mentioned kids around him, he seems at best ambivalent. What should I do? Stay or go?

ANSWER: I think you've probably answered your own question. You tell me that you've talked to him about the problem, but he blows you off talking about his big dreams. And it seems like he's been like this for some time based on your letter. So, honestly, your lifestyles and what you want in the future just aren't compatible. You have a promising career. He seems to just want to follow his dreams by not working. And you've said that he "seems at best ambivalent" about having children, which you say is one of your big goals. And at 28, you're probably aware that you won't have forever to make this happen. 

You've invested a number of years in this man, and I have no doubt that there's lots of love between you. Any breakup would be devastating, but would breaking up with him be any more devastating than foregoing your wish to have children in order to accommodate someone who has had years to start to build a gainful career but apparently hasn't done so? And even with your well-paying job, I imagine that the stress of having to support him, as well as yourself, is starting to get to you. My younger sister had a boyfriend much like him. Sweet guy, really loved her, great with her dog. But he just wouldn't get his life together. He was working a dead-end theater job and he made no efforts to try to better his situation, either by going back to school or by looking for another job. My sister made the heartbreaking but necessary decision to end it with him. It looks like you are in a quite similar situation. So unless there is something big that you haven't told me about in this letter that would change this situation (such as a large inheritance from his rich uncle), I would urge you to likewise end this relationship and look for someone who is going to pull his weight in the relationship, and eventually as a father, whether or not this conforms with glamorous ideas of dreams. I know it's always very hurtful to end a relationship, but I think that you, as my sister did, will look back on this breakup and realize that although it hurt, you did the right thing for both of you.

QUESTION: I'm 27 and my boyfriend is 30; we've been together for three years and living together for 1.5 years. We get along well and are managing financially, but the problem is with his parents. They're in their late 60s, living on limited income (his father is retired from the military, his mother was a teacher until she quit due to osteoarthritis), but despite their modest pensions, they've made extremely inadvisable financial decisions—luxury cruises, expensive restaurants they can't afford. They're emotionally manipulative, constantly playing on the fact that he's their only child to get him to spend money on them and go into debt. He can't seem to resist, and I think part of it is his sense of duty carried over from when he was in the military—he feels he owes his parents for raising him and wants to give back. They're taking advantage of this. I've tried talking to him about this multiple times, but he always says that his duty to his parents supersedes everything else. I love him and don't want to leave, but I also don't want us to go broke because he can't say no to his parents. Is there any hope left for us?

ANSWER: "He always just says that his duty to his parents supersedes everything else." I think this tells you all that you need to know. I don't doubt that he loves you and that his sense of duty also includes a commitment to you. He sounds like a noble person, but people with a strong sense of duty can be vulnerable to manipulation, as you've seen. In this predicament with his parents, you've asked him multiple times to reconsider his supporting and enabling them, but he isn't responsive to that. And he doesn't seem to respect your input or try to seek any sort of compromise with respect to the money that he spends and the debt that he goes into for them.

This shouldn't remain your problem. You've done your best and made your feelings known to him, but he's ignored them repeatedly. Sadly, I think the best choice that you have is to end the relationship and start over. You don't want to become a second enabler for his parents. Nor do you want his consistent choosing of his parents over you to wreck your own credit and damage your own financial future.

QUESTION: My wife started seeing a therapist about a year ago after her mother died, which I fully supported. But now our marriage is falling apart because of it. When we have disagreements, she comes home from her sessions and immediately brings up whatever we're fighting about, but now she says things like "My therapist says you should..." or "My therapist says I need to..." and then she becomes completely inflexible, treating her therapist's advice like it's a binding court ruling. I feel like I'm being ganged up on by two people, and I can't even defend myself because I'm not in the room with them. I've asked to join a session or see a couples counselor together, but she says her therapist recommended a different therapist for couples work, and I'm resistant because these therapists are expensive and I don't want to cede control of our marriage to them. We're now talking about separating, which I never thought would happen. How can I save our marriage without giving up all control to therapists?

ANSWER: First, let's address the control issue directly: you're already losing your marriage, so the question isn't whether to involve professionals, but which professionals and how. Your wife's individual therapist is correct that couples counseling requires a different therapist—that's standard practice, not a power play. The individual therapist's job is to support your wife's growth, not to referee your marriage. That's why couples work needs its own neutral space.

The real issue here is that you're hearing your wife's version of what happens in therapy, not what actually happens. Therapists don't typically say "You should do X" or "Your spouse needs to Y"—they help people explore their feelings and needs. Your wife may be misrepresenting what's being said, or she may be taking the therapist's guidance and turning it into demands. Either way, you need to be in the room to hear it for yourself. I'd strongly recommend accepting the couples counseling offer. Think of it this way: you're not ceding control to therapists, you're getting professional help to communicate better. If the cost is truly prohibitive, many therapists offer sliding scale fees, and some community health centers provide low-cost counseling. But if you're choosing between paying for therapy or paying for two separate households, the math is pretty clear. The goal isn't to have therapists run your marriage—it's to learn tools to run it better yourselves.

QUESTION: My husband has always been particular about cleanliness, but since he started a high-stress job, it's gotten much worse. When he's on his way home, I can feel my whole body tense up. I rush around cleaning counters, vacuuming, putting away dishes, making sure no toys are out—all before he walks through the door. If anything is out of place when he arrives, he immediately starts straightening and cleaning, often before even saying hello. I've adapted to his standards over the years, and we're both tidy now, but I feel like I'm living under constant pressure to keep things perfect so he doesn't spiral into cleaning mode. Our kids are experiencing the stress too, and it's getting to them. It's exhausting, and I hate that I sometimes dread his return because of the energy shift it brings. We've talked about it many times, but not much changes. He refuses counseling and says he'll "work on it," but I don't see real progress. How can I support him without losing my peace or turning our home into a stress zone for everyone?

ANSWER: This sounds like untreated anxiety manifesting as obsessive-compulsive behavior, and it's affecting your entire family. The fact that you're pre-cleaning before he gets home to avoid triggering him is a sign that his needs have expanded beyond reasonable boundaries. You can't make him get help, but you can set boundaries around how his untreated anxiety affects you and your children. At least in the short term.

Start by having a direct conversation when you're both calm: "I love you, and I can see that your need for order is tied to managing stress from work. But when you come home and immediately start cleaning without greeting us, it makes me and the kids feel like we're less important than a clean counter. I also notice that I'm spending energy trying to prevent your reactions, which isn't sustainable for me." Then propose specific changes: he agrees to say hello and spend five minutes with the family before addressing any mess, and you agree to maintain reasonable tidiness without the pre-cleaning scramble. If he can't commit to these small changes, then you need to consider whether this is the life you want. 

And even if you can, the changes that I just proposed are just a band-aid. They can buy you some time to make your house a bit of a less stressful place while you ask your husband to reconsider his refusal to get professional help. But on the long term, if you want to truly get this problem under control, he's going to need professional help. His refusal to get such help for what's clearly impacting his family is a choice he's making, and you don't have to accommodate it indefinitely. You might also benefit from individual therapy to help you set and maintain these boundaries without feeling guilty and to talk through what the future might look like if your husband keeps refusing to get professional help in the longer term.

QUESTION: I'm expecting my first baby in a few months, and I'm struggling with a decision I never thought I'd face. I always assumed I would stay home with my kids, at least during the early years—that's how I was raised. My mom stayed home throughout our entire childhoods. But now that I'm actually pregnant, I realize I don't want to leave my job. I work in HR at a midsize company, and while the work is challenging, it's also predictable and I find it fulfilling. It also doesn't make financial sense right now because I bring in roughly 60% of our family's income—my husband is a schoolteacher. Most of my friends either don't have kids yet or are stay-at-home moms, so I don't have great models for working motherhood. My coworkers who are moms seem frazzled and complain about their kids all the time, which scares me. Is it even possible to be a happy working mom, or am I letting money make a decision for me that should be moral or emotional?

ANSWER: Yes, it's absolutely possible to be a happy working mom—millions of women do it every day. The fact that your coworkers complain doesn't mean they're unhappy; sometimes people vent about challenges without meaning they regret their choices. You might try talking to them directly: "I'm expecting and trying to figure out the work-life balance. I hear you venting sometimes—can you tell me what you actually like about working and parenting? What makes it work for you?" You might be surprised by their answers.

The bigger issue here is the "should" in your question. There's no moral imperative to stay home or to work—there's only what works for your family, your finances, your personality, and your circumstances. You're bringing in most of the income, you find your work fulfilling, and you don't want to leave. Those are all valid reasons to continue working. The key is to set yourself up for success: discuss with your husband how you'll share childcare responsibilities, consider what kind of childcare arrangement would work best for your family, and be realistic about what you can and can't do. You might also find that your feelings change once the baby arrives; some women who planned to work find they want to stay home, and some who planned to stay home find they need the structure and adult interaction that work provides. Give yourself permission to make the decision that's right for you, and know that you can always reassess as your circumstances change.

QUESTION: My best friend recently got back together with her ex-boyfriend, who I know was emotionally abusive to her. She cut off her other best friend for telling her to leave him, and now she's threatening to cut me off too over a trivial political disagreement we had. I'm trying to be a safe presence for her like people advised, but it's getting harder as she keeps ghosting me or being cold and distant. How do I handle this without losing my friend completely, and how do I stop feeling terrible about it?

ANSWER: You can't fix this for her, and you shouldn't try to. Your friend is in a cycle of abuse where she's isolating herself from people who care about her—this is unfortunately common in abusive relationships. The person who's supposed to be her safe place (you) is being pushed away, while the person causing harm is being drawn closer. Your role right now isn't to be a regular friend who gets regular friendship back. It's to be a lifeline that stays available even when she's not using it.

That means: keep reaching out periodically with low-pressure check-ins. Don't expect her to respond, and don't take her distance personally. When she does respond, don't lecture her about the boyfriend—just be present. Say things like, "I'm here whenever you need me, no questions asked." The goal is to make sure she knows you're still there when she's ready to leave. As for feeling terrible about it—that's actually appropriate. It is terrible to watch someone you care about self-destruct. But remember: her choices aren't your fault, and you can't rescue her if she doesn't want to be rescued. You can only keep the door open. In the meantime, make sure you're taking care of yourself. This is emotionally draining work, and you deserve support too. Consider talking to a therapist or joining a support group for friends and family of people in abusive relationships.

QUESTION: My husband and I recently discovered that our 17-year-old is depressed and has contemplated suicide. I found out by going through their phone after noticing they seemed "off" and didn't want to talk to me. Our teen feels betrayed and angry that I went through their phone. We took them to their pediatrician for an evaluation, and they refused to talk at all or to consider an antidepressant or nonmedical interventions. We went to a therapist twice and they refused to speak at all. I've tried drawing them out, waiting patiently, explaining how suicide cannot be undone and we will get through this together, but nothing seems to get through. They did confirm that there was no event that triggered this—they're just sad. They said talking to their friends helps. But I don't know what to do. I'm barely sleeping and every time they're out of sight I'm wondering if they're okay. I asked if they'd see a different therapist and got completely shut down. How do we continue in this liminal space where our teen is suffering but refusing help?

ANSWER: This is terrifying, and I'm so sorry your family is going through this. The most important thing right now is that you and your husband get professional support yourselves, even if your teen won't. Find a therapist who specializes in adolescent mental health—not to fix your teen, but to guide you on how to support them. This is one of those situations where you need expert instructions, not just well-meaning advice.

Since your teen won't talk to a therapist, you need to be their support system. Keep doing what you're doing: spending time with them, doing things they enjoy, getting them outside for walks even if there's resistance. But also, get eyes on them at school—talk to the school counselor confidentially about your concerns. Make sure any firearms are completely removed from your home (not just locked up), and ask friends and family to do the same if your teen visits. The phone issue is tricky—you violated their privacy, which they're rightfully upset about, but you also found critical information. You might need to apologize for the method while explaining why you were worried: "I'm sorry I went through your phone. I was scared because you seemed so different, and I didn't know how else to understand what was happening. Can we find a better way for you to let me know when you're struggling?" Most importantly, keep the lines of communication open. They said talking to friends helps—that's actually a good sign. Don't try to replace that, but do make sure they know you're available whenever they're ready to talk. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and you need to take care of yourself too so you can be there for the long haul.

QUESTION: I'm getting married next year and I want to wear my grandmother's wedding gown. She got married in 1970 and her dress is a stunning floor-length fuchsia A-line gown with a square neckline—she hated white as much as I do. My grandmother is having it dry cleaned and says it's still in perfect condition. My future mother-in-law thought it was wonderful that I'd be wearing my grandmother's gown until she saw a picture of it. Now she insists that it couldn't be a wedding gown since brides only wore white back then, even though the picture is clearly of my grandparents on their wedding day. She can't let it go and keeps saying what a mistake it will be to be married in "that dreary old pink dress" and that I'll miss the fun of picking my own special gown. My mom also suggested I wear something more traditional like she did, and offered me her white gown, but I hate it—it's poufy and over the top with tulle and beading. My fiancé says I should wear what makes me happy, which is my grandmother's dress. With both moms objecting, is this a stupid hill to die on?

ANSWER: No, this is not a stupid hill to die on. It's your wedding, and you should wear what makes you happy. Your future mother-in-law is wrong about historical wedding dress colors—plenty of brides wore colors other than white throughout history, and even in 1970, non-white wedding dresses weren't unheard of. But more importantly, her opinion about what you should wear on your wedding day is just that—an opinion, not a requirement.

Here's what I'd suggest: thank both mothers for their input, then firmly close the topic. "Thanks for everyone's thoughts, but I've decided to wear my grandmother's dress. The topic's closed." Mean it, and don't engage in further discussion about it. If they bring it up again, you can say, "We've already discussed this, and my decision is made." Your fiancé is right to support you, and it's good that he's on your side. If your future mother-in-law continues to push, he should be the one to tell her to stop, since it's his family. This is actually a good test of how you'll handle future boundary issues with your in-laws. If you give in on something as personal as your wedding dress to avoid conflict, you're setting a pattern of letting them dictate your choices. Start as you mean to go on: with respect for their opinions, but with firm boundaries about what's yours to decide. Wear the pink dress, and have a beautiful wedding.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been together for three years, and we're talking about moving in together. The problem is that we have very different ideas about what "clean" means. I'm someone who likes things tidy—dishes done, counters wiped, clothes put away. He's more relaxed and thinks it's fine to leave dishes in the sink overnight, have clothes on the floor, and let mail pile up on the kitchen table. When I visit his apartment, I find myself cleaning up because the mess stresses me out, but I know I can't do that forever. I've tried talking to him about it, and he says he'll "try to be better," but nothing really changes. I'm worried that if we move in together, I'll either become his maid or we'll fight constantly about housework. How do we figure out if we can make this work?

ANSWER: This is a very common issue, and it's smart to address it before you move in together. The key is to have a concrete conversation about expectations, not just vague promises to "try better." Sit down and discuss specific standards: what does "clean enough" look like for shared spaces? How often should dishes be done? What's the threshold for when something becomes too messy? You might find that you can compromise—maybe dishes can wait until morning, but they need to be done before dinner the next day. Or maybe you agree that shared spaces stay tidy, but personal spaces like bedrooms can be as messy as each person wants.

The bigger question is whether he's willing to put in the effort to meet you halfway. If he says he'll try but never actually does, that's a red flag. Consider a trial period: spend a week living together (if possible) or have him stay with you for an extended visit and see how it goes. Pay attention to whether he notices when things need cleaning, whether he takes initiative, or whether you have to ask him every time. If you find yourself constantly nagging or doing everything yourself, that's not a sustainable dynamic. You might also consider hiring a cleaning service if you can afford it—sometimes outsourcing this conflict is worth the cost to preserve your relationship. But ultimately, if he can't or won't meet you in the middle on basic household maintenance, that tells you something important about how he'll handle other compromises in your relationship.

QUESTION: My girlfriend and I have been dating for two years, and we're both in our late 20s. I've always known I wanted kids—it's been a life goal of mine for as long as I can remember. When we first started dating, she said she wasn't sure about kids, which I thought meant she was open to the possibility. But recently, she's been more firm about it, saying she doesn't think she wants children and that she's pretty certain about that. I love her and I can see a future with her, but I can't imagine my life without being a parent. I've tried to talk to her about it, but she gets defensive and says I'm pressuring her. I don't want to pressure her, but I also don't want to waste either of our time if we're fundamentally incompatible on this. How do we navigate this?

ANSWER: This is one of those fundamental incompatibilities that can't be compromised on—you can't have half a kid, and one person shouldn't have to sacrifice such a major life goal for the other. The fact that she's getting defensive suggests she knows this is a deal-breaker issue, and she may be trying to avoid the conversation because she doesn't want to face what it might mean for your relationship.

You need to have one more direct, honest conversation. Frame it not as pressure, but as clarity: "I love you, and I want to build a future with you. But I need to know where you stand on kids, because this is a deal-breaker for me. I'm not asking you to change your mind—I'm asking you to be honest with me and with yourself about what you want." Give her space to think about it, but set a timeline. If after some reflection she's certain she doesn't want kids, then you have your answer. It's heartbreaking, but staying together when you want fundamentally different things will only lead to resentment—either you'll resent her for "depriving" you of parenthood, or she'll resent you if she has a child she doesn't want. Neither outcome is fair to either of you, or to a potential child. The kindest thing you can do for both of you is to be honest about this incompatibility and make the hard decision to part ways if you can't align on this fundamental life goal.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been in a long-distance relationship for the past year. We met online and hit it off immediately, and we've been making it work with visits every few months. But lately, I'm starting to feel like the distance is taking a toll. We talk on the phone and video chat regularly, but it's not the same as being together. I'm starting to feel lonely and disconnected, and I'm wondering if I'm missing out on opportunities to meet someone local. We've talked about one of us moving, but neither of us can right now—I'm in grad school and they're established in their career. I love them, but I'm not sure how much longer I can do this. How do I know if the distance is just a temporary challenge we can overcome, or if it's a sign that this isn't meant to be?

ANSWER: Long-distance relationships can work, but they require a clear end date or at least a concrete plan for when you'll be together. The fact that neither of you can move right now is understandable, but "someday" isn't a plan—it's a hope. You need to sit down together and have a serious conversation about timelines: when could one of you realistically move? What would that look like? What are you both willing to sacrifice to make it happen? If the answer is "we don't know" or "maybe in a few years," then you're essentially asking yourself to put your life on hold indefinitely, which isn't fair to either of you.

The loneliness you're feeling is valid, and it's worth examining whether you're staying in this relationship because you genuinely see a future together, or because you're afraid of being alone or of hurting them. Ask yourself: if you knew for certain that you'd be long-distance for another three years with no clear plan to close the distance, would you stay? If the answer is no, then you have your answer. It's okay to love someone and still recognize that the circumstances aren't right for you. That doesn't make the love less real—it just means that love alone isn't always enough to make a relationship work. You deserve to be in a relationship that meets your needs, including the need for physical presence and daily connection. If this relationship can't provide that within a reasonable timeframe, it may be time to have an honest conversation about whether you're both truly committed to making the necessary sacrifices to be together.

QUESTION: I'm on the autism spectrum and my partner is also neurodivergent, albeit in a different way. This has been a source of connection, but also a source of struggle. For example, they frequently express frustration when I'm not reading their social cues in the way that they expect me to. They also get irritated if I leave the room because they're cooking a certain thing, or if I'm focusing on obsessive interest, as we autists are known for. I do try to communicate my needs to them, and they seem receptive to it. But often it seems like we're getting nowhere. Our brains are wired too differently. Any recommendations on how to bridge the gap?

ANSWER: This is a common problem in neurologically mixed relationships. Even with both partners being neurodivergent, being neurodivergent in different ways is often just as challenging as one partner being neurodivergent and the other neurotypical. But you're not alone in this struggle. If you aren't doing it already, I would highly recommend couples counseling. This should help you begin to work through some of these issues. There are many compromises that you can make that would be worthwhile. For instance, your partner agrees not to cook certain food with you around, or you agree to set aside a certain amount of time for them each day so that you don't get sucked into your strong interest as much. The keys are:
1. Compassion
2. Empathy
3. A willingness to listen

There's also a growing body of resources available for couples in your situation. In particular, I would recommend that you both read the book "The Autism Partner Handbook: How to Love an Autistic Person" by Elly Blue, Faith G. Harper, and Joe Biel. It's a quick read and offers a lot of useful suggestions for your situation. Navigating neurodivergence is a challenge, but plenty of other couples have done it. Good luck.

QUESTION: I've been dating my boyfriend for about six months, and things are going well overall. But there's one issue that's been bothering me: he's still very close with his ex-girlfriend. They text regularly, hang out one-on-one, and he even invited her to a party at his place recently. When I asked him about it, he said they're just friends and that their relationship was never that serious anyway. I trust him, but it still makes me uncomfortable. I've never stayed friends with my exes, so I don't really understand how that works. Am I being unreasonable? Should I ask him to cut back on the friendship, or is this something I need to work on?

ANSWER: Whether exes can be friends is highly individual—some people can maintain healthy platonic friendships with former partners, and others can't. The question isn't whether it's "normal" to be friends with an ex, but whether this particular friendship is appropriate and respectful of your current relationship. There are some red flags here: the one-on-one hangouts, the regular texting, and the fact that he's including her in his social life in a way that might be making you feel like a third wheel.

Before you ask him to change anything, you need to understand what's really going on. Have a calm conversation: "I trust you, but I'm feeling uncomfortable with how close you are with your ex. Can you help me understand the friendship? What does it look like from your perspective?" Pay attention to his response. Does he dismiss your feelings? Does he get defensive? Or does he listen and try to help you understand? A partner who cares about your feelings will want to address your discomfort, even if they don't agree that there's a problem. You might find that there are reasonable boundaries you can both agree on—maybe group hangouts are fine, but one-on-one dinners feel too intimate. Or maybe you can all hang out together so you can see their dynamic for yourself. But if he's unwilling to make any adjustments or if his friendship with his ex is more important than your comfort in the relationship, that tells you something about his priorities. You're not being unreasonable to want boundaries around ex-relationships—that's a very common need in romantic partnerships.

QUESTION: My husband and I have been married for five years, and we have two young children. My husband's job requires him to travel frequently—he's gone about two weeks out of every month. When he's home, he's often exhausted and wants to relax, which means I'm still doing most of the childcare and household management even when he's here. I work full-time too, and I'm burning out. I've tried talking to him about it, but he says his job is demanding and he needs downtime when he's home. I understand that, but I also need a break, and I feel like I'm doing everything alone. We can't afford for him to change jobs right now, but something has to give. How do we find balance when his career requires so much travel?

ANSWER: This is a really tough situation, and your burnout is completely understandable. The issue isn't just the travel—it's that when he's home, the division of labor isn't fair. Yes, he's tired from work, but so are you, and you've been holding down the fort solo while he's been away. His "downtime" shouldn't come at the expense of you never getting any.

You need to have a serious conversation about restructuring how things work when he's home. Start by acknowledging his need for rest, but also make it clear that you have the same need: "I know you're exhausted when you get home, and I want you to have time to recharge. But I've been working and parenting solo while you're gone, and I'm exhausted too. We need to find a way for both of us to get breaks." Then get specific: maybe he takes the kids for a few hours on Saturday morning so you can sleep in or have time to yourself. Maybe you alternate who handles bedtime routines. Maybe you hire help—a babysitter for a few hours a week, or a cleaning service to take some of the household burden off both of you. The key is that his travel schedule can't be an excuse for you to carry 100% of the load when he's home. That's not sustainable, and it will breed resentment.

You also need to talk about the long-term plan. If his job requires this much travel indefinitely, you both need to decide if that's the life you want. Can he look for a different role in the same company that requires less travel? Can you make financial changes that would allow him to take a job with less travel, even if it pays less? The current arrangement might work short-term, but if it's going to be years of this, you need to know that and make an informed decision about whether you can handle it. Your mental health and your children's well-being depend on you not being constantly overwhelmed.

QUESTION: My girlfriend and I have been together for a year, and we're both in our early 30s. She's great in so many ways, but there's one thing that's really bothering me: she's constantly on her phone when we're together. We'll be having dinner, and she'll be scrolling through social media. We'll be watching a movie, and she'll be texting. Even when we're having what I think is an important conversation, she'll pick up her phone to check notifications. I've mentioned it a few times, and she'll put it away for a little while, but then she's right back to it. I feel like I'm competing with her phone for attention, and it's making me feel unimportant. Am I overreacting, or is this a legitimate concern?

ANSWER: You're not overreacting—this is a legitimate concern. When someone is constantly on their phone during shared time, it sends a message that whatever's on the screen is more important than the person in front of them. That's hurtful, and it's reasonable to want your partner's full attention when you're spending time together.

The fact that she puts it away temporarily when you mention it but then goes back to it suggests this might be more of a habit or compulsion than intentional disregard. Some people genuinely struggle with phone addiction or use their phones as a way to manage anxiety or boredom. But regardless of the reason, it's affecting your relationship, and that needs to be addressed.

Have a direct conversation when you're both calm and not in the middle of a phone-checking moment: "I love spending time with you, but I've noticed that you're often on your phone when we're together, and it makes me feel like I'm not important to you. I'd like us to have some phone-free time together—maybe during meals, or when we're watching something, or having important conversations. Can we agree on some boundaries around that?" Be specific about what you need: maybe phones go in another room during dinner, or you have certain times that are designated as phone-free. If she's resistant or dismissive of your feelings, that's a bigger problem. But if she's willing to work on it, you might need to help her by suggesting alternatives—maybe she needs to address underlying anxiety, or maybe you need to make your time together more engaging so she's less tempted to reach for her phone. The goal is to find a balance where you both feel present and connected.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for three years, and we're talking about getting engaged. The problem is my family. They're very traditional and have made it clear they don't approve of my partner for several reasons—my partner is from a different cultural background, has a different religion, and my family thinks they're "not good enough" for me. We've tried to include my partner in family events, but my family is cold and sometimes outright rude. My partner has been incredibly patient and understanding, but I can see it's taking a toll. I love my family, but I also love my partner, and I'm tired of being caught in the middle. How do I handle this?

ANSWER: This is a painful situation, and I'm sorry you're dealing with it. The reality is that you can't control your family's behavior, but you can control how you respond to it and what you're willing to tolerate. Right now, by continuing to bring your partner into situations where they're treated poorly, you're essentially condoning that treatment, even if that's not your intention.

You need to set clear boundaries with your family. Have a direct conversation: "I love you all, and I want you in my life. But the way you're treating my partner is unacceptable, and I won't continue to subject them to that. If you can't be respectful and welcoming to my partner, then I won't be bringing them to family events, and I may need to limit my own participation as well." This is hard, but necessary. Your partner deserves to be treated with basic respect, and you deserve to not have to choose between your family and your relationship.

The key is to be consistent. If you set this boundary but then keep showing up to family events without your partner, or if you let your family's comments slide, you're sending mixed messages. You might also consider whether there are family members who are more accepting—maybe you can maintain relationships with those individuals separately, while limiting contact with those who are hostile. Ultimately, if your family can't accept your partner, that's their loss. You're building a life with someone you love, and that's what matters. Your family can either be part of that life on respectful terms, or they can choose not to be. But you shouldn't have to sacrifice your relationship to maintain a relationship with people who don't respect your choices.

QUESTION: I'm the mother of two kids, a son age 15 and a daughter age 13. My son has expressed a strong interest in being a physician, a goal that I support because he has a genuine love for medicine—he's been interested in it from a very young age and has loved his hospital shadowing experiences. The problem is that he's so focused on school and grades that he isn't doing any extracurriculars. I worry that now that he's in high school, not having extracurriculars will hurt his chances of getting into a good college and eventually medical school, even if he maintains his excellent grades. I don't like the "extracurricular arms race" that high school has become, but I recognize we have to work within the system as it exists. I've repeatedly encouraged him to find an extracurricular he likes, even suggesting the Science Club since science is his favorite subject, but he always says he's focused on schoolwork and that Science Club would be redundant since he already studies science outside of school. I want him to forge his own path, but I also don't want him to make choices that could hurt his chances of getting into medical school or another professional or graduate school. How can I strike a balance between providing sound parental advice and giving him the autonomy he needs to make his own choices?

ANSWER: I agree with you about the extracurricular arms race—it's unfortunate that these activities have become boxes to check rather than enriching experiences, but you're right that we need to work within the system. A good first step is to talk to his guidance counselor (and encourage him to do the same) to understand what extracurricular portfolios look like for recent graduates who got into good colleges; you can also talk to other parents and look at reputable websites (avoid sources like U.S. News and World Report, which exaggerate prestige factors). Being armed with facts helps reduce over-worrying. I would stress that having one or two extracurriculars can be important for college admissions—it's not fair, but that's how the system works. My brother had virtually perfect grades and a 1600 SAT score yet didn't get into Yale, and we think his lack of extracurriculars was a major factor. Does your son have friends in extracurriculars who've had good experiences? Does he have interests outside of science that could be pursued in an extracurricular? Most schools offer many options, and even if his doesn't, there should be something that appeals to his interests. Remind him that these organizations are good ways to make friends and can be enriching beyond just a line on a resume. Good luck—he sounds like a really good kid.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I are both 25, and we've been dating for about eight months. Things are going well, but there's one issue: he wants to move in together, and I'm not ready. I like having my own space, and I'm not sure we've been together long enough to take that step. When I tell him this, he gets hurt and says it makes him feel like I don't see a future with us. I do see a future with us, but I also think moving in together is a big step that shouldn't be rushed. How do I explain this without making him feel rejected?

ANSWER: Your instinct to take things slowly is valid—eight months isn't very long, and moving in together is a significant commitment that changes the dynamic of a relationship. His hurt feelings are understandable, but they shouldn't pressure you into making a decision you're not ready for. Moving in together before you're ready is a recipe for resentment and conflict.

Have a conversation that acknowledges his feelings while being clear about your own: "I understand why this feels like rejection, and that's not my intention at all. I do see a future with us, which is why I want to make sure we're making this decision for the right reasons and at the right time. Moving in together is a big step, and I want us to be in a place where we're both excited about it, not where one of us is doing it to avoid hurting the other's feelings." Then talk about what "ready" looks like for you: maybe you want to hit the one-year mark, or maybe you want to work through some other issues first, or maybe you just need more time to feel comfortable with the idea. Be specific about your timeline if you have one, or be honest if you don't know when you'll be ready.

It's also worth exploring why he's pushing for this so soon. Is he feeling insecure about the relationship? Is there a financial reason? Understanding his motivation can help you address the underlying concern. But ultimately, if you're not ready, you're not ready, and that's okay. A partner who truly cares about you will respect your boundaries and timeline, even if it's not what they hoped for. If he can't accept that and continues to pressure you, that's a red flag about how he handles not getting his way in the relationship.

QUESTION: My wife and I have been married for eight years, and we have a good relationship overall. But there's one recurring issue: she's very close with her group of college friends, and they have a group chat where they're constantly messaging. The problem is that they often share very personal details about their lives, including things about their relationships and sex lives. My wife participates in these conversations and sometimes shares details about our relationship that I'm not comfortable with. When I've asked her to keep our private life private, she says I'm being too sensitive and that this is just how her friend group communicates. But I feel like my privacy is being violated, and I don't want our intimate details discussed in a group chat. How do we resolve this?

ANSWER: Your feelings are completely valid—you have a right to privacy in your relationship, and your wife sharing intimate details about your life without your consent is a boundary violation. The fact that she's dismissing your concerns as being "too sensitive" is also problematic. Your comfort level matters, and a good partner should respect that, even if they don't fully understand it.

You need to have a clear conversation about boundaries: "I understand that your friend group is close and shares a lot with each other. But when you share details about our relationship, especially intimate ones, it makes me feel like my privacy isn't being respected. I'm not asking you to stop being close with your friends, but I am asking you to keep our private life private. Can we agree on what's off-limits?" Be specific about what you consider private—maybe it's anything about your sex life, or maybe it's details about arguments or personal struggles. The key is that you both need to agree on what's okay to share and what isn't.

If she continues to dismiss your concerns or refuses to change her behavior, that's a bigger issue. It suggests she doesn't respect your boundaries or your right to privacy. You might need to consider couples counseling to work through this, because trust and respect for boundaries are fundamental to a healthy relationship. Your wife's friendships are important, but they shouldn't come at the expense of your comfort and privacy in your own marriage.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for two years. We get along great and have similar values and goals. But there's one thing that's been bothering me: there's a 12-year age gap between us—I'm 35 and they're 23. When we started dating, the age difference didn't seem like a big deal, but lately I've been thinking about it more. I'm at a point where I'm thinking about settling down, buying a house, maybe having kids. They're still figuring out their career, want to travel, and aren't sure about kids. I'm worried that we're at different life stages, and that might cause problems down the road. Am I overthinking this, or are these legitimate concerns?

ANSWER: These are legitimate concerns. Age gaps can work in relationships, but they often come with life-stage differences that can create challenges. The fact that you're thinking about settling down and they're still in the exploration phase is a real difference that needs to be addressed, not dismissed.

The age gap itself isn't necessarily the problem—it's the life-stage mismatch. If they're 23 and want to travel and explore, that's completely normal for someone that age. But if you're 35 and ready to settle down, you need to decide if you're willing to wait for them to catch up to where you are, or if you need someone who's already at that stage. Remember that your partner was 21 when you first started dating them. That's only barely old enough to drink. And it's only a few years past high school. Also, they say that the brain doesn't fully form until age 25. When you reached drinking age, they were only 9 years old and in elementary school. By the time they catch up, you might be in your early to mid-40s. And while I don't want to presume the gender of either of you, that's generally a late age to start having kids. 

So you need to ask yourself some hard questions. Then if you haven't already done so, have a frank and honest conversation with them. Open with something like: "I love you, and I want to make sure we're on the same page about where we're headed. I'm thinking about buying a house and potentially having kids in the next few years. Where are you at with those things? What does your timeline look like?" Pay attention to their answers. Are they open to having those conversations? Do they seem to want similar things, just on a different timeline? Or are you fundamentally wanting different things? You need to be honest with yourself about what you want and whether this relationship can provide it. Don't stay in a relationship hoping someone will change or "catch up"—that's a recipe for resentment. Either you're both moving in the same direction, and at a speed that you feel works well for both of you, or you need to acknowledge that you might be on different paths.

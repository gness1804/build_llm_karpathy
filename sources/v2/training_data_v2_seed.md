QUESTION: My husband and I (both in our late 30s) have very different approaches to conflict. I want to talk things through right away, while he tends to shut down and say he needs space. When we argue, I feel abandoned when he walks away, and he says he feels attacked when I keep pushing. We both agree we love each other and don’t want every disagreement to turn into a blowup, but we haven’t found a way to meet in the middle. How can we handle conflict without repeating this same pattern every time?

ANSWER: Start by talking about this pattern at a calm time, not in the middle of an argument. Name what happens in neutral terms: you pursue, he withdraws, and both of you end up feeling misunderstood. Then, instead of arguing about who is “right,” see if you can agree on a shared goal: “When we disagree, we want both people to feel heard and neither person to feel cornered or abandoned.”

From there, negotiate some specific ground rules. For example: if he needs a break, he agrees to say, “I’m overwhelmed; I need 30 minutes and then I’ll come back and talk,” and you agree to honor that time-limited pause instead of following him from room to room. In return, you ask that when he comes back, he stays engaged for a set amount of time before calling another break. You can also agree to use “I” statements (“I felt shut out when you left the room”) instead of global labels (“You always run away”), which lower the emotional temperature. If these patterns are deeply rooted, a few sessions with a couples therapist can give you both a neutral referee and practice tools that feel less personal and more like skills you’re learning together.

QUESTION: I’m a 29-year-old woman who recently moved in with my boyfriend. I’ve noticed that his mom texts and calls him multiple times a day about minor things—what he ate, whether he got enough sleep, if he remembered to bring a jacket. He usually answers right away and sometimes even leaves our plans hanging to respond. When I bring it up, he says I’m overreacting and that she “just worries.” I don’t want to be the person who makes him choose between me and his mom, but I also feel like we’re never fully alone. How can I set boundaries here without sounding controlling?

ANSWER: You don’t need to make this about his mother’s worth as a parent; you can keep it focused on what you need in your relationship. Start by describing specific moments instead of labeling the whole dynamic: “When we’re in the middle of dinner and you step away to text your mom for ten minutes, I feel pushed to the side.” Then follow it with a clear request: “When we’re on a date or having a planned evening together, I’d like us both to silence non‑urgent notifications unless there’s an emergency.”

It may help to frame this as a growing-up step rather than a rejection of his mom: “Part of living together is learning to protect time that’s just ours. That doesn’t mean you love your mom any less—it just means we’re building our own household.” Ask him what feels reasonable to him: maybe he checks in with her once a day at a predictable time, instead of constantly. If he refuses to consider any limits at all, that’s not about his mom; it’s about whether he’s ready to prioritize your shared life. In that case, the harder question is not “How do I change his contact with her?” but “Can I accept being in a relationship where our time as a couple is always second place?”

<END_OF_SET>

QUESTION: My partner and I have very different social batteries. I’m an introvert who needs quiet evenings to recharge after work, while she loves to host people and have something on the calendar most nights. When I say I need a night in, she takes it as a rejection and says I’m “never up for anything.” When she fills our week with plans, I start to dread it and feel resentful. We both feel criticized and misunderstood. How can we find a rhythm that doesn’t leave one of us exhausted and the other one lonely?

ANSWER: Treat this as a logistics puzzle, not a character judgment. You’re not “boring” and she’s not “too much”; you simply have different settings that need to be respected. Start by mapping out a typical week together and literally blocking off “quiet nights” and “social nights” on a shared calendar. For example, you might agree that two evenings a week are guaranteed quiet time at home, two are open for social plans together, and the rest are flexible.

On her high‑social nights, she can still make plans without you, as long as that’s discussed in advance and not treated as punishment. On your quiet nights, you commit to being present with her—phones down, some shared activity—even if it’s low‑key. Make sure you both have something to look forward to: she gets her people time, you get your recharge time, and neither of you is surprised by a last‑minute jammed schedule. If this continues to be a sore spot, a counselor can help you both translate “I feel rejected” and “I feel overwhelmed” into specific, negotiable needs instead of accusations.

QUESTION: My husband and I have been married for 10 years, and while it's mostly been a good marriage with the usual ups and downs, a toxic dynamic has evolved where both of us rush to blame the other during arguments. For example, last week our cat escaped and my youngest child and I spent several hours looking for her before a neighbor thankfully found and returned her. The relief of having her back should have been the end of it, but instead the incident sparked a painful argument about whose "fault" it was—-my husband blamed me for leaving the door open when I went out to tend to our plants (I was only outside for a few minutes), while I blamed him because the only reason I went out to water the plants was that he had neglected to do it after saying he would take care of them. The argument was unproductive, as almost all of our arguments are. We've been in couples therapy but haven't made much progress, in part because my husband doesn't take therapy seriously. How can we overcome this blame dynamic and develop a better marital relationship?

ANSWER: This is a common problem, so you're hardly alone in facing this. Your husband's reluctance to take therapy seriously is discouraging, but there are other approaches you can take. During a moment when both of you are calm, approach him and say something like, "Honey, I've noticed that when we fight, we often blame each other for problems, and this doesn't resolve anything. It just results in hurt feelings for both of us. What do you think we can do to address this?"

Much will depend on how he responds. If he doesn't respond well, particularly after repeated attempts to address this amicably, then it might behoove you to engage in solo therapy to explore any underlying problems behind this pattern. But if he is open to engaging with you, try this exercise: the next time you have an argument and one of you starts blaming the other, get out a piece of paper and each of you write down possible solutions, with a rule that nobody can write anything blaming the other partner—just focus on solutions. Blame is a dynamic that tends to be self-reinforcing: the more you resort to blame, the more it feels natural, but the good news is that it works the other way as well—the less you engage in blame over time, the less it becomes the default way of "solving" problems. Over time, this exercise should help change this difficult dynamic while also solving the original problems more quickly. I would also recommend reading John Gottman's book, "The 7 Principles for Making Marriage Work," which contains excellent advice about the blame game and other marital challenges.

QUESTION: My husband and I are facing a dilemma over how to respond to a problem with how his family treats his brother. Both of us have long suspected that my husband's brother is gay. At one point, the brother even came to my husband asking for advice on how to come out of the closet. However, in large part because of their family's attitudes, the brother has never actually come out to them. From time to time, I overhear some of my husband's family, particularly my father-in-law, make offensive and cruel remarks about gay people. I don't know if the father-in-law suspects that one of his sons is gay or not, but regardless, this creates an alienating environment for us and obviously especially for the brother.

Our dilemma is on how to respond to this, if at all. I would like for us, or at least for my husband, to bring this up with his father and to make clear that we don't approve of these cruel remarks. My husband has made it clear that even though he strongly disapproves of the anti-gay remarks, he wants to preserve his relationship with his father and doesn't want to intervene. I tend to feel that since it's his family, he should have more of a say on how to engage with them. But it really hurts to stand by and say nothing while my husband's father creates such an intolerant environment. Do you think that we should just let this go or do you feel that it's worth risking our relationship with his father to try to improve the situation?

ANSWER: What about the brother's opinion of all this? Before confronting his father, why don't you two, or just your husband, approach the brother and gently ask him what he thinks the best course of action is? Given that he seems to be the one most affected by the remarks, his opinion should be given special weight. Only confront the father if the brother is okay with that. You don't want to risk a backlash by confronting the father and then him responding by treating his son even worse. And even though what the father is saying is clearly abhorrent, the son that you suspect is gay might have his own reasons for wanting to preserve his own relationship with his father.

Regardless of whether you choose to confront the father directly, there are more subtle ways that you can send signals of disapproval about the remarks. For instance, you can limit your visits to those particular relatives when the father is around. You can also invite the brother to spend more time with you and your husband separately, apart from his parents. And the next time you happen to overhear a remark, you might consider going the route of asking a question as opposed to direct confrontation. That is, maybe you could ask the father, "If you were gay, how would you feel about other people saying that about you?" I've often found that when dealing with difficult people, asking them respectful but direct critical questions is often a more effective strategy than simply laying down the law and telling them that they're wrong. Although I admit, I'm human too, and often the temptation for the latter is quite strong in that type of situation. But regardless of what approach you take, remember that empathy and compassion should be your guiding lights. Make sure that the brother's needs are first and foremost in whatever solution you decide on.

QUESTION: My wife and I are expecting our first child, a daughter. As you might imagine, we're over the moon about being new parents and nurturing and loving this new human. Nevertheless, my wife and I are engaged in a nasty recurring argument over whether to baptize our future daughter. My wife came from a fairly secular family but experienced trauma in her early adulthood, including a sexual assault. She found an on-campus religious community that provided tremendous support to her in her healing. And after college she has continued to attend church in that same denomination. She's been a part of this denomination for about 15 years at this point, and I have nothing against her doing this. Obviously she's an autonomous adult, and we don't have to agree on religion. But in my case, I'm an atheist who had some very bad experiences with religion growing up, including multiple attempts to proselytize me. I also had a friend who was abused by a priest. And so for me, organized religion is the root of much evil with corporate greed being the root of most of the rest.

My wife wants to baptize our daughter in her denomination because she wants to pass on to her child the deep connection that she has to her faith. And also, I suspect, because she feels that on some level being part of this religious community might shield her daughter from the trauma that she went through as a younger woman. But for me, I worry that baptizing our daughter in this religion would essentially brainwash and indoctrinate her. I fear our daughter wanting to marry young and then becoming obedient to her husband due to our church's teachings. The denomination is one of the more conservative ones, and I don't agree with most of their teachings. I want our daughter to be a strong young woman, not a slave to her future husband because of religious brainwashing. Should I just give in and let her get indoctrinated, or should I fight harder for her to not be baptized?

ANSWER: It seems like you're falling into a trap that many religious and secular people fall into: framing a problem as a strict black-and-white either/or matter. Fundamentally, it seems to me that both you and your wife are coming from a place of love, and your differences are rooted in very different life experiences with religion. I don't know how much you've talked to your wife about this, but if you haven't, I would suggest first having an open and frank discussion with her about religion in general and what it means to each of you. Frame this in a way that respects her beliefs and life experiences while also reminding her that yours are just as valid, and agree to temporarily stay away from the subject of your daughter's potential baptism. This might help you two to get on the same page on religion in general, and not just over the question of baptizing your daughter. 

Then, when you two have found some common ground over religion (even if it is very limited), return to the subject of the baptism. There might be multiple ways to skin this cat that respect both of your viewpoints and beliefs. For instance, might you agree to having the daughter baptized in a more liberal denomination? This might satisfy your wife's wishes for her to be baptized as a Christian without being baptized in the same denomination whose beliefs you find so problematic. This might seem like an unacceptable compromise, but it's worked for a lot of couples. For instance, when I was dating my wife, I was very reluctant to convert to the dominant religion of her family because I found it unpalatable in many ways. But we compromised, and I converted into a more liberal denomination of the faith, which ended up working out fairly well for us. And don't forget to keep in mind the bigger picture of what your daughter herself might eventually want. Hopefully you and your wife would both agree that when your daughter is old enough to do so, she should be the one to determine her future path, be it a religious path or a secular one. So I think it makes sense to expose her to a mixture of religious and secular viewpoints. The exact contours of this will, of course, be up to you and your wife and eventually up to her. But by coming from a place of compassion and love, you will put her in a position to be well-equipped to make her own faith decision when the time comes.

QUESTION: I am the oldest of three daughters, and my family has always placed a heavy emphasis on achievement and success, conventionally defined—my father is a physician, and my mother is a renowned lawyer, and my younger siblings and I all followed in their footsteps, becoming professionals of various stripes. We're all reasonably happy in our lives, though we face a lot of stress. But I've been encountering one particular problem that has caused me to question some of the values I grew up with. Last year, when my car broke down on the side of the road, I waited 3 hours for AAA, but they never came. Just as hour 4 began, a kindly man around my age drove up in his truck and offered to fix the problem, refusing the money I offered as compensation. On a whim, I asked him if he might want to meet for coffee, and we really hit it off. Now we're in a promising relationship. He came from a working class family and aside from his vocational education, hasn't had much formal education; he's an auto mechanic. But after I told my parents about our relationship, they strongly disapproved, making harsh remarks about me throwing away my life with some "grease monkey" and emphasizing that both of my siblings were married or engaged to fellow highly paid professionals.

I love my parents, but I don't like the way they're treating me or my partner, and now I'm starting to question the ruthless Type A values I was raised to believe in. I have no desire to throw away my professional career, but I'm also queasy about obsessing over status the way I once did. When it comes to my family, should I just keep them at arm's length for as long as I'm in this relationship? Or do you think it's worth trying to confront them and getting them to see the light?

ANSWER: I would agree that your parents are acting inappropriately. We have enough problems with class and income inequality in our society without people throwing fuel on the fire by acting with such disrespect towards those who are different. (Gets down from soap box.) The fact and appropriateness of your relationship with a mechanic is none of their business. You definitely should not feel the need to "hide" your beau to "keep them at arm's length" Without first engaging with your parents directly on this matter. If I were in your shoes, I would sit down with the parents if possible (I don't know if you live close enough to them to do that; if not, then consider a good phone conversation.). I would convey to them that while you love them, you also don't like how they've been treating either of you or the snide remarks they've been making about him. You might say something like, "How would you feel if the roles were reversed, and you were a working-class person being looked down upon by an upper-middle-class professional? Would that make you feel good?" You might also remind them that assuming you're not part of the 0.01% in this country, there are people above you and your parents on the socio-economic ladder that look down on you just as much as your parents look down on this mechanic. You can also remind them that you're an adult capable of making your own decisions. If you want to flatter them, throw in something about them having equipped you well to make these decisions. But fundamentally, keep to the principle that it's your life, not theirs, and act accordingly. I wish you and your partner every happiness.

QUESTION: Like so many others, my teenage daughter is struggling with an eating disorder. In her case, she's lost so many pounds in the last few weeks that she barely resembles her old self. She's obsessed with the idea that she's fat, but in reality, she's dangerously underweight. Making matters worse, my husband seems to not take her situation seriously enough. While I fear for her life if she doesn't get treatment soon, my husband often brushes off the subject when I talk to him about it. He says things like, "Oh, she's just going through a phase," or "Maybe she just doesn't like the food that you cook." I think that my daughter is overhearing this and it might be encouraging her to starve herself even more.

I've always been the non-confrontational type, which I fear has contributed to my daughter getting into the mess that she's in. So I'm not sure really how to confront my husband about this. What do you suggest?

ANSWER: As you noted, this is a life-or-death situation. What I would do is urgently get both your daughter and husband educated on the serious problem of eating disorders, "tout de suite." First, if you haven't already, inform your daughter of the following resources: the 24/7 eating disorder hotline (866-932-1264) and the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD) Helpline (888-375-7767). I would also insist that both your daughter and your husband visit the website of the National Eating Disorders Association, particularly their helpful article "Busting The Myths About Eating Disorders" (https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/busting-myths-about-eating-disorders/). 

The immediate problem, of course, is helping your daughter to get healthy and overcome the disorder, and to learn the skills needed to prevent relapses in the future. This starts with a conversation with her primary care physician and also her therapist, if she has one. But I suspect you're doing most of this already. What you wrote to me about was really a problem of attitudes and education on the part of your husband. In addition to showing him the above-mentioned resources, I would have a serious conversation with him about how his attitudes might be harming his daughter. There is also some underlying sexism and misogyny in his remarks, particularly about what he said about the food that you cook. But educating him on eating disorders is the first priority. Then you can have a longer discussion with him (ideally also with a couples therapist) addressing some of these problematic assumptions that he seems to have about you and about gender roles.

Finally, by all means, whenever your husband makes one of these remarks and there's even the possibility that your daughter could have been around, seek her out at your first opportunity and emphasize to her that what her father said was wrong. Tell her the facts in a calm manner, not to demonize her father but rather to show that his harmful views aren't correct. Facts and sincere affirmation are the best antidotes to misguided and harmful ignorance.

QUESTION: I feel that I'm a walking, breathing cliche. I'm a 54-year-old woman whose similarly-aged husband cheated on me with his 24-year-old secretary. It's really the oldest story on God's green earth. I naively took him at his word when he told me that he was working late on Monday and Wednesday evenings. He told me that he had a big project to finish up, and his boss had laid off his assistant, so he was forced to do two people's jobs. Thus, he had to spend many hours at work outside of the workday to get it all done. 

Imagine my surprise when my best friend told me that she had seen my husband and a much younger woman out at a nice restaurant after working hours while my friend was on a date there! I confronted him, and after initial predictable denials, he confessed. He told me that she made him feel young and wanted. Again, you can find countless examples of this story down to the small details. But now that I'm reeling from this betrayal, I'm wondering whether to stay or to leave him. He has always been a good husband and provider, and I believe him when he told me that he hasn't slept with anybody outside of the marriage except for the secretary. He swore to me that he would change. However, a couple of weeks ago, after we tried to reconcile, my friend once again saw him out with the girlfriend at the same restaurant. (He could have at least been smart about it and gone to a different restaurant with her.) Clearly he hasn't ended things with her. He has many good qualities, but I don't know if I can forgive him for this. Should I stay or should I go?

ANSWER: I'm sorry that you're in this situation. Nobody deserves to be cheated on. Whether to stay or go in the event of an extramarital affair is one of those questions where good, reasonable people can disagree. Some are of the opinion that even one incident of cheating is too much, and that the trust can never be restored. On the other hand, others subscribe to the school of thought of allowing their partners a second or even third chance. Clearly you're at least open to the possibility of taking him back, but given that this betrayal has happened multiple times and that the deceit is continuing after his assurances that it wouldn't, I would be hesitant about taking him back.

If you haven't already, find a good therapist to discuss this question with. Try to look for larger patterns. For instance, have you been cheated on before and then taken a partner back? What happened then? Your husband told you that he hasn't cheated on you with anyone except for the secretary, but has he engaged in any other dishonest behavior, such as using family money for questionable purposes? Usually when somebody is deceitful or dishonest in one area, they act similarly in other areas. Ultimately, the decision on whether to stay or go is yours, but I would exercise caution regarding his ability to change given what you've experienced thus far. If there were a graveyard for all failed relationships and marriages, probably about half of the headstones would read: "She tried to change him."

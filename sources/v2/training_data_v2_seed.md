QUESTION: My husband and I (both in our late 30s) have very different approaches to conflict. I want to talk things through right away, while he tends to shut down and say he needs space. When we argue, I feel abandoned when he walks away, and he says he feels attacked when I keep pushing. We both agree we love each other and don’t want every disagreement to turn into a blowup, but we haven’t found a way to meet in the middle. How can we handle conflict without repeating this same pattern every time?

ANSWER: Start by talking about this pattern at a calm time, not in the middle of an argument. Name what happens in neutral terms: you pursue, he withdraws, and both of you end up feeling misunderstood. Then, instead of arguing about who is “right,” see if you can agree on a shared goal: “When we disagree, we want both people to feel heard and neither person to feel cornered or abandoned.”

From there, negotiate some specific ground rules. For example: if he needs a break, he agrees to say, “I’m overwhelmed; I need 30 minutes and then I’ll come back and talk,” and you agree to honor that time-limited pause instead of following him from room to room. In return, you ask that when he comes back, he stays engaged for a set amount of time before calling another break. You can also agree to use “I” statements (“I felt shut out when you left the room”) instead of global labels (“You always run away”), which lower the emotional temperature. If these patterns are deeply rooted, a few sessions with a couples therapist can give you both a neutral referee and practice tools that feel less personal and more like skills you’re learning together.

QUESTION: I’m a 29-year-old woman who recently moved in with my boyfriend. I’ve noticed that his mom texts and calls him multiple times a day about minor things—what he ate, whether he got enough sleep, if he remembered to bring a jacket. He usually answers right away and sometimes even leaves our plans hanging to respond. When I bring it up, he says I’m overreacting and that she “just worries.” I don’t want to be the person who makes him choose between me and his mom, but I also feel like we’re never fully alone. How can I set boundaries here without sounding controlling?

ANSWER: You don’t need to make this about his mother’s worth as a parent; you can keep it focused on what you need in your relationship. Start by describing specific moments instead of labeling the whole dynamic: “When we’re in the middle of dinner and you step away to text your mom for ten minutes, I feel pushed to the side.” Then follow it with a clear request: “When we’re on a date or having a planned evening together, I’d like us both to silence non‑urgent notifications unless there’s an emergency.”

It may help to frame this as a growing-up step rather than a rejection of his mom: “Part of living together is learning to protect time that’s just ours. That doesn’t mean you love your mom any less—it just means we’re building our own household.” Ask him what feels reasonable to him: maybe he checks in with her once a day at a predictable time, instead of constantly. If he refuses to consider any limits at all, that’s not about his mom; it’s about whether he’s ready to prioritize your shared life. In that case, the harder question is not “How do I change his contact with her?” but “Can I accept being in a relationship where our time as a couple is always second place?”

<END_OF_SET>

QUESTION: My partner and I have very different social batteries. I’m an introvert who needs quiet evenings to recharge after work, while she loves to host people and have something on the calendar most nights. When I say I need a night in, she takes it as a rejection and says I’m “never up for anything.” When she fills our week with plans, I start to dread it and feel resentful. We both feel criticized and misunderstood. How can we find a rhythm that doesn’t leave one of us exhausted and the other one lonely?

ANSWER: Treat this as a logistics puzzle, not a character judgment. You’re not “boring” and she’s not “too much”; you simply have different settings that need to be respected. Start by mapping out a typical week together and literally blocking off “quiet nights” and “social nights” on a shared calendar. For example, you might agree that two evenings a week are guaranteed quiet time at home, two are open for social plans together, and the rest are flexible.

On her high‑social nights, she can still make plans without you, as long as that’s discussed in advance and not treated as punishment. On your quiet nights, you commit to being present with her—phones down, some shared activity—even if it’s low‑key. Make sure you both have something to look forward to: she gets her people time, you get your recharge time, and neither of you is surprised by a last‑minute jammed schedule. If this continues to be a sore spot, a counselor can help you both translate “I feel rejected” and “I feel overwhelmed” into specific, negotiable needs instead of accusations.

QUESTION: My husband and I have been married for 10 years, and while it's mostly been a good marriage with the usual ups and downs, a toxic dynamic has evolved where both of us rush to blame the other during arguments. For example, last week our cat escaped and my youngest child and I spent several hours looking for her before a neighbor thankfully found and returned her. The relief of having her back should have been the end of it, but instead the incident sparked a painful argument about whose "fault" it was—-my husband blamed me for leaving the door open when I went out to tend to our plants (I was only outside for a few minutes), while I blamed him because the only reason I went out to water the plants was that he had neglected to do it after saying he would take care of them. The argument was unproductive, as almost all of our arguments are. We've been in couples therapy but haven't made much progress, in part because my husband doesn't take therapy seriously. How can we overcome this blame dynamic and develop a better marital relationship?

ANSWER: This is a common problem, so you're hardly alone in facing this. Your husband's reluctance to take therapy seriously is discouraging, but there are other approaches you can take. During a moment when both of you are calm, approach him and say something like, "Honey, I've noticed that when we fight, we often blame each other for problems, and this doesn't resolve anything. It just results in hurt feelings for both of us. What do you think we can do to address this?"

Much will depend on how he responds. If he doesn't respond well, particularly after repeated attempts to address this amicably, then it might behoove you to engage in solo therapy to explore any underlying problems behind this pattern. But if he is open to engaging with you, try this exercise: the next time you have an argument and one of you starts blaming the other, get out a piece of paper and each of you write down possible solutions, with a rule that nobody can write anything blaming the other partner—just focus on solutions. Blame is a dynamic that tends to be self-reinforcing: the more you resort to blame, the more it feels natural, but the good news is that it works the other way as well—the less you engage in blame over time, the less it becomes the default way of "solving" problems. Over time, this exercise should help change this difficult dynamic while also solving the original problems more quickly. I would also recommend reading John Gottman's book, "The 7 Principles for Making Marriage Work," which contains excellent advice about the blame game and other marital challenges.

QUESTION: My husband and I are facing a dilemma over how to respond to a problem with how his family treats his brother. Both of us have long suspected that my husband's brother is gay. At one point, the brother even came to my husband asking for advice on how to come out of the closet. However, in large part because of their family's attitudes, the brother has never actually come out to them. From time to time, I overhear some of my husband's family, particularly my father-in-law, make offensive and cruel remarks about gay people. I don't know if the father-in-law suspects that one of his sons is gay or not, but regardless, this creates an alienating environment for us and obviously especially for the brother.

Our dilemma is on how to respond to this, if at all. I would like for us, or at least for my husband, to bring this up with his father and to make clear that we don't approve of these cruel remarks. My husband has made it clear that even though he strongly disapproves of the anti-gay remarks, he wants to preserve his relationship with his father and doesn't want to intervene. I tend to feel that since it's his family, he should have more of a say on how to engage with them. But it really hurts to stand by and say nothing while my husband's father creates such an intolerant environment. Do you think that we should just let this go or do you feel that it's worth risking our relationship with his father to try to improve the situation?

ANSWER: What about the brother's opinion of all this? Before confronting his father, why don't you two, or just your husband, approach the brother and gently ask him what he thinks the best course of action is? Given that he seems to be the one most affected by the remarks, his opinion should be given special weight. Only confront the father if the brother is okay with that. You don't want to risk a backlash by confronting the father and then him responding by treating his son even worse. And even though what the father is saying is clearly abhorrent, the son that you suspect is gay might have his own reasons for wanting to preserve his own relationship with his father.

Regardless of whether you choose to confront the father directly, there are more subtle ways that you can send signals of disapproval about the remarks. For instance, you can limit your visits to those particular relatives when the father is around. You can also invite the brother to spend more time with you and your husband separately, apart from his parents. And the next time you happen to overhear a remark, you might consider going the route of asking a question as opposed to direct confrontation. That is, maybe you could ask the father, "If you were gay, how would you feel about other people saying that about you?" I've often found that when dealing with difficult people, asking them respectful but direct critical questions is often a more effective strategy than simply laying down the law and telling them that they're wrong. Although I admit, I'm human too, and often the temptation for the latter is quite strong in that type of situation. But regardless of what approach you take, remember that empathy and compassion should be your guiding lights. Make sure that the brother's needs are first and foremost in whatever solution you decide on.

QUESTION: My wife and I are expecting our first child, a daughter. As you might imagine, we're over the moon about being new parents and nurturing and loving this new human. Nevertheless, my wife and I are engaged in a nasty recurring argument over whether to baptize our future daughter. My wife came from a fairly secular family but experienced trauma in her early adulthood, including a sexual assault. She found an on-campus religious community that provided tremendous support to her in her healing. And after college she has continued to attend church in that same denomination. She's been a part of this denomination for about 15 years at this point, and I have nothing against her doing this. Obviously she's an autonomous adult, and we don't have to agree on religion. But in my case, I'm an atheist who had some very bad experiences with religion growing up, including multiple attempts to proselytize me. I also had a friend who was abused by a priest. And so for me, organized religion is the root of much evil with corporate greed being the root of most of the rest.

My wife wants to baptize our daughter in her denomination because she wants to pass on to her child the deep connection that she has to her faith. And also, I suspect, because she feels that on some level being part of this religious community might shield her daughter from the trauma that she went through as a younger woman. But for me, I worry that baptizing our daughter in this religion would essentially brainwash and indoctrinate her. I fear our daughter wanting to marry young and then becoming obedient to her husband due to our church's teachings. The denomination is one of the more conservative ones, and I don't agree with most of their teachings. I want our daughter to be a strong young woman, not a slave to her future husband because of religious brainwashing. Should I just give in and let her get indoctrinated, or should I fight harder for her to not be baptized?

ANSWER: It seems like you're falling into a trap that many religious and secular people fall into: framing a problem as a strict black-and-white either/or matter. Fundamentally, it seems to me that both you and your wife are coming from a place of love, and your differences are rooted in very different life experiences with religion. I don't know how much you've talked to your wife about this, but if you haven't, I would suggest first having an open and frank discussion with her about religion in general and what it means to each of you. Frame this in a way that respects her beliefs and life experiences while also reminding her that yours are just as valid, and agree to temporarily stay away from the subject of your daughter's potential baptism. This might help you two to get on the same page on religion in general, and not just over the question of baptizing your daughter. 

Then, when you two have found some common ground over religion (even if it is very limited), return to the subject of the baptism. There might be multiple ways to skin this cat that respect both of your viewpoints and beliefs. For instance, might you agree to having the daughter baptized in a more liberal denomination? This might satisfy your wife's wishes for her to be baptized as a Christian without being baptized in the same denomination whose beliefs you find so problematic. This might seem like an unacceptable compromise, but it's worked for a lot of couples. For instance, when I was dating my wife, I was very reluctant to convert to the dominant religion of her family because I found it unpalatable in many ways. But we compromised, and I converted into a more liberal denomination of the faith, which ended up working out fairly well for us. And don't forget to keep in mind the bigger picture of what your daughter herself might eventually want. Hopefully you and your wife would both agree that when your daughter is old enough to do so, she should be the one to determine her future path, be it a religious path or a secular one. So I think it makes sense to expose her to a mixture of religious and secular viewpoints. The exact contours of this will, of course, be up to you and your wife and eventually up to her. But by coming from a place of compassion and love, you will put her in a position to be well-equipped to make her own faith decision when the time comes.

QUESTION: I am the oldest of three daughters, and my family has always placed a heavy emphasis on achievement and success, conventionally defined—my father is a physician, and my mother is a renowned lawyer, and my younger siblings and I all followed in their footsteps, becoming professionals of various stripes. We're all reasonably happy in our lives, though we face a lot of stress. But I've been encountering one particular problem that has caused me to question some of the values I grew up with. Last year, when my car broke down on the side of the road, I waited 3 hours for AAA, but they never came. Just as hour 4 began, a kindly man around my age drove up in his truck and offered to fix the problem, refusing the money I offered as compensation. On a whim, I asked him if he might want to meet for coffee, and we really hit it off. Now we're in a promising relationship. He came from a working class family and aside from his vocational education, hasn't had much formal education; he's an auto mechanic. But after I told my parents about our relationship, they strongly disapproved, making harsh remarks about me throwing away my life with some "grease monkey" and emphasizing that both of my siblings were married or engaged to fellow highly paid professionals.

I love my parents, but I don't like the way they're treating me or my partner, and now I'm starting to question the ruthless Type A values I was raised to believe in. I have no desire to throw away my professional career, but I'm also queasy about obsessing over status the way I once did. When it comes to my family, should I just keep them at arm's length for as long as I'm in this relationship? Or do you think it's worth trying to confront them and getting them to see the light?

ANSWER: I would agree that your parents are acting inappropriately. We have enough problems with class and income inequality in our society without people throwing fuel on the fire by acting with such disrespect towards those who are different. (Gets down from soap box.) The fact and appropriateness of your relationship with a mechanic is none of their business. You definitely should not feel the need to "hide" your beau to "keep them at arm's length" Without first engaging with your parents directly on this matter. If I were in your shoes, I would sit down with the parents if possible (I don't know if you live close enough to them to do that; if not, then consider a good phone conversation.). I would convey to them that while you love them, you also don't like how they've been treating either of you or the snide remarks they've been making about him. You might say something like, "How would you feel if the roles were reversed, and you were a working-class person being looked down upon by an upper-middle-class professional? Would that make you feel good?" You might also remind them that assuming you're not part of the 0.01% in this country, there are people above you and your parents on the socio-economic ladder that look down on you just as much as your parents look down on this mechanic. You can also remind them that you're an adult capable of making your own decisions. If you want to flatter them, throw in something about them having equipped you well to make these decisions. But fundamentally, keep to the principle that it's your life, not theirs, and act accordingly. I wish you and your partner every happiness.

QUESTION: Like so many others, my teenage daughter is struggling with an eating disorder. In her case, she's lost so many pounds in the last few weeks that she barely resembles her old self. She's obsessed with the idea that she's fat, but in reality, she's dangerously underweight. Making matters worse, my husband seems to not take her situation seriously enough. While I fear for her life if she doesn't get treatment soon, my husband often brushes off the subject when I talk to him about it. He says things like, "Oh, she's just going through a phase," or "Maybe she just doesn't like the food that you cook." I think that my daughter is overhearing this and it might be encouraging her to starve herself even more.

I've always been the non-confrontational type, which I fear has contributed to my daughter getting into the mess that she's in. So I'm not sure really how to confront my husband about this. What do you suggest?

ANSWER: As you noted, this is a life-or-death situation. What I would do is urgently get both your daughter and husband educated on the serious problem of eating disorders, "tout de suite." First, if you haven't already, inform your daughter of the following resources: the 24/7 eating disorder hotline (866-932-1264) and the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD) Helpline (888-375-7767). I would also insist that both your daughter and your husband visit the website of the National Eating Disorders Association, particularly their helpful article "Busting The Myths About Eating Disorders" (https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/busting-myths-about-eating-disorders/). 

The immediate problem, of course, is helping your daughter to get healthy and overcome the disorder, and to learn the skills needed to prevent relapses in the future. This starts with a conversation with her primary care physician and also her therapist, if she has one. But I suspect you're doing most of this already. What you wrote to me about was really a problem of attitudes and education on the part of your husband. In addition to showing him the above-mentioned resources, I would have a serious conversation with him about how his attitudes might be harming his daughter. There is also some underlying sexism and misogyny in his remarks, particularly about what he said about the food that you cook. But educating him on eating disorders is the first priority. Then you can have a longer discussion with him (ideally also with a couples therapist) addressing some of these problematic assumptions that he seems to have about you and about gender roles.

Finally, by all means, whenever your husband makes one of these remarks and there's even the possibility that your daughter could have been around, seek her out at your first opportunity and emphasize to her that what her father said was wrong. Tell her the facts in a calm manner, not to demonize her father but rather to show that his harmful views aren't correct. Facts and sincere affirmation are the best antidotes to misguided and harmful ignorance.

QUESTION: I feel that I'm a walking, breathing cliche. I'm a 54-year-old woman whose similarly-aged husband cheated on me with his 24-year-old secretary. It's really the oldest story on God's green earth. I naively took him at his word when he told me that he was working late on Monday and Wednesday evenings. He told me that he had a big project to finish up, and his boss had laid off his assistant, so he was forced to do two people's jobs. Thus, he had to spend many hours at work outside of the workday to get it all done. 

Imagine my surprise when my best friend told me that she had seen my husband and a much younger woman out at a nice restaurant after working hours while my friend was on a date there! I confronted him, and after initial predictable denials, he confessed. He told me that she made him feel young and wanted. Again, you can find countless examples of this story down to the small details. But now that I'm reeling from this betrayal, I'm wondering whether to stay or to leave him. He has always been a good husband and provider, and I believe him when he told me that he hasn't slept with anybody outside of the marriage except for the secretary. He swore to me that he would change. However, a couple of weeks ago, after we tried to reconcile, my friend once again saw him out with the girlfriend at the same restaurant. (He could have at least been smart about it and gone to a different restaurant with her.) Clearly he hasn't ended things with her. He has many good qualities, but I don't know if I can forgive him for this. Should I stay or should I go?

ANSWER: I'm sorry that you're in this situation. Nobody deserves to be cheated on. Whether to stay or go in the event of an extramarital affair is one of those questions where good, reasonable people can disagree. Some are of the opinion that even one incident of cheating is too much, and that the trust can never be restored. On the other hand, others subscribe to the school of thought of allowing their partners a second or even third chance. Clearly you're at least open to the possibility of taking him back, but given that this betrayal has happened multiple times and that the deceit is continuing after his assurances that it wouldn't, I would be hesitant about taking him back.

If you haven't already, find a good therapist to discuss this question with. Try to look for larger patterns. For instance, have you been cheated on before and then taken a partner back? What happened then? Your husband told you that he hasn't cheated on you with anyone except for the secretary, but has he engaged in any other dishonest behavior, such as using family money for questionable purposes? Usually when somebody is deceitful or dishonest in one area, they act similarly in other areas. Ultimately, the decision on whether to stay or go is yours, but I would exercise caution regarding his ability to change given what you've experienced thus far. If there were a graveyard for all failed relationships and marriages, probably about half of the headstones would read: "She tried to change him."

QUESTION: I'm engaged to a wonderful man. We've been together for two years, and even though we've had our ups and downs, it's mostly been great. But we've hit a major snag when it comes to wedding planning. Since he proposed a couple of months ago, our first concern has been cost. We're both graduate students, and we're several years away from being able to earn good money. I come from a modest background where there was never much extra money growing up. But my fiancé's family is much wealthier. His parents agreed to pay for the entire wedding, which really floored me and was something that we gratefully accepted. But there was a catch. Since they've agreed to fund the wedding, they've been trying to dictate to us non-stop every little detail, right down to the color of the flowers. They've even hinted in a backhanded way that they might withdraw financial support for our wedding if we don't do things exactly their way.

I understand the need to take family concerns into consideration when planning a wedding, but we want to be able to make a lot of decisions ourselves. After all, we're the ones getting married. My dilemma is whether or not to just suck it up and let them dictate how the wedding should be done to the last detail, or whether we should push back. A third option would be to elope, which honestly part of me really wants to do. But I've always wanted a big wedding and really hope that we can somehow have our cake and eat it too. How do you suggest approaching this?

ANSWER: I'm sorry that your dream wedding is coming with so many strings attached, but unfortunately, that's fairly common. What I'd suggest you do first is have an honest conversation with your fiancé. Sit down and discuss: what are the essentials that you must have in your wedding? What are some things that you can negotiate on? And what are some things that you don't particularly care about? Then, you might want to make a list as to what your preferences are in each of those categories versus what his parents' preferences are. This will help you have a holistic view to see whether there's enough alignment with their preferences to, as you say, "suck it up" and go along with what they want.

If you're generally okay with their direction but have a few deal-breakers, then I would suggest talking to them in a compassionate and loving manner. Tell them that you're extremely grateful for their support for the wedding, but there are a few details that you want to have different than what they envision. Hopefully, they'll be reasonable and accept that not every little detail can be dictated by them regardless of who's paying. And then there's the nuclear option of either eloping or holding a much more modest wedding within your means. I wouldn't rule this out, especially if your preliminary discussion with your partner reveals that there are just too many differences between your vision of the wedding and what his parents' vision of the wedding is. Weddings tend to be unconscionably expensive, but there are definitely ways that you can reduce costs. Having a small guest list is the most obvious of these, though of course that comes with its own social politics. I'd also recommend that you check out "The Budget-Savvy Wedding Planner & Organizer: Checklists, Worksheets, and Essential Tools to Plan the Perfect Wedding on a Small Budget" by Jessica Bishop. It's chock-full of useful suggestions on how to economize wedding planning and still have a beautiful and meaningful ceremony without breaking the bank. Good luck.

QUESTION: My wife and I have been married for about 15 years. For the first few years, our sex life was great. We were, as the saying goes, "f***ing like bunnies". But as the years wore on, especially once we had kids, we hit a rough spot in the bedroom. Since we had our second and final child, my wife only wants sex once every few weeks, and sometimes once every few months. When we do have sex, I almost always have to initiate, and she's just not as, shall we say, vigorous as was the case before. I love my wife and want to respect her preferences, but at the same time, I feel that my sexual needs are no longer being met. Am I doomed to spend the rest of my days in a sexually unsatisfying marriage, or is there hope for us?

ANSWER: As you might be aware, this is a very common problem, but that doesn't make it any less painful. Since there is such a huge spectrum of sexual desire/libido among humans, it's very likely that any given marriage will have a mismatch in libido, be it large or small. Working this out depends on many things, particularly:
1. How large the libido gap is
2. The personalities of the partners
3. How open both partners are to compromise

There are, of course, a few basic ground rules:
1. Nobody should ever have sex that they don't want to have
2. Any negotiations about sex should be done in a loving and compassionate manner

With that in mind, have a frank discussion with your wife about this issue. Frame the problem not as her not giving you what you want, but rather as an apparent mismatch in sexual interest. Don't frame your own higher libido as better or normative. Approach this in a compassionate manner, and ask if she might be willing to compromise. For instance, ask if you both could have sex a little more often, but still within her comfort zone. Also, there is a lot of stigma around this, but there is no shame in satisfying your needs on the side as long as it doesn't involve an extra-marital affair. That is, as long as it's done ethically. By this I mean, well, sometimes taking solo flights when the dual flight is canceled or delayed. Almost all married people, even in happy marriages, satisfy themselves sometimes. And that's perfectly normal, as long as it doesn't substitute for your actual sex life. For a compassionate and common-sense view of such matters, and male sexuality in general, I'd highly recommend checking out Bernie Zilbergeld's book, "The New Male Sexuality." It's an oldie but goodie that even after a few decades still stands the test of time.

QUESTION: My husband has a habit of criticizing me when I do something wrong, or when he thinks I do something wrong. This behavior has unfortunately been escalating over the past few months. It started even before our wedding. For instance, he would remark upon my having chosen the "wrong" dress rather than telling a white lie that he liked the dress. Also, he would say things like, "You must be so glad you found me given how you were living before." Like most people in love, I brushed off these red flags, thinking that he would change after the wedding. But alas, things only got worse from there. Now that we've been married several years and have two kids, he started insulting me in front of the kids. He also tries to make me believe things that I know aren't true. For instance, by repeating lies to me, such as accusing me of losing our house keys, when in fact he's the one who misplaced them. They were found in the pocket of his suit jacket, for goodness sake!

My husband is mostly a wonderful man and a good father, and I dread the prospect of becoming a single mother, so I don't want to lose him. I've tried talking with him about the insults, but he always brushes me off. Is there a way that I can address this to salvage the marriage? Or do you think I should look for the exit?

ANSWER: Oh my goodness, you should run and not walk to the exit door. This is a textbook case of emotional and verbal abuse and gaslighting. Your husband insults you even after you've pointed it out and asked him to stop. He tries to get you to believe things that you know aren't true, and thus to undermine your confidence in yourself and your sense of reality, which is the definition of gaslighting. And he's doing it in front of your children. You even say that these are "red flags." This marriage is clearly beyond the point of no return. Rather than trying to change him, you should look for the safest and quickest way out of the marriage, which I know won't be easy.

The good news is that there are resources for domestic violence victims like you to get out safely. The first steps should be to find a time when he's not around and call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233. This service is available in many languages to everyone who needs it. They will help you devise an escape plan. Also, what support network do you have? Do you have a mother or sister or brother or best friend who could help you? Speak to someone who you trust about the situation. Hopefully, they will see the obvious fact that this is domestic abuse and they will rush to help. If not, don't let them convince you that what you're seeing isn't true. Go to somebody else you trust. If you don't have anyone around you who you trust, then find a local women's shelter. They can provide you with a lot of resources. And when the time comes, of course, you'll need to visit an attorney. But your safety comes before everything else. You deserve so much better, and you need to get out now. Good luck to you.

QUESTION: I'm engaged to be married to a wonderful man we met online about a year and a half ago. When he proposed, I was really over the moon. This has been a fairytale story, except for one major aspect: my extremely religious sister doesn't approve of him. Why? It boils down to the fact that he's divorced. In our religious tradition, if you enter into marriage with somebody, even if the marriage itself was not in this tradition, and you then divorce, our church has to find a reason why the divorce is invalid in order to permit the person to marry a second time within this church. It's called an annulment. My fiance has been willing to go quite far for my family with regards to religion, including even getting baptized, albeit not in our same denomination. But very reasonably, he's decided not to do an annulment on the grounds that it would be an unacceptable intrusion into his private life. And he's right. We don't need priests digging into his past life.

But this refusal to do the annulment is a deal-breaker for my sister, who will only attend my wedding if the annulment happens and if my fiance gets baptized into the "right" sect. It's looking like a real possibility that my sister will skip the wedding. I really want her there, and I've tried to explain this to her and get her to understand that even though she may not agree with the wedding or with my choice of a partner, she needs to attend because that's what sisters who love their sisters do. I am politically liberal, but if she were to marry someone who's a huge Trump supporter and conservative, I wouldn't hesitate to attend. (She is single now.) Because again that's what sisters do.

Is there a way that I can approach the topic that I haven't thought of that might help come around to seeing reason, or should I just deal with not having my beloved sister at the wedding? (Oh, and one thing I forgot to mention, I encouraged her to see a priest to discuss this matter on the hopes that he would tell her something along the lines of: "Yes, go to the wedding because you love your sister and it's the right thing to do. It's not anything that will undermine your faith or commitment to God." But she won't go, and my husband suspects the reason is because she knows that the priest will probably say something along these lines.)

ANSWER: Your predicament is unfortunate, and I'm sorry you have to go through that. Unfortunately, when dealing with other adults, there's always only so much that you can do to get them to do what you want. It seems like you have tried to engage her in a loving and compassionate manner, and try to convince her to come to the wedding, but it sounds like she won't budge. You might try one more time with something along the lines of: "[Sister], I know that you love me and I love you. And I would gladly attend your wedding if you have one in the future, regardless of the groom that you choose or what his faith is. So can you please find it within yourself to come to our wedding? It's not going to be any judgment on you or your faith. It's just an expression of love for me, and it would mean the world to me."

My only other real suggestion to try to get her to come around would be something that you've already effectively ruled out: talking to a faith leader in her tradition about the subject. You might still consider talking to a faith leader yourself and with your partner, but without your sister present. Not because you think he's going to give you some sort of argument to convince her to come to the wedding, but just to hear his perspective. (If this is the faith that I think it is, the priest will only be a "he".) He might give you a compassionate perspective on accepting your sister not coming to the wedding because realistically, that seems to be your only real option at this point assuming that your Hail Mary (sorry) doesn't pan out. As hard as it may be, don't take it personally and encourage your fiancé to not take it personally either. This is all about the sister and has nothing to do with you or your fiancé or your choice of a partner. So go to the wedding, enjoy it, and savor the time around people you love. Your sister will be there for other events. Above all, try not to let her absence dominate your experience of the wedding. Her absence is unfortunate, but it's one of those things that happens in life that one just has to deal with. I wish you and your fiance many years of happiness and a beautiful wedding.

QUESTION: My partner and I are both liberal, but most of my family is strongly conservative, as in hardcore Trump-loving conservative. As you can imagine, we've had our share of disagreements, but we've found ways to agree to disagree. We just try not to discuss politics, and we have a rule to never talk to each other on the day of a major election, like the midterms or a presidential election. This has worked reasonably well for us and has managed to keep us in relatively close contact.

The problem is that my partner, who's an outspoken activist in our local Democratic Party, refuses to come to family events. He came to our Easter celebration one year and was visibly upset by some of the things that my parents said regarding Trump and immigrants. Even though I 100% agree with my partner that those things were wrong, it's still important for me to spend time with my family. Lately, my partner will make excuses for not coming to family events. He'll say he's too tired or he'll say that it's too long of a drive (they live 3 hours away, but my husband routinely makes drives longer than that for work and to go to his video game conventions.) 

My family has asked why he's not coming, and I have to fudge it or come up with half-true excuses. They're smart people, and they've started to suspect the real reason for his not coming. I've tried to talk to him about it, but again he's always evasive. Should I sit down with him and ask him point-blank to please tell me the truth so we can clear the air? Or should I respect his opinions as a fellow adult and just drop the matter?

ANSWER: This is a difficult situation, I'm sorry. On the surface, I feel for your partner, as I have similar political opinions to the two of you, and I still get roiled up when I hear certain types of remarks, even after 10 years of Donald Trump being in the national political spotlight. But I still think that your partner is being a bit of a coward. He won't admit what's plainly obvious to you and what your family is starting to catch on to. It's fine to have differing opinions, but one shouldn't tell half-truths or be evasive when it comes to the reason for not seeing their significant other's family. At this point, this is starting to cost you time with people you love, and that's not okay. So, what I would do is sit down with him and have the conversation that you propose. Tell him that you know the real reason why he's avoiding them. And that it's deceitful and insulting to your intelligence for him to not admit that. And then tell him that you want to be around your family more than he's allowing you to be (assuming that's true). Ask him to reconsider his boycott of your family if only for your sake. You might want to reassure him about how you have found ways of accommodating political differences with your family, and tell him that he can use similar strategies with them to do the same. (And if your family is anything like conservative (and liberal) relatives that I know, they will care more about his character and how he treats you than how he votes at the ballot box.) Right now, frankly, his actions don't reflect well on his character.

If he still won't be accommodating to you after having a frank and honest discussion with him and laying out what I just said and anything else that you feel to be important, then honestly, I'd reconsider your choice of a partner. You don't want to be around somebody who's not willing to experience discomfort for the sake of their partner or to defend their beliefs in the presence of people who disagree with them. Because if you go on to marry this person or have a lifelong partnership with them outside of marriage, what would you be signing up for? Do you want decades with someone who won't stand up for you or defend what he believes in when challenged?

QUESTION: I'm going through a nasty divorce. My husband and I were married for about 20 years, and the marriage unraveled for a variety of reasons. Yes, there was infidelity, but that honestly wasn't the biggest part of it. The infidelity was really a symptom rather than a cause of what broke us up. Effectively, we just weren't communicating well, and we realized that we would be happier with other people.

The specific problem that I am writing to you about is our families' very different opinions about divorce and their impacts on me. Not to be stereotypical, but my family is from the West Coast, and they have a more relaxed attitude towards things like divorce. Obviously they don't like divorce, but they accept that it's sometimes necessary when a marriage has run its course or otherwise is damaged beyond repair. They're being very compassionate and graceful towards me and even towards him. My soon-to-be ex-husband's family, on the other hand, is much more religious and conservative. They feel that divorce is a sin and that he needs to stay in the marriage at all costs. Perhaps owing to the fact that their religious tradition is more than a little patriarchal, they've been venting most of their anger on me rather than him. Even though he's the one who cheated. They've been making snide remarks towards me about how I didn't cut it as a wife and mother. And they even called me a few times and half cajoled me, half insulted me into trying to reconsider ending the marriage.

Now I know that after the divorce, I will have less reason to interact with them. But the fact that I have three children with my husband means that they won't be out of our lives entirely. At least not until the children grow up. And that's assuming the children decide to cut ties with them, which is unlikely because our daughter in particular is close to one of her uncles and those cousins. Obviously, once our children become adults, they'll have every right to make their own independent decisions on whether to maintain ties with these soon-to-be former relatives. But I fear that keeping these relatives in our lives for the children's sake is just going to mean that the insults and other poor behavior will continue. How can I respect the wishes of my children to choose their own relationship with their in-laws while protecting myself from their vitriol?

ANSWER: This is a dilemma for sure, but like many relationship dilemmas, the imperfect but necessary solution is to create boundaries. You can't control how these soon-to-be former in-laws view you or your husband or the institution of marriage. But you can control, to the extent possible, the extent to which they can be in your lives. One suggestion is to try to have a conversation with them to clear the air and push for better treatment. Discuss how hurt you feel by their remarks and say that, while you disagree with them on the divorce, it's your and your husband's right as adults to choose whether or not to stay in the marriage. Maybe even invoke some Christian teachings to try to get them to rediscover their compassionate side around you.

But if this doesn't work, and my spidey sense thinks that it won't, your only real option is to set strict boundaries with them. For instance, make it a rule that you will never talk to them unless it pertains to your children. And while your children are still minors (I presume they still are due to the context of this letter), try to arrange meetings between them and those relatives where you have minimal contact. If possible, ask your ex-husband if he can participate in those meetings without you. Remember that you don't owe anybody anything except for your children, and to the extent required by law and common ethics, your husband as well. (For example, he will presumably be entitled to some amount of custody as the father of the children, unless he's a true monster.) And even while your kids are still minors, you don't have to agree to a Christmas or Thanksgiving or anything else with these in-laws. Those expectations collapsed when the marriage did. You can limit your interaction with them to the extent necessary to facilitate periodic visits between them and your children. And after these children become adults, they can conduct their completely autonomous relationships with these relatives if they so choose, without your having to be involved at all. Good luck and chin up. It will get better.

QUESTION: I'm a 37-year-old man, and I live with my long-term partner. No kids. My brother and I are not close. He lives just a 3-hour drive away, and we routinely make drives longer than that for various reasons, but we only see him maybe once every couple of years. And this includes Christmases and Thanksgivings. We are not actively hostile. We get along relatively well, and we have a few things in common. But we really are at the level of at most casual friends. I have co-workers who I'm closer to than my brother. I want to reconcile with him, but I really don't know how. You have any strategies for trying to connect with a semi-estranged but not hostile sibling?

ANSWER: It's hard to know exactly what advice to provide, given the limited context I have here. For instance:
- What are the reasons for the estrangement?
- Was there a fierce sibling rivalry growing up?
- Was there competition over grades or even over a person?
- Or did you or him do something negative to the other as children?

The general advice on family estrangement is that it's heavily context-specific. In the most extreme cases, such as abuse, the right and reasonable course of action is to cut off contact to the extent possible. But it doesn't sound from your letter like this is the case. In less extreme situations, it really depends a lot on the reasons for the estrangement and knowing the other person, how you think they would react. In these less extreme situations, it's usually a good idea to reach out directly to the person and try to clear the air. This doesn't necessarily need to involve a tell-all or a play-by-play recounting of what happened in the past between you. It could just be something along the lines of: "Hey [Brother], I'm sure you've noticed we don't talk very often and I'd like to change that. I value you as a sibling and love you and hope that we can have a good relationship. What do you think about that?" 

That conveys that you've taken the initiative to try to improve the situation, and that then puts the ball in his court. Ultimately, it will depend on how he responds as to whether or not you two can have a closer relationship. You will have done your part by starting the conversation just mentioned. Another thing I would suggest is to try to meet him at his place rather than the reverse. You can make that 3-hour drive as an additional gesture of your goodwill. Obviously with some advance notice, however. Good luck.

QUESTION: My daughter just came out to my husband and me. It happened relatively undramatically. We were all sitting around the kitchen table, eating dinner, and she mentioned that she had something to tell us. She said that her friend, who we will call Chloe, is actually her girlfriend, and that she's been pretty sure that she is gay for some time. She's 16. She says that while she's been attracted to other girls aside from Chloe, Chloe is the first one to actually reciprocate. And she says she's never been attracted to any boys.

My husband and I paused for a moment, not out of disapproval, but because we simply didn't know how to respond. Finally, we both said something about how we love her and that she's glad and that we're glad that she has enough trust in us to confide in us about this. Neither my husband nor I are homophobic. We have both long supported gay rights, and we've both been close to people who are gay. My husband even bought a small pride flag for her room. The problem though is how do we go about actually relating to her? While my husband and I are honestly elated that we won't have to deal with any teen pregnancy scares, we're also unsure about how we as straight people can truly relate to her experiences. We know that, when it comes to dating and relationships, gay and straight people have many things in common, more so than what divides them. But being gay in our still substantially homophobic society is an experience that neither my husband and I have ever known firsthand. Do you have any suggestions or resources on how to connect with her on this?

ANSWER: About three-quarters of the battle has already been won. She is very lucky to have such loving and supportive parents. Sadly, many people in her situation don't. When it comes to the question of how to relate to her better, you can start the conversation with what you mentioned to me: that there are many similarities between what people experience in gay relationships and what they experience in straight ones. The giddiness and euphoria of a first love, the experience of heartbreak, rejection, hope, physical and emotional intimacy-- these experiences are universal and don't conform to lines of sexual labels. You can probably relate a great deal to what she's going through if you had a relationship or a crush at her age.

And as far as the experiences that don't overlap between straight and gay people, compassion and proactivity is the name of the game. Reinform your unconditional love and support for her and for her choice of partner, whoever that may be. Be proactive without being overbearing. Initiate some of these conversations and discussions, while also knowing when to hang back. And above all, just be there for her. Gay or straight, teenagers need to have that affirmation from parents. With parents also granting them more autonomy, assuming that their behavior and maturity justify it. And yes, by all means, celebrate that when she goes out with her girlfriend, there's not the risk of a pregnancy involved. And remember that even though she still needs guardrails, as all under-18s do, she's also on the cusp of adulthood and is experiencing a situation that's novel for her. Be there with love, compassion, and common sense, offering advice when needed, but generally leaving her to have her own experiences and make her own mistakes. This is the best way to equip her to navigate not only her current relationship but all the ones that follow.

QUESTION: I'm 28 years old (female), and my boyfriend is 33. We get along well and he's a great guy, loves me, loves my dog, wants kids, is usually pretty low maintenance. The problem is, well, I suppose a common one. It's a new time and in many cases, women are working and earning more than men. We are a textbook example of this. Although in our case, I am the only one earning anything at all! I just finished grad school last year and I have a really good, promising job in the finance industry. Nothing like those Wolf of Wall Street financiers but still a good, sustainable job. My boyfriend, by contrast, has always been a bit of a dreamer. He dropped out of college once, then finished a couple years later after volunteering in several cities in America and earning very little money. I met him during his second college stint when I was finishing up college myself. We had a period of long distance but long story short, decided it was worth it, stuck out the long distance, and then started living together after he was able to move back to our town. He also got a master's degree somewhere along the way but isn't using it. He says he wants to change the world and has big plans to end world hunger and to improve global education.

Part of the reason why I fell in love with him was that idealism. But honestly, the situation is starting to become untenable. As I mentioned, he doesn't work right now. He's in a volunteer gig and he sometimes picks up shifts as an Uber driver. But that's hardly what he went to grad school to do. When I urge him to help pay at least a respectable portion of the rent, he keeps talking to me about how his dreams are so important and how so many people in third-world countries are living so much worse than us. So you shouldn't be complaining. I get and understand that there are lots of people who have it worse off than us. But that's still no excuse in my view for what he's doing. As I alluded to earlier, I'm interested in starting a family soon, but can't imagine doing it with him until he does a 180 with his life. And when I have mentioned kids around him, he seems at best ambivalent. What should I do? Stay or go?

ANSWER: I think you've probably answered your own question. You tell me that you've talked to him about the problem, but he blows you off talking about his big dreams. And it seems like he's been like this for some time based on your letter. So, honestly, your lifestyles and what you want in the future just aren't compatible. You have a promising career. He seems to just want to follow his dreams by not working. And you've said that he "seems at best ambivalent" about having children, which you say is one of your big goals. And at 28, you're probably aware that you won't have forever to make this happen. 

You've invested a number of years in this man, and I have no doubt that there's lots of love between you. Any breakup would be devastating, but would breaking up with him be any more devastating than foregoing your wish to have children in order to accommodate someone who has had years to start to build a gainful career but apparently hasn't done so? And even with your well-paying job, I imagine that the stress of having to support him, as well as yourself, is starting to get to you. My younger sister had a boyfriend much like him. Sweet guy, really loved her, great with her dog. But he just wouldn't get his life together. He was working a dead-end theater job and he made no efforts to try to better his situation, either by going back to school or by looking for another job. My sister made the heartbreaking but necessary decision to end it with him. It looks like you are in a quite similar situation. So unless there is something big that you haven't told me about in this letter that would change this situation (such as a large inheritance from his rich uncle), I would urge you to likewise end this relationship and look for someone who is going to pull his weight in the relationship, and eventually as a father, whether or not this conforms with glamorous ideas of dreams. I know it's always very hurtful to end a relationship, but I think that you, as my sister did, will look back on this breakup and realize that although it hurt, you did the right thing for both of you.

QUESTION: I am 27, and my boyfriend of three years is 30. We have lived together for about 1.5 years. For what it's worth, I had two serious relationships before him, and he's had one. Being in the military made it hard for him to form any romantic relationships. So he had his first one at a relatively advanced age (25). I met him soon after that first serious relationship of his ended. We get along well, and are doing the best we can financially in this uncertain economy. 

The problem is with his parents. His father is 70, and his mother is 66. Both of them have been living on a limited income for a while. His father's retired from the military, and his mother was a school teacher for many years until she quit largely due to a problem with osteoarthritis making it too painful for her to stay at work. And she didn't want to do "Zoom school" during the pandemic. Both have modest pensions from their respective former occupations. 

But in spite of their limited resources, they've made some extremely inadvisable financial decisions over the last few years. For instance, they took a luxury Norwegian cruise last year, and they have been going out to eat at restaurants they can't afford. They have also been emotionally manipulative, and keep manipulating my boyfriend into spending more money on them and going into debt for them. They keep tugging at the emotional heartstrings that being their only child, he's all they have left. And he can't seem to resist this. I've tried to be patient, but have become seriously frustrated and angry at the financial toll his subservience to his parents is taking on us. I think part of the issue is the sense of duty that he has also exhibited in the military. He feels he has a sense of duty to his parents for raising him, and that he wants to give back to them in any way that he can. They're taking advantage of this. I love my boyfriend and don't want to leave him, but I also don't want us to go broke because he can't say no to his parents. I've tried talking to him about this multiple times, but he always just says that his duty to his parents supersedes everything else. Is there any hope left for us?

ANSWER: "He always just says that his duty to his parents supersedes everything else." I think this tells you all that you need to know, especially since he's apparently repeated it multiple times. I don't doubt that he loves you and that his sense of duty also includes a commitment to you. He sounds like a noble person, but sometimes the "noble sacrifice" becomes too destructive to sustain. In this predicament with his parents, you've asked him multiple times to reconsider his supporting and enabling them, but he isn't responsive to that. And he doesn't seem to respect your input or try to seek any sort of compromise with respect to the money that he spends and the debt that he goes into for them. One other factor might be that assuming he lived with his former partner as well as you, he's never really lived by himself for an extended period of time. Consider his timeline:
- He was first growing up and living in his parents' home
- Then he was in the military
- Then he had these two relationships  

So he's always had someone or something to fall back on during his life with the exception of some brief stints, like that first year and a half that you were dating him. Maybe an extended period of living by himself is what he needs to really learn to stand on his own two feet and say no to people. But regardless, this shouldn't remain your problem. You've done your best and made your feelings known to him, but he's ignored them repeatedly. Sadly, I think the best choice that you have is to end the relationship and start over. You don't want to become a second enabling "child" to his parents. Nor do you want his consistent choosing of his parents over you to wreck your own credit and damage your own financial future.

QUESTION: My wife started seeing a therapist about a year ago after her mother died, which I fully supported. But now our marriage is falling apart because of it. When we have disagreements, she comes home from her sessions and immediately brings up whatever we're fighting about, but now she says things like "My therapist says you should..." or "My therapist says I need to..." and then she becomes completely inflexible, treating her therapist's advice like it's a binding court ruling. I feel like I'm being ganged up on by two people, and I can't even defend myself because I'm not in the room with them. I've asked to join a session or see a couples counselor together, but she says her therapist recommended a different therapist for couples work, and I'm resistant because these therapists are expensive and I don't want to cede control of our marriage to them. We're now talking about separating, which I never thought would happen. How can I save our marriage without giving up all control to therapists?

ANSWER: First, let's address the control issue directly: you're already losing your marriage, so the question isn't whether to involve professionals, but which professionals and how. Your wife's individual therapist is correct that couples counseling requires a different therapist—that's standard practice, not a power play. The individual therapist's job is to support your wife's growth, not to referee your marriage. That's why couples work needs its own neutral space.

The real issue here is that you're hearing your wife's version of what happens in therapy, not what actually happens. Therapists don't typically say "You should do X" or "Your spouse needs to Y"—they help people explore their feelings and needs. Your wife may be misrepresenting what's being said, or she may be taking the therapist's guidance and turning it into demands. Either way, you need to be in the room to hear it for yourself. I'd strongly recommend accepting the couples counseling offer. Think of it this way: you're not ceding control to therapists, you're getting professional help to communicate better. If the cost is truly prohibitive, many therapists offer sliding scale fees, and some community health centers provide low-cost counseling. But if you're choosing between paying for therapy or paying for two separate households, the math is pretty clear. The goal isn't to have therapists run your marriage—it's to learn tools to run it better yourselves.

QUESTION: My husband has always been particular about cleanliness, but since he started a high-stress job, it's gotten much worse. When he's on his way home, I can feel my whole body tense up. I rush around cleaning counters, vacuuming, putting away dishes, making sure no toys are out—all before he walks through the door. If anything is out of place when he arrives, he immediately starts straightening and cleaning, often before even saying hello. I've adapted to his standards over the years, and we're both tidy now, but I feel like I'm living under constant pressure to keep things perfect so he doesn't spiral into cleaning mode. Our kids are experiencing the stress too, and it's getting to them. It's exhausting, and I hate that I sometimes dread his return because of the energy shift it brings. We've talked about it many times, but not much changes. He refuses counseling and says he'll "work on it," but I don't see real progress. How can I support him without losing my peace or turning our home into a stress zone for everyone?

ANSWER: This sounds like untreated anxiety manifesting as obsessive-compulsive behavior, and it's affecting your entire family. The fact that you're pre-cleaning before he gets home to avoid triggering him is a sign that his needs have expanded beyond reasonable boundaries. You can't make him get help, but you can set boundaries around how his untreated anxiety affects you and your children. At least in the short term.

Start by having a direct conversation when you're both calm: "I love you, and I can see that your need for order is tied to managing stress from work. But when you come home and immediately start cleaning without greeting us, it makes me and the kids feel like we're less important than a clean counter. I also notice that I'm spending energy trying to prevent your reactions, which isn't sustainable for me." Then propose specific changes: he agrees to say hello and spend five minutes with the family before addressing any mess, and you agree to maintain reasonable tidiness without the pre-cleaning scramble. If he can't commit to these small changes, then you need to consider whether this is the life you want. 

And even if you can, the changes that I just proposed are just a band-aid. They can buy you some time to make your house a bit of a less stressful place while you ask your husband to reconsider his refusal to get professional help. But on the long term, if you want to truly get this problem under control, he's going to need professional help. His refusal to get such help for what's clearly impacting his family is a choice he's making, and you don't have to accommodate it indefinitely. You might also benefit from individual therapy to help you set and maintain these boundaries without feeling guilty.

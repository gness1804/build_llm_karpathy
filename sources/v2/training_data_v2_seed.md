QUESTION: My husband and I (both in our late 30s) have very different approaches to conflict. I want to talk things through right away, while he tends to shut down and say he needs space. When we argue, I feel abandoned when he walks away, and he says he feels attacked when I keep pushing. We both agree we love each other and don’t want every disagreement to turn into a blowup, but we haven’t found a way to meet in the middle. How can we handle conflict without repeating this same pattern every time?

ANSWER: Start by talking about this pattern at a calm time, not in the middle of an argument. Name what happens in neutral terms: you pursue, he withdraws, and both of you end up feeling misunderstood. Then, instead of arguing about who is “right,” see if you can agree on a shared goal: “When we disagree, we want both people to feel heard and neither person to feel cornered or abandoned.”

From there, negotiate some specific ground rules. For example: if he needs a break, he agrees to say, “I’m overwhelmed; I need 30 minutes and then I’ll come back and talk,” and you agree to honor that time-limited pause instead of following him from room to room. In return, you ask that when he comes back, he stays engaged for a set amount of time before calling another break. You can also agree to use “I” statements (“I felt shut out when you left the room”) instead of global labels (“You always run away”), which lower the emotional temperature. If these patterns are deeply rooted, a few sessions with a couples therapist can give you both a neutral referee and practice tools that feel less personal and more like skills you’re learning together.

QUESTION: I’m a 29-year-old woman who recently moved in with my boyfriend. I’ve noticed that his mom texts and calls him multiple times a day about minor things—what he ate, whether he got enough sleep, if he remembered to bring a jacket. He usually answers right away and sometimes even leaves our plans hanging to respond. When I bring it up, he says I’m overreacting and that she “just worries.” I don’t want to be the person who makes him choose between me and his mom, but I also feel like we’re never fully alone. How can I set boundaries here without sounding controlling?

ANSWER: You don’t need to make this about his mother’s worth as a parent; you can keep it focused on what you need in your relationship. Start by describing specific moments instead of labeling the whole dynamic: “When we’re in the middle of dinner and you step away to text your mom for ten minutes, I feel pushed to the side.” Then follow it with a clear request: “When we’re on a date or having a planned evening together, I’d like us both to silence non‑urgent notifications unless there’s an emergency.”

It may help to frame this as a growing-up step rather than a rejection of his mom: “Part of living together is learning to protect time that’s just ours. That doesn’t mean you love your mom any less—it just means we’re building our own household.” Ask him what feels reasonable to him: maybe he checks in with her once a day at a predictable time, instead of constantly. If he refuses to consider any limits at all, that’s not about his mom; it’s about whether he’s ready to prioritize your shared life. In that case, the harder question is not “How do I change his contact with her?” but “Can I accept being in a relationship where our time as a couple is always second place?”

QUESTION: My partner and I have very different social batteries. I’m an introvert who needs quiet evenings to recharge after work, while she loves to host people and have something on the calendar most nights. When I say I need a night in, she takes it as a rejection and says I’m “never up for anything.” When she fills our week with plans, I start to dread it and feel resentful. We both feel criticized and misunderstood. How can we find a rhythm that doesn’t leave one of us exhausted and the other one lonely?

ANSWER: Treat this as a logistics puzzle, not a character judgment. You’re not “boring” and she’s not “too much”; you simply have different settings that need to be respected. Start by mapping out a typical week together and literally blocking off “quiet nights” and “social nights” on a shared calendar. For example, you might agree that two evenings a week are guaranteed quiet time at home, two are open for social plans together, and the rest are flexible.

On her high‑social nights, she can still make plans without you, as long as that’s discussed in advance and not treated as punishment. On your quiet nights, you commit to being present with her—phones down, some shared activity—even if it’s low‑key. Make sure you both have something to look forward to: she gets her people time, you get your recharge time, and neither of you is surprised by a last‑minute jammed schedule. If this continues to be a sore spot, a counselor can help you both translate “I feel rejected” and “I feel overwhelmed” into specific, negotiable needs instead of accusations.

QUESTION: My husband and I have been married for 10 years, and while it's mostly been a good marriage with the usual ups and downs, a toxic dynamic has evolved where both of us rush to blame the other during arguments. For example, last week our cat escaped and my youngest child and I spent several hours looking for her before a neighbor thankfully found and returned her. The relief of having her back should have been the end of it, but instead the incident sparked a painful argument about whose "fault" it was—-my husband blamed me for leaving the door open when I went out to tend to our plants (I was only outside for a few minutes), while I blamed him because the only reason I went out to water the plants was that he had neglected to do it after saying he would take care of them. The argument was unproductive, as almost all of our arguments are. We've been in couples therapy but haven't made much progress, in part because my husband doesn't take therapy seriously. How can we overcome this blame dynamic and develop a better marital relationship?

ANSWER: This is a common problem, so you're hardly alone in facing this. Your husband's reluctance to take therapy seriously is discouraging, but there are other approaches you can take. During a moment when both of you are calm, approach him and say something like, "Honey, I've noticed that when we fight, we often blame each other for problems, and this doesn't resolve anything. It just results in hurt feelings for both of us. What do you think we can do to address this?"

Much will depend on how he responds. If he doesn't respond well, particularly after repeated attempts to address this amicably, then it might behoove you to engage in solo therapy to explore any underlying problems behind this pattern. But if he is open to engaging with you, try this exercise: the next time you have an argument and one of you starts blaming the other, get out a piece of paper and each of you write down possible solutions, with a rule that nobody can write anything blaming the other partner—just focus on solutions. Blame is a dynamic that tends to be self-reinforcing: the more you resort to blame, the more it feels natural, but the good news is that it works the other way as well—the less you engage in blame over time, the less it becomes the default way of "solving" problems. Over time, this exercise should help change this difficult dynamic while also solving the original problems more quickly. I would also recommend reading John Gottman's book, "The 7 Principles for Making Marriage Work," which contains excellent advice about the blame game and other marital challenges.

QUESTION: I was in what I thought was a long-term, loving relationship for over a year. My partner, "J", and I shared a lot of interests, got along mostly well, and overall really connected. We had even started talking about marriage, although only semi-seriously. But then J goes on a business trip for two weeks. On his last day, he calls me and says that he needs to take some time for himself. I thought, This is odd, but if he needs his space for a while and to recharge, then I'm all for it. But after this conversation, he dropped off the face of the earth. No calls, texts, e-mails. I called and texted him multiple times to try to understand what's going on, but I was continually met with silence. 

After two agonizing months of no contact from him at all, he calls me out of the blue one evening. He says he wants to pick up where we left off. I'm incensed. I gave him a piece of my mind and let him know that it's not acceptable to ghost your partner like that, especially given the level of commitment that I thought we had had. We had a big fight, and I told him that I never wanted to see him again. (I should note that I did ask him whether something tragic or drastic had happened, such as one of his parents passing away, and he said no, there was nothing like that. He didn't give a real explanation.) But now looking back, I feel guilty. Did I overreact?

ANSWER: Anyone who invests a year in a relationship, openly discusses marriage, and then gets cut off without warning would be shaken. A year together is a major emotional investment. When someone disappears at that stage, people often experience a kind of emotional disorientation—guilt, shame, confusion, and, very often, self-doubt. But it’s important to remember that he was the one who chose to walk out, and his choice reflects on him, not on your worth. You weren’t being overly dramatic. You were responding like any person would when a trusted partner suddenly vanishes.

A year together signals seriousness for most people. By that point, ending things by text already feels too abrupt and impersonal, let alone disappearing entirely. Ghosting after that level of intimacy isn’t a momentary lapse in judgment. It’s a deep breakdown in basic relational responsibility.

If he reaches out again hoping to reopen the conversation, you can keep your response simple:
"I'm not interested in revisiting this. You disappeared for two months without explanation, and I can't overlook that. I've moved on. I wish you well, but I'm not available for further contact."

That isn't punishment. It’s a boundary.

It’s also worth remembering that two months is a sixth of your entire relationship and longer than many relationships last in total. You deserve someone who honors your time and your presence instead of leaving for an extended period and returning only when it’s convenient for him. If working through all of this brings up self-doubt or lingering guilt, a therapist can be a helpful partner in making sense of what happened—not because you did anything wrong, but because experiences like this can shake your sense of stability. A good therapist can help you internalize that this rupture was about his avoidance, not your value, and sometimes hearing that clearly and consistently is the best medicine as you move forward.

QUESTION: My boyfriend of a year and a half broke up with me last month. Like most breakups, it wasn't pleasant. Our issues were multiple: we didn't see eye-to-eye on finances. He was more religious than me and was becoming dissatisfied that I didn't want to convert to his faith. I didn't get along well with parts of his family and a few other things. I realize that you and most advice columnists would probably see these as a big deal, and I mean they are, I admit that. But the frustrating thing is, when it was just the two of us watching Netflix or eating dinner or just talking, it felt magical. During those moments, I felt that we really did have a long-term future together. But I suppose the cliché is true: love alone isn't enough.

At least he had the courage to end things in person. We went to our favorite restaurant, and as we were finishing dinner, he told me he had something to tell me. He explained that while he loves me and I will always have a part of his heart, at our core we just aren't compatible. He cited some issues I mentioned above. I was very hurt, but I acknowledged his right to end things. After all, all relationships have to be mutual.

After that dinner, I moved out, and I've been living with my sister until I can find a place to live alone again. The reason I'm writing to you is that I still really want closure, but he doesn't seem interested. I want to know what I could have done differently, and I have some questions for him concerning how we might have been able to resolve some of our differences, like in terms of finance and family. I feel that he did not fully explain his reasons for ending things, and I didn't get closure as a result. I feel he left me hanging when it came to some of the particulars. Am I right to feel this way? Is there a way that I can get closure from him, or should I just drop this?

ANSWER: The hardest breakups, and the ones that often leave us with the most questions, are usually the ones where nobody did anything “wrong.” When a relationship ends this way, it’s common to feel blindsided, especially after investing a year and a half of your life. Wanting a fuller explanation isn’t a sign that you’re stuck or unreasonable; it’s a very human attempt to make sense of a meaningful loss.

The desire for closure is rooted in a powerful need to create a narrative around painful events. Without one, it’s easy to get caught in a loop of unanswered questions and imagined alternatives. But people process breakups differently. Some want to talk everything through, while others need distance to move on. Neither approach is inherently wrong, but when those needs don’t align, there often isn’t a satisfying middle ground. In situations like this, unless there’s some unusual or unresolved circumstance, continuing to press for answers usually prolongs the pain rather than easing it.

If you feel the urge to text or call him in search of closure, it can help to pause and tell yourself something like: “This relationship ended, and it hurts. I may never know every detail of what he was thinking, and that’s okay. Sometimes the fit just isn’t there, and I don’t need a complete explanation in order to heal or move forward.” That isn’t resignation; it’s self-protection.

Instead of anchoring your healing to an explanation he may never be willing or able to give, try grounding yourself in what you already know. The differences you described—around finances, religion, and family—are substantial, and any one of them is enough to end a relationship, let alone all of them combined. And regardless of how things ended, you’re still you: someone worthy of love, compatibility, and stability.

What you're going through is common, but I know that doesn't make it hurt any less. If you find yourself stuck in self-doubt or rumination, a therapist can be a helpful partner in sorting through those feelings. Learning to let your own understanding, rather than someone else’s explanation, carry the weight of your healing is not only less emotionally risky; it’s also far more empowering.

QUESTION: My brother has a good friend who he seems to have a love-hate relationship with. The friend is less "conventionally successful" than my brother. For instance, while my brother has multiple advanced degrees and a six-figure job, the friend has "only" a bachelor's degree and a job that pays tens of thousands of dollars less than my brother's. (I say "only" a bachelor's degree not to minimize that achievement, but just to try to create more context, hence the quotes around the word.) My brother also has a group of tech friends that he hangs out with (he works in the tech industry), and I think he gets a lot out of being around people who he sees as closer to his success level. My brother is also married, for what it's worth, while his friend is in what the friend himself admits is a dead marriage. Long story, but for our purposes, it's another status mismatch between the two.

My brother pays lip service to not caring about these superficial factors, but his actions tell a different story. My brother always talks about hanging out with the friend begrudgingly, as if it's a chore or obligation he has to do, like going to the supermarket. And my brother is always trying to postpone or shorten their gatherings. The friend never seems to mind. Whether that's out of otherworldly emotional restraint and perspective, or desperation, or something else, I'm not sure. The friend has always struggled socially, while my brother, even though he's had his own issues, has generally done better.

Is it wrong of me to consider talking to my brother about this? I mean, his friendships really should be his business, but it hurts to see him treating his friend like this. Is that my place to talk with him about this? Or is this something I should just let go?

ANSWER: It must be quite painful to see your own brother engaging in actions that harm others. You clearly care about the friend and your brother. So you're not wrong to feel hurt even though your brother's actions aren't directed at you. You don't mention that there's been any outright abuse in this friendship. Had there been, the case for intervention would have been a slam dunk. Assuming no abuse, this is a tough nut to crack. You want your brother to treat his friend better, but you also don't want to get involved in his life. You respect his autonomy as I'm sure you would want him to respect yours. But yet you also see him engaging in actions that violate your moral compass.

But that being said, I think this issue is more complex than just your brother's autonomy vs. compassion. This is a situation where you don't have to speak up right away, unprovoked (again, if there was abuse, then the advice would be very different). But the next time the topic of the friend comes up, and especially if your brother says something dismissive towards him, then you might want to speak up. You might say something like the following: "[Brother], I know that your friendships are your own business, but as your sister and as a friend, I can't help but notice that you've been treating your friend a bit dismissively. This conveys to the friend that you don't think that he's worthy of your time. Would you like to be treated like that?"

Such a conversation might be hard, but if your brother is open-minded and willing to reconsider his attitudes, then that will help far more people than just his friend. Being reminded of where we're falling short when it comes to compassion and empathy can help us grow in ways that benefit us all. And if he pushes back or chooses not to engage, you can still take some peace in knowing that you spoke up in a way that was measured, compassionate, and aligned with your values. Sometimes doing that is all that’s within our control, and sometimes that’s enough.

QUESTION: I recently ended things with my girlfriend, and now I regret having done so. It's always easy to idealize somebody after a breakup, but in this case, she really was the total package: kind, compassionate, very smart, and seemed to really love me. So why did I let her go? Because of family pressure. 

Our family has always focused on academic achievement. In my immediate family alone, there are two doctors, a lawyer, and an accountant. I myself am a professor at a mid-sized regional university. I was raised to believe in the value of education. Unfortunately, in our case, this too often veered into perfectionism. And even worse, into mistreatment or dismissal of others who didn't meet our lofty academic standards. 

My ex is a social worker with "only" an undergrad degree from a state school. She also had always done well in school, but it wasn't her life. She cared more about improving the world and other passions like art. That's a major reason why I fell for her, but it's also why my family never truly accepted her. Sometimes they paid lip service to accepting her, but more often they would make snarky comments behind her back about how she didn't measure up or how she wasn't "Yale material." Those comments affected me more than I thought. Last month, I found myself telling her that we just weren't a good fit. I never really explained why, but she was smart enough to figure it out. She said something to the effect of, "Well, if you think you're too good for me, then I never want to see you again." Which I deserved.

I sorely regret ending things. Is there a way back into her life? Or even failing that, should I simply reach out to her to apologize? It's been a few weeks, and we haven't talked since that conversation. We didn't live together or have kids or anything, so it was a relatively easy split logistically. But emotionally, I'm still tied in knots. Help?

ANSWER: You were clearly caught between a woman you loved and a family that possesses a narrow definition of success in life. And now you regret having listened to your family rather than honoring your own feelings and those of the person that you were with. It was an awful situation, and I'm sorry I had to go through it. But it seems like a hard lesson in what not to do when faced with conflict between family expectations and what your heart is telling you.

I would not attempt further contact with her. You ended things. She made it clear she didn't want to interact with you anymore. And even if you didn't respect her life choices back then, back during the relationship, you should at least respect her choice now to end contact with you. If by chance she does reach out to you, which would probably be for logistical reasons rather than any interest in renewing their relationship, do not attempt to win her back. You can tell her something like, "I'm so sorry for how I treated you. I don't expect you to forgive me, and I certainly don't expect you to take me back. But I just wanted to express that I feel awful for having treated you so poorly. You didn't deserve that, and I didn't deserve you." And mean it.

If she doesn't reach out, don't reach out to her. You seem wracked with guilt and feeling a need to apologize to her. But reaching out would probably do more harm than good, especially since she expressed the wish to not see you again. And she would likely take an unsolicited apology as an empty gesture meant more to comfort you than to sincerely atone for the mistakes that you made. Guilt can be a useful signal to us to do better. Now that you're more aware of how others' opinions can sway you and of some of your own blind spots, you'll be better equipped to handle such a situation in a similar relationship. Let this person go. Do better next time.

QUESTION: I briefly dated a woman last year. Let's call her "Jeannie." And by "briefly," I mean: friendship that quickly evolved, romance that developed even more quickly, a brief sexual encounter, and then painful disengagement on the part of Jeannie. The situation was short but extremely intense, and it was one of the one or two times that I've truly been in love. We were good friends for 6 months after our "breakup" and then have remained cordial thereafter. 

After the romantic liaison with Jeannie ended, I met another woman. She was very different from Jeannie, was more stable and critically, she didn't run away when things got tough. I have been in a serious relationship with this other woman, "Mira," for about a year at this point. We have a good relationship.

Jeannie wants to remain friends. The romantic aspect of our relationship is clearly dead, and neither of us has any interest in reviving it. And my relationship with Jeannie ended before my current relationship started. So I have no problem remaining friends. But Mira says it's inappropriate to remain friends with an ex, particularly someone I was with so recently. There's no beef with Jeannie, but she thinks I should cut off contact in the name of our relationship. I'm not happy with this response. I've never cheated on anyone in my life and have no plans to do so. Who's right?

ANSWER: Being torn between two people you care about, especially when you don't think that there's a valid reason for the conflict to be there at all, is definitely a distinct kind of pain. In your mind, there's a clear boundary, chronologically and physically, that separates your relationship with Jeannie from that with Mira. Mira feels differently. 

Being friends with an ex is one of those age-old issues dividing good, thoughtful people. One school of thought holds that such a friendship, or any friendship between people with the potential for mutual attraction, is almost always a slippery slope towards inappropriate contact between the two people involved. Call this the "When Harry Met Sally" school. The other camp is more permissive of such friendships, as long as appropriate boundaries are maintained. And ultimately, it really does depend on the people and the circumstances. I've known of people who were platonic friends with exes for years after the breakup, with no apparent rekindling of any sort of romantic interest between them. And I've also known of people who, um, went the "When Harry Met Sally" route.

Ultimately, the answer to this question depends on the particulars. What are your partner's reasons for not being comfortable with you continuing to remain friends with this ex? How would you feel if the situation were reversed and she were platonic friends with the guy she had dated previously? Ultimately, you have a right to your own friendships, but her concerns are also valid. If you truly feel that you can maintain a friendship with this ex without any temptations or risk of inappropriate actions, then it might be worth trying to make the friendship work while also keeping your current partner apprised, of course. Suggest a compromise. For instance, maybe only hang out with Jeannie in group settings or when your partner is there. Or agree to only see Jeannie in public spaces during the day. But if your partner's discomfort would seem to preclude even compromises like this, then you might have to weigh this friendship vs. your current relationship. If it really does seem to be a mutually exclusive choice after ruling out compromises and such, then you'll have to decide whether staying in your current relationship is worth cutting ties with a friend or vice-versa.

QUESTION: My wife and I are facing a quandary concerning faith. When we met, we were at a somewhat different place regarding religion, but we felt that we were basically compatible. Long story short, she believes in God, I don't, but we both have the same basic values. I let her know of my leanings early on, and she was always accepting. She comes from a very religious family, but questions many aspects of organized religions, particularly the one that she was raised in. We went through a rough patch with her parents accepting me because of the religious issues, but we moved beyond that.

Now, however, we seem to be moving in opposite directions. If you can imagine a 0-to-10 scale with respect to warmth towards religion, with 0 being completely cold to religion and 10 being extremely accepting, as of this time a year ago, I was probably about a 4 while she was a 6 or 7. But now she's probably an 8 or a 9, while I'm a 2. For a variety of reasons, not least of which is the current political climate in this country, I'm feeling even more turned off by religion than I was a year or two ago. But at the same time, she's interested in re-exploring the faith she grew up in. She's even singing in a church choir and has been for a few months. Recently, I saw a cross which had been banished to our garage, now in our guest bedroom on the bed.

How can we accommodate this difference? We haven't had any arguments over it yet, but I feel that there's some tension. I want to respect her faith and her own spiritual decisions, but my allergic reaction to religion makes that difficult. How can we both coexist under the same roof with different attitudes towards religion?

ANSWER: Religious differences can be particularly painful because they often involve not only abstract belief but also matters of identity, family, and morality. But it sounds like you and your wife are both coming from a place of compassion and respect. That matters a great deal. 

This will position you better to explore the thorny problems that your letter raises.

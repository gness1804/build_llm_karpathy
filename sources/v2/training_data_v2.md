QUESTION: My husband and I (both in our late 30s) have very different approaches to conflict. I want to talk things through right away, while he tends to shut down and say he needs space. When we argue, I feel abandoned when he walks away, and he says he feels attacked when I keep pushing. We both agree we love each other and don’t want every disagreement to turn into a blowup, but we haven’t found a way to meet in the middle. How can we handle conflict without repeating this same pattern every time?

ANSWER: Start by talking about this pattern at a calm time, not in the middle of an argument. Name what happens in neutral terms: you pursue, he withdraws, and both of you end up feeling misunderstood. Then, instead of arguing about who is “right,” see if you can agree on a shared goal: “When we disagree, we want both people to feel heard and neither person to feel cornered or abandoned.”

From there, negotiate some specific ground rules. For example: if he needs a break, he agrees to say, “I’m overwhelmed; I need 30 minutes and then I’ll come back and talk,” and you agree to honor that time-limited pause instead of following him from room to room. In return, you ask that when he comes back, he stays engaged for a set amount of time before calling another break. You can also agree to use “I” statements (“I felt shut out when you left the room”) instead of global labels (“You always run away”), which lower the emotional temperature. If these patterns are deeply rooted, a few sessions with a couples therapist can give you both a neutral referee and practice tools that feel less personal and more like skills you’re learning together.

QUESTION: I’m a 29-year-old woman who recently moved in with my boyfriend. I’ve noticed that his mom texts and calls him multiple times a day about minor things—what he ate, whether he got enough sleep, if he remembered to bring a jacket. He usually answers right away and sometimes even leaves our plans hanging to respond. When I bring it up, he says I’m overreacting and that she “just worries.” I don’t want to be the person who makes him choose between me and his mom, but I also feel like we’re never fully alone. How can I set boundaries here without sounding controlling?

ANSWER: You don’t need to make this about his mother’s worth as a parent; you can keep it focused on what you need in your relationship. Start by describing specific moments instead of labeling the whole dynamic: “When we’re in the middle of dinner and you step away to text your mom for ten minutes, I feel pushed to the side.” Then follow it with a clear request: “When we’re on a date or having a planned evening together, I’d like us both to silence non‑urgent notifications unless there’s an emergency.”

It may help to frame this as a growing-up step rather than a rejection of his mom: “Part of living together is learning to protect time that’s just ours. That doesn’t mean you love your mom any less—it just means we’re building our own household.” Ask him what feels reasonable to him: maybe he checks in with her once a day at a predictable time, instead of constantly. If he refuses to consider any limits at all, that’s not about his mom; it’s about whether he’s ready to prioritize your shared life. In that case, the harder question is not “How do I change his contact with her?” but “Can I accept being in a relationship where our time as a couple is always second place?”

QUESTION: My partner and I have very different social batteries. I’m an introvert who needs quiet evenings to recharge after work, while she loves to host people and have something on the calendar most nights. When I say I need a night in, she takes it as a rejection and says I’m “never up for anything.” When she fills our week with plans, I start to dread it and feel resentful. We both feel criticized and misunderstood. How can we find a rhythm that doesn’t leave one of us exhausted and the other one lonely?

ANSWER: Treat this as a logistics puzzle, not a character judgment. You’re not “boring” and she’s not “too much”; you simply have different settings that need to be respected. Start by mapping out a typical week together and literally blocking off “quiet nights” and “social nights” on a shared calendar. For example, you might agree that two evenings a week are guaranteed quiet time at home, two are open for social plans together, and the rest are flexible.

On her high‑social nights, she can still make plans without you, as long as that’s discussed in advance and not treated as punishment. On your quiet nights, you commit to being present with her—phones down, some shared activity—even if it’s low‑key. Make sure you both have something to look forward to: she gets her people time, you get your recharge time, and neither of you is surprised by a last‑minute jammed schedule. If this continues to be a sore spot, a counselor can help you both translate “I feel rejected” and “I feel overwhelmed” into specific, negotiable needs instead of accusations.

QUESTION: My husband and I have been married for 10 years, and while it's mostly been a good marriage with the usual ups and downs, a toxic dynamic has evolved where both of us rush to blame the other during arguments. For example, last week our cat escaped and my youngest child and I spent several hours looking for her before a neighbor thankfully found and returned her. The relief of having her back should have been the end of it, but instead the incident sparked a painful argument about whose "fault" it was—-my husband blamed me for leaving the door open when I went out to tend to our plants (I was only outside for a few minutes), while I blamed him because the only reason I went out to water the plants was that he had neglected to do it after saying he would take care of them. The argument was unproductive, as almost all of our arguments are. We've been in couples therapy but haven't made much progress, in part because my husband doesn't take therapy seriously. How can we overcome this blame dynamic and develop a better marital relationship?

ANSWER: This is a common problem, so you're hardly alone in facing this. Your husband's reluctance to take therapy seriously is discouraging, but there are other approaches you can take. During a moment when both of you are calm, approach him and say something like, "Honey, I've noticed that when we fight, we often blame each other for problems, and this doesn't resolve anything. It just results in hurt feelings for both of us. What do you think we can do to address this?"

Much will depend on how he responds. If he doesn't respond well, particularly after repeated attempts to address this amicably, then it might behoove you to engage in solo therapy to explore any underlying problems behind this pattern. But if he is open to engaging with you, try this exercise: the next time you have an argument and one of you starts blaming the other, get out a piece of paper and each of you write down possible solutions, with a rule that nobody can write anything blaming the other partner—just focus on solutions. Blame is a dynamic that tends to be self-reinforcing: the more you resort to blame, the more it feels natural, but the good news is that it works the other way as well—the less you engage in blame over time, the less it becomes the default way of "solving" problems. Over time, this exercise should help change this difficult dynamic while also solving the original problems more quickly. I would also recommend reading John Gottman's book, "The 7 Principles for Making Marriage Work," which contains excellent advice about the blame game and other marital challenges.

QUESTION: Like so many others, my teenage daughter is struggling with an eating disorder. In her case, she's lost so many pounds in the last few weeks that she barely resembles her old self. She's obsessed with the idea that she's fat, but in reality, she's dangerously underweight. Making matters worse, my husband seems to not take her situation seriously enough. While I fear for her life if she doesn't get treatment soon, my husband often brushes off the subject when I talk to him about it. He says things like, "Oh, she's just going through a phase," or "Maybe she just doesn't like the food that you cook." I think that my daughter is overhearing this and it might be encouraging her to starve herself even more.

I've always been the non-confrontational type, which I fear has contributed to my daughter getting into the mess that she's in. So I'm not sure really how to confront my husband about this. What do you suggest?

ANSWER: As you noted, this is a life-or-death situation. What I would do is urgently get both your daughter and husband educated on the serious problem of eating disorders, "tout de suite." First, if you haven't already, inform your daughter of the following resources: the 24/7 eating disorder hotline (866-932-1264) and the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD) Helpline (888-375-7767). I would also insist that both your daughter and your husband visit the website of the National Eating Disorders Association, particularly their helpful article "Busting The Myths About Eating Disorders" (https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/busting-myths-about-eating-disorders/). 

The immediate problem, of course, is helping your daughter to get healthy and overcome the disorder, and to learn the skills needed to prevent relapses in the future. This starts with a conversation with her primary care physician and also her therapist, if she has one. But I suspect you're doing most of this already. What you wrote to me about was really a problem of attitudes and education on the part of your husband. In addition to showing him the above-mentioned resources, I would have a serious conversation with him about how his attitudes might be harming his daughter. There is also some underlying sexism and misogyny in his remarks, particularly about what he said about the food that you cook. But educating him on eating disorders is the first priority. Then you can have a longer discussion with him (ideally also with a couples therapist) addressing some of these problematic assumptions that he seems to have about you and about gender roles.

Finally, by all means, whenever your husband makes one of these remarks and there's even the possibility that your daughter could have been around, seek her out at your first opportunity and emphasize to her that what her father said was wrong. Tell her the facts in a calm manner, not to demonize her father but rather to show that his harmful views aren't correct. Facts and sincere affirmation are the best antidotes to misguided and harmful ignorance.

QUESTION: My husband and I are facing a dilemma over how to respond to a problem with how his family treats his brother. Both of us have long suspected that my husband's brother is gay. At one point, the brother even came to my husband asking for advice on how to come out of the closet. However, in large part because of their family's attitudes, the brother has never actually come out to them. From time to time, I overhear some of my husband's family, particularly my father-in-law, make offensive and cruel remarks about gay people. I don't know if the father-in-law suspects that one of his sons is gay or not, but regardless, this creates an alienating environment for us and obviously especially for the brother.

Our dilemma is on how to respond to this, if at all. I would like for us, or at least for my husband, to bring this up with his father and to make clear that we don't approve of these cruel remarks. My husband has made it clear that even though he strongly disapproves of the anti-gay remarks, he wants to preserve his relationship with his father and doesn't want to intervene. I tend to feel that since it's his family, he should have more of a say on how to engage with them. But it really hurts to stand by and say nothing while my husband's father creates such an intolerant environment. Do you think that we should just let this go or do you feel that it's worth risking our relationship with his father to try to improve the situation?

ANSWER: What about the brother's opinion of all this? Before confronting his father, why don't you two, or just your husband, approach the brother and gently ask him what he thinks the best course of action is? Given that he seems to be the one most affected by the remarks, his opinion should be given special weight. Only confront the father if the brother is okay with that. You don't want to risk a backlash by confronting the father and then him responding by treating his son even worse. And even though what the father is saying is clearly abhorrent, the son that you suspect is gay might have his own reasons for wanting to preserve his own relationship with his father.

Regardless of whether you choose to confront the father directly, there are more subtle ways that you can send signals of disapproval about the remarks. For instance, you can limit your visits to those particular relatives when the father is around. You can also invite the brother to spend more time with you and your husband separately, apart from his parents. And the next time you happen to overhear a remark, you might consider going the route of asking a question as opposed to direct confrontation. That is, maybe you could ask the father, "If you were gay, how would you feel about other people saying that about you?" I've often found that when dealing with difficult people, asking them respectful but direct critical questions is often a more effective strategy than simply laying down the law and telling them that they're wrong. Although I admit, I'm human too, and often the temptation for the latter is quite strong in that type of situation. But regardless of what approach you take, remember that empathy and compassion should be your guiding lights. Make sure that the brother's needs are first and foremost in whatever solution you decide on.

QUESTION: My wife and I are expecting our first child, a daughter. As you might imagine, we're over the moon about being new parents and nurturing and loving this new human. Nevertheless, my wife and I are engaged in a nasty recurring argument over whether to baptize our future daughter. My wife came from a fairly secular family but experienced trauma in her early adulthood, including a sexual assault. She found an on-campus religious community that provided tremendous support to her in her healing. And after college she has continued to attend church in that same denomination. She's been a part of this denomination for about 15 years at this point, and I have nothing against her doing this. Obviously she's an autonomous adult, and we don't have to agree on religion. But in my case, I'm an atheist who had some very bad experiences with religion growing up, including multiple attempts to proselytize me. I also had a friend who was abused by a priest. And so for me, organized religion is the root of much evil with corporate greed being the root of most of the rest.

My wife wants to baptize our daughter in her denomination because she wants to pass on to her child the deep connection that she has to her faith. And also, I suspect, because she feels that on some level being part of this religious community might shield her daughter from the trauma that she went through as a younger woman. But for me, I worry that baptizing our daughter in this religion would essentially brainwash and indoctrinate her. I fear our daughter wanting to marry young and then becoming obedient to her husband due to our church's teachings. The denomination is one of the more conservative ones, and I don't agree with most of their teachings. I want our daughter to be a strong young woman, not a slave to her future husband because of religious brainwashing. Should I just give in and let her get indoctrinated, or should I fight harder for her to not be baptized?

ANSWER: It seems like you're falling into a trap that many religious and secular people both fall into: framing a problem as a strict black-and-white either/or matter. Fundamentally, it seems to me that both you and your wife are coming from a place of love, and your differences are rooted in very different life experiences with religion. I don't know how much you've talked to your wife about this, but if you haven't, I would suggest first having an open and frank discussion with her about religion in general and what it means to each of you. Frame this in a way that respects her beliefs and life experiences while also reminding her that yours are just as valid, and agree to temporarily stay away from the subject of your daughter's potential baptism. This might help you two to get on the same page on religion in general, and not just over the question of baptizing your daughter. 

Then, when you two have found some common ground over religion (even if it is very limited), return to the subject of the baptism. There might be multiple ways to skin this cat that respect both of your viewpoints and beliefs. For instance, might you agree to having the daughter baptized in a more liberal denomination? This might satisfy your wife's wishes for her to be baptized as a Christian without being baptized in the same denomination whose beliefs you find so problematic. This might seem like an unacceptable compromise, but it's worked for a lot of couples. For instance, when I was dating my wife, I was very reluctant to convert to the dominant religion of her family because I found it unpalatable in many ways. But we compromised, and I converted into a more liberal denomination of the faith, which ended up working out fairly well for us. And don't forget to keep in mind the bigger picture of what your daughter herself might eventually want. Hopefully you and your wife would both agree that when your daughter is old enough to do so, she should be the one to determine her future path, be it a religious path or a secular one. So I think it makes sense to expose her to a mixture of religious and secular viewpoints. The exact contours of this will, of course, be up to you and your wife and eventually up to her. But by coming from a place of compassion and love, you will put her in a position to be well-equipped to make her own faith decision when the time comes.

QUESTION: I am the oldest of three daughters, and my family has always placed a heavy emphasis on achievement and success, conventionally defined—my father is a physician, and my mother is a renowned lawyer, and my younger siblings and I all followed in their footsteps, becoming professionals of various stripes. We're all reasonably happy in our lives, though we face a lot of stress. But I've been encountering one particular problem that has caused me to question some of the values I grew up with. Last year, when my car broke down on the side of the road, I waited 3 hours for AAA, but they never came. Just as hour 4 began, a kindly man around my age drove up in his truck and offered to fix the problem, refusing the money I offered as compensation. On a whim, I asked him if he might want to meet for coffee, and we really hit it off. Now we're in a promising relationship. He came from a working class family and aside from his vocational education, hasn't had much formal education; he's an auto mechanic. But after I told my parents about our relationship, they strongly disapproved, making harsh remarks about me throwing away my life with some "grease monkey" and emphasizing that both of my siblings were married or engaged to fellow highly paid professionals.

I love my parents, but I don't like the way they're treating me or my partner, and now I'm starting to question the ruthless Type A values I was raised to believe in. I have no desire to throw away my professional career, but I'm also queasy about obsessing over status the way I once did. When it comes to my family, should I just keep them at arm's length for as long as I'm in this relationship? Or do you think it's worth trying to confront them and getting them to see the light?

ANSWER: I would agree that your parents are acting inappropriately. We have enough problems with class and income inequality in our society without people throwing fuel on the fire by acting with such disrespect towards those who are different. (Gets down from soap box.) The fact and appropriateness of your relationship with a mechanic is none of their business. You definitely should not feel the need to "hide" your beau to "keep them at arm's length" Without first engaging with your parents directly on this matter. If I were in your shoes, I would sit down with the parents if possible (I don't know if you live close enough to them to do that; if not, then consider a good phone conversation.). I would convey to them that while you love them, you also don't like how they've been treating either of you or the snide remarks they've been making about him. You might say something like, "How would you feel if the roles were reversed, and you were a working-class person being looked down upon by an upper-middle-class professional? Would that make you feel good?" You might also remind them that assuming you're not part of the 0.01% in this country, there are people above you and your parents on the socio-economic ladder that look down on you just as much as your parents look down on this mechanic. You can also remind them that you're an adult capable of making your own decisions. If you want to flatter them, throw in something about them having equipped you well to make these decisions. But fundamentally, keep to the principle that it's your life, not theirs, and act accordingly. I wish you and your partner every happiness.

QUESTION: I feel that I'm a walking, breathing cliche. I'm a 54-year-old woman whose similarly-aged husband cheated on me with his 24-year-old secretary. It's really the oldest story on God's green earth. I naively took him at his word when he told me that he was working late on Monday and Wednesday evenings. He told me that he had a big project to finish up, and his boss had laid off his assistant, so he was forced to do two people's jobs. Thus, he had to spend many hours at work outside of the workday to get it all done. 

Imagine my surprise when my best friend told me that she had seen my husband and a much younger woman out at a nice restaurant after working hours while my friend was on a date there! I confronted him, and after initial predictable denials, he confessed. He told me that she made him feel young and wanted. Again, you can find countless examples of this story down to the small details. But now that I'm reeling from this betrayal, I'm wondering whether to stay or to leave him. He has always been a good husband and provider, and I believe him when he told me that he hasn't slept with anybody outside of the marriage except for the secretary. He swore to me that he would change. However, a couple of weeks ago, after we tried to reconcile, my friend once again saw him out with the girlfriend at the same restaurant. (He could have at least been smart about it and gone to a different restaurant with her.) Clearly he hasn't ended things with her. He has many good qualities, but I don't know if I can forgive him for this. Should I stay or should I go?

ANSWER: I'm sorry that you're in this situation. Nobody deserves to be cheated on. Whether to stay or go in the event of an extramarital affair is one of those questions where good, reasonable people can disagree. Some are of the opinion that even one incident of cheating is too much, and that the trust can never be restored. On the other hand, others subscribe to the school of thought of allowing their partners a second or even third chance. Clearly you're at least open to the possibility of taking him back, but given that this betrayal has happened multiple times and that the deceit is continuing after his assurances that it wouldn't, I would be hesitant about taking him back.

If you haven't already, find a good therapist to discuss this question with. Try to look for larger patterns. For instance, have you been cheated on before and then taken a partner back? What happened then? Your husband told you that he hasn't cheated on you with anyone except for the secretary, but has he engaged in any other dishonest behavior, such as using family money for questionable purposes? Usually when somebody is deceitful or dishonest in one area, they act similarly in other areas. Ultimately, the decision on whether to stay or go is yours, but I would exercise caution regarding his ability to change given what you've experienced thus far. If there were a graveyard for all failed relationships and marriages, probably about half of the headstones would read: "She tried to change him."

QUESTION: I'm engaged to a wonderful man. We've been together for two years, and even though we've had our ups and downs, it's mostly been great. But we've hit a major snag when it comes to wedding planning. Since he proposed a couple of months ago, our first concern has been cost. We're both graduate students, and we're several years away from being able to earn good money. I come from a modest background where there was never much extra money growing up. But my fiancé's family is much wealthier. His parents agreed to pay for the entire wedding, which really floored me and was something that we gratefully accepted. But there was a catch. Since they've agreed to fund the wedding, they've been trying to dictate to us non-stop every little detail, right down to the color of the flowers. They've even hinted in a backhanded way that they might withdraw financial support for our wedding if we don't do things exactly their way.

I understand the need to take family concerns into consideration when planning a wedding, but we want to be able to make a lot of decisions ourselves. After all, we're the ones getting married. My dilemma is whether or not to just suck it up and let them dictate how the wedding should be done to the last detail, or whether we should push back. A third option would be to elope, which honestly part of me really wants to do. But I've always wanted a big wedding and really hope that we can somehow have our cake and eat it too. How do you suggest approaching this?

ANSWER: I'm sorry that your dream wedding is coming with so many strings attached, but unfortunately, that's fairly common. What I'd suggest you do first is have an honest conversation with your fiancé. Sit down and discuss: what are the essentials that you must have in your wedding? What are some things that you can negotiate on? And what are some things that you don't particularly care about? Then, you might want to make a list as to what your preferences are in each of those categories versus what his parents' preferences are. This will help you have a holistic view to see whether there's enough alignment with their preferences to, as you say, "suck it up" and go along with what they want.

If you're generally okay with their direction but have a few deal-breakers, then I would suggest talking to them in a compassionate and loving manner. Tell them that you're extremely grateful for their support for the wedding, but there are a few details that you want to have different than what they envision. Hopefully, they'll be reasonable and accept that not every little detail can be dictated by them regardless of who's paying. And then there's the nuclear option of either eloping or holding a much more modest wedding within your means. I wouldn't rule this out, especially if your preliminary discussion with your partner reveals that there are just too many differences between your vision of the wedding and what his parents' vision of the wedding is. Weddings tend to be unconscionably expensive, but there are definitely ways that you can reduce costs. Having a small guest list is the most obvious of these, though of course that comes with its own social politics. I'd also recommend that you check out "The Budget-Savvy Wedding Planner & Organizer: Checklists, Worksheets, and Essential Tools to Plan the Perfect Wedding on a Small Budget" by Jessica Bishop. It's chock-full of useful suggestions on how to economize wedding planning and still have a beautiful and meaningful ceremony without breaking the bank. Good luck.

QUESTION: My best friend recently got back together with her ex-boyfriend, who I know was emotionally abusive to her. She cut off her other best friend for telling her to leave him, and now she's threatening to cut me off too over a trivial political disagreement we had. I'm trying to be a safe presence for her like people advised, but it's getting harder as she keeps ghosting me or being cold and distant. How do I handle this without losing my friend completely, and how do I stop feeling terrible about it?

ANSWER: You can't fix this for her, and you shouldn't try to. Your friend is in a cycle of abuse where she's isolating herself from people who care about her—this is unfortunately common in abusive relationships. The person who's supposed to be her safe place (you) is being pushed away, while the person causing harm is being drawn closer. Your role right now isn't to be a regular friend who gets regular friendship back. It's to be a lifeline that stays available even when she's not using it.

That means: keep reaching out periodically with low-pressure check-ins. Don't expect her to respond, and don't take her distance personally. When she does respond, don't lecture her about the boyfriend—just be present. Say things like, "I'm here whenever you need me, no questions asked." The goal is to make sure she knows you're still there when she's ready to leave. As for feeling terrible about it—that's actually appropriate. It is terrible to watch someone you care about self-destruct. But remember: her choices aren't your fault, and you can't rescue her if she doesn't want to be rescued. You can only keep the door open. In the meantime, make sure you're taking care of yourself. This is emotionally draining work, and you deserve support too. Consider talking to a therapist or joining a support group for friends and family of people in abusive relationships.

QUESTION: My wife and I have been married for about 15 years. For the first few years, our sex life was great. We were, as the saying goes, "f***ing like bunnies". But as the years wore on, especially once we had kids, we hit a rough spot in the bedroom. Since we had our second and final child, my wife only wants sex once every few weeks, and sometimes once every few months. When we do have sex, I almost always have to initiate, and she's just not as, shall we say, vigorous as was the case before. I love my wife and want to respect her preferences, but at the same time, I feel that my sexual needs are no longer being met. Am I doomed to spend the rest of my days in a sexually unsatisfying marriage, or is there hope for us?

ANSWER: As you might be aware, this is a very common problem, but that doesn't make it any less painful. Since there is such a huge spectrum of sexual desire/libido among humans, it's very likely that any given marriage will have a mismatch in libido, be it large or small. Working this out depends on many things, particularly:
1. How large the libido gap is
2. The personalities of the partners
3. How open both partners are to compromise

There are, of course, a few basic ground rules:
1. Nobody should ever have sex that they don't want to have
2. Any negotiations about sex should be done in a loving and compassionate manner

With that in mind, have a frank discussion with your wife about this issue. Frame the problem not as her not giving you what you want, but rather as an apparent mismatch in sexual interest. Don't frame your own higher libido as better or normative. Approach this in a compassionate manner, and ask if she might be willing to compromise. For instance, ask if you both could have sex a little more often, but still within her comfort zone. Also, there is a lot of stigma around this, but there is no shame in satisfying your needs on the side as long as it doesn't involve an extra-marital affair. That is, as long as it's done ethically. By this I mean, well, sometimes taking solo flights when the dual flight is canceled or delayed. Almost all married people, even in happy marriages, satisfy themselves sometimes. And that's perfectly normal, as long as it doesn't substitute for your actual sex life. For a compassionate and common-sense view of such matters, and male sexuality in general, I'd highly recommend checking out Bernie Zilbergeld's book, "The New Male Sexuality." It's an oldie but goodie that even after a few decades still stands the test of time.

QUESTION: My husband has a habit of criticizing me when I do something wrong, or when he thinks I do something wrong. This behavior has unfortunately been escalating over the past few months. It started even before our wedding. For instance, he would remark upon my having chosen the "wrong" dress rather than telling a white lie that he liked the dress. Also, he would say things like, "You must be so glad you found me given how you were living before." Like most people in love, I brushed off these red flags, thinking that he would change after the wedding. But alas, things only got worse from there. Now that we've been married several years and have two kids, he started insulting me in front of the kids. He also tries to make me believe things that I know aren't true. For instance, by repeating lies to me, such as accusing me of losing our house keys, when in fact he's the one who misplaced them. They were found in the pocket of his suit jacket, for goodness sake!

My husband is mostly a wonderful man and a good father, and I dread the prospect of becoming a single mother, so I don't want to lose him. I've tried talking with him about the insults, but he always brushes me off. Is there a way that I can address this to salvage the marriage? Or do you think I should look for the exit?

ANSWER: Oh my goodness, you should run and not walk to the exit door. This is a textbook case of emotional and verbal abuse and gaslighting. Your husband insults you even after you've pointed it out and asked him to stop. He tries to get you to believe things that you know aren't true, and thus to undermine your confidence in yourself and your sense of reality, which is the definition of gaslighting. And he's doing it in front of your children. You even say that these are "red flags." This marriage is clearly beyond the point of no return. Rather than trying to change him, you should look for the safest and quickest way out of the marriage, which I know won't be easy.

The good news is that there are resources for domestic violence victims like you to get out safely. The first steps should be to find a time when he's not around and call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233. This service is available in many languages to everyone who needs it. They will help you devise an escape plan. Also, what support network do you have? Do you have a mother or sister or brother or best friend who could help you? Speak to someone who you trust about the situation. Hopefully, they will see the obvious fact that this is domestic abuse and they will rush to help. If not, don't let them convince you that what you're seeing isn't true. Go to somebody else you trust. If you don't have anyone around you who you trust, then find a local women's shelter. They can provide you with a lot of resources. And when the time comes, of course, you'll need to visit an attorney. But your safety comes before everything else. You deserve so much better, and you need to get out now. Good luck to you.

QUESTION: I'm engaged to be married to a wonderful man we met online about a year and a half ago. When he proposed, I was really over the moon. This has been a fairytale story, except for one major aspect: my extremely religious sister doesn't approve of him. Why? It boils down to the fact that he's divorced. In our religious tradition, if you enter into marriage with somebody, even if the marriage itself was not in this tradition, and you then divorce, our church has to find a reason why the divorce is invalid in order to permit the person to marry a second time within this church. It's called an annulment. My fiance has been willing to go quite far for my family with regards to religion, including even getting baptized, albeit not in our same denomination. But very reasonably, he's decided not to do an annulment on the grounds that it would be an unacceptable intrusion into his private life. And he's right. We don't need priests digging into his past life.

But this refusal to do the annulment is a deal-breaker for my sister, who will only attend my wedding if the annulment happens and if my fiance gets baptized into the "right" sect. It's looking like a real possibility that my sister will skip the wedding. I really want her there, and I've tried to explain this to her and get her to understand that even though she may not agree with the wedding or with my choice of a partner, she needs to attend because that's what sisters who love their sisters do. I am politically liberal, but if she were to marry someone who's a huge Trump supporter and conservative, I wouldn't hesitate to attend. (She is single now.) Because again that's what sisters do.

Is there a way that I can approach the topic that I haven't thought of that might help come around to seeing reason, or should I just deal with not having my beloved sister at the wedding? (Oh, and one thing I forgot to mention, I encouraged her to see a priest to discuss this matter on the hopes that he would tell her something along the lines of: "Yes, go to the wedding because you love your sister and it's the right thing to do. It's not anything that will undermine your faith or commitment to God." But she won't go, and my husband suspects the reason is because she knows that the priest will probably say something along these lines.)

ANSWER: Your predicament is unfortunate, and I'm sorry you have to go through that. Unfortunately, when dealing with other adults, there's always only so much that you can do to get them to do what you want. It seems like you have tried to engage her in a loving and compassionate manner, and try to convince her to come to the wedding, but it sounds like she won't budge. You might try one more time with something along the lines of: "[Sister], I know that you love me and I love you. And I would gladly attend your wedding if you have one in the future, regardless of the groom that you choose or what his faith is. So can you please find it within yourself to come to our wedding? It's not going to be any judgment on you or your faith. It's just an expression of love for me, and it would mean the world to me."

My only other real suggestion to try to get her to come around would be something that you've already effectively ruled out: talking to a faith leader in her tradition about the subject. You might still consider talking to a faith leader yourself and with your partner, but without your sister present. Not because you think he's going to give you some sort of argument to convince her to come to the wedding, but just to hear his perspective. (If this is the faith that I think it is, the priest will only be a "he".) He might give you a compassionate perspective on accepting your sister not coming to the wedding because realistically, that seems to be your only real option at this point assuming that your Hail Mary (sorry) doesn't pan out. As hard as it may be, don't take it personally and encourage your fiancé to not take it personally either. This is all about the sister and has nothing to do with you or your fiancé or your choice of a partner. So go to the wedding, enjoy it, and savor the time around people you love. Your sister will be there for other events. Above all, try not to let her absence dominate your experience of the wedding. Her absence is unfortunate, but it's one of those things that happens in life that one just has to deal with. I wish you and your fiance many years of happiness and a beautiful wedding.

QUESTION: I'm on the autism spectrum and my partner is also neurodivergent, albeit in a different way. This has been a source of connection, but also a source of struggle. For example, they frequently express frustration when I'm not reading their social cues in the way that they expect me to. They also get irritated if I leave the room because they're cooking a certain thing, or if I'm focusing on obsessive interest, as we autists are known for. I do try to communicate my needs to them, and they seem receptive to it. But often it seems like we're getting nowhere. Our brains are wired too differently. Any recommendations on how to bridge the gap?

ANSWER: This is a common problem in neurologically mixed relationships. Even with both partners being neurodivergent, being neurodivergent in different ways is often just as challenging as one partner being neurodivergent and the other neurotypical. But you're not alone in this struggle. If you aren't doing it already, I would highly recommend couples counseling. This should help you begin to work through some of these issues. There are many compromises that you can make that would be worthwhile. For instance, your partner agrees not to cook certain food with you around, or you agree to set aside a certain amount of time for them each day so that you don't get sucked into your strong interest as much. The keys are:
1. Compassion
2. Empathy
3. A willingness to listen

There's also a growing body of resources available for couples in your situation. In particular, I would recommend that you both read the book "The Autism Partner Handbook: How to Love an Autistic Person" by Elly Blue, Faith G. Harper, and Joe Biel. It's a quick read and offers a lot of useful suggestions for your situation. Navigating neurodivergence is a challenge, but plenty of other couples have done it. Good luck.

QUESTION: My partner and I are both liberal, but most of my family is strongly conservative, as in hardcore Trump-loving conservative. As you can imagine, we've had our share of disagreements, but we've found ways to agree to disagree. We just try not to discuss politics, and we have a rule to never talk to each other on the day of a major election, like the midterms or a presidential election. This has worked reasonably well for us and has managed to keep us in relatively close contact.

The problem is that my partner, who's an outspoken activist in our local Democratic Party, refuses to come to family events. He came to our Easter celebration one year and was visibly upset by some of the things that my parents said regarding Trump and immigrants. Even though I 100% agree with my partner that those things were wrong, it's still important for me to spend time with my family. Lately, my partner will make excuses for not coming to family events. He'll say he's too tired or he'll say that it's too long of a drive (they live 3 hours away, but my husband routinely makes drives longer than that for work and to go to his video game conventions.) 

My family has asked why he's not coming, and I have to fudge it or come up with half-true excuses. They're smart people, and they've started to suspect the real reason for his not coming. I've tried to talk to him about it, but again he's always evasive. Should I sit down with him and ask him point-blank to please tell me the truth so we can clear the air? Or should I respect his opinions as a fellow adult and just drop the matter?

ANSWER: This is a difficult situation, I'm sorry. On the surface, I feel for your partner, as I have similar political opinions to the two of you, and I still get roiled up when I hear certain types of remarks, even after 10 years of Donald Trump being in the national political spotlight. But I still think that your partner is being a bit of a coward. He won't admit what's plainly obvious to you and what your family is starting to catch on to. It's fine to have differing opinions, but one shouldn't tell half-truths or be evasive when it comes to the reason for not seeing their significant other's family. At this point, this is starting to cost you time with people you love, and that's not okay. So, what I would do is sit down with him and have the conversation that you propose. Tell him that you know the real reason why he's avoiding them. And that it's deceitful and insulting to your intelligence for him to not admit that. And then tell him that you want to be around your family more than he's allowing you to be (assuming that's true). Ask him to reconsider his boycott of your family if only for your sake. You might want to reassure him about how you have found ways of accommodating political differences with your family, and tell him that he can use similar strategies with them to do the same. (And if your family is anything like conservative (and liberal) relatives that I know, they will care more about his character and how he treats you than how he votes at the ballot box.) Right now, frankly, his actions don't reflect well on his character.

If he still won't be accommodating to you after having a frank and honest discussion with him and laying out what I just said and anything else that you feel to be important, then honestly, I'd reconsider your choice of a partner. You don't want to be around somebody who's not willing to experience discomfort for the sake of their partner or to defend their beliefs in the presence of people who disagree with them. Because if you go on to marry this person or have a lifelong partnership with them outside of marriage, what would you be signing up for? Do you want decades with someone who won't stand up for you or defend what he believes in when challenged?

QUESTION: I'm going through a nasty divorce. My husband and I were married for about 20 years, and the marriage unraveled for a variety of reasons. Yes, there was infidelity, but that honestly wasn't the biggest part of it. The infidelity was really a symptom rather than a cause of what broke us up. Effectively, we just weren't communicating well, and we realized that we would be happier with other people.

The specific problem that I am writing to you about is our families' very different opinions about divorce and their impacts on me. Not to be stereotypical, but my family is from the West Coast, and they have a more relaxed attitude towards things like divorce. Obviously they don't like divorce, but they accept that it's sometimes necessary when a marriage has run its course or otherwise is damaged beyond repair. They're being very compassionate and graceful towards me and even towards him. My soon-to-be ex-husband's family, on the other hand, is much more religious and conservative. They feel that divorce is a sin and that he needs to stay in the marriage at all costs. Perhaps owing to the fact that their religious tradition is more than a little patriarchal, they've been venting most of their anger on me rather than him. Even though he's the one who cheated. They've been making snide remarks towards me about how I didn't cut it as a wife and mother. And they even called me a few times and half cajoled me, half insulted me into trying to reconsider ending the marriage.

Now I know that after the divorce, I will have less reason to interact with them. But the fact that I have three children with my husband means that they won't be out of our lives entirely. At least not until the children grow up. And that's assuming the children decide to cut ties with them, which is unlikely because our daughter in particular is close to one of her uncles and those cousins. Obviously, once our children become adults, they'll have every right to make their own independent decisions on whether to maintain ties with these soon-to-be former relatives. But I fear that keeping these relatives in our lives for the children's sake is just going to mean that the insults and other poor behavior will continue. How can I respect the wishes of my children to choose their own relationship with their in-laws while protecting myself from their vitriol?

ANSWER: This is a dilemma for sure, but like many relationship dilemmas, the imperfect but necessary solution is to create boundaries. You can't control how these soon-to-be former in-laws view you or your husband or the institution of marriage. But you can control, to the extent possible, the extent to which they can be in your lives. One suggestion is to try to have a conversation with them to clear the air and push for better treatment. Discuss how hurt you feel by their remarks and say that, while you disagree with them on the divorce, it's your and your husband's right as adults to choose whether or not to stay in the marriage. Maybe even invoke some Christian teachings to try to get them to rediscover their compassionate side around you.

But if this doesn't work, and my spidey sense thinks that it won't, your only real option is to set strict boundaries with them. For instance, make it a rule that you will never talk to them unless it pertains to your children. And while your children are still minors (I presume they still are due to the context of this letter), try to arrange meetings between them and those relatives where you have minimal contact. If possible, ask your ex-husband if he can participate in those meetings without you. Remember that you don't owe anybody anything except for your children, and to the extent required by law and common ethics, your husband as well. (For example, he will presumably be entitled to some amount of custody as the father of the children, unless he's a true monster.) And even while your kids are still minors, you don't have to agree to a Christmas or Thanksgiving or anything else with these in-laws. Those expectations collapsed when the marriage did. You can limit your interaction with them to the extent necessary to facilitate periodic visits between them and your children. And after these children become adults, they can conduct their completely autonomous relationships with these relatives if they so choose, without your having to be involved at all. Good luck and chin up. It will get better.

QUESTION: I'm a 37-year-old man, and I live with my long-term partner. No kids. My brother and I are not close. He lives just a 3-hour drive away, and we routinely make drives longer than that for various reasons, but we only see him maybe once every couple of years. And this includes Christmases and Thanksgivings. We are not actively hostile. We get along relatively well, and we have a few things in common. But we really are at the level of at most casual friends. I have co-workers who I'm closer to than my brother. I want to reconcile with him, but I really don't know how. You have any strategies for trying to connect with a semi-estranged but not hostile sibling?

ANSWER: It's hard to know exactly what advice to provide, given the limited context I have here. For instance:
- What are the reasons for the estrangement?
- Was there a fierce sibling rivalry growing up?
- Was there competition over grades or even over a person?
- Or did you or him do something negative to the other as children?

The general advice on family estrangement is that it's heavily context-specific. In the most extreme cases, such as abuse, the right and reasonable course of action is to cut off contact to the extent possible. But it doesn't sound from your letter like this is the case. In less extreme situations, it really depends a lot on the reasons for the estrangement and knowing the other person, how you think they would react. In these less extreme situations, it's usually a good idea to reach out directly to the person and try to clear the air. This doesn't necessarily need to involve a tell-all or a play-by-play recounting of what happened in the past between you. It could just be something along the lines of: "Hey [Brother], I'm sure you've noticed we don't talk very often and I'd like to change that. I value you as a sibling and love you and hope that we can have a good relationship. What do you think about that?" 

That conveys that you've taken the initiative to try to improve the situation, and that then puts the ball in his court. Ultimately, it will depend on how he responds as to whether or not you two can have a closer relationship. You will have done your part by starting the conversation just mentioned. Another thing I would suggest is to try to meet him at his place rather than the reverse. You can make that 3-hour drive as an additional gesture of your goodwill. Obviously with some advance notice, however. Good luck.

QUESTION: My daughter just came out to my husband and me. It happened relatively undramatically. We were all sitting around the kitchen table, eating dinner, and she mentioned that she had something to tell us. She said that her friend, who we will call Chloe, is actually her girlfriend, and that she's been pretty sure that she is gay for some time. She's 16. She says that while she's been attracted to other girls aside from Chloe, Chloe is the first one to actually reciprocate. And she says she's never been attracted to any boys.

My husband and I paused for a moment, not out of disapproval, but because we simply didn't know how to respond. Finally, we both said something about how we love her and that she's glad and that we're glad that she has enough trust in us to confide in us about this. Neither my husband nor I are homophobic. We have both long supported gay rights, and we've both been close to people who are gay. My husband even bought a small pride flag for her room. The problem though is how do we go about actually relating to her? While my husband and I are honestly elated that we won't have to deal with any teen pregnancy scares, we're also unsure about how we as straight people can truly relate to her experiences. We know that, when it comes to dating and relationships, gay and straight people have many things in common, more so than what divides them. But being gay in our still substantially homophobic society is an experience that neither my husband and I have ever known firsthand. Do you have any suggestions or resources on how to connect with her on this?

ANSWER: About three-quarters of the battle has already been won. She is very lucky to have such loving and supportive parents. Sadly, many people in her situation don't. When it comes to the question of how to relate to her better, you can start the conversation with what you mentioned to me: that there are many similarities between what people experience in gay relationships and what they experience in straight ones. The giddiness and euphoria of a first love, the experience of heartbreak, rejection, hope, physical and emotional intimacy-- these experiences are universal and don't conform to lines of sexual labels. You can probably relate a great deal to what she's going through if you had a relationship or a crush at her age.

And as far as the experiences that don't overlap between straight and gay people, compassion and proactivity is the name of the game. Reinform your unconditional love and support for her and for her choice of partner, whoever that may be. Be proactive without being overbearing. Initiate some of these conversations and discussions, while also knowing when to hang back. And above all, just be there for her. Gay or straight, teenagers need to have that affirmation from parents. With parents also granting them more autonomy, assuming that their behavior and maturity justify it. And yes, by all means, celebrate that when she goes out with her girlfriend, there's not the risk of a pregnancy involved. And remember that even though she still needs guardrails, as all under-18s do, she's also on the cusp of adulthood and is experiencing a situation that's novel for her. Be there with love, compassion, and common sense, offering advice when needed, but generally leaving her to have her own experiences and make her own mistakes. This is the best way to equip her to navigate not only her current relationship but all the ones that follow.

QUESTION: I'm 28 years old (female), and my boyfriend is 33. We get along well and he's a great guy, loves me, loves my dog, wants kids, is usually pretty low maintenance. The problem is, well, I suppose a common one. It's a new time and in many cases, women are working and earning more than men. We are a textbook example of this. Although in our case, I am the only one earning anything at all! I just finished grad school last year and I have a really good, promising job in the finance industry. Nothing like those Wolf of Wall Street financiers but still a good, sustainable job. My boyfriend, by contrast, has always been a bit of a dreamer. He dropped out of college once, then finished a couple years later after volunteering in several cities in America and earning very little money. I met him during his second college stint when I was finishing up college myself. We had a period of long distance but long story short, decided it was worth it, stuck out the long distance, and then started living together after he was able to move back to our town. He also got a master's degree somewhere along the way but isn't using it. He says he wants to change the world and has big plans to end world hunger and to improve global education.

Part of the reason why I fell in love with him was that idealism. But honestly, the situation is starting to become untenable. As I mentioned, he doesn't work right now. He's in a volunteer gig and he sometimes picks up shifts as an Uber driver. But that's hardly what he went to grad school to do. When I urge him to help pay at least a respectable portion of the rent, he keeps talking to me about how his dreams are so important and how so many people in third-world countries are living so much worse than us. So you shouldn't be complaining. I get and understand that there are lots of people who have it worse off than us. But that's still no excuse in my view for what he's doing. As I alluded to earlier, I'm interested in starting a family soon, but can't imagine doing it with him until he does a 180 with his life. And when I have mentioned kids around him, he seems at best ambivalent. What should I do? Stay or go?

ANSWER: I think you've probably answered your own question. You tell me that you've talked to him about the problem, but he blows you off talking about his big dreams. And it seems like he's been like this for some time based on your letter. So, honestly, your lifestyles and what you want in the future just aren't compatible. You have a promising career. He seems to just want to follow his dreams by not working. And you've said that he "seems at best ambivalent" about having children, which you say is one of your big goals. And at 28, you're probably aware that you won't have forever to make this happen. 

You've invested a number of years in this man, and I have no doubt that there's lots of love between you. Any breakup would be devastating, but would breaking up with him be any more devastating than foregoing your wish to have children in order to accommodate someone who has had years to start to build a gainful career but apparently hasn't done so? And even with your well-paying job, I imagine that the stress of having to support him, as well as yourself, is starting to get to you. My younger sister had a boyfriend much like him. Sweet guy, really loved her, great with her dog. But he just wouldn't get his life together. He was working a dead-end theater job and he made no efforts to try to better his situation, either by going back to school or by looking for another job. My sister made the heartbreaking but necessary decision to end it with him. It looks like you are in a quite similar situation. So unless there is something big that you haven't told me about in this letter that would change this situation (such as a large inheritance from his rich uncle), I would urge you to likewise end this relationship and look for someone who is going to pull his weight in the relationship, and eventually as a father, whether or not this conforms with glamorous ideas of dreams. I know it's always very hurtful to end a relationship, but I think that you, as my sister did, will look back on this breakup and realize that although it hurt, you did the right thing for both of you.

QUESTION: I'm 27 and my boyfriend is 30; we've been together for three years and living together for 1.5 years. We get along well and are managing financially, but the problem is with his parents. They're in their late 60s, living on limited income (his father is retired from the military, his mother was a teacher until she quit due to osteoarthritis), but despite their modest pensions, they've made extremely inadvisable financial decisions—luxury cruises, expensive restaurants they can't afford. They're emotionally manipulative, constantly playing on the fact that he's their only child to get him to spend money on them and go into debt. He can't seem to resist, and I think part of it is his sense of duty carried over from when he was in the military—he feels he owes his parents for raising him and wants to give back. They're taking advantage of this. I've tried talking to him about this multiple times, but he always says that his duty to his parents supersedes everything else. I love him and don't want to leave, but I also don't want us to go broke because he can't say no to his parents. Is there any hope left for us?

ANSWER: "He always just says that his duty to his parents supersedes everything else." I think this tells you all that you need to know. I don't doubt that he loves you and that his sense of duty also includes a commitment to you. He sounds like a noble person, but people with a strong sense of duty can be vulnerable to manipulation, as you've seen. In this predicament with his parents, you've asked him multiple times to reconsider his supporting and enabling them, but he isn't responsive to that. And he doesn't seem to respect your input or try to seek any sort of compromise with respect to the money that he spends and the debt that he goes into for them.

This shouldn't remain your problem. You've done your best and made your feelings known to him, but he's ignored them repeatedly. Sadly, I think the best choice that you have is to end the relationship and start over. You don't want to become a second enabler for his parents. Nor do you want his consistent choosing of his parents over you to wreck your own credit and damage your own financial future.

QUESTION: My wife started seeing a therapist about a year ago after her mother died, which I fully supported. But now our marriage is falling apart because of it. When we have disagreements, she comes home from her sessions and immediately brings up whatever we're fighting about, but now she says things like "My therapist says you should..." or "My therapist says I need to..." and then she becomes completely inflexible, treating her therapist's advice like it's a binding court ruling. I feel like I'm being ganged up on by two people, and I can't even defend myself because I'm not in the room with them. I've asked to join a session or see a couples counselor together, but she says her therapist recommended a different therapist for couples work, and I'm resistant because these therapists are expensive and I don't want to cede control of our marriage to them. We're now talking about separating, which I never thought would happen. How can I save our marriage without giving up all control to therapists?

ANSWER: First, let's address the control issue directly: you're already losing your marriage, so the question isn't whether to involve professionals, but which professionals and how. Your wife's individual therapist is correct that couples counseling requires a different therapist—that's standard practice, not a power play. The individual therapist's job is to support your wife's growth, not to referee your marriage. That's why couples work needs its own neutral space.

The real issue here is that you're hearing your wife's version of what happens in therapy, not what actually happens. Therapists don't typically say "You should do X" or "Your spouse needs to Y"—they help people explore their feelings and needs. Your wife may be misrepresenting what's being said, or she may be taking the therapist's guidance and turning it into demands. Either way, you need to be in the room to hear it for yourself. I'd strongly recommend accepting the couples counseling offer. Think of it this way: you're not ceding control to therapists, you're getting professional help to communicate better. If the cost is truly prohibitive, many therapists offer sliding scale fees, and some community health centers provide low-cost counseling. But if you're choosing between paying for therapy or paying for two separate households, the math is pretty clear. The goal isn't to have therapists run your marriage—it's to learn tools to run it better yourselves.

The problem though is how do we go about actually relating to her? While my husband and I are honestly elated that we won't have to deal with any teen pregnancy scares, we're also unsure about how we as straight people can truly relate to her experiences. We know that, when it comes to dating and relationships, gay and straight people have many things in common, more so than what divides them. But being gay in our still substantially homophobic society is an experience that neither my husband and I have ever known firsthand. Do you have any suggestions or resources on how to connect with her on this?

ANSWER: About three-quarters of the battle has already been won. She is very lucky to have such loving and supportive parents. Sadly, many people in her situation don't. When it comes to the question of how to relate to her better, you can start the conversation with what you mentioned to me: that there are many similarities between what people experience in gay relationships and what they experience in straight ones. The giddiness and euphoria of a first love, the experience of heartbreak, rejection, hope, physical and emotional intimacy-- these experiences are universal and don't conform to lines of sexual labels. You can probably relate a great deal to what she's going through if you had a relationship or a crush at her age.

And as far as the experiences that don't overlap between straight and gay people, compassion and proactivity is the name of the game. Reinform your unconditional love and support for her and for her choice of partner, whoever that may be. Be proactive without being overbearing. Initiate some of these conversations and discussions, while also knowing when to hang back. And above all, just be there for her. Gay or straight, teenagers need to have that affirmation from parents. With parents also granting them more autonomy, assuming that their behavior and maturity justify it. And yes, by all means, celebrate that when she goes out with her girlfriend, there's not the risk of a pregnancy involved. And remember that even though she still needs guardrails, as all under-18s do, she's also on the cusp of adulthood and is experiencing a situation that's novel for her. Be there with love, compassion, and common sense, offering advice when needed, but generally leaving her to have her own experiences and make her own mistakes. This is the best way to equip her to navigate not only her current relationship but all the ones that follow.

QUESTION: My husband has always been particular about cleanliness, but since he started a high-stress job, it's gotten much worse. When he's on his way home, I can feel my whole body tense up. I rush around cleaning counters, vacuuming, putting away dishes, making sure no toys are out—all before he walks through the door. If anything is out of place when he arrives, he immediately starts straightening and cleaning, often before even saying hello. I've adapted to his standards over the years, and we're both tidy now, but I feel like I'm living under constant pressure to keep things perfect so he doesn't spiral into cleaning mode. Our kids are experiencing the stress too, and it's getting to them. It's exhausting, and I hate that I sometimes dread his return because of the energy shift it brings. We've talked about it many times, but not much changes. He refuses counseling and says he'll "work on it," but I don't see real progress. How can I support him without losing my peace or turning our home into a stress zone for everyone?

ANSWER: This sounds like untreated anxiety manifesting as obsessive-compulsive behavior, and it's affecting your entire family. The fact that you're pre-cleaning before he gets home to avoid triggering him is a sign that his needs have expanded beyond reasonable boundaries. You can't make him get help, but you can set boundaries around how his untreated anxiety affects you and your children. At least in the short term.

Start by having a direct conversation when you're both calm: "I love you, and I can see that your need for order is tied to managing stress from work. But when you come home and immediately start cleaning without greeting us, it makes me and the kids feel like we're less important than a clean counter. I also notice that I'm spending energy trying to prevent your reactions, which isn't sustainable for me." Then propose specific changes: he agrees to say hello and spend five minutes with the family before addressing any mess, and you agree to maintain reasonable tidiness without the pre-cleaning scramble. If he can't commit to these small changes, then you need to consider whether this is the life you want. 

And even if you can, the changes that I just proposed are just a band-aid. They can buy you some time to make your house a bit of a less stressful place while you ask your husband to reconsider his refusal to get professional help. But on the long term, if you want to truly get this problem under control, he's going to need professional help. His refusal to get such help for what's clearly impacting his family is a choice he's making, and you don't have to accommodate it indefinitely. You might also benefit from individual therapy to help you set and maintain these boundaries without feeling guilty and to talk through what the future might look like if your husband keeps refusing to get professional help in the longer term.

QUESTION: My wife comes from a large, close-knit family, while I come from a much smaller family. Sometimes it seems like I have lived "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." But movie references aside, this has resulted in cultural adaptations for both of us. Geography also shapes our interactions with our respective families, especially around the holidays. Her family is mostly local. The majority of them live within an hour driving radius. By contrast, my family is very spread out. By "spread out", I mean that I need to get on a plane to see three of my four immediate family members. And there's no destination I can go to where I will be within 200 miles of more than one of my immediate family members. As you can imagine, this means that we spend most holidays with her family. It just makes logistical sense, especially because traveling over the holidays is such a nightmare. But at the same time, I feel that this is a bit inequitable. I grew up assuming that my wife and I would alternate families to visit for the holidays, as a lot of people do. For instance, we see her family for Thanksgiving, I see hers for Christmas, then do it the reverse the following year. But the distance makes this impractical. I also have limited time off from work, and we like to travel outside of the holidays for leisure purposes as well. How can we pay heed to logistical realities while also making things more equitable?

ANSWER: Short of a couple or more of your family members moving, there isn't really a way to do it without working around the geography. There are a great many families that can't simply do the one-side-for-Thanksgiving/other-for-Christmas pattern that you mentioned. For instance, some relatives have limited mobility. Some relatives have much larger houses to support family gatherings than others. And as in your situation, geography is often a major factor. So I'd say the first step for you would be to step back from the script that you've been trying to follow and recognize the diversity of experiences out there. There's no one-size-fits-all model for the holidays.

Now come the actual logistical suggestions. You may not see your family as often as you see hers, but there are still some ways to work out compromises. For instance, maybe travel every other year to see a long-distance relative around Christmas, since Christmas tends to be a little bit better than Thanksgiving for travel. You can cut down on outside-of-holidays travel on the years that you go to see your relatives. Or you can invent your own traditions. For example, you could have an early Christmas at one of your relatives' houses and hope that other family members fly in as well. This avoids the worst holiday travel and also gives you yet another celebration to look forward to. You could do the same for Thanksgiving. I have experienced both of these things, and the celebration feels just as festive as if it were on the official calendar day. These situations are always challenging, but they are definitely workable. It's also important to keep perspective: compared to financial issues, disparate philosophies on child-rearing, and many other hard problems, this is a breeze. So go enjoy your Festivus or your Pre-Christmas. I'm sure that they will be just as wonderful and memorable as the traditional holidays.

QUESTION: I'm expecting my first baby in a few months, and I'm struggling with a decision I never thought I'd face. I always assumed I would stay home with my kids, at least during the early years—that's how I was raised. My mom stayed home throughout our entire childhoods. But now that I'm actually pregnant, I realize I don't want to leave my job. I work in HR at a midsize company, and while the work is challenging, it's also predictable and I find it fulfilling. It also doesn't make financial sense right now because I bring in roughly 60% of our family's income—my husband is a schoolteacher. Most of my friends either don't have kids yet or are stay-at-home moms, so I don't have great models for working motherhood. My coworkers who are moms seem frazzled and complain about their kids all the time, which scares me. Is it even possible to be a happy working mom, or am I letting money make a decision for me that should be moral or emotional?

ANSWER: Yes, it's absolutely possible to be a happy working mom—millions of women do it every day. The fact that your coworkers complain doesn't mean they're unhappy; sometimes people vent about challenges without meaning they regret their choices. You might try talking to them directly: "I'm expecting and trying to figure out the work-life balance. I hear you venting sometimes—can you tell me what you actually like about working and parenting? What makes it work for you?" You might be surprised by their answers.

The bigger issue here is the "should" in your question. There's no moral imperative to stay home or to work—there's only what works for your family, your finances, your personality, and your circumstances. You're bringing in most of the income, you find your work fulfilling, and you don't want to leave. Those are all valid reasons to continue working. The key is to set yourself up for success: discuss with your husband how you'll share childcare responsibilities, consider what kind of childcare arrangement would work best for your family, and be realistic about what you can and can't do. You might also find that your feelings change once the baby arrives; some women who planned to work find they want to stay home, and some who planned to stay home find they need the structure and adult interaction that work provides. Give yourself permission to make the decision that's right for you, and know that you can always reassess as your circumstances change.

QUESTION: My best friend recently got back together with her ex-boyfriend, who I know was emotionally abusive to her. She cut off her other best friend for telling her to leave him, and now she's threatening to cut me off too over a trivial political disagreement we had. I'm trying to be a safe presence for her like people advised, but it's getting harder as she keeps ghosting me or being cold and distant. How do I handle this without losing my friend completely, and how do I stop feeling terrible about it?

ANSWER: You can't fix this for her, and you shouldn't try to. Your friend is in a cycle of abuse where she's isolating herself from people who care about her—this is unfortunately common in abusive relationships. The person who's supposed to be her safe place (you) is being pushed away, while the person causing harm is being drawn closer. Your role right now isn't to be a regular friend who gets regular friendship back. It's to be a lifeline that stays available even when she's not using it.

That means: keep reaching out periodically with low-pressure check-ins. Don't expect her to respond, and don't take her distance personally. When she does respond, don't lecture her about the boyfriend—just be present. Say things like, "I'm here whenever you need me, no questions asked." The goal is to make sure she knows you're still there when she's ready to leave. As for feeling terrible about it—that's actually appropriate. It is terrible to watch someone you care about self-destruct. But remember: her choices aren't your fault, and you can't rescue her if she doesn't want to be rescued. You can only keep the door open. In the meantime, make sure you're taking care of yourself. This is emotionally draining work, and you deserve support too. Consider talking to a therapist or joining a support group for friends and family of people in abusive relationships.

QUESTION: My husband and I recently discovered that our 17-year-old is depressed and has contemplated suicide. I found out by going through their phone after noticing they seemed "off" and didn't want to talk to me. Our teen feels betrayed and angry that I went through their phone. We took them to their pediatrician for an evaluation, and they refused to talk at all or to consider an antidepressant or nonmedical interventions. We went to a therapist twice and they refused to speak at all. I've tried drawing them out, waiting patiently, explaining how suicide cannot be undone and we will get through this together, but nothing seems to get through. They did confirm that there was no event that triggered this—they're just sad. They said talking to their friends helps. But I don't know what to do. I'm barely sleeping and every time they're out of sight I'm wondering if they're okay. I asked if they'd see a different therapist and got completely shut down. How do we continue in this liminal space where our teen is suffering but refusing help?

ANSWER: This is terrifying, and I'm so sorry your family is going through this. The most important thing right now is that you and your husband get professional support yourselves, even if your teen won't. Find a therapist who specializes in adolescent mental health—not to fix your teen, but to guide you on how to support them. This is one of those situations where you need expert instructions, not just well-meaning advice.

Since your teen won't talk to a therapist, you need to be their support system. Keep doing what you're doing: spending time with them, doing things they enjoy, getting them outside for walks even if there's resistance. But also, get eyes on them at school—talk to the school counselor confidentially about your concerns. Make sure any firearms are completely removed from your home (not just locked up), and ask friends and family to do the same if your teen visits. The phone issue is tricky—you violated their privacy, which they're rightfully upset about, but you also found critical information. You might need to apologize for the method while explaining why you were worried: "I'm sorry I went through your phone. I was scared because you seemed so different, and I didn't know how else to understand what was happening. Can we find a better way for you to let me know when you're struggling?" Most importantly, keep the lines of communication open. They said talking to friends helps—that's actually a good sign. Don't try to replace that, but do make sure they know you're available whenever they're ready to talk. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and you need to take care of yourself too so you can be there for the long haul.

QUESTION: I'm getting married next year and I want to wear my grandmother's wedding gown. She got married in 1970 and her dress is a stunning floor-length fuchsia A-line gown with a square neckline—she hated white as much as I do. My grandmother is having it dry cleaned and says it's still in perfect condition. My future mother-in-law thought it was wonderful that I'd be wearing my grandmother's gown until she saw a picture of it. Now she insists that it couldn't be a wedding gown since brides only wore white back then, even though the picture is clearly of my grandparents on their wedding day. She can't let it go and keeps saying what a mistake it will be to be married in "that dreary old pink dress" and that I'll miss the fun of picking my own special gown. My mom also suggested I wear something more traditional like she did, and offered me her white gown, but I hate it—it's poufy and over the top with tulle and beading. My fiancé says I should wear what makes me happy, which is my grandmother's dress. With both moms objecting, is this a stupid hill to die on?

ANSWER: No, this is not a stupid hill to die on. It's your wedding, and you should wear what makes you happy. Your future mother-in-law is wrong about historical wedding dress colors—plenty of brides wore colors other than white throughout history, and even in 1970, non-white wedding dresses weren't unheard of. But more importantly, her opinion about what you should wear on your wedding day is just that—an opinion, not a requirement.

Here's what I'd suggest: thank both mothers for their input, then firmly close the topic. "Thanks for everyone's thoughts, but I've decided to wear my grandmother's dress. The topic's closed." Mean it, and don't engage in further discussion about it. If they bring it up again, you can say, "We've already discussed this, and my decision is made." Your fiancé is right to support you, and it's good that he's on your side. If your future mother-in-law continues to push, he should be the one to tell her to stop, since it's his family. This is actually a good test of how you'll handle future boundary issues with your in-laws. If you give in on something as personal as your wedding dress to avoid conflict, you're setting a pattern of letting them dictate your choices. Start as you mean to go on: with respect for their opinions, but with firm boundaries about what's yours to decide. Wear the pink dress, and have a beautiful wedding.

QUESTION: My brother and I have always been very competitive. We were raised in a household where academic success was valued above almost everything else. He and I were both very good students, but he was the better one. In particular, I struggled at math. But he always aced his math classes and now has a math PhD as well as one in physics. I have, "only," a single PhD in a non-math related field. Our competition dynamic led to a distant relationship that we have had during our entire adult lives. We're both in our early forties. I want to try to mend the rift, but I'm not sure where to begin. This is complicated by the fact that on the relatively rare occasions that we see each other, the old competitive dynamic emerges again. For instance, recently when we were visiting our mother, we played games such as Trivial Pursuit and Scrabble in which he smoked me. He's never been a jerk or bragged about beating me in things, but I still feel the effects of it. How can we move towards a more productive dynamic?

ANSWER: Sibling rivalries are always hard, and while your relationship is generally cordial, the competitive dynamic from your past complicates it. I admire your willingness to reach out. Start by having an initial conversation with him to break the ice and build a better relationship—in this first conversation, don't mention the competitive dynamic unless it comes up. Just focus on the fact that you've been distant and that you want to be more a part of his life. He should be receptive to that unless he has some sort of secret grudge against you.

Regardless of how he responds, it's important for you to do some work on yourself to question this mentality of competition, ideally with a therapist. Try to understand not just where this idea of competition comes from, but how it affects you now: does it add to your life or take away from it? I would also urge you to cultivate hobbies and interests that don't depend on competition, such as gardening, art, or single-player video games. And stay away from social media, which amplifies the "keeping up with the Joneses" dynamic. With some healthy new hobbies and ways of thinking, you'll be well on your way to better managing this relationship and, equally importantly, your own mental health.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been together for three years, and we're talking about moving in together. The problem is that we have very different ideas about what "clean" means. I'm someone who likes things tidy—dishes done, counters wiped, clothes put away. He's more relaxed and thinks it's fine to leave dishes in the sink overnight, have clothes on the floor, and let mail pile up on the kitchen table. When I visit his apartment, I find myself cleaning up because the mess stresses me out, but I know I can't do that forever. I've tried talking to him about it, and he says he'll "try to be better," but nothing really changes. I'm worried that if we move in together, I'll either become his maid or we'll fight constantly about housework. How do we figure out if we can make this work?

ANSWER: This is a very common issue, and it's smart to address it before you move in together. The key is to have a concrete conversation about expectations, not just vague promises to "try better." Sit down and discuss specific standards: what does "clean enough" look like for shared spaces? How often should dishes be done? What's the threshold for when something becomes too messy? You might find that you can compromise—maybe dishes can wait until morning, but they need to be done before dinner the next day. Or maybe you agree that shared spaces stay tidy, but personal spaces like bedrooms can be as messy as each person wants.

The bigger question is whether he's willing to put in the effort to meet you halfway. If he says he'll try but never actually does, that's a red flag. Consider a trial period: spend a week living together (if possible) or have him stay with you for an extended visit and see how it goes. Pay attention to whether he notices when things need cleaning, whether he takes initiative, or whether you have to ask him every time. If you find yourself constantly nagging or doing everything yourself, that's not a sustainable dynamic. You might also consider hiring a cleaning service if you can afford it—sometimes outsourcing this conflict is worth the cost to preserve your relationship. But ultimately, if he can't or won't meet you in the middle on basic household maintenance, that tells you something important about how he'll handle other compromises in your relationship.

QUESTION: My girlfriend and I have been dating for two years, and we're both in our late 20s. I've always known I wanted kids—it's been a life goal of mine for as long as I can remember. When we first started dating, she said she wasn't sure about kids, which I thought meant she was open to the possibility. But recently, she's been more firm about it, saying she doesn't think she wants children and that she's pretty certain about that. I love her and I can see a future with her, but I can't imagine my life without being a parent. I've tried to talk to her about it, but she gets defensive and says I'm pressuring her. I don't want to pressure her, but I also don't want to waste either of our time if we're fundamentally incompatible on this. How do we navigate this?

ANSWER: This is one of those fundamental incompatibilities that can't be compromised on—you can't have half a kid, and one person shouldn't have to sacrifice such a major life goal for the other. The fact that she's getting defensive suggests she knows this is a deal-breaker issue, and she may be trying to avoid the conversation because she doesn't want to face what it might mean for your relationship.

You need to have one more direct, honest conversation. Frame it not as pressure, but as clarity: "I love you, and I want to build a future with you. But I need to know where you stand on kids, because this is a deal-breaker for me. I'm not asking you to change your mind—I'm asking you to be honest with me and with yourself about what you want." Give her space to think about it, but set a timeline. If after some reflection she's certain she doesn't want kids, then you have your answer. It's heartbreaking, but staying together when you want fundamentally different things will only lead to resentment—either you'll resent her for "depriving" you of parenthood, or she'll resent you if she has a child she doesn't want. Neither outcome is fair to either of you, or to a potential child. The kindest thing you can do for both of you is to be honest about this incompatibility and make the hard decision to part ways if you can't align on this fundamental life goal.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been in a long-distance relationship for the past year. We met online and hit it off immediately, and we've been making it work with visits every few months. But lately, I'm starting to feel like the distance is taking a toll. We talk on the phone and video chat regularly, but it's not the same as being together. I'm starting to feel lonely and disconnected, and I'm wondering if I'm missing out on opportunities to meet someone local. We've talked about one of us moving, but neither of us can right now—I'm in grad school and they're established in their career. I love them, but I'm not sure how much longer I can do this. How do I know if the distance is just a temporary challenge we can overcome, or if it's a sign that this isn't meant to be?

ANSWER: Long-distance relationships can work, but they require a clear end date or at least a concrete plan for when you'll be together. The fact that neither of you can move right now is understandable, but "someday" isn't a plan—it's a hope. You need to sit down together and have a serious conversation about timelines: when could one of you realistically move? What would that look like? What are you both willing to sacrifice to make it happen? If the answer is "we don't know" or "maybe in a few years," then you're essentially asking yourself to put your life on hold indefinitely, which isn't fair to either of you.

The loneliness you're feeling is valid, and it's worth examining whether you're staying in this relationship because you genuinely see a future together, or because you're afraid of being alone or of hurting them. Ask yourself: if you knew for certain that you'd be long-distance for another three years with no clear plan to close the distance, would you stay? If the answer is no, then you have your answer. It's okay to love someone and still recognize that the circumstances aren't right for you. That doesn't make the love less real—it just means that love alone isn't always enough to make a relationship work. You deserve to be in a relationship that meets your needs, including the need for physical presence and daily connection. If this relationship can't provide that within a reasonable timeframe, it may be time to have an honest conversation about whether you're both truly committed to making the necessary sacrifices to be together.

QUESTION: I'm on the autism spectrum and my partner is also neurodivergent, albeit in a different way. This has been a source of connection, but also a source of struggle. For example, they frequently express frustration when I'm not reading their social cues in the way that they expect me to. They also get irritated if I leave the room because they're cooking a certain thing, or if I'm focusing on obsessive interest, as we autists are known for. I do try to communicate my needs to them, and they seem receptive to it. But often it seems like we're getting nowhere. Our brains are wired too differently. Any recommendations on how to bridge the gap?

ANSWER: This is a common problem in neurologically mixed relationships. Even with both partners being neurodivergent, being neurodivergent in different ways is often just as challenging as one partner being neurodivergent and the other neurotypical. But you're not alone in this struggle. If you aren't doing it already, I would highly recommend couples counseling. This should help you begin to work through some of these issues. There are many compromises that you can make that would be worthwhile. For instance, your partner agrees not to cook certain food with you around, or you agree to set aside a certain amount of time for them each day so that you don't get sucked into your strong interest as much. The keys are:
1. Compassion
2. Empathy
3. A willingness to listen

There's also a growing body of resources available for couples in your situation. In particular, I would recommend that you both read the book "The Autism Partner Handbook: How to Love an Autistic Person" by Elly Blue, Faith G. Harper, and Joe Biel. It's a quick read and offers a lot of useful suggestions for your situation. Navigating neurodivergence is a challenge, but plenty of other couples have done it. Good luck.

QUESTION: I've been dating my boyfriend for about six months, and things are going well overall. But there's one issue that's been bothering me: he's still very close with his ex-girlfriend. They text regularly, hang out one-on-one, and he even invited her to a party at his place recently. When I asked him about it, he said they're just friends and that their relationship was never that serious anyway. I trust him, but it still makes me uncomfortable. I've never stayed friends with my exes, so I don't really understand how that works. Am I being unreasonable? Should I ask him to cut back on the friendship, or is this something I need to work on?

ANSWER: Whether exes can be friends is highly individual—some people can maintain healthy platonic friendships with former partners, and others can't. The question isn't whether it's "normal" to be friends with an ex, but whether this particular friendship is appropriate and respectful of your current relationship. There are some red flags here: the one-on-one hangouts, the regular texting, and the fact that he's including her in his social life in a way that might be making you feel like a third wheel.

Before you ask him to change anything, you need to understand what's really going on. Have a calm conversation: "I trust you, but I'm feeling uncomfortable with how close you are with your ex. Can you help me understand the friendship? What does it look like from your perspective?" Pay attention to his response. Does he dismiss your feelings? Does he get defensive? Or does he listen and try to help you understand? A partner who cares about your feelings will want to address your discomfort, even if they don't agree that there's a problem. You might find that there are reasonable boundaries you can both agree on—maybe group hangouts are fine, but one-on-one dinners feel too intimate. Or maybe you can all hang out together so you can see their dynamic for yourself. But if he's unwilling to make any adjustments or if his friendship with his ex is more important than your comfort in the relationship, that tells you something about his priorities. You're not being unreasonable to want boundaries around ex-relationships—that's a very common need in romantic partnerships.

QUESTION: I'm 28 years old (female), and my boyfriend is 33. We get along well and he's a great guy, loves me, loves my dog, wants kids, is usually pretty low maintenance. The problem is, well, I suppose a common one. It's a new time and in many cases, women are working and earning more than men. We are a textbook example of this. Although in our case, I am the only one earning anything at all! I just finished grad school last year and I have a really good, promising job in the finance industry. Nothing like those Wolf of Wall Street financiers but still a good, sustainable job. My boyfriend, by contrast, has always been a bit of a dreamer. He dropped out of college once, then finished a couple years later after volunteering in several cities in America and earning very little money. I met him during his second college stint when I was finishing up college myself. We had a period of long distance but long story short, decided it was worth it, stuck out the long distance, and then started living together after he was able to move back to our town. He also got a master's degree somewhere along the way but isn't using it. He says he wants to change the world and has big plans to end world hunger and to improve global education.

Part of the reason why I fell in love with him was that idealism. But honestly, the situation is starting to become untenable. As I mentioned, he doesn't work right now. He's in a volunteer gig and he sometimes picks up shifts as an Uber driver. But that's hardly what he went to grad school to do. When I urge him to help pay at least a respectable portion of the rent, he keeps talking to me about how his dreams are so important and how so many people in third-world countries are living so much worse than us. So you shouldn't be complaining. I get and understand that there are lots of people who have it worse off than us. But that's still no excuse in my view for what he's doing. As I alluded to earlier, I'm interested in starting a family soon, but can't imagine doing it with him until he does a 180 with his life. And when I have mentioned kids around him, he seems at best ambivalent. What should I do? Stay or go?

ANSWER: I think you've probably answered your own question. You tell me that you've talked to him about the problem, but he blows you off talking about his big dreams. And it seems like he's been like this for some time based on your letter. So, honestly, your lifestyles and what you want in the future just aren't compatible. You have a promising career. He seems to just want to follow his dreams by not working. And you've said that he "seems at best ambivalent" about having children, which you say is one of your big goals. And at 28, you're probably aware that you won't have forever to make this happen. 

You've invested a number of years in this man, and I have no doubt that there's lots of love between you. Any breakup would be devastating, but would breaking up with him be any more devastating than foregoing your wish to have children in order to accommodate someone who has had years to start to build a gainful career but apparently hasn't done so? And even with your well-paying job, I imagine that the stress of having to support him, as well as yourself, is starting to get to you. My younger sister had a boyfriend much like him. Sweet guy, really loved her, great with her dog. But he just wouldn't get his life together. He was working a dead-end theater job and he made no efforts to try to better his situation, either by going back to school or by looking for another job. My sister made the heartbreaking but necessary decision to end it with him. It looks like you are in a quite similar situation. So unless there is something big that you haven't told me about in this letter that would change this situation (such as a large inheritance from his rich uncle), I would urge you to likewise end this relationship and look for someone who is going to pull his weight in the relationship, and eventually as a father, whether or not this conforms with glamorous ideas of dreams. I know it's always very hurtful to end a relationship, but I think that you, as my sister did, will look back on this breakup and realize that although it hurt, you did the right thing for both of you.

QUESTION: My husband and I have been married for five years, and we have two young children. My husband's job requires him to travel frequently—he's gone about two weeks out of every month. When he's home, he's often exhausted and wants to relax, which means I'm still doing most of the childcare and household management even when he's here. I work full-time too, and I'm burning out. I've tried talking to him about it, but he says his job is demanding and he needs downtime when he's home. I understand that, but I also need a break, and I feel like I'm doing everything alone. We can't afford for him to change jobs right now, but something has to give. How do we find balance when his career requires so much travel?

ANSWER: This is a really tough situation, and your burnout is completely understandable. The issue isn't just the travel—it's that when he's home, the division of labor isn't fair. Yes, he's tired from work, but so are you, and you've been holding down the fort solo while he's been away. His "downtime" shouldn't come at the expense of you never getting any.

You need to have a serious conversation about restructuring how things work when he's home. Start by acknowledging his need for rest, but also make it clear that you have the same need: "I know you're exhausted when you get home, and I want you to have time to recharge. But I've been working and parenting solo while you're gone, and I'm exhausted too. We need to find a way for both of us to get breaks." Then get specific: maybe he takes the kids for a few hours on Saturday morning so you can sleep in or have time to yourself. Maybe you alternate who handles bedtime routines. Maybe you hire help—a babysitter for a few hours a week, or a cleaning service to take some of the household burden off both of you. The key is that his travel schedule can't be an excuse for you to carry 100% of the load when he's home. That's not sustainable, and it will breed resentment.

You also need to talk about the long-term plan. If his job requires this much travel indefinitely, you both need to decide if that's the life you want. Can he look for a different role in the same company that requires less travel? Can you make financial changes that would allow him to take a job with less travel, even if it pays less? The current arrangement might work short-term, but if it's going to be years of this, you need to know that and make an informed decision about whether you can handle it. Your mental health and your children's well-being depend on you not being constantly overwhelmed.

QUESTION: My girlfriend and I have been together for a year, and we're both in our early 30s. She's great in so many ways, but there's one thing that's really bothering me: she's constantly on her phone when we're together. We'll be having dinner, and she'll be scrolling through social media. We'll be watching a movie, and she'll be texting. Even when we're having what I think is an important conversation, she'll pick up her phone to check notifications. I've mentioned it a few times, and she'll put it away for a little while, but then she's right back to it. I feel like I'm competing with her phone for attention, and it's making me feel unimportant. Am I overreacting, or is this a legitimate concern?

ANSWER: You're not overreacting—this is a legitimate concern. When someone is constantly on their phone during shared time, it sends a message that whatever's on the screen is more important than the person in front of them. That's hurtful, and it's reasonable to want your partner's full attention when you're spending time together.

The fact that she puts it away temporarily when you mention it but then goes back to it suggests this might be more of a habit or compulsion than intentional disregard. Some people genuinely struggle with phone addiction or use their phones as a way to manage anxiety or boredom. But regardless of the reason, it's affecting your relationship, and that needs to be addressed.

Have a direct conversation when you're both calm and not in the middle of a phone-checking moment: "I love spending time with you, but I've noticed that you're often on your phone when we're together, and it makes me feel like I'm not important to you. I'd like us to have some phone-free time together—maybe during meals, or when we're watching something, or having important conversations. Can we agree on some boundaries around that?" Be specific about what you need: maybe phones go in another room during dinner, or you have certain times that are designated as phone-free. If she's resistant or dismissive of your feelings, that's a bigger problem. But if she's willing to work on it, you might need to help her by suggesting alternatives—maybe she needs to address underlying anxiety, or maybe you need to make your time together more engaging so she's less tempted to reach for her phone. The goal is to find a balance where you both feel present and connected.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for three years, and we're talking about getting engaged. The problem is my family. They're very traditional and have made it clear they don't approve of my partner for several reasons—my partner is from a different cultural background, has a different religion, and my family thinks they're "not good enough" for me. We've tried to include my partner in family events, but my family is cold and sometimes outright rude. My partner has been incredibly patient and understanding, but I can see it's taking a toll. I love my family, but I also love my partner, and I'm tired of being caught in the middle. How do I handle this?

ANSWER: This is a painful situation, and I'm sorry you're dealing with it. The reality is that you can't control your family's behavior, but you can control how you respond to it and what you're willing to tolerate. Right now, by continuing to bring your partner into situations where they're treated poorly, you're essentially condoning that treatment, even if that's not your intention.

You need to set clear boundaries with your family. Have a direct conversation: "I love you all, and I want you in my life. But the way you're treating my partner is unacceptable, and I won't continue to subject them to that. If you can't be respectful and welcoming to my partner, then I won't be bringing them to family events, and I may need to limit my own participation as well." This is hard, but necessary. Your partner deserves to be treated with basic respect, and you deserve to not have to choose between your family and your relationship.

The key is to be consistent. If you set this boundary but then keep showing up to family events without your partner, or if you let your family's comments slide, you're sending mixed messages. You might also consider whether there are family members who are more accepting—maybe you can maintain relationships with those individuals separately, while limiting contact with those who are hostile. Ultimately, if your family can't accept your partner, that's their loss. You're building a life with someone you love, and that's what matters. Your family can either be part of that life on respectful terms, or they can choose not to be. But you shouldn't have to sacrifice your relationship to maintain a relationship with people who don't respect your choices.

QUESTION: I'm the mother of two kids, a son age 15 and a daughter age 13. My son has expressed a strong interest in being a physician, a goal that I support because he has a genuine love for medicine—he's been interested in it from a very young age and has loved his hospital shadowing experiences. The problem is that he's so focused on school and grades that he isn't doing any extracurriculars. I worry that now that he's in high school, not having extracurriculars will hurt his chances of getting into a good college and eventually medical school, even if he maintains his excellent grades. I don't like the "extracurricular arms race" that high school has become, but I recognize we have to work within the system as it exists. I've repeatedly encouraged him to find an extracurricular he likes, even suggesting the Science Club since science is his favorite subject, but he always says he's focused on schoolwork and that Science Club would be redundant since he already studies science outside of school. I want him to forge his own path, but I also don't want him to make choices that could hurt his chances of getting into medical school or another professional or graduate school. How can I strike a balance between providing sound parental advice and giving him the autonomy he needs to make his own choices?

ANSWER: I agree with you about the extracurricular arms race—it's unfortunate that these activities have become boxes to check rather than enriching experiences, but you're right that we need to work within the system. A good first step is to talk to his guidance counselor (and encourage him to do the same) to understand what extracurricular portfolios look like for recent graduates who got into good colleges; you can also talk to other parents and look at reputable websites (avoid sources like U.S. News and World Report, which exaggerate prestige factors). Being armed with facts helps reduce over-worrying. I would stress that having one or two extracurriculars can be important for college admissions—it's not fair, but that's how the system works. My brother had virtually perfect grades and a 1600 SAT score yet didn't get into Yale, and we think his lack of extracurriculars was a major factor. Does your son have friends in extracurriculars who've had good experiences? Does he have interests outside of science that could be pursued in an extracurricular? Most schools offer many options, and even if his doesn't, there should be something that appeals to his interests. Remind him that these organizations are good ways to make friends and can be enriching beyond just a line on a resume. Good luck—he sounds like a really good kid.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I are both 25, and we've been dating for about eight months. Things are going well, but there's one issue: he wants to move in together, and I'm not ready. I like having my own space, and I'm not sure we've been together long enough to take that step. When I tell him this, he gets hurt and says it makes him feel like I don't see a future with us. I do see a future with us, but I also think moving in together is a big step that shouldn't be rushed. How do I explain this without making him feel rejected?

ANSWER: Your instinct to take things slowly is valid—eight months isn't very long, and moving in together is a significant commitment that changes the dynamic of a relationship. His hurt feelings are understandable, but they shouldn't pressure you into making a decision you're not ready for. Moving in together before you're ready is a recipe for resentment and conflict.

Have a conversation that acknowledges his feelings while being clear about your own: "I understand why this feels like rejection, and that's not my intention at all. I do see a future with us, which is why I want to make sure we're making this decision for the right reasons and at the right time. Moving in together is a big step, and I want us to be in a place where we're both excited about it, not where one of us is doing it to avoid hurting the other's feelings." Then talk about what "ready" looks like for you: maybe you want to hit the one-year mark, or maybe you want to work through some other issues first, or maybe you just need more time to feel comfortable with the idea. Be specific about your timeline if you have one, or be honest if you don't know when you'll be ready.

It's also worth exploring why he's pushing for this so soon. Is he feeling insecure about the relationship? Is there a financial reason? Understanding his motivation can help you address the underlying concern. But ultimately, if you're not ready, you're not ready, and that's okay. A partner who truly cares about you will respect your boundaries and timeline, even if it's not what they hoped for. If he can't accept that and continues to pressure you, that's a red flag about how he handles not getting his way in the relationship.

QUESTION: I'm a 37-year-old man, and I live with my long-term partner. No kids. My brother and I are not close. He lives just a 3-hour drive away, and we routinely make drives longer than that for various reasons, but we only see him maybe once every couple of years. And this includes Christmases and Thanksgivings. We are not actively hostile. We get along relatively well, and we have a few things in common. But we really are at the level of at most casual friends. I have co-workers who I'm closer to than my brother. I want to reconcile with him, but I really don't know how. You have any strategies for trying to connect with a semi-estranged but not hostile sibling?

ANSWER: It's hard to know exactly what advice to provide, given the limited context I have here. For instance:
- What are the reasons for the estrangement?
- Was there a fierce sibling rivalry growing up?
- Was there competition over grades or even over a person?
- Or did you or him do something negative to the other as children?

The general advice on family estrangement is that it's heavily context-specific. In the most extreme cases, such as abuse, the right and reasonable course of action is to cut off contact to the extent possible. But it doesn't sound from your letter like this is the case. In less extreme situations, it really depends a lot on the reasons for the estrangement and knowing the other person, how you think they would react. In these less extreme situations, it's usually a good idea to reach out directly to the person and try to clear the air. This doesn't necessarily need to involve a tell-all or a play-by-play recounting of what happened in the past between you. It could just be something along the lines of: "Hey [Brother], I'm sure you've noticed we don't talk very often and I'd like to change that. I value you as a sibling and love you and hope that we can have a good relationship. What do you think about that?" 

That conveys that you've taken the initiative to try to improve the situation, and that then puts the ball in his court. Ultimately, it will depend on how he responds as to whether or not you two can have a closer relationship. You will have done your part by starting the conversation just mentioned. Another thing I would suggest is to try to meet him at his place rather than the reverse. You can make that 3-hour drive as an additional gesture of your goodwill. Obviously with some advance notice, however. Good luck.

QUESTION: My wife and I have been married for eight years, and we have a good relationship overall. But there's one recurring issue: she's very close with her group of college friends, and they have a group chat where they're constantly messaging. The problem is that they often share very personal details about their lives, including things about their relationships and sex lives. My wife participates in these conversations and sometimes shares details about our relationship that I'm not comfortable with. When I've asked her to keep our private life private, she says I'm being too sensitive and that this is just how her friend group communicates. But I feel like my privacy is being violated, and I don't want our intimate details discussed in a group chat. How do we resolve this?

ANSWER: Your feelings are completely valid—you have a right to privacy in your relationship, and your wife sharing intimate details about your life without your consent is a boundary violation. The fact that she's dismissing your concerns as being "too sensitive" is also problematic. Your comfort level matters, and a good partner should respect that, even if they don't fully understand it.

You need to have a clear conversation about boundaries: "I understand that your friend group is close and shares a lot with each other. But when you share details about our relationship, especially intimate ones, it makes me feel like my privacy isn't being respected. I'm not asking you to stop being close with your friends, but I am asking you to keep our private life private. Can we agree on what's off-limits?" Be specific about what you consider private—maybe it's anything about your sex life, or maybe it's details about arguments or personal struggles. The key is that you both need to agree on what's okay to share and what isn't.

If she continues to dismiss your concerns or refuses to change her behavior, that's a bigger issue. It suggests she doesn't respect your boundaries or your right to privacy. You might need to consider couples counseling to work through this, because trust and respect for boundaries are fundamental to a healthy relationship. Your wife's friendships are important, but they shouldn't come at the expense of your comfort and privacy in your own marriage.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for two years. We get along great and have similar values and goals. But there's one thing that's been bothering me: there's a 12-year age gap between us—I'm 35 and they're 23. When we started dating, the age difference didn't seem like a big deal, but lately I've been thinking about it more. I'm at a point where I'm thinking about settling down, buying a house, maybe having kids. They're still figuring out their career, want to travel, and aren't sure about kids. I'm worried that we're at different life stages, and that might cause problems down the road. Am I overthinking this, or are these legitimate concerns?

ANSWER: These are legitimate concerns. Age gaps can work in relationships, but they often come with life-stage differences that can create challenges. The fact that you're thinking about settling down and they're still in the exploration phase is a real difference that needs to be addressed, not dismissed.

The age gap itself isn't necessarily the problem—it's the life-stage mismatch. If they're 23 and want to travel and explore, that's completely normal for someone that age. But if you're 35 and ready to settle down, you need to decide if you're willing to wait for them to catch up to where you are, or if you need someone who's already at that stage. Remember that your partner was 21 when you first started dating them. That's only barely old enough to drink. And it's only a few years past high school. When you reached drinking age, they were only 9 years old and in elementary school. By the time they catch up to where you are now, you might be in your early to mid-40s. And while I don't want to presume the gender of either of you, that's generally a late age to start having kids. 

So you need to ask yourself some hard questions. Then if you haven't already done so, have a frank and honest conversation with them. Open with something like: "I love you, and I want to make sure we're on the same page about where we're headed. I'm thinking about buying a house and potentially having kids in the next few years. Where are you at with those things? What does your timeline look like?" Pay attention to their answers. Are they open to having those conversations? Do they seem to want similar things, just on a different timeline? Or are you fundamentally wanting different things? You need to be honest with yourself about what you want and whether this relationship can provide it. Don't stay in a relationship hoping someone will change or "catch up"—that's a recipe for resentment. Either you're both moving in the same direction, and at a speed that you feel works well for both of you, or you need to acknowledge that you might be on different paths.

QUESTION: My husband and I have been married for seven years, and we have two kids from my previous marriage. My husband has been in their lives since they were 4 and 6, and he's been a great stepfather overall. But lately, my 13-year-old has been pushing back against his authority, saying things like "You're not my real dad" when he tries to set rules or give consequences. My husband is hurt by this, and I'm caught in the middle. I want to support my husband's role as a parental figure, but I also don't want to invalidate my son's feelings or make him feel like he has to forget about his biological father. How do I navigate this?

ANSWER: This is a common challenge in blended families, and your son's behavior, while hurtful, is also developmentally normal—teenagers push boundaries, and step-parent relationships add an extra layer of complexity. The key is to validate your son's feelings while also maintaining clear boundaries about respect. Have a private conversation with your son: "I understand that [husband] isn't your biological father, and I would never ask you to think of him that way. But he is part of our family, and he cares about you. When you say 'You're not my real dad' to hurt him, that's not okay. You can express your feelings without being disrespectful." Then work with your husband on a unified approach: maybe you take the lead on discipline for now, while your husband focuses on building connection through shared activities and positive interactions. Consider family therapy if this continues—blended families often benefit from professional guidance to navigate these dynamics. The goal isn't to force your son to see your husband as his father, but to help him understand that respect and love aren't zero-sum—he can honor his biological father while also having a positive relationship with his stepfather.

QUESTION: I'm 27 and my boyfriend is 30; we've been together for three years and living together for 1.5 years. We get along well and are managing financially, but the problem is with his parents. They're in their late 60s, living on limited income (his father is retired from the military, his mother was a teacher until she quit due to osteoarthritis), but despite their modest pensions, they've made extremely inadvisable financial decisions—luxury cruises, expensive restaurants they can't afford. They're emotionally manipulative, constantly playing on the fact that he's their only child to get him to spend money on them and go into debt. He can't seem to resist, and I think part of it is his sense of duty carried over from when he was in the military—he feels he owes his parents for raising him and wants to give back. They're taking advantage of this. I've tried talking to him about this multiple times, but he always says that his duty to his parents supersedes everything else. I love him and don't want to leave, but I also don't want us to go broke because he can't say no to his parents. Is there any hope left for us?

ANSWER: "He always just says that his duty to his parents supersedes everything else." I think this tells you all that you need to know. I don't doubt that he loves you and that his sense of duty also includes a commitment to you. He sounds like a noble person, but people with a strong sense of duty can be vulnerable to manipulation, as you've seen. In this predicament with his parents, you've asked him multiple times to reconsider his supporting and enabling them, but he isn't responsive to that. And he doesn't seem to respect your input or try to seek any sort of compromise with respect to the money that he spends and the debt that he goes into for them.

This shouldn't remain your problem. You've done your best and made your feelings known to him, but he's ignored them repeatedly. Sadly, I think the best choice that you have is to end the relationship and start over. You don't want to become a second enabler for his parents. Nor do you want his consistent choosing of his parents over you to wreck your own credit and damage your own financial future.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for four years, and we're both in our early 30s. We've been talking about having kids, but we have very different ideas about parenting. I was raised with strict rules, clear consequences, and high expectations. My partner was raised in a much more permissive household where kids had a lot of freedom and choices. I think kids need structure and boundaries to thrive, while my partner thinks too many rules stifle creativity and independence. We've tried to discuss this, but we both get defensive because our approaches are tied to our own childhood experiences. How do we figure out a parenting style we can both agree on before we have kids?

ANSWER: This is exactly the kind of conversation you need to have before having children, so good on you for recognizing it. The key is to move away from "my way vs. your way" and toward "what works best for kids." Start by reading some evidence-based parenting books together—look for sources that cite research rather than just personal philosophy. Books like "The Whole-Brain Child" by Daniel Siegel or "How to Talk So Kids Will Listen" by Adele Faber can give you a shared foundation based on child development research rather than your individual upbringings.

Then, instead of debating strict vs. permissive, talk about specific scenarios: "How would we handle it if our 5-year-old refuses to go to bed?" or "What do we do if our teenager wants to go to a party we're not comfortable with?" Focus on the principles behind your approaches—you value structure and safety, your partner values autonomy and trust. Both are valid, and the best parenting often combines elements of both. You might find that you can agree on boundaries around safety and health (non-negotiable) while giving kids more freedom in areas like hobbies or clothing choices (negotiable). Consider taking a parenting class together or seeing a couples therapist who specializes in pre-parenting counseling. The goal isn't to convince each other that one approach is right, but to build a shared philosophy that incorporates both of your values.

QUESTION: My girlfriend and I have been together for two years, and we're both in our late 20s. She just got offered her dream job, but it's in a city about 500 miles away. She wants to take it, and she's asked me to move with her. I have a good job here that I enjoy, my family lives nearby, and I've built a life in this city. I love her and I want to support her career, but I'm not sure I'm ready to uproot my entire life. She's hurt that I'm hesitating and says it shows I'm not committed to our future. How do we figure this out?

ANSWER: This is a major life decision that requires honest conversation, not guilt or pressure. Her hurt is understandable—she's interpreting your hesitation as a lack of commitment—but moving for a partner is a huge ask that deserves careful consideration, not an immediate yes. You need to have a real conversation about what this move would mean for both of you: What would your job prospects look like in the new city? How would you maintain your relationships with family and friends? What's the long-term plan—is this permanent, or is there a timeline for potentially moving back? Are there compromises—could you try long-distance for a period while you both explore options?

The bigger question is whether you see a future together regardless of location. If you do, then this becomes a logistics problem you can solve together. If you don't, then the location question is really a proxy for a deeper incompatibility. Be honest with yourself and with her about where you're at. It's okay to say, "I need time to think about this because it's a major decision that affects my career, my relationships, and my life. Can we talk through the practicalities and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us?" If she can't give you that space and continues to frame it as a test of your commitment, that's a red flag. A healthy partnership allows both people to make major life decisions thoughtfully, not under pressure.

QUESTION: My husband and I have been married for 10 years, and we have very different approaches to holidays. I come from a big family where holidays are a huge deal—lots of traditions, big gatherings, weeks of preparation. He comes from a smaller, more low-key family where holidays were simpler. I love the excitement and the sense of tradition, but he finds it all overwhelming and stressful. Every holiday season, we end up fighting because I want to do all the things I grew up with, and he wants to keep it minimal. I feel like he's not putting in effort, and he feels like I'm creating unnecessary stress. How do we find a middle ground?

ANSWER: Holidays can be emotionally loaded because they're tied to childhood memories and family identity, which is why these disagreements feel so personal. The key is to separate what's truly important to you from what's just habit. Sit down together before the next holiday season and each make a list: what are your must-haves, what would be nice to have, and what could you skip? You might find that you can keep the traditions that matter most to you while letting go of the ones that are more about going through the motions.

Then, divide and conquer: maybe you take the lead on the traditions that matter most to you (with his support but not his active participation in every detail), and he takes the lead on keeping things manageable and stress-free. You could also alternate years—one year you go all out, the next year you keep it simpler. Or create new traditions that are meaningful to both of you rather than trying to replicate exactly what you each grew up with. The goal isn't to convince him that your way is better, or vice versa—it's to create holiday experiences that feel good for both of you. If you find you can't agree on anything, consider seeing a couples therapist to work through this, because holiday stress that repeats every year can really damage a relationship over time.

QUESTION: My wife comes from a large, close-knit family, while I come from a much smaller family. Sometimes it seems like I have lived "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." But movie references aside, this has resulted in cultural adaptations for both of us. Geography also shapes our interactions with our respective families, especially around the holidays. Her family is mostly local. The majority of them live within an hour driving radius. By contrast, my family is very spread out. By "spread out", I mean that I need to get on a plane to see three of my four immediate family members. And there's no destination I can go to where I will be within 200 miles of more than one of my immediate family members. As you can imagine, this means that we spend most holidays with her family. It just makes logistical sense, especially because traveling over the holidays is such a nightmare. But at the same time, I feel that this is a bit inequitable. I grew up assuming that my wife and I would alternate families to visit for the holidays, as a lot of people do. For instance, we see her family for Thanksgiving, I see hers for Christmas, then do it the reverse the following year. But the distance makes this impractical. I also have limited time off from work, and we like to travel outside of the holidays for leisure purposes as well. How can we pay heed to logistical realities while also making things more equitable?

ANSWER: Short of a couple or more of your family members moving, there isn't really a way to do it without working around the geography. There are a great many families that can't simply do the one-side-for-Thanksgiving/other-for-Christmas pattern that you mentioned. For instance, some relatives have limited mobility. Some relatives have much larger houses to support family gatherings than others. And as in your situation, geography is often a major factor. So I'd say the first step for you would be to step back from the script that you've been trying to follow and recognize the diversity of experiences out there. There's no one-size-fits-all model for the holidays.

Now come the actual logistical suggestions. You may not see your family as often as you see hers, but there are still some ways to work out compromises. For instance, maybe travel every other year to see a long-distance relative around Christmas, since Christmas tends to be a little bit better than Thanksgiving for travel. You can cut down on outside-of-holidays travel on the years that you go to see your relatives. Or you can invent your own traditions. For example, you could have an early Christmas at one of your relatives' houses and hope that other family members fly in as well. This avoids the worst holiday travel and also gives you yet another celebration to look forward to. You could do the same for Thanksgiving. I have experienced both of these things, and the celebration feels just as festive as if it were on the official calendar day. These situations are always challenging, but they are definitely workable. It's also important to keep perspective: compared to financial issues, disparate philosophies on child-rearing, and many other hard problems, this is a breeze. So go enjoy your Festivus or your Pre-Christmas. I'm sure that they will be just as wonderful and memorable as the traditional holidays.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. He's a great guy in many ways, but he spends almost all his free time playing video games. When we're together, he's often on his computer gaming, and when I try to plan activities, he'd rather stay home and play. I've tried to be understanding because I know gaming is his hobby and how he relaxes, but I'm starting to feel like I'm competing with his games for attention. I've mentioned it a few times, and he'll play less for a day or two, but then he's right back to it. I don't want to be the girlfriend who tries to change him, but I also don't want to be in a relationship where I feel like an afterthought. How do I address this?

ANSWER: This isn't about you trying to change him—it's about whether your needs for connection and quality time are being met in the relationship. Gaming can be a legitimate hobby and stress reliever, but when it takes up so much time that your partner feels neglected, it becomes a problem. The fact that he plays less for a day or two after you mention it suggests he knows it's an issue, but he's not making a lasting change.

Have a direct conversation when you're both calm: "I know gaming is important to you and how you relax, and I don't want to take that away from you. But I'm feeling like we don't spend much quality time together, and when we do, you're often gaming. I'd like us to have some dedicated time together where we're both fully present—maybe a few evenings a week, or a regular date night. Can we agree on that?" Be specific about what you need: maybe it's two evenings a week that are phone-and-computer-free, or maybe it's that when you're doing something together, he's not gaming. If he's resistant or dismissive of your feelings, that tells you something about his priorities. A partner who cares about you will want to make sure your needs are met, even if it means adjusting their gaming schedule. If he can't or won't make room for you in his life, then you have to decide if this is the relationship you want.

QUESTION: I'm a 37-year-old man, and I live with my long-term partner. No kids. My brother and I are not close. He lives just a 3-hour drive away, and we routinely make drives longer than that for various reasons, but we only see him maybe once every couple of years. And this includes Christmases and Thanksgivings. We are not actively hostile. We get along relatively well, and we have a few things in common. But we really are at the level of at most casual friends. I have co-workers who I'm closer to than my brother. I want to reconcile with him, but I really don't know how. You have any strategies for trying to connect with a semi-estranged but not hostile sibling?

ANSWER: It's hard to know exactly what advice to provide, given the limited context I have here. For instance:
- What are the reasons for the estrangement?
- Was there a fierce sibling rivalry growing up?
- Was there competition over grades or even over a person?
- Or did you or him do something negative to the other as children?

The general advice on family estrangement is that it's heavily context-specific. In the most extreme cases, such as abuse, the right and reasonable course of action is to cut off contact to the extent possible. But it doesn't sound from your letter like this is the case. In less extreme situations, it really depends a lot on the reasons for the estrangement and knowing the other person, how you think they would react. In these less extreme situations, it's usually a good idea to reach out directly to the person and try to clear the air. This doesn't necessarily need to involve a tell-all or a play-by-play recounting of what happened in the past between you. It could just be something along the lines of: "Hey [Brother], I'm sure you've noticed we don't talk very often and I'd like to change that. I value you as a sibling and love you and hope that we can have a good relationship. What do you think about that?" 

That conveys that you've taken the initiative to try to improve the situation, and that then puts the ball in his court. Ultimately, it will depend on how he responds as to whether or not you two can have a closer relationship. You will have done your part by starting the conversation just mentioned. Another thing I would suggest is to try to meet him at his place rather than the reverse. You can make that 3-hour drive as an additional gesture of your goodwill. Obviously with some advance notice, however. Good luck.

QUESTION: My wife and I have been married for five years, and we have very different approaches to health and wellness. I'm into fitness—I work out regularly, watch what I eat, and try to stay active. She's more laid-back about it and doesn't share my interest in exercise or healthy eating. I've tried to encourage her to join me at the gym or cook healthy meals together, but she always declines. She says I'm being judgmental and that she's happy with her body and lifestyle. I'm worried about her long-term health, but I also don't want to be the nagging spouse. How do I balance my concern for her health with respecting her autonomy?

ANSWER: This is a delicate situation because health concerns can feel like judgment, even when they come from a place of love. The key is to separate your concern from your desire to control her choices. You can't make someone care about fitness or healthy eating, and trying to will only create resentment. Start by examining your own motivations: are you genuinely worried about her health, or are you uncomfortable with the lifestyle difference? Both are valid, but they require different approaches.

If it's truly about health, focus on shared activities rather than fitness goals: "Would you like to go for a walk together after dinner?" or "I'm making a healthy dinner tonight—want to join me?" Frame it as spending time together, not as improving her health. If she continues to decline, accept that. You can also model healthy behaviors without commenting on hers—continue your own fitness routine and healthy eating without making it about her. If you're concerned about specific health issues, you might suggest she talk to her doctor during her annual checkup, but frame it as routine care rather than a critique of her lifestyle. Ultimately, her body and her health choices are hers to make. Your job as her partner is to support her, not to manage her health. If the lifestyle difference is a deal-breaker for you, that's something to be honest about, but you can't change her—you can only decide if you can accept her as she is.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for three years, and we're talking about moving in together. The issue is pets. I have two cats that I've had for years, and they're like family to me. My partner is allergic to cats and doesn't really like them anyway. They've suggested I rehome my cats before we move in together, but I can't imagine giving them up. My partner says it's not fair to expect them to live with animals they're allergic to and don't want, but I feel like asking me to give up my pets is asking me to give up part of my family. How do we resolve this?

ANSWER: This is a fundamental incompatibility that needs to be addressed before you move in together. Your partner is right that it's not fair to expect them to live with animals they're allergic to, but you're also right that asking you to rehome pets you've had for years is a significant ask. The question is whether there's a compromise that works for both of you, or whether this is a deal-breaker.

First, explore the allergy issue: has your partner tried allergy medication or immunotherapy? Some people can manage cat allergies with medication, though it's not a guarantee. If the allergy is severe and can't be managed, then you're looking at a choice: either you keep your cats and don't live together (at least not in the same space), or you rehome the cats. But before you make that decision, you need to be honest with yourself about what you can live with. If rehoming your cats would cause you lasting resentment, then that's not a viable solution—it will poison your relationship. You might need to consider whether you're compatible for cohabitation right now. Some couples make it work by living separately, or by waiting until circumstances change (like the cats passing away naturally, though that's obviously not something to rush). The key is to have an honest conversation about what each of you can and can't accept, and to make a decision based on that, not on pressure or guilt.

QUESTION: My girlfriend and I have been dating for about eight months. Things are going well, but there's one issue: she's always late. Not just a few minutes—we're talking 30 minutes to an hour late to everything. Dates, meeting up with friends, even important events. When I bring it up, she says she's just not a punctual person and that I need to be more flexible. But I feel like her chronic lateness shows she doesn't respect my time or our plans. I've tried adjusting—showing up later myself, or giving her earlier times—but it's starting to really bother me. Am I being too rigid, or is this a legitimate concern?

ANSWER: You're not being too rigid—chronic lateness is a legitimate concern, especially when it's this extreme. Being 30 minutes to an hour late regularly suggests either poor time management, a lack of respect for other people's time, or possibly an underlying issue like ADHD or anxiety. The fact that she dismisses your concerns and tells you to "be more flexible" rather than acknowledging the problem is also concerning.

Have a direct conversation: "I know you're not a punctual person, but when you're consistently 30 minutes to an hour late, it makes me feel like our time together isn't important to you. I'm happy to be flexible with a few minutes here and there, but this feels different. Can we talk about what's making it hard for you to be on time?" Try to understand the root cause—is it poor planning, difficulty estimating time, or something else? If she's willing to work on it, you can brainstorm solutions together: maybe she sets alarms, builds in buffer time, or you agree on consequences (like if she's more than 15 minutes late, you'll go ahead without her). But if she continues to dismiss your feelings and refuses to make any effort to change, that tells you something about how she values your time and your relationship. Punctuality might seem like a small thing, but it's often a proxy for respect and consideration. You deserve a partner who values your time as much as their own.

QUESTION: My husband and I have been married for six years, and we have a good relationship overall. But there's one recurring issue: he has several close female friends, and he spends a lot of time with them one-on-one—grabbing coffee, going to movies, that kind of thing. I trust him and I don't think he's cheating, but it still makes me uncomfortable. When I've mentioned it, he says I'm being insecure and that he shouldn't have to give up his friendships just because he's married. I don't want him to give up his friendships, but I also feel like there should be some boundaries around opposite-sex friendships when you're in a committed relationship. Am I being unreasonable?

ANSWER: You're not being unreasonable—this is a common issue in relationships, and different couples have different comfort levels around opposite-sex friendships. The key is finding boundaries that work for both of you, not just one person's comfort level. Your husband dismissing your feelings as "insecurity" isn't helpful—your discomfort is valid, even if he doesn't share it.

Have a conversation that focuses on what would make you feel more comfortable rather than asking him to end friendships: "I trust you, and I don't want you to lose your friends. But the one-on-one time with your female friends makes me uncomfortable. Could we talk about some boundaries that would work for both of us?" Maybe that means group hangouts are fine, but one-on-one dinners feel too intimate. Or maybe it means you get to know these friends better so they feel less like strangers. Or maybe it means certain activities are off-limits (like late-night hangouts or weekend trips). The goal is to find a middle ground where he can maintain his friendships while you feel secure in your relationship.

If he's completely unwilling to consider any boundaries and continues to dismiss your feelings, that's a bigger issue. A healthy partnership requires both people to consider each other's comfort levels, even if they don't fully understand them. Your feelings matter, and a good partner will want to address them rather than just telling you to get over it.

QUESTION: I've been in a serious relationship for a few years now. Things have been going really well between us. I mean, we have our issues like every couple, but overall, things are great. I love him, he loves me, we both love each other's families. The problem is that he's expressed interest in opening up the relationship. I'm not enthused about the idea. Although I don't consider myself particularly religious or traditional, I do think that intimate relationships should be one-on-one. No judgment towards anybody else, but that's how I want my own life to be. He says that he wants to explore other people outside the relationship but remain committed to me. He cited several examples of our friends who have done it and he emphasizes that I would always remain his primary partner. He also said that I can meet any and all of his other partners and that he would be above board about everything. I have no reason to think that he's seeing anyone behind my back. He's always been an honest person. But I don't really feel comfortable with an open relationship. I've expressed this, but he keeps bringing it up. Is there hope for us?

ANSWER: Polyamorous relationships are becoming more and more common these days. I think you have the right approach by being non-judgmental, but also by knowing what you want personally. Since he has mentioned it multiple times even though you've expressed not wanting to pursue this, this seems like a fundamental incompatibility issue. How exactly does he respond when you tell him that you're not interested? Is it dismissive, or does it seem sincere? Polyamory is something that both relationship partners have to sign off on. And in fact, not just sign off on, but be committed to. In spite of common misconceptions, polyamory takes just as much commitment as a traditional monogamous relationship, and in some ways even more, since it's incumbent upon each partner to inform their original partner of everyone else they're sleeping with, plus get STD tests and do other due diligence. And there are always concerns about developing an emotional connection with a secondary partner that outweighs that with a primary partner.

The fundamental question is whether you want a polyamorous relationship or you want to keep your current partner. It appears that you can't have both. I would have one more conversation with him in which you are crystal clear that you love him and you want to stay with him, but polyamory just isn't for you. Tell him that if he really wants a polyamorous relationship, that it won't work out between you two. Ask him point-blank if he wants to go ahead with polyamory or if he wants to remain with you. Emphasize that he can't have both--in a loving way, of course, not in a way that sounds like an ultimatum. I know that even broaching the subject of a breakup can be very painful in a relationship as committed as yours seems to be. But better to determine that now rather than later. Good luck.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for two years, and we're both in our mid-30s. We have a good relationship, but there's one thing that's been bothering me: they talk about their exes a lot. Not in a "I miss them" way, but just bringing them up in conversation—comparing things I do to things their ex did, telling stories about their past relationships, that kind of thing. When I've mentioned that it makes me uncomfortable, they say I'm being insecure and that their past is part of who they are. I understand that, but I also feel like constantly bringing up exes is disrespectful to our relationship. Am I overreacting?

ANSWER: You're not overreacting—constantly bringing up exes in a current relationship can feel like you're being compared or that your partner isn't fully present with you. While it's true that past relationships are part of someone's history, there's a difference between occasionally referencing the past and making it a regular topic of conversation. The fact that your partner dismisses your feelings as "insecurity" is also problematic—your discomfort is valid, regardless of their intent.

Have a conversation that focuses on how their behavior makes you feel: "I understand that your past relationships are part of your history, and I'm not asking you to pretend they never happened. But when you frequently bring up your exes or compare me to them, it makes me feel like I'm being measured against your past relationships rather than appreciated for who I am. Can we talk about ways to share your past that feel less like comparisons?" You might find that the issue is less about mentioning exes at all and more about how they're being mentioned—maybe stories about exes are fine, but comparisons aren't. Or maybe you both agree that exes come up less frequently in general conversation.

If your partner continues to dismiss your feelings and refuses to make any changes, that's a red flag. A good partner will want to make you feel valued and secure, even if they don't fully understand why something bothers you. Your feelings matter, and they deserve to be taken seriously, not brushed off as insecurity.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been together for a year, and things are mostly good. But there's one issue: we have very different comfort levels with public displays of affection. I'm someone who likes to hold hands, give quick kisses, put my arm around my partner when we're out. He's much more reserved and says he's not comfortable with PDA—he'll hold my hand sometimes, but that's about it. When I try to be affectionate in public, he pulls away or seems embarrassed. I feel rejected, and he feels pressured. We've talked about it, but we can't seem to find a middle ground. How do we navigate this?

ANSWER: This is a common issue, and both of your comfort levels are valid. The key is finding a compromise that respects both of your boundaries rather than one person having to completely accommodate the other. Start by having a conversation about what specifically makes each of you uncomfortable: is it any physical contact in public, or are certain things okay (like holding hands) while others aren't (like kissing)? Understanding the specifics can help you find a middle ground.

Then, try to meet in the middle: maybe you agree that holding hands and brief hugs are okay, but more intimate displays of affection are saved for private. Or maybe you have certain contexts where PDA is more acceptable (like at a party with friends) versus others where it's not (like in a professional setting or around family). The goal is to find a level of affection that you're both comfortable with, not to convince him to be more affectionate or you to be less affectionate.

It's also worth considering whether this is a symptom of a larger issue: does he show affection in private? Does he make you feel loved and valued in other ways? If the only issue is public affection and you're both happy with your private relationship, then this might just be a difference in comfort levels that you can work around. But if he's also reserved in private or if you're feeling generally unloved or rejected, then this might be a sign of a deeper incompatibility that needs to be addressed.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been living together for a few months, and I am surprised by how unsteady I feel about something that seems so basic. I grew up in a household where the day ended with everything more or less reset. Dishes washed, surfaces cleared, laundry in a basket. He is used to doing the bulk of tidying on the weekends, and during the week he tends to leave little piles and unfinished chores around until he feels like tackling them. None of this is catastrophic, but I find myself getting tense and short-tempered by Wednesday, and when I try to bring it up he gets defensive and says I am trying to control how he lives in his own home. I don’t want this to turn into a recurring fight, but I also don’t want to quietly shoulder the discomfort. How do we talk about this in a way that gets us somewhere?

ANSWER: Start by reframing the conversation so it isn’t about who is “right” about housekeeping. This is really about what both of you need in order to relax in a shared space. Try approaching it with a tone of curiosity rather than frustration. For example, you might say: “I’ve noticed I feel unsettled when things build up during the week. I want to understand what helps you feel comfortable at home too, so we can find a rhythm that works for both of us.”

Once you’ve shifted the tone, move toward specifics. General pleas like “keep the place cleaner” are hard to act on. Instead, identify a few concrete habits that would make the biggest difference for you. Maybe it’s agreeing that dishes don’t sit overnight, or that laundry at least gets gathered into one spot instead of sprawling between rooms. You’re not asking him to change his personality, just to co-create a baseline that respects both of your thresholds.

After you both agree on a plan, revisit it in a couple of weeks. Not as a scolding session, but as a check-in where you assess what’s working and what needs adjusting. This turns the whole issue into an ongoing collaborative effort rather than a clash of standards. Shared homes evolve. The goal is to build a structure that allows each of you to breathe.

QUESTION: I'm 28 years old (female), and my boyfriend is 33. We get along well and he's a great guy, loves me, loves my dog, wants kids, is usually pretty low maintenance. The problem is, well, I suppose a common one. It's a new time and in many cases, women are working and earning more than men. We are a textbook example of this. Although in our case, I am the only one earning anything at all! I just finished grad school last year and I have a really good, promising job in the finance industry. Nothing like those Wolf of Wall Street financiers but still a good, sustainable job. My boyfriend, by contrast, has always been a bit of a dreamer. He dropped out of college once, then finished a couple years later after volunteering in several cities in America and earning very little money. I met him during his second college stint when I was finishing up college myself. We had a period of long distance but long story short, decided it was worth it, stuck out the long distance, and then started living together after he was able to move back to our town. He also got a master's degree somewhere along the way but isn't using it. He says he wants to change the world and has big plans to end world hunger and to improve global education.

Part of the reason why I fell in love with him was that idealism. But honestly, the situation is starting to become untenable. As I mentioned, he doesn't work right now. He's in a volunteer gig and he sometimes picks up shifts as an Uber driver. But that's hardly what he went to grad school to do. When I urge him to help pay at least a respectable portion of the rent, he keeps talking to me about how his dreams are so important and how so many people in third-world countries are living so much worse than us. So you shouldn't be complaining. I get and understand that there are lots of people who have it worse off than us. But that's still no excuse in my view for what he's doing. As I alluded to earlier, I'm interested in starting a family soon, but can't imagine doing it with him until he does a 180 with his life. And when I have mentioned kids around him, he seems at best ambivalent. What should I do? Stay or go?

ANSWER: I think you've probably answered your own question. You tell me that you've talked to him about the problem, but he blows you off talking about his big dreams. And it seems like he's been like this for some time based on your letter. So, honestly, your lifestyles and what you want in the future just aren't compatible. You have a promising career. He seems to just want to follow his dreams by not working. And you've said that he "seems at best ambivalent" about having children, which you say is one of your big goals. And at 28, you're probably aware that you won't have forever to make this happen. 

You've invested a number of years in this man, and I have no doubt that there's lots of love between you. Any breakup would be devastating, but would breaking up with him be any more devastating than foregoing your wish to have children in order to accommodate someone who has had years to start to build a gainful career but apparently hasn't done so? And even with your well-paying job, I imagine that the stress of having to support him, as well as yourself, is starting to get to you. My younger sister had a boyfriend much like him. Sweet guy, really loved her, great with her dog. But he just wouldn't get his life together. He was working a dead-end theater job and he made no efforts to try to better his situation, either by going back to school or by looking for another job. My sister made the heartbreaking but necessary decision to end it with him. It looks like you are in a quite similar situation. So unless there is something big that you haven't told me about in this letter that would change this situation (such as a large inheritance from his rich uncle), I would urge you to likewise end this relationship and look for someone who is going to pull his weight in the relationship, and eventually as a father, whether or not this conforms with glamorous ideas of dreams. I know it's always very hurtful to end a relationship, but I think that you, as my sister did, will look back on this breakup and realize that although it hurt, you did the right thing for both of you.

QUESTION: My younger sister has taken up this strange new habit of commenting on my appearance every time we see each other. It’s always framed as concern about my health or “just trying to be honest,” but the comments land hard and linger with me for days. I’ve already tried gently telling her that these remarks don’t feel supportive, yet she insists she’s doing it out of love and that I’m being overly sensitive. I’m starting to dread family gatherings because I never know what she’ll say next. She isn’t trying to be cruel, but the pattern is wearing me down. How do I set a boundary she will actually respect?

ANSWER: Since the softer approach didn’t shift her behavior, you need to set a boundary that is both clear and firm. The key is to remove the debate entirely. Instead of explaining why her comments hurt or asking her to see them differently, state the limit as a simple fact: “I’m not discussing my body or my weight with you. If you bring it up again, I will end the conversation and step away.”

Deliver it calmly and without extra justification. You’re not asking for her approval. You’re naming your boundary.

Then, and this is the hard part, you must follow through. The moment she crosses the line, end the interaction immediately. No flustered explanations, no arguing, no trying to convince her that you’re reasonable. Just a short “I’m going to step away now,” and do it.

This isn’t about punishing her. It’s about teaching her, through consistent action, that certain topics are not up for discussion. Some people only take boundaries seriously when there is a predictable consequence. Holding that line may feel uncomfortable at first, but it is often the only way to shift ingrained patterns in a family dynamic. You’re allowed to protect your well-being.

QUESTION: My fiancé has a lifelong best friend who has always been part of our social circle, but lately I leave gatherings feeling deflated. The friend has a habit of making jokes at my expense. None of them are hateful or crude, but they’re pointed enough that I feel more scrutinized than included. When I mentioned this to my fiancé, he brushed it off as “just his sense of humor” and said not to take it personally. The problem is that I do take it personally, because I’m the one absorbing it. I don’t want to ask him to choose sides, but I also don’t want to spend the rest of my life avoiding someone who matters to him. How can I bring this up in a way that makes him understand the emotional reality without making it a fight?

ANSWER: Focus on describing the impact rather than diagnosing the friend’s behavior. Instead of saying “he’s rude” or “he targets me,” try something like: “I know he’s important to you. I just leave these hangouts feeling drained and a bit singled out, and I want to talk about how we can make those situations feel less lopsided.”

This invites your fiancé into the problem with you rather than casting him as the gatekeeper for his friend. After that, shift toward what support would look like. Maybe you’d feel more comfortable if your fiancé stepped in when the friend’s jokes start piling up, or if he changed the subject instead of letting the moment linger. You’re not asking him to confront his friend dramatically. You’re asking him to help shape the tone of group interactions so you feel more grounded and respected.

If he struggles to respond, explore what’s underneath that. Sometimes partners minimize these things because they feel caught between loyalty and discomfort. Naming that tension gently can help him see that you’re not attacking the friendship, but trying to create a dynamic where you don’t bear the brunt of someone else’s humor.

This is solvable if both of you stay oriented toward the shared goal: making social time feel welcoming for everyone involved.

QUESTION: One of my coworkers is very friendly and has made a point of inviting me to various after-work activities. I’ve turned down the invitations every time, partly because I’m introverted and partly because I like keeping a clear line between my work life and my personal time. He never gets pushy or inappropriate, but he is persistent. Even after several polite no’s, he keeps asking as though I might suddenly change my mind. I don’t want to embarrass him or make things awkward at work, but I also don’t want to spend the rest of the year repeating myself. How can I shut this down kindly but firmly?

ANSWER: When polite refusals don’t work, it usually means the other person is interpreting them as circumstantial rather than categorical. To fix that, you need to give him a clear and unambiguous statement that leaves no room for hope. Something like: “I appreciate the invitation, but I don’t do social events outside of work. That’s a personal boundary for me, and it’s not going to change. I just want to be upfront so you don’t feel like you need to keep asking.”

This removes the ambiguity and gives him a way to save face. He didn’t misread your signals. He simply didn’t have the full information.

If he slips and invites you again, keep your response short and steady: “As I mentioned before, I don’t do after-work hangouts.” No apologies, no elaboration. Reducing the emotional padding in these moments actually makes it easier for him to adjust because the message is consistent.

Handled this way, the work relationship doesn’t need to suffer. Most people appreciate clarity once they have it, even if it wasn’t the answer they hoped for.

QUESTION: My girlfriend has started asking to look through my texts when she feels insecure, and it caught me off guard. Nothing in our relationship has changed, and I’ve never given her any reason to suspect I’m hiding something. She says it helps her feel less anxious, but to me it feels like crossing a line. I don’t want to dismiss her feelings, because I know insecurity can be painful, but I also don’t want our relationship to drift into a place where privacy gets treated like a luxury instead of a basic norm. How do I talk about this in a way that doesn’t make her feel worse while still holding my ground?

ANSWER: Begin by separating her emotions from her request. You can validate her feelings without agreeing to the solution she’s proposing. Try something like: “I can see you’re feeling unsettled, and I want to understand what’s going on for you. But I’m not comfortable sharing my private messages, because trust can’t grow in an environment where we monitor each other.”

This approach affirms her emotional reality but draws a firm line around your privacy. Then shift toward what would actually help her feel steadier. Ask what’s driving the insecurity: fear of abandonment, past experiences with dishonesty, uncertainty about the relationship’s future. These questions can open a deeper conversation that moves both of you away from the surface issue of the phone and into the underlying emotional terrain.

If the pressure continues, consider suggesting couples counseling. Persistent anxiety often points to patterns that neither partner alone can resolve. A counselor can help her articulate fears she may not fully understand herself, and it can give both of you a structured space to rebuild trust in a healthier way. The goal isn’t to manage her insecurity by sacrificing your own boundaries. It’s to help the relationship grow in a direction where neither of you has to choose between honesty and dignity.

QUESTION: My wife comes from a large, close-knit family, while I come from a much smaller family. Sometimes it seems like I have lived "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." But movie references aside, this has resulted in cultural adaptations for both of us. Geography also shapes our interactions with our respective families, especially around the holidays. Her family is mostly local. The majority of them live within an hour driving radius. By contrast, my family is very spread out. By "spread out", I mean that I need to get on a plane to see three of my four immediate family members. And there's no destination I can go to where I will be within 200 miles of more than one of my immediate family members. As you can imagine, this means that we spend most holidays with her family. It just makes logistical sense, especially because traveling over the holidays is such a nightmare. But at the same time, I feel that this is a bit inequitable. I grew up assuming that my wife and I would alternate families to visit for the holidays, as a lot of people do. For instance, we see her family for Thanksgiving, I see hers for Christmas, then do it the reverse the following year. But the distance makes this impractical. I also have limited time off from work, and we like to travel outside of the holidays for leisure purposes as well. How can we pay heed to logistical realities while also making things more equitable?

ANSWER: Short of a couple or more of your family members moving, there isn't really a way to do it without working around the geography. There are a great many families that can't simply do the one-side-for-Thanksgiving/other-for-Christmas pattern that you mentioned. For instance, some relatives have limited mobility. Some relatives have much larger houses to support family gatherings than others. And as in your situation, geography is often a major factor. So I'd say the first step for you would be to step back from the script that you've been trying to follow and recognize the diversity of experiences out there. There's no one-size-fits-all model for the holidays.

Now come the actual logistical suggestions. You may not see your family as often as you see hers, but there are still some ways to work out compromises. For instance, maybe travel every other year to see a long-distance relative around Christmas, since Christmas tends to be a little bit better than Thanksgiving for travel. You can cut down on outside-of-holidays travel on the years that you go to see your relatives. Or you can invent your own traditions. For example, you could have an early Christmas at one of your relatives' houses and hope that other family members fly in as well. This avoids the worst holiday travel and also gives you yet another celebration to look forward to. You could do the same for Thanksgiving. I have experienced both of these things, and the celebration feels just as festive as if it were on the official calendar day. These situations are always challenging, but they are definitely workable. It's also important to keep perspective: compared to financial issues, disparate philosophies on child-rearing, and many other hard problems, this is a breeze. So go enjoy your Festivus or your Pre-Christmas. I'm sure that they will be just as wonderful and memorable as the traditional holidays.

QUESTION: My teenage son has been irritable and withdrawn for weeks. He comes home from school, goes straight to his room, and barely speaks to anyone. His grades have slipped, and when I try to check in he insists he’s fine and just wants to be left alone. Part of me wants to push harder because I’m worried something serious is going on. Another part of me remembers what it felt like to be a teenager and how suffocating it was when adults demanded explanations I wasn’t ready to give. I feel stuck between wanting to respect his space and wanting to make sure he’s not silently drowning. How do I show up for him in a way that actually helps?

ANSWER: The key is to create multiple low-pressure avenues for connection. Teenagers often shut down when conversations feel like interrogations, but they will open up in small, sideways ways when the setting feels safe. Try brief check-ins during shared activities: a car ride, cooking dinner, folding laundry. Keep the tone light. Something like, “You seem stressed lately. I’m around if you ever want to talk,” is often more effective than “Tell me what’s going on.”

At the same time, gently monitor the basics: sleep, appetite, school workload, changes in friend groups. Reach out to teachers or counselors if you’re seeing consistent decline. You’re not tattling. You’re gathering context.

If he continues to withdraw or shows signs of depression, bring in a mental health professional. Many teenagers open up more easily to someone who isn’t a parent, and having a neutral adult in the picture can relieve both of you. You’re not abandoning your role by asking for help. You’re broadening the support system so he doesn’t have to navigate a tough period alone.

The balance you’re trying to strike is real, and it’s delicate. But showing steady, non-intrusive care is often exactly what a struggling teenager needs.

QUESTION: I have a close friend who I truly care about, but whenever we spend time together the conversation tilts heavily toward her life and her struggles. I want to be supportive, but there’s almost no room for me to share anything of my own. On the occasions when she does ask, she seems distracted or pivots back to herself within minutes. I leave our hangouts feeling drained rather than connected. I’m not ready to give up on the friendship, but I need the dynamic to feel more mutual. How do I raise this without making her feel attacked?

ANSWER: Approach it from a place of wanting a stronger friendship, not a fairer scoreboard. Try saying something like: “I value our relationship, and I want to feel closer to you. Lately I’ve noticed that when we talk, there isn’t much space for me to share what’s going on in my life. I’d love if our conversations felt a little more balanced.”

This shifts the frame from criticism to aspiration. Then offer a small structural change rather than a personality critique. For example: “Maybe when we meet, we can both start by checking in about our week before diving into other topics.” This makes the adjustment concrete and manageable.

If she responds well, great. If she gets defensive, stay calm and reiterate that you’re speaking from a place of wanting the friendship to thrive. And if nothing changes after that, you’ll have more clarity about the limits of the relationship. Some friendships cannot stretch beyond their established patterns. Knowing that allows you to adjust your expectations and emotional investment accordingly, without resentment.

QUESTION: My partner has a very close relationship with his mother, and I admire how attentive he is to her. But recently our date nights have been interrupted multiple times by long phone calls from her. Even when I try not to react, it disrupts the evening and leaves me feeling like I’m competing for his attention. When I mentioned this gently, he said he doesn’t want to hurt her feelings by telling her to call later. I’m not asking him to choose between us, but I do need our time together to feel like it matters. How can I approach this without sounding like I’m attacking their relationship?

ANSWER: Start by affirming what you appreciate. Something like: “I love how much you care about your mom. I’m not trying to take that away.” Then shift toward describing your emotional experience: “When our date nights get interrupted, it breaks the flow of our time together and leaves me feeling a bit sidelined.”

Once he understands the impact, propose a practical adjustment rather than a sweeping change. For example: “Could we agree that during our planned time together, non-urgent calls wait until afterward? You can let her know you’re out and will call back later.” This frames the boundary as situational, not relational.

If he hesitates, explore the fear beneath it. Often the issue isn’t the mother but his discomfort asserting boundaries in general. Reassure him that healthy relationships—romantic and familial—can withstand small adjustments in communication habits. You’re not asking him to lessen his bond with her. You’re asking him to help protect the quality of the moments you share.

Handled with warmth and clarity, this can strengthen your partnership rather than strain it.

QUESTION: My new roommate is friendly and easy to live with in most ways, but he has developed a habit of borrowing my kitchen tools without asking. Nothing has been lost or broken, but I grew up in a household where you always checked before using someone else’s things, so seeing my utensils scattered around the kitchen makes me tense. He seems to assume everything in the common areas is communal. I don’t want to make a big deal out of this, but I also don’t want the frustration to build. How do I bring this up without creating unnecessary tension?

ANSWER: Bring it up early, casually, and without blame. You might say: “I’ve noticed some of my kitchen tools get used from time to time. I’m totally fine sharing some things, but I prefer to be asked first for the items that are mine. Can we check in before using each other’s stuff?”

Follow this with something constructive. Suggest designating a specific shelf or drawer for communal items that anyone can use without asking. Systems like this prevent confusion and reduce the emotional charge of the conversation.

If he forgets once or twice, remind him gently but consistently. Most people adjust quickly when expectations are clear. And raising it now, before resentment solidifies, will help the household stay comfortable for both of you.

QUESTION: My best friend and I used to talk constantly, but ever since my husband and I had our first child, she’s slowly pulled away. She still responds when I reach out, but her replies are brief and spaced out, and she rarely initiates anymore. I miss her. Part of me worries she feels left behind, and part of me wonders if our lives have just diverged too much for her to know how to stay connected. I don’t want to pressure her or make her feel guilty, but I also don’t want this friendship to fade without at least trying. Should I reach out again or give her space?

ANSWER: A gentle, open-ended invitation is the best step. Something like: “I miss you and would love to catch up whenever you have the bandwidth. I know life gets hectic, so no pressure at all.” This lets her know the door is open without implying she has done something wrong.

If she responds and wants to reconnect, great. If her distance continues, it may reflect her own transitions, insecurities, or emotional bandwidth rather than a rejection of you. Friendships often enter quiet seasons when major life changes happen on one side. Giving her space after making your interest clear allows her to return when she’s ready, without feeling cornered.

The key is to hold the friendship lightly. You’re signaling care, not demanding closeness. And you’re allowing both of you the room to grow into the next version of the relationship, whatever shape that takes.

QUESTION: My husband has a habit of criticizing me when I do something wrong, or when he thinks I do something wrong. This behavior has unfortunately been escalating over the past few months. It started even before our wedding. For instance, he would remark upon my having chosen the "wrong" dress rather than telling a white lie that he liked the dress. Also, he would say things like, "You must be so glad you found me given how you were living before." Like most people in love, I brushed off these red flags, thinking that he would change after the wedding. But alas, things only got worse from there. Now that we've been married several years and have two kids, he started insulting me in front of the kids. He also tries to make me believe things that I know aren't true. For instance, by repeating lies to me, such as accusing me of losing our house keys, when in fact he's the one who misplaced them. They were found in the pocket of his suit jacket, for goodness sake!

My husband is mostly a wonderful man and a good father, and I dread the prospect of becoming a single mother, so I don't want to lose him. I've tried talking with him about the insults, but he always brushes me off. Is there a way that I can address this to salvage the marriage? Or do you think I should look for the exit?

ANSWER: Oh my goodness, you should run and not walk to the exit door. This is a textbook case of emotional and verbal abuse and gaslighting. Your husband insults you even after you've pointed it out and asked him to stop. He tries to get you to believe things that you know aren't true, and thus to undermine your confidence in yourself and your sense of reality, which is the definition of gaslighting. And he's doing it in front of your children. You even say that these are "red flags." This marriage is clearly beyond the point of no return. Rather than trying to change him, you should look for the safest and quickest way out of the marriage, which I know won't be easy.

The good news is that there are resources for domestic violence victims like you to get out safely. The first steps should be to find a time when he's not around and call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233. This service is available in many languages to everyone who needs it. They will help you devise an escape plan. Also, what support network do you have? Do you have a mother or sister or brother or best friend who could help you? Speak to someone who you trust about the situation. Hopefully, they will see the obvious fact that this is domestic abuse and they will rush to help. If not, don't let them convince you that what you're seeing isn't true. Go to somebody else you trust. If you don't have anyone around you who you trust, then find a local women's shelter. They can provide you with a lot of resources. And when the time comes, of course, you'll need to visit an attorney. But your safety comes before everything else. You deserve so much better, and you need to get out now. Good luck to you.

QUESTION: I have been married a few years. My wife and I are mostly open with each other about things. But I have one thing that I haven't told her about. I watch porn. It's always from mainstream sites. Never underage porn. And I never interact with any of the performers directly, a la OnlyFans. I usually do it when I'm sleeping in the other room for various reasons, or sometimes when she goes out for a while. I feel guilty about this, but at the same time, I also feel like it's important to me since our libidos are mismatched. My libido is significantly higher than hers. 

I feel that this is a better solution to the libido problem than actually going out and having an affair, but part of me feels this is still cheating because after all, I am deliberately getting sexually stimulated by other women's bodies. Is this cheating? What's your verdict on this?

ANSWER: the use of sensual materials, when all common sense and ethical guidelines are met, is a question that good people can disagree upon. Some marriages can do well and even thrive when one or both partners use porn, whereas it kills other marriages. I'd start by asking yourself a few questions. First, why haven't you told your wife about this porn use? Is it that you're worried about her reaction? Do you feel ashamed? You did mention that you feel that it feels like a "betrayal." But engage in a thought exercise for a moment: how would you compare the following situations when it comes to whether it's a betrayal of your spouse?
- Watching porn
- Reading an erotic novel
- Masturbating through pure fantasy

Almost all married people masturbate at least sometimes in their marriage. So that fact itself isn't reason to feel bad or like you're betraying your spouse. And I gave you the above list to get you thinking about what really separates porn from these other activities. Not to justify porn but to simply try to isolate your thinking as far as what its role is or should be in your life. I think the biggest issue here though is the secretiveness. You should have a frank conversation with your spouse about this. Mention using these materials and mention your concern about them. Even if they disagree with your use of them, hopefully they will react in a compassionate and loving way. And also look at Bernie Zilbergeld's book, "The New Male Sexuality." He offers a lot of common sense advice on topics like this.

QUESTION: My husband and I usually communicate well, but lately we’ve been getting stuck in the same argument about how we spend our free time. I’m someone who likes to plan outings or small activities on the weekends. He prefers to decompress at home and gets overwhelmed when he feels like the weekend is scheduled. When I bring up wanting to do more together, he hears it as criticism. When he asks for quieter weekends, I hear it as disinterest. We’re not fighting constantly, but we keep circling this mismatch and neither of us feels fully understood. How do we bridge this without either of us feeling steamrolled?

ANSWER: Start by shifting the frame from “How do we solve this?” to “How do we understand each other better?” Because underneath the scheduling conflict is a clash of needs: your desire for shared experiences and his desire for rest. Try approaching the conversation with that lens. For example: “I’m not trying to take away your downtime. I just feel more connected when we have a few planned moments together. Can we talk about how to make space for both?”

Once you’ve established that you’re both trying to meet real needs rather than win an argument, experiment with structure. Maybe you designate one weekend day as low-key and keep one small planned outing on the other. Or you agree on two or three “anchor points” each month so he can anticipate the energy required. You’re not erasing his need for rest or your desire for activity. You’re creating a rhythm you both can breathe in.

Finally, check in periodically about how it’s going. These patterns evolve as stress levels and life demands shift. The goal isn’t perfect balance every week. It’s a sense that both of you matter in the equation.

QUESTION: I’m close with one of my coworkers, but over the past year she has started treating me like her unofficial therapist. She often pulls me aside to vent about her marriage, her kids, her health, and whatever else is weighing on her. I genuinely care about her, but these conversations leave me drained and unfocused, and I’m noticing that I dread running into her because I know I’ll get pulled into another hour-long download. I don’t want to shut her out or make her feel rejected, but I need that boundary between my emotional energy and her crises. How do I communicate this without damaging our work relationship?

ANSWER: Begin by naming your own limits rather than critiquing her behavior. Something like: “I care about you, but I’m realizing I don’t have the emotional bandwidth for deep conversations during the workday. I want to be supportive, but I need to protect my focus and energy.” Keeping the emphasis on your capacity makes it less likely she will interpret it as a personal judgment.

Then offer a clear boundary paired with a kind alternative. You might say: “If you need a quick check-in, I’m here for that. But the longer, heavier conversations are too much for me during the day.” You’re not abandoning the friendship. You’re adjusting the channel through which it flows.

If she tests the boundary, gently redirect: “I wish I had the energy to dive into this right now, but I need to stay focused. Maybe we can talk another time.” Repetition, not justification, is what sets the limit. And remember, a relationship that can only function if you absorb her emotional weight isn’t sustainable. You’re giving the friendship a path forward that doesn’t burn you out.

QUESTION: My boyfriend’s roommate and I have never clicked, but recently he has been making passive-aggressive comments whenever I’m over. Things like jokes about how much time I spend at the apartment or little remarks about “guest privileges.” I try to brush it off, but the tension is starting to affect how comfortable I feel being there. My boyfriend thinks I’m reading too much into it and says his roommate is just quirky, but the atmosphere has definitely shifted. I don’t want to escalate things, but I also don’t want to keep pretending everything is fine. How do I address this with my boyfriend without sounding accusatory?

ANSWER: Start with the emotional truth rather than the behavior itself. Something like: “I’m not trying to vilify your roommate. I just haven’t been feeling very comfortable at the apartment lately, and I want to talk to you about it so we can figure out how to make the space feel welcoming for both of us.” That keeps the focus on your experience instead of forcing him to defend someone.

Then offer concrete examples of moments that made you uncomfortable. Not as ammunition, but as context. This helps him understand that the issue isn’t vague discomfort but a repeatable pattern that’s affecting your sense of belonging.

From there, brainstorm together. Maybe he checks in with his roommate privately. Maybe he gives you a heads-up about nights when the roommate is stressed and less receptive. You’re not demanding that he confront his roommate aggressively. You’re asking him to be a partner in making the shared environment livable for everyone. When framed as a shared challenge instead of a critique, most partners are more willing to hear it.

QUESTION: My older brother has always had a forceful personality, but lately he has started giving me unsolicited advice about every aspect of my life. My job, my finances, my relationship, even how I organize my house. He means well, but the constant commentary makes me feel like I’m being managed rather than supported. If I push back, he gets offended and says he’s only trying to help. I don’t want to damage the relationship, but I can’t keep absorbing this. How do I set a boundary with someone who thinks boundaries are personal attacks?

ANSWER: People who overreach often believe their intentions should override your experience, so start by separating the two. You might say: “I know you want the best for me, but the unsolicited advice is overwhelming. I need to come to you when I want input, not feel like I’m being evaluated all the time.” This honors his intention while making your limit unmistakable.

Then be explicit about what you want going forward. Something like: “Unless I ask for advice, I need you to just listen.” No apologies, no over-explanation. Just clarity.

If he reacts defensively, keep your tone warm but firm: “I’m not questioning your desire to help. I’m asking for space to handle things my own way.” His discomfort does not mean the boundary is wrong. It just means it’s new.

Consistency is the lever here. The first few times he lapses, redirect calmly: “I’m not looking for advice right now.” Over time, even the most well-meaning micromanagers learn that your autonomy is not up for negotiation.

QUESTION: My partner and I recently adopted a dog, and we’re clashing over training styles. I favor consistent structure and routines, and he’s more relaxed and intuitive. The dog is confused, we’re both frustrated, and conversations about it quickly spiral into debates about who understands the dog better. I want us to work as a team, but right now it feels like we’re working against each other. How do we reset and approach this more constructively?

ANSWER: Treat the situation as a shared learning curve rather than a competition. Try saying: “I think we both want the dog to feel secure, but our approaches are different enough that it’s creating mixed signals. Can we look at this as something we’re figuring out together rather than needing to choose one method over the other?”

Then consider bringing in an external reference point. Reading the same book, following a reputable training guide, or attending one or two sessions with a trainer can give both of you common ground. It shifts the dynamic from “my way vs. your way” to “what do the experts suggest, and how do we want to adapt that for our home?”

Finally, agree on a few key principles you’ll both honor, such as consistent commands, predictable routines, or shared expectations around rewards and limits. You don’t have to be identical in every moment. You just need to avoid contradicting each other in ways that confuse the dog. You’re building a household culture, and that takes collaboration more than correctness.

QUESTION: My college-age daughter comes home on breaks and immediately reverts to treating me like a full-time provider. She expects meals, laundry help, rides, and emotional labor on demand. I love her and I’m glad she feels at home here, but I’m exhausted by how quickly my boundaries get erased the moment she walks through the door. When I try to bring it up, she gets defensive and says she’s only home for a short time, so why can’t things just be easy? How do I reset expectations without turning every visit into a standoff?

ANSWER: Start by acknowledging the transition she’s navigating. Coming home often triggers old roles for both parents and young adults. But then name your reality: “I love having you here, and I want this to be a place you can relax. At the same time, I can’t take on every responsibility the way I did when you were younger.”

Be specific about what needs to change. Instead of “I need more help,” try: “If you want laundry done, it needs to be your responsibility,” or “I’m happy to cook some meals, but not every meal.” Concrete expectations reduce the emotional charge.

If she protests, stay calm: “I’m not trying to make your time here stressful. I’m trying to make sure it’s sustainable for both of us.” Give her a little space to adjust; role shifts rarely happen overnight.

Over time, the goal is to build a new adult-to-adult rhythm rather than sliding automatically into parent-child mode. You’re not being harsh. You’re updating the household contract so it respects both of you.

QUESTION: I’m in a close friend group where everyone usually gets along, but two people had a falling-out months ago and the tension is still affecting the whole dynamic. They avoid each other, make pointed remarks, and sometimes try to recruit the rest of us to “their side.” I’m tired of feeling like I’m walking through interpersonal landmines every time we all hang out. I care about both of them, but I don’t want to be a mediator or referee anymore. How can I protect my own peace without alienating either friend?

ANSWER: You don’t need to fix their conflict, but you do need to define your role in it. Start by telling each of them privately, and gently, that you’re stepping out of the middle. Something like: “I care about you, but I can’t be part of conversations that pull me into the conflict with the other person. I want to stay neutral and keep our friendship separate from whatever the two of you are working through.”

Then set a consistent boundary in group settings. If the tension surfaces, redirect or disengage. “Let’s not go there” or “I’m not getting into that” is enough. You’re not scolding them. You’re declining the invitation to be collateral.

If group hangouts continue to feel strained, consider hosting smaller gatherings with different configurations so you’re not constantly managing the fallout. You’re allowed to curate your social life. Caring about people doesn’t require absorbing their unresolved conflicts.

You’re choosing self-preservation, not sides.

QUESTION: My brother and I have always been very competitive. We were raised in a household where academic success was valued above almost everything else. He and I were both very good students, but he was the better one. In particular, I struggled at math. But he always aced his math classes and now has a math PhD as well as one in physics. I have, "only," a single PhD in a non-math related field. Our competition dynamic led to a distant relationship that we have had during our entire adult lives. We're both in our early forties. I want to try to mend the rift, but I'm not sure where to begin. This is complicated by the fact that on the relatively rare occasions that we see each other, the old competitive dynamic emerges again. For instance, recently when we were visiting our mother, we played games such as Trivial Pursuit and Scrabble in which he smoked me. He's never been a jerk or bragged about beating me in things, but I still feel the effects of it. How can we move towards a more productive dynamic?

ANSWER: Sibling rivalries are always hard, and while your relationship is generally cordial, the competitive dynamic from your past complicates it. I admire your willingness to reach out. Start by having an initial conversation with him to break the ice and build a better relationship—in this first conversation, don't mention the competitive dynamic unless it comes up. Just focus on the fact that you've been distant and that you want to be more a part of his life. He should be receptive to that unless he has some sort of secret grudge against you.

Regardless of how he responds, it's important for you to do some work on yourself to question this mentality of competition, ideally with a therapist. Try to understand not just where this idea of competition comes from, but how it affects you now: does it add to your life or take away from it? I would also urge you to cultivate hobbies and interests that don't depend on competition, such as gardening, art, or single-player video games. And stay away from social media, which amplifies the "keeping up with the Joneses" dynamic. With some healthy new hobbies and ways of thinking, you'll be well on your way to better managing this relationship and, equally importantly, your own mental health.

QUESTION: My spouse has a habit of interrupting me in conversations, both at home and when we’re around others. I’ve pointed it out a few times, and he always apologizes, but the pattern keeps repeating. It makes me feel talked over and, honestly, a little invisible. I don’t think he’s doing it intentionally, but the impact is really wearing on me. How do I address this in a way that leads to actual change rather than another temporary apology?

ANSWER: Focus on the pattern rather than each individual moment. Try something like: “I know you’re not trying to interrupt me, but when it happens repeatedly, I feel silenced. I want to talk about how we can make space for both of us in conversations.”

Then propose something practical, specific, and small enough to stick. Maybe he pauses for a beat after you start speaking, or you agree on a cue word you can use in the moment that signals, kindly, that you want to finish your thought. Many people interrupt out of enthusiasm or habit, not disrespect, and small structural reminders help break the loop.

Reinforce progress when you see it. Positive feedback isn’t about coddling him—it’s about marking new neural pathways. And if the pattern persists unchanged, consider exploring why. Is he anxious? Distracted? Unused to slow conversation rhythms? Sometimes understanding the root makes the solution clearer.

The goal isn’t to police his speech. It’s to create conversations where you both feel heard.

QUESTION: My partner and I recently merged our finances, and we’re discovering that we have very different spending habits. I’m frugal and tend to think several months ahead. He’s more spontaneous and comfortable with impulse purchases. Neither of us is reckless, but the mismatch has caused a few tense conversations about what counts as “necessary,” and I can feel resentment creeping in. How do we navigate this without turning every purchase into a referendum on our values?

ANSWER: Start by separating the emotional layer from the logistical one. Spending habits often reflect deeper stories—security, identity, pleasure, scarcity. You might say: “I think our reactions to money come from different places. I’d like to understand yours better, and I want to explain mine so we’re not guessing at each other’s motives.”

Then build a system that contains the differences rather than erases them. That might mean setting a monthly discretionary allowance for each of you—money you can spend without explanation. Or creating a threshold above which you both discuss a purchase beforehand. Clear rules remove the ambiguity that fuels resentment.

Finally, check in regularly. Not about individual purchases, but about how the system feels. You’re not trying to force each other into identical spending styles. You’re trying to build a shared financial culture that gives both of you room to breathe. When you treat it as something you’re designing together, the conversations get easier and the stakes feel lower.

QUESTION: My brother and I have always been very competitive. We were raised in a household where academic success was valued above almost everything else. He and I were both very good students, but he was the better one. In particular, I struggled at math. But he always aced his math classes and now has a math PhD as well as one in physics. I have, "only," a single PhD in a non-math related field. Our competition dynamic led to a distant relationship that we have had during our entire adult lives. We're both in our early forties. I want to try to mend the rift, but I'm not sure where to begin. This is complicated by the fact that on the relatively rare occasions that we see each other, the old competitive dynamic emerges again. For instance, recently when we were visiting our mother, we played games such as Trivial Pursuit and Scrabble in which he smoked me. He's never been a jerk or bragged about beating me in things, but I still feel the effects of it. How can we move towards a more productive dynamic?

ANSWER: Sibling rivalries are always hard, and while your relationship is generally cordial, the competitive dynamic from your past complicates it. I admire your willingness to reach out. Start by having an initial conversation with him to break the ice and build a better relationship—in this first conversation, don't mention the competitive dynamic unless it comes up.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over two years, and we generally communicate well, but there’s one recurring issue I can’t seem to crack. When he gets stressed about work, he completely shuts down emotionally. He doesn’t get angry or lash out. He just becomes quiet, withdrawn, and unreachable. I’ve tried giving him space, and I’ve tried gently checking in, but both approaches leave me feeling shut out. I don’t need him to be cheerful all the time, but I do need some sense of connection during hard weeks. I’m worried that if we don’t figure this out, we’ll drift into a pattern where stress equals distance. How can I help him open up without adding more pressure?

ANSWER: Start by naming the pattern without judgment. Something like: “I’ve noticed that when work gets overwhelming, you tend to pull inward. I want to support you, but I also want us to stay connected during those times. Can we talk about what kind of support actually feels helpful to you?”

This shifts the conversation from “Why are you shutting me out?” to “How do we navigate stress as a team?” Then explore concrete possibilities. Maybe he needs a predictable check-in each evening, or maybe what helps is physical closeness rather than conversation. Sometimes people withdraw not because they don’t trust their partner, but because they never learned what healthy support looks like.

From there, agree on a small shared practice. For example, even if he isn’t ready to talk, he might say, “It’s a hard day, but I love you. I’m just needing quiet.” That one sentence preserves the connection and reassures you that his silence isn’t a rejection.

You’re not trying to change his coping style completely. You’re trying to weave the relationship into it so neither of you feels alone in the process. With patience and clarity, this can become one of the strengths of your partnership rather than a fracture line.

QUESTION: I feel that I'm a walking, breathing cliche. I'm a 54-year-old woman whose similarly-aged husband cheated on me with his 24-year-old secretary. It's really the oldest story on God's green earth. I naively took him at his word when he told me that he was working late on Monday and Wednesday evenings. He told me that he had a big project to finish up, and his boss had laid off his assistant, so he was forced to do two people's jobs. Thus, he had to spend many hours at work outside of the workday to get it all done. 

Imagine my surprise when my best friend told me that she had seen my husband and a much younger woman out at a nice restaurant after working hours while my friend was on a date there! I confronted him, and after initial predictable denials, he confessed. He told me that she made him feel young and wanted. Again, you can find countless examples of this story down to the small details. But now that I'm reeling from this betrayal, I'm wondering whether to stay or to leave him. He has always been a good husband and provider, and I believe him when he told me that he hasn't slept with anybody outside of the marriage except for the secretary. He swore to me that he would change. However, a couple of weeks ago, after we tried to reconcile, my friend once again saw him out with the girlfriend at the same restaurant. (He could have at least been smart about it and gone to a different restaurant with her.) Clearly he hasn't ended things with her. He has many good qualities, but I don't know if I can forgive him for this. Should I stay or should I go?

ANSWER: I'm sorry that you're in this situation. Nobody deserves to be cheated on. Whether to stay or go in the event of an extramarital affair is one of those questions where good, reasonable people can disagree. Some are of the opinion that even one incident of cheating is too much, and that the trust can never be restored. On the other hand, others subscribe to the school of thought of allowing their partners a second or even third chance. Clearly you're at least open to the possibility of taking him back, but given that this betrayal has happened multiple times and that the deceit is continuing after his assurances that it wouldn't, I would be hesitant about taking him back.

If you haven't already, find a good therapist to discuss this question with. Try to look for larger patterns. For instance, have you been cheated on before and then taken a partner back? What happened then? Your husband told you that he hasn't cheated on you with anyone except for the secretary, but has he engaged in any other dishonest behavior, such as using family money for questionable purposes? Usually when somebody is deceitful or dishonest in one area, they act similarly in other areas. Ultimately, the decision on whether to stay or go is yours, but I would exercise caution regarding his ability to change given what you've experienced thus far. If there were a graveyard for all failed relationships and marriages, probably about half of the headstones would read: "She tried to change him."

QUESTION: My parents divorced years ago, and both have since remarried. I get along with everyone individually, but whenever we plan holiday gatherings, the old tension resurfaces. Even minor logistical decisions—who hosts, what time we eat, how long we stay—turn into silent territorial battles. I end up absorbing everyone’s frustration because I’m the one trying to keep the peace. I’m already dreading the next holiday season. How do I step out of this role without setting off a family blow-up?

ANSWER: First, recognize that you aren’t responsible for managing the emotional history among adults. That burden isn’t yours, even if you’ve carried it for years. Start by naming your limit with kindness: “I love all of you, but I can’t be the coordinator and buffer anymore. I’d like us to make a plan together, and I’ll participate, but I can’t mediate the tensions.”

Then propose a simple structure that shifts responsibility. For example, suggest rotating hosting duties or creating a shared group message where everyone weighs in equally. This prevents the planning from funneling through you.

If someone tries to pull you back into the middle, hold steady: “I’m not taking sides. I’m stepping away from managing this.” You don’t need to justify it. Consistency teaches people that you’re serious.

Finally, give yourself permission to attend gatherings on your own terms. You’re allowed to arrive later, leave earlier, or even skip certain events if the emotional cost gets too high. You’re not abandoning your family. You’re choosing a role that’s sustainable and respectful to your own well-being.

QUESTION: One of my closest friends has started making little digs about my relationship. Things like “Are you sure he’s good enough for you?” or “You could do better if you wanted to.” She frames it as concern, but the comments come out of nowhere and don’t match the reality of my relationship at all. I’ve tried brushing it off, but it’s starting to feel disrespectful. I’m worried if I call her out directly, she’ll accuse me of being defensive or blinded by love. How do I protect my relationship while also preserving the friendship?

ANSWER: Begin by grounding the conversation in appreciation, then move toward clarity. For example: “I know you care about me, and I appreciate that. But some of your comments about my relationship have felt more discouraging than supportive, and I want to talk about that.”

Be specific but calm. Mention one or two examples to illustrate your point without creating a dossier of grievances. Then say what you need: “When I share things about my partner, I’m looking for support, not uncertainty. Can we keep those conversations focused on what I’m actually experiencing rather than hypothetical doubts?”

If she reacts defensively, stay steady: “I’m not questioning your intentions. I’m telling you how the comments land for me.” You’re inviting her to be part of your support system, not pushing her away.

Good friendships adapt. If she values the connection, she’ll recalibrate. If she can’t, that tells you something important about the limits of the relationship.

QUESTION: My teenage nephew has been spending more time with me since his parents’ divorce, and I’m glad to be someone he trusts. But he’s started sharing things that are clearly private—fights between his parents, details about their finances, and harsh criticisms one parent makes about the other. I don’t want to betray his confidence, but I also don’t want to be holding sensitive information that I’m not equipped to manage. How do I support him without becoming a vault for material that isn’t mine to hold?

ANSWER: Start by affirming that he’s allowed to talk about his feelings with you. Then gently distinguish feelings from confidential details. Something like: “I’m here for you, and you can always talk to me about how things at home make you feel. But I don’t want to be the keeper of private information about your parents. That’s a lot for one person to carry, and it doesn’t help you in the long run.”

Redirect the conversation toward his emotional experience rather than the specifics. If he shares something sensitive, you might say: “It sounds like that situation was really stressful. How did it make you feel?” This keeps the focus on him and relieves you from absorbing adult conflicts.

If he reveals something concerning—anything that suggests risk or harm—you may need to loop in a parent or another trusted adult. But for general tension and upheaval, your role is to support his well-being, not to manage the conflict.

You’re giving him a healthier template for emotional communication: sharing what he feels, not carrying what isn’t his to hold.

QUESTION: My girlfriend has a habit of making plans for both of us without asking—dinners with friends, weekend trips, events she thinks I’ll enjoy. She’s very social and means well, but I often find out after the fact that my weekend has been spoken for. When I bring it up, she says I’m being inflexible or antisocial. I don’t want to dampen her enthusiasm, but I need more say in how I spend my time. How do I set a boundary without making her feel shut down?

ANSWER: Frame the issue as a need for collaboration, not constraint. Try: “I appreciate that you want to plan fun things for us, but I need to be part of the decision-making. When plans get made without checking in, I feel like I lose control of my own time.”

Then offer a shared system. For instance: “Can we agree that before either of us commits to something for both of us, we check in first? That way we both get to shape our social life.” This turns the boundary into a joint habit rather than a veto power.

If she accuses you of being antisocial, gently counter: “This isn’t about avoiding people. It’s about wanting agency over my schedule.” Stay steady. Boundaries often feel like criticism to people who are used to setting the pace, but consistency teaches them the difference.

You’re not rejecting her excitement. You’re asking to be an equal partner in how your life together is structured.

QUESTION: My close friend recently started dating someone new, and while I want to be supportive, every interaction I’ve had with his partner has left me uneasy. They dominate conversations, interrupt constantly, and seem dismissive of my friend’s opinions in subtle but persistent ways. My friend seems smitten and hasn’t noticed any of this. I don’t want to rain on his happiness, but I’m worried about the dynamic I’m observing. How do I express concern without sounding judgmental or territorial?

ANSWER: Start with curiosity rather than conclusions. You might say: “I’m glad you’re happy. I’ve noticed a few moments where it seemed like your partner talked over you or dismissed your ideas. I’m not sure if that’s just their style, but I wanted to check in about how you’re feeling in the relationship.”

This approach centers his experience rather than your interpretation. You’re not telling him what to think. You’re inviting him to reflect.

If he brushes it off, don’t push. Early-stage relationships can make people temporarily blind to interpersonal imbalances. Instead, keep the door open: “If anything ever feels off, I’m here.” That way he knows you’re a safe place to land if the dynamic shifts.

If the relationship is healthy, your concern won’t harm it. If it isn’t, your comment might be the seed that helps him notice patterns later. Either way, you’ve spoken with care rather than judgment.

QUESTION: I'm the mother of two kids, a son age 15 and a daughter age 13. My son has expressed a strong interest in being a physician, a goal that I support because he has a genuine love for medicine—he's been interested in it from a very young age and has loved his hospital shadowing experiences. The problem is that he's so focused on school and grades that he isn't doing any extracurriculars. I worry that now that he's in high school, not having extracurriculars will hurt his chances of getting into a good college and eventually medical school, even if he maintains his excellent grades. I don't like the "extracurricular arms race" that high school has become, but I recognize we have to work within the system as it exists. I've repeatedly encouraged him to find an extracurricular he likes, even suggesting the Science Club since science is his favorite subject, but he always says he's focused on schoolwork and that Science Club would be redundant since he already studies science outside of school. I want him to forge his own path, but I also don't want him to make choices that could hurt his chances of getting into medical school or another professional or graduate school. How can I strike a balance between providing sound parental advice and giving him the autonomy he needs to make his own choices?

ANSWER: I agree with you about the extracurricular arms race—it's unfortunate that these activities have become boxes to check rather than enriching experiences, but you're right that we need to work within the system. A good first step is to talk to his guidance counselor (and encourage him to do the same) to understand what extracurricular portfolios look like for recent graduates who got into good colleges; you can also talk to other parents and look at reputable websites (avoid sources like U.S. News and World Report, which exaggerate prestige factors). Being armed with facts helps reduce over-worrying. I would stress that having one or two extracurriculars can be important for college admissions—it's not fair, but that's how the system works. My brother had virtually perfect grades and a 1600 SAT score yet didn't get into Yale, and we think his lack of extracurriculars was a major factor. Does your son have friends in extracurriculars who've had good experiences? Does he have interests outside of science that could be pursued in an extracurricular? Most schools offer many options, and even if his doesn't, there should be something that appeals to his interests. Remind him that these organizations are good ways to make friends and can be enriching beyond just a line on a resume. Good luck—he sounds like a really good kid.

QUESTION: I’ve always been the “responsible one” in my family, and now that my dad’s health is declining, everyone seems to assume I’ll handle all the logistics—doctor appointments, bills, coordinating with caregivers. I love my father and want to help, but I’m burned out and resentful. When I suggest dividing tasks, my siblings say things like “You’re just better at this” or “I don’t know how to do that stuff.” I’m reaching a breaking point. How do I get out of this role without abandoning my dad?

ANSWER: You can support your father without becoming the entire infrastructure around him. Start by stating your limit clearly: “I can’t manage all of Dad’s care by myself. We need to divide responsibilities, even if that means everyone learning something new.”

Then break the tasks into concrete pieces and assign them collaboratively. For example: one sibling handles scheduling, another manages transportation, another deals with insurance. Specificity prevents the vague promises that often leave everything on your shoulders.

If your siblings resist, hold firm: “I’m not stepping away from Dad. I’m stepping away from doing everything.” You may also consider involving a social worker, care coordinator, or professional caregiver if the load remains too heavy. Sometimes an external resource makes reluctant family members take the situation more seriously.

You’re not failing your father by creating a sustainable structure. You’re ensuring that the support he receives isn’t dependent on your exhaustion.

QUESTION: My partner and I argue about chores more than anything else, and it’s wearing us down. We both work full-time, and we both want the house to feel comfortable, but our definitions of “comfortable” are different. He’s fine with a bit of clutter and sees chores as something to tackle when they pile up. I feel unsettled if things aren’t handled quickly. We’ve tried chore charts, weekly check-ins, and even switching tasks, but none of it sticks. How do we get unstuck from this cycle?

ANSWER: Start by shifting from task-based problem-solving to emotional understanding. Try saying: “I think we’ve been focusing on the chores themselves instead of what they represent for us. I’d like to understand why certain things matter to you, and I want to share why they matter to me.”

Often one partner’s urgency comes from anxiety or a need for order, while the other’s slower pace comes from a desire for rest or reduced pressure. Neither is wrong, but the mismatch generates friction.

Once you’ve uncovered the emotional layer, revisit the structure. You might decide that each of you has “priority areas” where your preference leads, or create a short list of non-negotiables that help you feel settled. Another approach is bundling chores into a weekly ritual you do together—music on, quick reset—so the task feels shared rather than assigned.

The goal isn’t perfect symmetry. It’s creating a home that meets both of your needs without turning housekeeping into a referendum on character. Understanding each other reduces the emotional weight, which makes logistical solutions easier to sustain.

QUESTION: I’ve become close friends with someone at work, and the friendship has been great, but lately he’s been leaning on me in ways that feel more intimate than a typical workplace bond. Long messages late at night, venting about loneliness, asking for emotional reassurance. He has a partner, and so do I, and nothing explicitly romantic has happened, but the line feels blurry. I don’t want to lose the friendship, but I also don’t want to compromise boundaries I care about. How can I reset things without making it awkward at work?

ANSWER: Start by reestablishing the frame of the relationship. Try something like: “I value our friendship, but some of our recent conversations have gotten a bit more personal than I’m comfortable with. I want to make sure we keep good boundaries, especially since we both have partners.”

Then set a clear limit about timing and topics. For example: “I’m going to stop responding to late-night messages. Let’s keep our conversations to work hours or lighter topics.” You’re not rejecting him. You’re defining the shape of the connection.

If he reacts with embarrassment or over-apologizes, keep your tone steady: “There’s nothing wrong. I just want our friendship to stay in a place that feels good for both of us.”

Friendships at work can be meaningful, but they also benefit from guardrails. You’re creating them early enough that the relationship can adjust instead of rupture.

QUESTION: I've become very attracted to someone at my school. I'm in my mid-30s, and I am in an intensive vocational school that's co-educational. My cohort ranges in age from early 20s to 50s, although most of us are in the late 20s/early 30s range. I am a guy, and there's a girl in our cohort who is a few years younger than me. She and I are both introverts, and we bonded over this. She has also said that she sees me as handsome, though I need to remind myself that this doesn't necessarily indicate romantic interest. But I feel that our connection is becoming stronger with each conversation. We don't spend a lot of one-on-one time, but we always seem to end up talking to each other in group settings.

Unfortunately, she's engaged. I really want to be respectful of her relationship and not be a homewrecker, but at the same time I feel what I feel. Is there a way forward for us? Should I venture to satisfy my curiosity regarding whether she shares my feelings, or should I keep quiet about this?

ANSWER: While acknowledging the emotional complexities of the situation, I think you've answered your own questions. You want to respect her relationship, you don't want to be a homewrecker, and she's engaged. So that means that no, there's not a way forward for you two romantically, unless she breaks up with her fiancé. And needless to say, if this happens, it can't be because you contributed to it.

People have unrequited romantic feelings all the time, and also requited ones that can't be acted upon in situations such as yours. It's possible she shares your feelings, but it's equally possible she doesn't. And the larger point is that this is a question that needs to remain unanswered. Because, let's say she does share the feelings. Well, then what? There's no way for you two to act on them without breaking ethical rules that we can all agree on. So knowing that she shares these feelings, if she indeed does, would cause you even more torment. 

Continue to engage her as a friend within appropriate boundaries. But as far as romance, approach her with the mentality that romance is off the table and always will be.

QUESTION: My partner has a very different conflict style from mine. When something is bothering him, he wants to think alone for a day or two before talking. When something is bothering me, I need at least some acknowledgment in the moment, even if the full conversation comes later. Recently we had a disagreement, and he went quiet for almost 36 hours. I knew he wasn’t angry, but the silence left me spiraling. He says he’s not avoiding me, he just processes slowly. I don’t want to force him into conversations before he’s ready, but I also can’t handle complete emotional blackout. How do we meet in the middle?

ANSWER: Start by explaining the emotional reality, not the logistics. Something like: “When you go quiet for long stretches, I feel unanchored. I don’t need a full conversation right away, but I do need reassurance that we’re connected and that we’ll talk when you’re ready.”

Then propose a small, predictable bridge between your needs. Maybe he sends a simple check-in: “I need some time, but I’m here and we’ll talk tomorrow.” He’s honoring his processing style without leaving you suspended.

From there, negotiate a timeframe that’s workable for both of you. If he needs a day to think, fine. But complete silence for extended periods leaves the relationship holding all the emotional weight. You’re not asking him to become a different person. You’re asking him to participate in a shared rhythm of care. That’s reasonable, and it’s part of building a sustainable partnership.

QUESTION: My husband and I are facing a dilemma over how to respond to a problem with how his family treats his brother. Both of us have long suspected that my husband's brother is gay. At one point, the brother even came to my husband asking for advice on how to come out of the closet. However, in large part because of their family's attitudes, the brother has never actually come out to them. From time to time, I overhear some of my husband's family, particularly my father-in-law, make offensive and cruel remarks about gay people. I don't know if the father-in-law suspects that one of his sons is gay or not, but regardless, this creates an alienating environment for us and obviously especially for the brother.

Our dilemma is on how to respond to this, if at all. I would like for us, or at least for my husband, to bring this up with his father and to make clear that we don't approve of these cruel remarks. My husband has made it clear that even though he strongly disapproves of the anti-gay remarks, he wants to preserve his relationship with his father and doesn't want to intervene. I tend to feel that since it's his family, he should have more of a say on how to engage with them. But it really hurts to stand by and say nothing while my husband's father creates such an intolerant environment. Do you think that we should just let this go or do you feel that it's worth risking our relationship with his father to try to improve the situation?

ANSWER: What about the brother's opinion of all this? Before confronting his father, why don't you two, or just your husband, approach the brother and gently ask him what he thinks the best course of action is? Given that he seems to be the one most affected by the remarks, his opinion should be given special weight. Only confront the father if the brother is okay with that. You don't want to risk a backlash by confronting the father and then him responding by treating his son even worse. And even though what the father is saying is clearly abhorrent, the son that you suspect is gay might have his own reasons for wanting to preserve his own relationship with his father.

Regardless of whether you choose to confront the father directly, there are more subtle ways that you can send signals of disapproval about the remarks. For instance, you can limit your visits to those particular relatives when the father is around. You can also invite the brother to spend more time with you and your husband separately, apart from his parents. And the next time you happen to overhear a remark, you might consider going the route of asking a question as opposed to direct confrontation. That is, maybe you could ask the father, "If you were gay, how would you feel about other people saying that about you?" I've often found that when dealing with difficult people, asking them respectful but direct critical questions is often a more effective strategy than simply laying down the law and telling them that they're wrong. Although I admit, I'm human too, and often the temptation for the latter is quite strong in that type of situation. But regardless of what approach you take, remember that empathy and compassion should be your guiding lights. Make sure that the brother's needs are first and foremost in whatever solution you decide on.

QUESTION: My dad has always been a bit distant, but lately he’s been calling me almost every day, wanting long conversations about his loneliness, regrets, and fears about aging. I want to be there for him, but the emotional intensity leaves me drained for hours afterward. He doesn’t have many other people to talk to, and I feel guilty when I set limits. How do I stay connected without becoming his only emotional outlet?

ANSWER: Start by naming both truths: you love him, and you have limits. Try something like: “I want to stay close and support you. At the same time, daily deep conversations are more than I can handle. Can we find a rhythm that works for both of us?”

Then suggest alternatives that expand his support network rather than replacing it with absence. Maybe he joins a community group, reconnects with old friends, or sees a therapist who can hold the emotional weight you’re not equipped to carry alone.

You can also shape the calls themselves. Setting a time boundary—“I can talk for 15 minutes tonight”—gives structure without rejection. And introduce lighter topics on purpose. Relationships don’t thrive when every conversation is a crisis download.

You’re not abandoning him. You’re creating a sustainable pattern of connection. That’s more loving than burning out.

QUESTION: My best friend and I have known each other for years, but recently I’ve noticed that she subtly competes with me. If I share good news, she immediately counters with something about her own successes. If I mention a struggle, she finds a way to make hers sound more dramatic. It’s not overt hostility, but it leaves me feeling unseen. I don’t want to accuse her of something she might not even realize she’s doing. How can I address this without turning it into a scorekeeping match?

ANSWER: Focus on the emotional impact rather than the competitive behavior. Something like: “I’ve noticed that when I share things, the conversation shifts quickly away from what I’m saying. I end up feeling a bit overlooked. I want us both to have room to talk and be heard.”

You’re not labeling her as jealous or insecure. You’re naming a dynamic that’s getting in the way of connection. After that, pay attention to her response. If she truly wants a mutual friendship, she’ll adjust once she realizes how her habits land.

If the pattern continues unchanged, you’ll need to recalibrate your expectations for the friendship. Not as punishment, but as recognition. Some relationships are warm and loving but not emotionally reciprocal. Knowing that helps you engage with more clarity and less disappointment.

QUESTION: My partner and I have different approaches to socializing. I enjoy hosting people and creating opportunities to bring our circles together. He prefers one-on-one interactions and finds group gatherings draining. I’ve tried balancing both, but lately I feel like I’m shrinking my social world to fit his preferences. When I bring it up, he says he doesn’t want to hold me back, but he still rarely participates. I don’t want to pressure him, yet I want a life that feels full. How do we navigate this mismatch?

ANSWER: Start by identifying what you actually need. Is it his active participation? Or is it his support for you to host and socialize freely? Once you know that, express it clearly: “I don’t need you at every gathering, but I do need to feel like I’m not choosing between my social life and our relationship.”

From there, propose a shared compromise. Perhaps he joins a few events each month, and the rest you host or attend without him. You’re creating a rhythm that preserves both his energy and your desire for community.

Also, reassure him that opting out isn’t a failure. Many introverts feel guilty for not matching their partner’s social stamina. When you frame it as balance rather than pressure, he may feel freer to participate in ways that genuinely work for him.

You’re not trying to merge personalities. You’re trying to build a life where both styles can breathe.

QUESTION: I work from home, as do many people. As many people have experienced in the work-from-home era, this can be at once liberating and lonely. None of my coworkers are even located in the city where I live, so I can't even meet up with them occasionally for coffee. But I have found a warm and inviting professional group in my area. These folks are passionate about the same things that I am, and I've been frequenting the group's meet-ups. I now even pay for a co-working space so that I can spend time with some of the same people during the workday. The culture and the vibe are great, and have been a huge morale boost in my work life.

The problem is that recently a new person has started to come to these meetups. He's kind on the surface, but after a while, he starts making nasty racist jokes and often speaks in a crude manner. He's borderline misogynist and seems to be a political reactionary. When he comes to the meetups, I try to relocate to another table. I haven't confronted him about the jokes because I don't want to rock the boat and cause an unpleasant situation with this group that I care so much about. But if he keeps coming, I don't know if I can keep coming. It would be heartbreaking to let him ruin my experience, however. How can I preserve my experience while also making it clear that his jokes are not okay?

ANSWER: Unfortunately, as you've discovered, a single person can ruin a dynamic. But by the same token, you have agency too. You said that you don't want to cause an unpleasant situation, but from my reading, you're already in such a situation. And I doubt you're the only one to experience discomfort over this. What I would do is: the next time he comes to your table, don't change tables, at least not before confronting him, if needed, in a polite but firm manner. If he makes one of the racist jokes, you can say something like, "Hey, I think that members of X group would find this offensive." Or, "How would you feel if you were in their shoes?" 

This person or others might very well respond by claiming that they're just joking and that you're being too sensitive. But if this happens, then you can say things like, "I know that different people have different brands of humor, but these jokes are dehumanizing, and I don't find them funny." Or, "These jokes cross a line for me, and I'm not comfortable with that. I want this space to remain a place where everyone feels included and can have a good time. Can you please refrain from making these jokes while I'm around?"

A lot will depend not only on how this person responds but also on how others in the group respond, particularly the leadership. If, after taking your concerns to the person in question, the situation still isn't improving, then you might want to take your concerns to the leadership. But if the leadership brushes it off or justifies the jokes in some way, even by just saying, "Oh, they're just joking around, they're not being serious," then I would reconsider what kind of culture these leaders are creating. I know this group is important to you, but I would wager that your integrity is as well. Life sometimes forces us to make hard choices between our integrity and other things that matter to us. I hope this isn't the case, but unfortunately, this might be one of those situations.

QUESTION: My younger cousin frequently asks me for career advice, which I’m happy to give, but the pattern is becoming draining. He’ll ask for guidance, I’ll spend time talking him through options, and then he’ll do the exact opposite or drop the conversation entirely until the next crisis. I’m starting to feel like a sounding board rather than a mentor. I want him to succeed, but I can’t keep investing energy into conversations he doesn’t act on. How do I help him without becoming a revolving door of advice?

ANSWER: Shift from providing solutions to setting expectations. Try: “I’m happy to be someone you can talk to, but I’ve noticed that we go over the same topics and nothing really changes. I want to make sure my support is actually useful.”

Then ask him what he hopes to get from these conversations. Many people seek reassurance, not guidance, and naming that can reset the dynamic. You might also introduce some structure: “Before we talk, think about one or two options you’re genuinely considering.” This puts responsibility back on him.

If he continues the same pattern, step back gently: “I care about you, but I can’t keep revisiting these decisions when there’s no follow-through. Let me know when you’re ready to take concrete steps, and I’ll be here.” You’re not withdrawing love. You’re withdrawing from a cycle that isn’t serving either of you.

QUESTION: My partner’s sibling has become increasingly intrusive in our lives. They ask detailed questions about our finances, our future plans, even our disagreements. My partner brushes it off as their natural curiosity, but I find it invasive and uncomfortable. I don’t want to come between siblings, but I also don’t want my private life to be community property. How do I set boundaries without creating family drama?

ANSWER: Begin with your partner, not the sibling. Something like: “I know your sibling is important to you, but some of the questions they ask feel too personal to me. I need us to have clearer boundaries about what we share.”

Then propose a united front: certain topics—money, relationship conflicts, future plans—stay between the two of you unless both partners agree to share. By doing this, you're creating healthy boundaries.

If the sibling asks intrusive questions directly, respond with warmth and a gentle redirect: “We’re keeping that just between us for now.” Or, “We haven’t made decisions yet, but we’ll share more when we’re ready.” You’re not accusing. You’re simply declining.

Family systems often resist boundary shifts at first, but consistency softens resistance over time. Good luck.

QUESTION: My close friend recently confided that she feels jealous of some of my achievements, and ever since then, our interactions feel awkward. I appreciated her honesty, but now I worry about sharing anything good for fear of making her feel worse. Meanwhile, she seems embarrassed and avoids deeper conversation. I don’t want either of us walking on eggshells. How do we move past this without minimizing her feelings or burying my own joy?

ANSWER: Acknowledge her vulnerability, then reopen the door to normal connection. Something like: “I really appreciate that you trusted me with those feelings. I want us to be able to celebrate each other without either of us shrinking.”

Then invite a reset. “Can we agree that we’re allowed to have complicated feelings and still show up for each other? I want to keep sharing my life with you, and I want you to feel safe sharing yours with me.”

If she seems uncomfortable, give her some spaciousness. Jealousy often stems from comparison, not malice, and it takes time to recalibrate. Continue being warm, grounded, and consistent. Show her through your behavior that her confession didn’t damage the relationship.

You’re modeling a friendship where honesty isn’t punished. That’s rare, and it can deepen the bond in the long run.

QUESTION: My boss is kind and supportive, but she relies on me emotionally in a way that feels inappropriate for a workplace. She vents about her stress, asks for reassurance, and sometimes uses phrases like “I don’t know what I’d do without you.” I like her and want to maintain a good relationship, but I don’t want to become her emotional anchor. How do I create distance without damaging my standing at work?

ANSWER: Keep the tone warm and professional. You might say: “I appreciate that you trust me, and I want to support the team. At the same time, I need to keep some boundaries so I can focus on my role.”

Then gently redirect the emotional conversations toward appropriate channels. If she begins unloading personal stress, respond with something like: “That sounds overwhelming. Have you talked to HR or someone on the leadership team about getting more support?” This signals care without absorbing responsibility.

If she uses emotionally loaded language—“I don’t know what I’d do without you”—you can deflect with professionalism: “I’m glad I can help, and I’m committed to the work we’re doing.” No deeper reassurance.

You’re not rejecting her. You’re anchoring the relationship back in its intended structure. Boundaries at work protect both career growth and mental health.

QUESTION: My long-distance partner and I communicate well most of the time, but when one of us is having a rough day, the distance feels unbearable. Recently, I shared something vulnerable, and he responded hours later with something kind but brief. I know he wasn’t trying to minimize what I said, but the delayed, surface-level response left me feeling lonely and misunderstood. I don’t want to place unreasonable demands on his time, yet I need more emotional presence during hard moments. How do we find a rhythm that honors both reality and connection?

ANSWER: Focus on the underlying need: reassurance. Tell him: “When I’m having a hard day, even a quick message letting me know you’re with me helps me feel grounded. I don’t need long conversations every time, but I do need to feel connected.”

Then collaborate on a communication pattern that works for both of you. Maybe that means a brief acknowledgment within a reasonable window—“I’m tied up right now, but I’m with you and will respond more later.” These micro-connections keep the emotional thread alive across distance.

Also, clarify what kinds of responses help most. Some people default to problem-solving when what you need is empathy. Teach him your language: “What helps me most in those moments is warmth and presence, not solutions.”

Long-distance relationships hinge on intentionality. You’re not asking for constant availability. You’re asking for predictable signals of care. That’s the foundation that makes the miles feel less heavy.

QUESTION: My daughter just came out to my husband and me. It happened relatively undramatically. We were all sitting around the kitchen table, eating dinner, and she mentioned that she had something to tell us. She said that her friend, who we will call Chloe, is actually her girlfriend, and that she's been pretty sure that she is gay for some time. She's 16. She says that while she's been attracted to other girls aside from Chloe, Chloe is the first one to actually reciprocate. And she says she's never been attracted to any boys.

My husband and I paused for a moment, not out of disapproval, but because we simply didn't know how to respond. Finally, we both said something about how we love her and that she's glad and that we're glad that she has enough trust in us to confide in us about this. Neither my husband nor I are homophobic. We have both long supported gay rights, and we've both been close to people who are gay. My husband even bought a small pride flag for her room. The problem though is how do we go about actually relating to her? While my husband and I are honestly elated that we won't have to deal with any teen pregnancy scares, we're also unsure about how we as straight people can truly relate to her experiences. We know that, when it comes to dating and relationships, gay and straight people have many things in common, more so than what divides them. But being gay in our still substantially homophobic society is an experience that neither my husband and I have ever known firsthand. Do you have any suggestions or resources on how to connect with her on this?

ANSWER: About three-quarters of the battle has already been won. She is very lucky to have such loving and supportive parents. Sadly, many people in her situation don't. When it comes to the question of how to relate to her better, you can start the conversation with what you mentioned to me: that there are many similarities between what people experience in gay relationships and what they experience in straight ones. The giddiness and euphoria of a first love, the experience of heartbreak, rejection, hope, physical and emotional intimacy-- these experiences are universal and don't conform to lines of sexual labels. You can probably relate a great deal to what she's going through if you had a relationship or a crush at her age.

And as far as the experiences that don't overlap between straight and gay people, compassion and proactivity is the name of the game. Reinform your unconditional love and support for her and for her choice of partner, whoever that may be. Be proactive without being overbearing. Initiate some of these conversations and discussions, while also knowing when to hang back. And above all, just be there for her. Gay or straight, teenagers need to have that affirmation from parents. With parents also granting them more autonomy, assuming that their behavior and maturity justify it. And yes, by all means, celebrate that when she goes out with her girlfriend, there's not the risk of a pregnancy involved. And remember that even though she still needs guardrails, as all under-18s do, she's also on the cusp of adulthood and is experiencing a situation that's novel for her. Be there with love, compassion, and common sense, offering advice when needed, but generally leaving her to have her own experiences and make her own mistakes. This is the best way to equip her to navigate not only her current relationship but all the ones that follow.

QUESTION: My friend group has always been playful and sarcastic with each other, but one friend’s jokes about my background have started to sting. They’re not hateful, but they rely on stereotypes I’ve worked hard to distance myself from. When I’ve hinted that the jokes bother me, he says I’m being “too sensitive.” I don’t want to be the humor police, but I also don’t want to keep pretending I'm fine with jokes that hit nerves. How do I address this without isolating myself from the group?

ANSWER: Be direct, specific, and calm. Something like: “I know the intention is to joke around, but the comments about my background don’t feel playful to me. They hit differently, and I want them to stop.”

Avoid debating whether the joke is “offensive enough.” Focus on your personal boundary: “It doesn’t work for me, and that’s enough.”

If he pushes back, stay steady: “I’m not asking you to change who you are. I’m asking for one type of comment to be off limits.” Most friend groups adjust quickly when the line is drawn clearly.

If he continues anyway, respond consistently with a flat, “Not funny,” and disengage. Social cues are powerful teachers. Over time, either the jokes stop or the distance clarifies the relationship.

You’re not policing humor. You’re protecting dignity.

I hope this isn't the case, but unfortunately, this might be one of those situations.

QUESTION: My partner recently told me he is considering a major career shift that would require us to move across the country. He’s excited and says it would be a fresh start, but I’ve built a life I love here. My job is stable, my friends are close, and my family is nearby. When I expressed hesitation, he said I was holding him back from “growing.” I’m not trying to stifle his dreams, but I don’t want to uproot my entire life without feeling like my needs matter too. How do we talk about this without it turning into a contest between ambition and loyalty?

ANSWER: Begin by reframing the conversation so it’s not about whose priority is “bigger,” but about how both needs coexist. You might say: “I want you to pursue what excites you, and I also need you to understand what this move would cost me. Let’s explore this as partners, not opponents.”

Then get concrete. What does he hope to gain from the move? What do you fear losing? Talk about timelines, alternatives, and whether the career shift can happen without an immediate relocation. Many big decisions feel like all-or-nothing when they’re not.

If he interprets hesitation as opposition, reassure him: “I’m not saying no. I’m saying we need a plan that respects us both.” The goal is not to decide instantly, but to map the emotional terrain together. A relationship can survive mismatched desires about geography, but only if both people feel genuinely heard.
You’re not blocking his growth. You’re insisting that your roots matter too.

QUESTION: My younger sister and I used to be close, but ever since she joined a very tight-knit religious community, our relationship has grown strained. She’s kind and still reaches out, but conversations feel scripted, and she gently critiques my choices in ways she never used to. She keeps inviting me to events that feel more like recruitment than connection. I miss who we were to each other, but I also want to respect her path. How do I keep the relationship alive without feeling pressured to participate in a belief system that isn’t mine?

ANSWER: Start by affirming the bond you want to preserve. Something like: “I love you, and I want us to stay close. But I need to be honest: I feel pressured when our conversations center on your community or when invitations sound like recruitment.”

Then set a boundary that protects both of you. “I’m happy to hear about your life, but I’m not comfortable attending events tied to your group. I want to connect as siblings, not as someone evaluating a belief system.”

Expect her to feel awkward at first. When someone’s identity shifts, they often don’t realize how much their communication changes. Be consistent. Redirect gently when conversations slip into persuasion: “I appreciate you sharing, but let’s talk about us.”

You’re not rejecting her faith. You’re shaping a version of the relationship that both of you can inhabit with honesty. The connection can evolve, but only if it’s grounded in mutual respect rather than quiet discomfort.

QUESTION: My best friend recently got back together with her ex-boyfriend, who I know was emotionally abusive to her. She cut off her other best friend for telling her to leave him, and now she's threatening to cut me off too over a trivial political disagreement we had. I'm trying to be a safe presence for her like people advised, but it's getting harder as she keeps ghosting me or being cold and distant. How do I handle this without losing my friend completely, and how do I stop feeling terrible about it?

ANSWER: You can't fix this for her, and you shouldn't try to. Your friend is in a cycle of abuse where she's isolating herself from people who care about her—this is unfortunately common in abusive relationships. The person who's supposed to be her safe place (you) is being pushed away, while the person causing harm is being drawn closer. Your role right now isn't to be a regular friend who gets regular friendship back. It's to be a lifeline that stays available even when she's not using it.

That means: keep reaching out periodically with low-pressure check-ins. Don't expect her to respond, and don't take her distance personally. When she does respond, don't lecture her about the boyfriend—just be present. Say things like, "I'm here whenever you need me, no questions asked." The goal is to make sure she knows you're still there when she's ready to leave. As for feeling terrible about it—that's actually appropriate. It is terrible to watch someone you care about self-destruct. But remember: her choices aren't your fault, and you can't rescue her if she doesn't want to be rescued. You can only keep the door open. In the meantime, make sure you're taking care of yourself. This is emotionally draining work, and you deserve support too. Consider talking to a therapist or joining a support group for friends and family of people in abusive relationships.

QUESTION: I’m part of a small volunteer group, and two members—both strong personalities—have been clashing nonstop. Meetings get derailed, decisions stall, and I often get pulled aside to hear each person’s complaints about the other. I joined to help the community, not referee interpersonal politics. I don’t want to leave the group, but this dynamic is draining. How can I contribute without getting swallowed into their conflict?

ANSWER: You can stay engaged without becoming a pressure valve. Start by setting a boundary with each person privately: “I care about both of you, but I can’t be the middle ground for this conflict. I want to stay focused on the work we’re doing.”

When meetings start to spiral, intervene in a procedural way rather than a personal one. “Let’s bring this back to the agenda” or “We need to table this if we want to finish on time” shifts the focus to the group’s goals instead of anyone’s grievances.

If the conflict is truly stalling progress, suggest bringing in a neutral facilitator or establishing group norms for communication. This transfers responsibility from individuals to the whole group.

You’re not asking them to get along. You’re asking for a functional structure so the mission doesn’t get lost. That’s leadership, not avoidance.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have very different levels of political engagement. I attend rallies, donate, and stay active in local organizing. He supports my involvement but has little interest in participating himself, saying he prefers to “keep politics out of daily life.” Lately I’m feeling a sense of mismatch, like our values align in theory but not in practice. I’m worried that this will become a deeper divide over time. How do I talk about this without sounding self-righteous?

ANSWER: Begin by exploring what each of you means when you talk about values. You might say: “I know we agree on many issues, but civic engagement is a big part of how I live my values. I want to understand how you think about expressing yours.”

Avoid framing involvement as a moral hierarchy. Instead, describe the emotional impact: “When I’m deeply engaged in something meaningful and you’re neutral, I sometimes feel alone. I want to understand where you’re coming from, not judge it.”

From there, look for overlapping ground rather than identical action. Maybe he won’t march in the streets, but he might support you in smaller ways—researching issues, helping with logistics, or simply being a sounding board. Meaningful alignment doesn’t require carbon-copy activism.

The goal isn’t to convert him. It’s to build a shared understanding so your engagement feels like part of the relationship rather than something you do in a separate emotional world.

QUESTION: One of my closest friends has become extremely anxious about her health over the last year. Every small symptom becomes a crisis, and she often texts me in a panic asking for reassurance. I care deeply about her, but I’m not equipped to be her constant source of calm, and the emotional load is wearing me down. I don’t want to dismiss her feelings, but I also can’t keep being her emergency hotline. How do I support her without becoming her coping mechanism?

ANSWER: Start by validating her distress while refusing the role you’ve been placed in. Something like: “I know you’ve been feeling really anxious, and I care about you. But I can’t always be the person you reach out to in moments of panic. It’s more than I can handle.”

Then encourage her to build a broader support system. Suggest professional help gently, not as an ultimatum. “It might help to talk to someone trained to support people through anxiety. I’ll still be here as your friend, but you deserve more tools than I can give.”

When she texts in crisis, shift your responses: shorter, calmer, less solution-oriented. “I’m sorry you’re feeling scared. This sounds like a moment to use your grounding techniques.” You’re guiding her back to herself rather than absorbing her fear.

You’re not abandoning her. You’re refusing to reinforce a pattern that keeps both of you stuck.

QUESTION: My partner and I have different expectations about emotional disclosure. I grew up in a family where we talked openly about fears, insecurities, and hopes. He grew up in a family where vulnerability was rare, and everyone handled things privately. When I share something tender, he listens but rarely reciprocates. I know he feels deeply, but I sometimes feel like I’m talking into a well. How do I invite more emotional openness without trying to reshape him?

ANSWER: Start with curiosity rather than longing. You might say: “When I open up, I sometimes feel like I’m sharing alone. I want to understand how you experience vulnerability and what helps you feel safe opening up.”

For many people, emotional expression is a learned skill, not a natural reflex. Instead of expecting equal disclosure immediately, create small opportunities. Ask low-pressure questions: “What was the best part of your week?” or “What’s something you’re looking forward to?” Celebrate small moments of openness rather than pushing for big revelations.

Also, share why emotional exchange matters to you: “It helps me feel close when I know what’s happening inside your world.” Not as a demand, but as a map of intimacy.

Openness grows slowly. You’re not asking him to become someone he’s not—you’re asking him to meet you in the middle, step by step.

QUESTION: My wife and I are expecting our first child, a daughter. As you might imagine, we're over the moon about being new parents and nurturing and loving this new human. Nevertheless, my wife and I are engaged in a nasty recurring argument over whether to baptize our future daughter. My wife came from a fairly secular family but experienced trauma in her early adulthood, including a sexual assault. She found an on-campus religious community that provided tremendous support to her in her healing. And after college she has continued to attend church in that same denomination. She's been a part of this denomination for about 15 years at this point, and I have nothing against her doing this. Obviously she's an autonomous adult, and we don't have to agree on religion. But in my case, I'm an atheist who had some very bad experiences with religion growing up, including multiple attempts to proselytize me. I also had a friend who was abused by a priest. And so for me, organized religion is the root of much evil with corporate greed being the root of most of the rest.

My wife wants to baptize our daughter in her denomination because she wants to pass on to her child the deep connection that she has to her faith. And also, I suspect, because she feels that on some level being part of this religious community might shield her daughter from the trauma that she went through as a younger woman. But for me, I worry that baptizing our daughter in this religion would essentially brainwash and indoctrinate her. I fear our daughter wanting to marry young and then becoming obedient to her husband due to our church's teachings. The denomination is one of the more conservative ones, and I don't agree with most of their teachings. I want our daughter to be a strong young woman, not a slave to her future husband because of religious brainwashing. Should I just give in and let her get indoctrinated, or should I fight harder for her to not be baptized?

ANSWER: It seems like you're falling into a trap that many religious and secular people both fall into: framing a problem as a strict black-and-white either/or matter. Fundamentally, it seems to me that both you and your wife are coming from a place of love, and your differences are rooted in very different life experiences with religion. I don't know how much you've talked to your wife about this, but if you haven't, I would suggest first having an open and frank discussion with her about religion in general and what it means to each of you. Frame this in a way that respects her beliefs and life experiences while also reminding her that yours are just as valid, and agree to temporarily stay away from the subject of your daughter's potential baptism. This might help you two to get on the same page on religion in general, and not just over the question of baptizing your daughter. 

Then, when you two have found some common ground over religion (even if it is very limited), return to the subject of the baptism. There might be multiple ways to skin this cat that respect both of your viewpoints and beliefs. For instance, might you agree to having the daughter baptized in a more liberal denomination? This might satisfy your wife's wishes for her to be baptized as a Christian without being baptized in the same denomination whose beliefs you find so problematic. This might seem like an unacceptable compromise, but it's worked for a lot of couples. For instance, when I was dating my wife, I was very reluctant to convert to the dominant religion of her family because I found it unpalatable in many ways. But we compromised, and I converted into a more liberal denomination of the faith, which ended up working out fairly well for us. And don't forget to keep in mind the bigger picture of what your daughter herself might eventually want. Hopefully you and your wife would both agree that when your daughter is old enough to do so, she should be the one to determine her future path, be it a religious path or a secular one. So I think it makes sense to expose her to a mixture of religious and secular viewpoints. The exact contours of this will, of course, be up to you and your wife and eventually up to her. But by coming from a place of compassion and love, you will put her in a position to be well-equipped to make her own faith decision when the time comes.

QUESTION: I recently reconnected with an old college friend. At first it was great, but I’ve noticed she subtly belittles my accomplishments. If I mention a work milestone, she’ll point out a flaw or compare it to someone doing “better.” When I confronted her lightly, she laughed it off as “keeping me humble.” I’m torn between wanting to preserve our history and recognizing that the dynamic feels corrosive. How do I address this without getting sucked into defensiveness?

ANSWER: Anchor the conversation in your present needs rather than your shared past. You might say: “I’m glad we’ve reconnected, but some of the comments about my achievements land as dismissive rather than playful. I want us to cheer each other on, not chip away at each other.”

Use “I” statements, not accusations. Then name your boundary: “I’m not comfortable with jokes that undercut what I’m proud of. It’s important to me that we’re able to celebrate each other.”

If she responds with sarcasm or minimization, that’s data, not a dead end. You can reaffirm calmly: “I’m serious about this. I want our friendship to feel supportive.”

If the pattern persists, you may need to limit what you share with her. You’re not punishing her. You’re protecting the part of yourself that deserves celebration rather than subtle abrasion.

QUESTION: My partner’s mother has always been kind, but recently she’s started dropping critical comments about my career—suggesting it’s “not stable,” hinting that I should consider something “more practical.” My partner brushes it off as her being “old-fashioned,” but it’s wearing on me. I don’t want to create a rift in the family, but I also don’t want to sit quietly while someone critiques choices I’m proud of. How can I handle this gracefully?

ANSWER: First, talk to your partner privately. Not to demand confrontation, but to align perspectives. “These comments hurt, and I need you to understand why. I don’t want you to ‘fix’ your mom, but I do need us to approach this as a team.”

Then decide together how to respond. One option is a light boundary in the moment: “I appreciate your concern, but I’m happy with my career path.” Simple, neutral, and firm.

If the comments continue, your partner may need to step in—not with a lecture, but with a gentle redirect: “Mom, we’re not discussing careers today.” Sometimes boundaries land better when they come from the inside of a family system.

Remember that you don’t have to absorb unsolicited evaluations silently. Grace doesn’t mean silence. It means clarity delivered with restraint.

QUESTION: One of my close friends recently began dating someone who has a very different communication style. When the three of us hang out, the partner dominates conversations, interrupts, and sometimes speaks for my friend. My friend doesn’t seem bothered, but I leave feeling strangely protective and uneasy. I don’t want to sound like I’m criticizing their relationship, but I’m struggling with how overshadowed my friend seems. Should I say something?

ANSWER: Start by checking in about how your friend feels rather than presenting your interpretation. “When we all hang out, I notice your partner speaks up a lot. I’m curious how that dynamic feels for you.”

If your friend says they feel fine, don’t argue. Instead, focus on your emotional experience: “I sometimes feel like I don’t hear as much from you, and I miss your voice in the conversation.” That expresses longing, not suspicion.

If the relationship is healthy, your friend may appreciate the observation. If it isn’t, your gentle comment might be an important mirror later. You’re not planting doubt. You’re expressing care and keeping the door open.

Your role isn’t to evaluate their partner. It’s to stay connected to your friend in a way that honors both your honesty and your restraint.

QUESTION: My partner recently lost a close family member, and he’s grieving in a way that feels distant. He doesn’t want to talk, doesn’t want comfort, and spends long stretches alone. I want to be supportive, but every time I try to check in, he withdraws even more. I’m scared of doing the wrong thing, but I’m also scared that giving him space will make me feel sidelined. How do I support someone who doesn’t want support?

ANSWER: Remember that grief has its own tempo. Start by telling him: “I’m here, and I care. I’ll follow your lead, but I need to know how to be close to you right now without overwhelming you.”

Offer choices rather than assumptions. “Would you prefer quiet company, practical help, or space?” For some people, presence without conversation is the deepest comfort. For others, space is necessary before they can re-engage emotionally.

At the same time, name your own need: “I want to respect your way of grieving, but I also need small points of connection so I don’t feel like I’ve disappeared from your world.” That might mean a brief nightly check-in, a shared meal, or simply a sentence acknowledging the bond.

You’re not trying to pull him out of grief. You’re trying to make sure the relationship can bend with the weight of it instead of breaking.

QUESTION: I've become very attracted to someone at my school. I'm in my mid-30s, and I am in an intensive vocational school that's co-educational. My cohort ranges in age from early 20s to 50s, although most of us are in the late 20s/early 30s range. I am a guy, and there's a girl in our cohort who is a few years younger than me. She and I are both introverts, and we bonded over this. She has also said that she sees me as handsome, though I need to remind myself that this doesn't necessarily indicate romantic interest. But I feel that our connection is becoming stronger with each conversation. We don't spend a lot of one-on-one time, but we always seem to end up talking to each other in group settings.

Unfortunately, she's engaged. I really want to be respectful of her relationship and not be a homewrecker, but at the same time I feel what I feel. Is there a way forward for us? Should I venture to satisfy my curiosity regarding whether she shares my feelings, or should I keep quiet about this?

ANSWER: While acknowledging the emotional complexities of the situation, I think you've answered your own questions. You want to respect her relationship, you don't want to be a homewrecker, and she's engaged. So that means that no, there's not a way forward for you two romantically, unless she breaks up with her fiancé. And needless to say, if this happens, it can't be because you contributed to it.

People have unrequited romantic feelings all the time, and also requited ones that can't be acted upon in situations such as yours. It's possible she shares your feelings, but it's equally possible she doesn't. And the larger point is that this is a question that needs to remain unanswered. Because, let's say she does share the feelings. Well, then what? There's no way for you two to act on them without breaking ethical rules that we can all agree on. So knowing that she shares these feelings, if she indeed does, would cause you even more torment. 

Continue to engage her as a friend within appropriate boundaries. But as far as romance, approach her with the mentality that romance is off the table and always will be.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for a few years, and we’ve always talked about wanting kids “someday.” Recently, I’ve felt that desire growing stronger, but when I brought it up more concretely, he hesitated. Not a firm no, but a real uncertainty. He says he needs more time to think about what he wants his life to look like. I don’t want to pressure him into parenthood, but I also don’t want to put my own timeline on hold indefinitely. How do we talk about something this big without turning it into an ultimatum?

ANSWER: Begin by grounding the conversation in openness rather than urgency. Try saying: “I’m feeling a clearer sense of what I want, and I need to understand where you are so we can navigate this together.” This signals that you’re not demanding a decision on the spot.

Then dig into what “uncertainty” means for him. Is he unsure about the timing? His readiness? The idea of parenthood itself? Uncertainty has many shades, and clarity will help both of you understand whether you’re facing hesitation or a deeper ambivalence.

At the same time, articulate your own timeline without apology. You’re not issuing an ultimatum by acknowledging that your desires matter. You’re simply saying: “I can’t stay indefinitely in a holding pattern. I want to explore this with you in a way that respects both of our needs.”

Finally, agree on a structured follow-up—a real check-in a few weeks or months down the line. Big decisions often require reflection, but they also require momentum. You’re not rushing him. You’re creating a shared path forward.

QUESTION: I’ve become close friends with someone in a community group I’m part of, but I’ve noticed that she often retells stories I’ve shared with others as if they’re her own. It’s subtle, but it leaves me feeling oddly erased. When I’ve hinted at it, she laughs and says she “just internalizes things.” I don’t want to accuse her of something she may not be doing intentionally, but the pattern is unsettling. How do I bring this up without sounding possessive over my own experiences?

ANSWER: Focus on how the pattern affects your sense of connection. Something like: “I’ve noticed a few times when stories I shared came up again in conversation, and they were told in a way that made it sound like they happened to you. It left me feeling a little invisible.”

Stay away from labels like “lying” or “copying.” Instead, describe the emotional impact. “Part of friendship for me is feeling seen in my own experiences. When that gets blurred, I feel disconnected.”

If she responds with humor or defensiveness, stay grounded: “I’m not angry. I’m just asking for a little more clarity when we share things, because it matters to me.”

Her response will tell you a lot. People who value mutuality will adjust when they realize the effect of their behavior. Those who don’t may drift into more distant roles in your life—and that’s information, not failure.

QUESTION: My husband’s best friend recently confided in me that he’s struggling with depression, and he begged me not to tell my husband because he “doesn’t want to be a burden.” I care about this person, but I’m not comfortable holding a secret this big—especially since my husband would want to support him. I don’t want to betray his trust, but I also don’t want to shoulder something I’m not qualified to manage. What’s the right way to navigate this?

ANSWER: Begin by validating his feelings. “I’m really glad you trusted me enough to share this.” Then pivot gently toward your boundary: “But I’m not the right person to carry this alone. You deserve support from people who love you, and I can’t hold this in isolation.”

Encourage him to tell your husband directly. Offer support if he wants help framing the conversation. “I think it would be good for you to talk with him. If you want, I can sit with you when you tell him.”

If he still refuses, you may need to prioritize safety over secrecy. Mental health struggles are not casual confidences. You might say: “I’m worried about you, and I can’t keep this from him if it means you won’t get the support you need.”

This isn’t betrayal. It’s responsible care. You’re not exposing him. You’re preventing him from collapsing alone under the weight of something he shouldn’t have to carry in silence.

QUESTION: I’ve been dating someone wonderful for several months, but there’s one issue I can’t ignore. He has a habit of withdrawing physically when he’s stressed—less affectionate, less cuddly, less present. He reassures me that it’s not about me and that he still loves me, but the shift leaves me feeling emotionally adrift. I don’t want to demand affection on command, but I also don’t want to feel like I lose him every time life gets hard. How do we navigate this difference in emotional wiring?

ANSWER: Start by naming the distinction between need and pressure. “I’m not asking you to perform affection. I’m asking for a way to stay connected even during stressful times.”

Then explore what kinds of contact feel sustainable for him when he’s overwhelmed. Maybe he doesn’t want long hugs, but he’s open to holding hands. Maybe he can initiate a quick goodnight kiss even if he doesn’t have energy for longer intimacy. You’re not scripting your relationship—you’re finding anchors.

At the same time, tell him what the withdrawal triggers in you. Not as accusation, but context: “When you pull back physically, I worry I’ve done something wrong. Even small gestures help me stay grounded.”

Physical affection isn’t just warmth—it’s communication. You’re both learning new dialects of the same emotional language. With patience and clarity, you can create a bridge that holds during stress rather than collapsing under it.

QUESTION: My best friend and I have always had a very open relationship, but since she started dating someone new, she shares far less with me. She insists everything is great, but she brushes off invitations to spend time together and rarely responds with the depth she used to. I’m happy she’s in love, but I feel like I’ve lost access to a part of our friendship that meant a lot to me. How do I express this without sounding jealous or demanding?

ANSWER: Begin with vulnerability rather than accusation. “I’m really happy for you, and I love seeing you excited about your relationship. But I’ve been missing our deeper conversations. I feel a little farther away from you than I’d like.”

Make it clear that you’re expressing longing, not entitlement. “I don’t expect the friendship to look exactly the same, but I’d love to find a way to stay close.”

Then offer something concrete: planning a recurring catch-up, suggesting a walk, or setting aside time where the focus isn’t her partner. The goal is not to compete with the relationship but to maintain a place in her emotional world.

If she responds warmly, great. If she bristles, stay grounded. “I’m not asking you to choose. I’m asking to stay connected.” In healthy friendships, that’s not unreasonable—it’s a sign of care.

QUESTION: I've been in a serious relationship for a few years now. Things have been going really well between us. I mean, we have our issues like every couple, but overall, things are great. I love him, he loves me, we both love each other's families. The problem is that he's expressed interest in opening up the relationship. I'm not enthused about the idea. Although I don't consider myself particularly religious or traditional, I do think that intimate relationships should be one-on-one. No judgment towards anybody else, but that's how I want my own life to be. He says that he wants to explore other people outside the relationship but remain committed to me. He cited several examples of our friends who have done it and he emphasizes that I would always remain his primary partner. He also said that I can meet any and all of his other partners and that he would be above board about everything. I have no reason to think that he's seeing anyone behind my back. He's always been an honest person. But I don't really feel comfortable with an open relationship. I've expressed this, but he keeps bringing it up. Is there hope for us?

ANSWER: Polyamorous relationships are becoming more and more common these days. I think you have the right approach by being non-judgmental, but also by knowing what you want personally. Since he has mentioned it multiple times even though you've expressed not wanting to pursue this, this seems like a fundamental incompatibility issue. How exactly does he respond when you tell him that you're not interested? Is it dismissive, or does it seem sincere? Polyamory is something that both relationship partners have to sign off on. And in fact, not just sign off on, but be committed to. In spite of common misconceptions, polyamory takes just as much commitment as a traditional monogamous relationship, and in some ways even more, since it's incumbent upon each partner to inform their original partner of everyone else they're sleeping with, plus get STD tests and do other due diligence. And there are always concerns about developing an emotional connection with a secondary partner that outweighs that with a primary partner.

The fundamental question is whether you want a polyamorous relationship or you want to keep your current partner. It appears that you can't have both. I would have one more conversation with him in which you are crystal clear that you love him and you want to stay with him, but polyamory just isn't for you. Tell him that if he really wants a polyamorous relationship, that it won't work out between you two. Ask him point-blank if he wants to go ahead with polyamory or if he wants to remain with you. Emphasize that he can't have both--in a loving way, of course, not in a way that sounds like an ultimatum. I know that even broaching the subject of a breakup can be very painful in a relationship as committed as yours seems to be. But better to determine that now rather than later. Good luck.

QUESTION: I’m close with my older sister, but she’s been sharing very personal details about my life with extended family members—things I told her in confidence. When I confronted her, she said she was “just trying to help people understand what I’m going through.” I’m hurt and feel exposed, but she doesn’t seem to grasp the breach of trust. How do I rebuild safety with someone who doesn’t seem to understand boundaries?

ANSWER: Start with clarity: “When I share personal things with you, I expect them to stay between us unless I explicitly say otherwise.” Don’t soften it into a suggestion. Frame it as the baseline requirement for trust.

Then explain the emotional impact: “When you share my private information, I feel exposed and misunderstood. It makes me hesitate to open up at all.”

From there, set a forward-looking rule: “If you’re ever unsure whether something is private, assume it is. Ask me first.”

If she minimizes your concern, stay steady: “Intentions aside, the impact is real. I need this boundary respected.”

Rebuilding trust takes time, but consistency helps. If she proves she can hold confidentiality moving forward, the relationship will strengthen. If she can’t, you may need to adjust what you share with her—not out of punishment, but protection.

QUESTION: One of my colleagues regularly takes credit for ideas we develop together. It’s subtle—phrased as “I was thinking…” or “I’ve been considering…”—but it happens often enough that I feel undermined. I don’t want to create hostility on the team, but I also don’t want my work to disappear into someone else’s narrative. How do I assert myself without escalating tension?

ANSWER: Start by seizing gentle opportunities to reinsert your voice. In meetings, try: “Yes, that builds on the idea Sarah and I discussed,” or “When we talked earlier, I suggested…” This isn’t confrontational. It’s factual attribution.

Then have a direct but low-pressure conversation with the colleague: “I’ve noticed that sometimes our shared ideas get presented as solo contributions. It’s important to me that our collaboration is acknowledged. Can we be mindful about sharing credit?”

Most people respond to this if it’s framed around fairness rather than accusation. If the pattern persists, document contributions and bring it to a supervisor—not as a complaint, but as a clarity issue. “I want to ensure our collaborative work is visible.”

You’re not being petty. You’re protecting professional identity, which is a legitimate boundary.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been navigating a relationship where one of us is significantly more introverted. Most of the time we manage fine, but when I need emotional connection, he sometimes retreats because he feels overwhelmed by the intensity of my feelings. I don’t want to overwhelm him, but I also don’t want to suppress my emotional needs. How do we create space for both expression and retreat without making either person feel wrong?

ANSWER: Frame this as a rhythm problem, not a personality flaw. “I know we have different emotional bandwidths. I want to share what I’m feeling without it overwhelming you, and I want you to take space without me feeling shut out. How can we build something that honors both?”

Then negotiate structure. Maybe he agrees to stay present for a defined window—ten minutes of focused listening—after which he can take a breather. Meanwhile, you practice distilling your feelings into clearer, shorter communication so he’s not flooded.

Also, ask him how he wants you to check in: does he prefer advance notice? Physical closeness? A gentle prompt? You’re not reducing your emotional range. You’re shaping it into a form he can actually engage with.

This isn’t about diminishing anyone. It’s about tuning the relationship so both of you can thrive within its emotional architecture.

QUESTION: My long-term friend recently made a major lifestyle change—new diet, new workout routine, new social circle. I’m genuinely happy for her, but she’s become evangelical about it. Every time we hang out, she critiques my habits or pushes me to adopt hers. I’ve tried changing the subject, but she circles back. I’m beginning to dread spending time with her. How do I explain that I support her journey but don’t want to be enrolled in it?

ANSWER: Be straightforward but affirming. “I’m proud of you for making changes that feel good for you, and I want to support you. But I’m not looking to make the same changes, and I need our conversations not to revolve around convincing me.”

Then establish the lane clearly: “I’m happy to cheer you on. I’m not interested in advice about my habits unless I ask for it.”

If she slips, redirect kindly but firmly: “I’m glad this is working for you, but let’s talk about something else.”

Friendships evolve, and part of that evolution is redefining how you show up for each other. You’re not rejecting her progress. You’re protecting the space where the friendship can breathe without turning into a conversion campaign.

QUESTION: I'm on the autism spectrum and my partner is also neurodivergent, albeit in a different way. This has been a source of connection, but also a source of struggle. For example, they frequently express frustration when I'm not reading their social cues in the way that they expect me to. They also get irritated if I leave the room because they're cooking a certain thing, or if I'm focusing on obsessive interest, as we autists are known for. I do try to communicate my needs to them, and they seem receptive to it. But often it seems like we're getting nowhere. Our brains are wired too differently. Any recommendations on how to bridge the gap?

ANSWER: This is a common problem in neurologically mixed relationships. Even with both partners being neurodivergent, being neurodivergent in different ways is often just as challenging as one partner being neurodivergent and the other neurotypical. But you're not alone in this struggle. If you aren't doing it already, I would highly recommend couples counseling. This should help you begin to work through some of these issues. There are many compromises that you can make that would be worthwhile. For instance, your partner agrees not to cook certain food with you around, or you agree to set aside a certain amount of time for them each day so that you don't get sucked into your strong interest as much. The keys are:
1. Compassion
2. Empathy
3. A willingness to listen

There's also a growing body of resources available for couples in your situation. In particular, I would recommend that you both read the book "The Autism Partner Handbook: How to Love an Autistic Person" by Elly Blue, Faith G. Harper, and Joe Biel. It's a quick read and offers a lot of useful suggestions for your situation. Navigating neurodivergence is a challenge, but plenty of other couples have done it. Good luck.

QUESTION: My partner recently disclosed that he’s been feeling lost about his career, and now he wants to explore a totally different field. I want to be supportive, but I’m anxious—this could mean years of retraining, financial instability, and a major shift in our future plans. I don’t want to discourage him, but I also don’t want to ignore the practical impact on our shared life. How do I support his growth without sidelining my own needs?

ANSWER: Begin by validating the courage it takes to consider a big change: “I admire that you’re thinking deeply about your future.” Then shift into partnership mode: “Let’s talk about what this might mean for us, both emotionally and practically.”

Ask questions that clarify the scope: What draws him to the new field? What steps would he need to take? What timeline is realistic? This isn’t interrogation—it’s co-planning.

Also name your own concerns without framing them as obstacles: “I want to make sure we’re honoring both of our needs. Stability matters to me, and I need to understand how this transition would fit into our life.”

Then collaborate on a phased approach—research, shadowing, part-time classes—to test the path before making a full leap. You’re not denying him growth. You’re ensuring that the relationship is woven into the decision rather than left behind.

QUESTION: My partner and I generally communicate well, but when we disagree on something emotional, he becomes overly logical in a way that makes me feel dismissed. For example, if I say I’m hurt by something he did, he’ll explain why my interpretation isn’t correct instead of acknowledging the feeling. I know he’s trying to be helpful, but I end up feeling lonelier after the conversation than before. How do I help him understand that emotional validation isn’t the same as agreeing with me?

ANSWER: Start by naming the pattern gently. “When I share an emotion, and the response I get is an explanation of why I shouldn’t feel that way, I end up feeling more alone. I’m not asking you to admit fault. I’m asking you to meet me emotionally before we analyze anything.”

Then offer a simple template he can practice: reflect the feeling first, then move to discussion. Something like: “I hear that you felt hurt. I didn’t intend that, and I’d like to understand more.” This helps him learn that acknowledging emotion doesn’t equal conceding an argument.

Finally, tell him why this matters. “I’m not looking for intellectual correction. I’m looking for connection.” Many people raised to rely on logic don’t realize how soothing emotional presence can be. You’re teaching him a new skill, not criticizing who he is.

QUESTION: My close friend recently got engaged, and I expected to feel happy, but instead I’m feeling strangely left out. She’s been so absorbed in planning that our usual conversations have disappeared. When I try to bring up anything about my life, she steers back to wedding details. I don’t want to rain on her excitement, but I also miss having a balanced friendship. How do I talk about this without sounding bitter?

ANSWER: Approach it from affection, not deprivation. “I’m really happy for you, and I love seeing how excited you are. At the same time, I miss our conversations about everything else. I’d love to find a way to stay connected beyond wedding planning.”

This frames your longing as relational, not competitive. Then propose something concrete. “Can we carve out some time where we don’t talk about the wedding at all? I miss hearing your thoughts on other parts of life.”

You’re not asking her to shrink her joy. You’re asking her to keep space in the friendship for both of you. Most people can adjust once they understand the emotional cost of an unbalanced dynamic.

QUESTION: My partner’s ex is still part of his friend group, and they see each other at gatherings a few times a month. I’ve met her and she’s perfectly kind, but I can’t shake the feeling of being compared. Nothing specific has happened, but I feel a knot in my stomach every time I know she’ll be around. I don’t want to come across as insecure or controlling, but I also can’t keep pretending this doesn’t bother me. How do I bring this up?

ANSWER: Begin with honesty without accusation: “I know there’s no active issue with your ex, but I feel a little uneasy at gatherings where she’s present. I want to understand this feeling instead of letting it fester.”

Don’t frame it as a demand for him to change his social life. Frame it as a request for support. “I’d like a little extra reassurance at these events, or for us to check in afterward so I don’t get stuck in my own head.”

The goal is not to remove the ex from the equation. It’s to keep the relationship steady while you work through a vulnerable emotion. Jealousy isn’t a flaw—it’s a signal about where you need connection. When you approach it openly, it becomes manageable instead of corrosive.

QUESTION: My wife and I are expecting our first child, a daughter. As you might imagine, we're over the moon about being new parents and nurturing and loving this new human. Nevertheless, my wife and I are engaged in a nasty recurring argument over whether to baptize our future daughter. My wife came from a fairly secular family but experienced trauma in her early adulthood, including a sexual assault. She found an on-campus religious community that provided tremendous support to her in her healing. And after college she has continued to attend church in that same denomination. She's been a part of this denomination for about 15 years at this point, and I have nothing against her doing this. Obviously she's an autonomous adult, and we don't have to agree on religion. But in my case, I'm an atheist who had some very bad experiences with religion growing up, including multiple attempts to proselytize me. I also had a friend who was abused by a priest. And so for me, organized religion is the root of much evil with corporate greed being the root of most of the rest.

My wife wants to baptize our daughter in her denomination because she wants to pass on to her child the deep connection that she has to her faith. And also, I suspect, because she feels that on some level being part of this religious community might shield her daughter from the trauma that she went through as a younger woman. But for me, I worry that baptizing our daughter in this religion would essentially brainwash and indoctrinate her. I fear our daughter wanting to marry young and then becoming obedient to her husband due to our church's teachings. The denomination is one of the more conservative ones, and I don't agree with most of their teachings. I want our daughter to be a strong young woman, not a slave to her future husband because of religious brainwashing. Should I just give in and let her get indoctrinated, or should I fight harder for her to not be baptized?

ANSWER: It seems like you're falling into a trap that many religious and secular people both fall into: framing a problem as a strict black-and-white either/or matter. Fundamentally, it seems to me that both you and your wife are coming from a place of love, and your differences are rooted in very different life experiences with religion. I don't know how much you've talked to your wife about this, but if you haven't, I would suggest first having an open and frank discussion with her about religion in general and what it means to each of you. Frame this in a way that respects her beliefs and life experiences while also reminding her that yours are just as valid, and agree to temporarily stay away from the subject of your daughter's potential baptism. This might help you two to get on the same page on religion in general, and not just over the question of baptizing your daughter. 

Then, when you two have found some common ground over religion (even if it is very limited), return to the subject of the baptism. There might be multiple ways to skin this cat that respect both of your viewpoints and beliefs. For instance, might you agree to having the daughter baptized in a more liberal denomination? This might satisfy your wife's wishes for her to be baptized as a Christian without being baptized in the same denomination whose beliefs you find so problematic. This might seem like an unacceptable compromise, but it's worked for a lot of couples. For instance, when I was dating my wife, I was very reluctant to convert to the dominant religion of her family because I found it unpalatable in many ways. But we compromised, and I converted into a more liberal denomination of the faith, which ended up working out fairly well for us. And don't forget to keep in mind the bigger picture of what your daughter herself might eventually want. Hopefully you and your wife would both agree that when your daughter is old enough to do so, she should be the one to determine her future path, be it a religious path or a secular one. So I think it makes sense to expose her to a mixture of religious and secular viewpoints. The exact contours of this will, of course, be up to you and your wife and eventually up to her. But by coming from a place of compassion and love, you will put her in a position to be well-equipped to make her own faith decision when the time comes.

QUESTION: My younger brother has been talking about switching careers in a way that sounds impulsive. He’s frustrated with his current job and wants to quit immediately to pursue something completely different, but he hasn’t made a plan or saved money. When I express concern, he says I’m not being supportive. I want him to be happy, but I don’t want to cheerlead a decision that could leave him struggling. How do I balance honesty and encouragement?

ANSWER: Focus on process, not judgment. “I’m not against you exploring a new field. I just want to make sure you have a plan that sets you up for success.”

Ask questions that help him think rather than defend: “What’s your financial runway? What steps would let you test this interest before quitting? What skills would you need?” This communicates support while highlighting the gaps.

Then reassure him: “I believe you can make a change, and I want to help you do it thoughtfully.” You’re not shutting him down. You’re refusing to rubber-stamp a leap taken in the dark. That’s real support, even if he doesn’t see it immediately.

She’s unhappy and overwhelmed, and I care about her, but these calls leave me drained and disrupt my sleep. I’ve tried hinting that late nights aren’t good for me, but she hasn’t picked up on it. I’m worried that a direct boundary will make her feel abandoned. How do I handle this?

ANSWER: Start with warmth and clarity: “I care about you and want to support you, but late-night calls don’t work for me. I need to protect my rest.”

Offer alternatives so it doesn’t feel like rejection. “I can talk after work sometimes, or we can text briefly. I just can’t do late-night venting anymore.”

If she calls late anyway, don’t answer. Follow up the next day with consistency: “I was asleep when you called. Let’s talk tomorrow if you want.” Boundaries only work when they’re upheld, and you’re not abandoning her—you’re refusing a pattern that drains you.

QUESTION: I’ve always been close to my aunt, but recently she’s begun relying on me for emotional support in ways that seem disproportionate. She calls frequently to talk about her marriage, her finances, her loneliness. I’m honored she trusts me, but I’m in my twenties and barely managing my own life. I feel guilty for wanting distance. How do I create boundaries without hurting her?

ANSWER: Start by acknowledging the bond: “I love that we’re close, and I want to stay connected.” Then pivot to capacity: “But I can’t be the person who holds all of your heavy emotions. It’s more than I’m able to manage.”

Offer a gentle redirection: “I can listen sometimes, but I can’t be your primary emotional outlet. Have you considered talking to a therapist or someone who can support you more fully?”

You’re not rejecting her. You’re reminding her that closeness doesn’t mean unlimited bandwidth. Boundaries preserve relationships; they don’t end them.

QUESTION: My partner wants to merge our friend groups more, but I'm hesitant. My friendships are built around intimate, one-on-one conversations, while his friends gather in big groups with lots of noise and overlapping conversations. When we combine worlds, I feel lost and disconnected. He worries that my reluctance means I don’t like his friends, which isn’t true. I just feel overwhelmed. How do I explain this without sounding dismissive?

ANSWER: Speak from temperament, not preference. “Your friends are great. I just connect best in calmer, smaller settings. Large groups drain me, even when I’m with people I like.”

Then propose a blended approach: “I’m happy to join some group events, but I’d also love if we could spend time with your friends in smaller gatherings. And I’d like you and I to maintain space for our own separate friend worlds too.”

Connection doesn’t require identical social styles. It requires understanding. When you frame your hesitation as an energy issue rather than a critique, it becomes something you can adapt around, not something to defend.

QUESTION: My best friend recently shared that she’s taking medication for anxiety, and ever since, she’s been reaching out constantly for reassurance. Not about emergencies—just asking if she’s “acting weird,” if I’m “mad at her,” or if she’s “bothering me.” I want to support her, but the constant check-ins are starting to make me anxious myself. How do I help her feel secure without letting reassurance become the foundation of the friendship?

ANSWER: Start by validating the vulnerability: “I’m glad you told me what you’re going through, and I care about you.” Then set a gentle limit: “But constant reassurance isn’t something I can offer. It’s too much for me to hold.”

Encourage her to work with her therapist or doctor on managing reassurance-seeking. “This sounds like something a professional can really help with.”

When she asks for reassurance, shift from soothing to grounding: “It sounds like anxiety talking. What coping tools has your therapist suggested?” This redirects her inward instead of reinforcing the cycle.

You’re supporting her healing—not feeding the part of anxiety that demands constant confirmation.

QUESTION: I'm the mother of two kids, a son age 15 and a daughter age 13. My son has expressed a strong interest in being a physician, a goal that I support because he has a genuine love for medicine—he's been interested in it from a very young age and has loved his hospital shadowing experiences. The problem is that he's so focused on school and grades that he isn't doing any extracurriculars. I worry that now that he's in high school, not having extracurriculars will hurt his chances of getting into a good college and eventually medical school, even if he maintains his excellent grades. I don't like the "extracurricular arms race" that high school has become, but I recognize we have to work within the system as it exists. I've repeatedly encouraged him to find an extracurricular he likes, even suggesting the Science Club since science is his favorite subject, but he always says he's focused on schoolwork and that Science Club would be redundant since he already studies science outside of school. I want him to forge his own path, but I also don't want him to make choices that could hurt his chances of getting into medical school or another professional or graduate school. How can I strike a balance between providing sound parental advice and giving him the autonomy he needs to make his own choices?

ANSWER: I agree with you about the extracurricular arms race—it's unfortunate that these activities have become boxes to check rather than enriching experiences, but you're right that we need to work within the system. A good first step is to talk to his guidance counselor (and encourage him to do the same) to understand what extracurricular portfolios look like for recent graduates who got into good colleges; you can also talk to other parents and look at reputable websites (avoid sources like U.S. News and World Report, which exaggerate prestige factors). Being armed with facts helps reduce over-worrying. I would stress that having one or two extracurriculars can be important for college admissions—it's not fair, but that's how the system works. My brother had virtually perfect grades and a 1600 SAT score yet didn't get into Yale, and we think his lack of extracurriculars was a major factor. Does your son have friends in extracurriculars who've had good experiences? Does he have interests outside of science that could be pursued in an extracurricular? Most schools offer many options, and even if his doesn't, there should be something that appeals to his interests. Remind him that these organizations are good ways to make friends and can be enriching beyond just a line on a resume. Good luck—he sounds like a really good kid.

QUESTION: My partner and I have different approaches to religious traditions. I grew up celebrating holidays with specific rituals that still feel meaningful to me. He didn’t grow up with those traditions and doesn’t feel connected to them. When the holidays come around, he participates politely but without enthusiasm, and I feel oddly lonely celebrating something that matters deeply to me while he seems indifferent. How do we bridge this emotional gap?

ANSWER: Start by sharing the emotional significance: “These traditions are tied to my sense of family and identity. When I celebrate them alone, even with you present, something feels missing.”

Then ask what parts of the rituals he might connect with—not for religious reasons, but relational ones. Maybe he can choose one element to adopt as “ours,” creating meaning through shared intention rather than inherited symbolism.

At the same time, make room for individuality. “I don’t need you to feel what I feel. I just want us to create a way of celebrating that feels participatory rather than polite.”

Blended traditions evolve slowly. You’re not asking him to convert. You’re asking him to co-create a ritual landscape that honors both histories.

QUESTION: My coworker has started making subtle comments that imply I’m not ambitious enough. Things like, “You’re too smart to stay in this role” or “When are you going to start pushing harder?” I’m content where I am, and I don’t appreciate the implication that my pace or goals are inadequate. I don’t want to create tension, but I also don’t want to absorb these comments silently. How do I respond?

ANSWER: Keep it simple and firm. “I appreciate your confidence in me, but I’m happy with my current trajectory. I’ll make changes when I’m ready.”

If the comments continue, escalate slightly: “I know you mean well, but these remarks come across as pressure. I need you to respect that I have my own goals and timeline.”

You’re not obligated to defend your ambition. Contentment is not complacency. It’s clarity. And pushing back respectfully teaches people that their assumptions don’t define your path.

QUESTION: My partner and I recently got into a disagreement about how much time we each spend with our families. I’m very close to mine and see them often. He loves his family too, but prefers fewer visits and more independence. He says he feels stretched thin when our weekends get filled with family obligations, while I feel guilty if I don’t show up regularly. I don’t want him to feel overwhelmed, but I also don’t want to drift away from people who are important to me. How do we reconcile these different expectations?

ANSWER: Start by shifting the conversation away from logistics and toward values. “My family time is about staying connected. Yours is about balance and autonomy. How can we honor both without either of us feeling burdened or neglected?”

Then move to structuring the visits in a way that preserves your relationship’s bandwidth. Maybe some visits are solo for you, some shared, and some optional. You’re not abandoning your family or forcing him into constant togetherness—you’re tailoring involvement in a way that respects both temperaments.

Finally, schedule regular check-ins. Family dynamics evolve, and what works now may need adjustment later. You’re not trying to equalize your engagement; you’re building a rhythm that sustains both connection and breathing room.

QUESTION: My close friend has started minimizing my experiences whenever I share something difficult. If I talk about stress at work, she’ll say she had it worse. If I’m sad about something, she’ll pivot to her own heartbreak. I think she’s trying to relate, but it leaves me feeling erased. I don’t want to accuse her of being self-centered, but I need the friendship to feel reciprocal. How do I bring this up without starting a competition?

ANSWER: Frame it around emotional presence, not comparison. “I value our friendship, and I want us both to feel heard. Lately I’ve noticed that when I share something hard, the conversation shifts quickly to your experiences. I know you’re trying to relate, but it leaves me feeling a bit overlooked.”

Be specific but gentle. Then propose a small adjustment: “When one of us is sharing something heavy, maybe we can take a moment to stay with that person before switching topics.”

This isn’t criticism—it’s a request for deeper connection. If she values the friendship, she’ll adjust. If she can’t, you’ll at least have clarity about the limits of what the relationship can hold.

QUESTION: Like so many others, my teenage daughter is struggling with an eating disorder. In her case, she's lost so many pounds in the last few weeks that she barely resembles her old self. She's obsessed with the idea that she's fat, but in reality, she's dangerously underweight. Making matters worse, my husband seems to not take her situation seriously enough. While I fear for her life if she doesn't get treatment soon, my husband often brushes off the subject when I talk to him about it. He says things like, "Oh, she's just going through a phase," or "Maybe she just doesn't like the food that you cook." I think that my daughter is overhearing this and it might be encouraging her to starve herself even more.

I've always been the non-confrontational type, which I fear has contributed to my daughter getting into the mess that she's in. So I'm not sure really how to confront my husband about this. What do you suggest?

ANSWER: As you noted, this is a life-or-death situation. What I would do is urgently get both your daughter and husband educated on the serious problem of eating disorders, "tout de suite." First, if you haven't already, inform your daughter of the following resources: the 24/7 eating disorder hotline (866-932-1264) and the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD) Helpline (888-375-7767). I would also insist that both your daughter and your husband visit the website of the National Eating Disorders Association, particularly their helpful article "Busting The Myths About Eating Disorders" (https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/busting-myths-about-eating-disorders/). 

The immediate problem, of course, is helping your daughter to get healthy and overcome the disorder, and to learn the skills needed to prevent relapses in the future. This starts with a conversation with her primary care physician and also her therapist, if she has one. But I suspect you're doing most of this already. What you wrote to me about was really a problem of attitudes and education on the part of your husband. In addition to showing him the above-mentioned resources, I would have a serious conversation with him about how his attitudes might be harming his daughter. There is also some underlying sexism and misogyny in his remarks, particularly about what he said about the food that you cook. But educating him on eating disorders is the first priority. Then you can have a longer discussion with him (ideally also with a couples therapist) addressing some of these problematic assumptions that he seems to have about you and about gender roles.

Finally, by all means, whenever your husband makes one of these remarks and there's even the possibility that your daughter could have been around, seek her out at your first opportunity and emphasize to her that what her father said was wrong. Tell her the facts in a calm manner, not to demonize her father but rather to show that his harmful views aren't correct. Facts and sincere affirmation are the best antidotes to misguided and harmful ignorance.

QUESTION: My partner recently joined a new social circle built around a hobby he loves. I’m happy for him, but he’s spending more and more time with this group, often leaving me out because he says I “won’t enjoy it.” I don’t need to participate in everything he does, but I feel sidelined and less integrated into his world. When I bring it up, he insists it’s about convenience, not exclusion. How do I communicate that I’m not trying to intrude, but I do want to feel included in his life?

ANSWER: Begin with the emotional truth: “I’m glad you’ve found a group you enjoy. But I feel disconnected from a part of your life that matters to you, and I want to feel more woven in.”

Then clarify that inclusion doesn’t mean constant participation. “I don’t need to go to every event, but I’d like to meet your friends and feel part of the world you’re excited about.”

Suggest something concrete—joining for occasional gatherings, being introduced, or hearing more stories about them. This isn’t about controlling his time. It’s about strengthening the relational bridge.

Healthy relationships aren’t about merging all hobbies—they’re about ensuring neither partner feels like they’re living in a separate emotional ecosystem.

QUESTION: My older sister tends to dominate group conversations in our family. When I try to speak, she cuts me off or “corrects” my version of events. My parents don’t intervene, and I end up going quiet because the dynamic feels impossible to shift. I’m tired of feeling like a footnote in my own family. How do I assert myself without escalating into a conflict that no one wants to address?

ANSWER: Start with a one-on-one conversation rather than confronting her in the moment. “I love talking with you, but I’ve noticed that when we’re with the family, I sometimes get cut off or overshadowed. It makes me pull back.”

Keep the focus on impact, not blame. Then ask for collaboration: “Can we try making more space for each other to finish our thoughts? It would mean a lot to me.”

During group conversations, you can also hold your ground calmly: “Let me finish my point,” delivered without heat. If she’s receptive, the dynamic will slowly shift. If she isn’t, adjust expectations. Not all families evolve equally, but you can claim space without replicating old roles.

QUESTION: My best friend started seeing a therapist recently, which I’m glad about, but she’s begun using therapy language to analyze my behavior. She’ll say things like “You’re projecting” or “That sounds like an avoidant pattern” when I’m just trying to vent or express frustration. It feels invasive and a little condescending. How do I address this without dismissing her growth?

ANSWER: Start with affirmation and boundary together. “I’m really glad therapy is helping you. But when you use therapeutic terms to analyze me in everyday conversations, it feels more like evaluation than support.”

Be specific: “When I’m sharing something vulnerable, I’m looking for understanding, not diagnosis.”

Then invite collaboration: “I’d love if we could focus on listening to each other rather than interpreting each other. That’s what makes me feel closest.”

Most people don’t realize when they’ve crossed the line from insight to intrusion. Your clarity gives her a way to recalibrate without feeling criticized for seeking help.

QUESTION: A coworker I barely know has begun confiding very personal details about her life to me—family issues, health concerns, financial stress. I’ve tried being polite, but the level of disclosure feels inappropriate for our level of relationship, and it makes me uncomfortable. How do I gently redirect without embarrassing her?

ANSWER: Use warm firmness. “I’m really sorry things are hard for you right now. I want to be respectful, but I’m not the right person to talk about these kinds of personal matters.”

Offer a gentle pivot: “It might help to talk with someone you’re closer to or with a professional who can support you more fully.”

If she continues oversharing, shorten your responses and redirect to neutral topics. You’re not shaming her—just shaping the boundaries of your working relationship.

People often overshare because they’re lonely, not because they lack awareness. Your clarity helps both of you.

QUESTION: I've become very attracted to someone at my school. I'm in my mid-30s, and I am in an intensive vocational school that's co-educational. My cohort ranges in age from early 20s to 50s, although most of us are in the late 20s/early 30s range. I am a guy, and there's a girl in our cohort who is a few years younger than me. She and I are both introverts, and we bonded over this. She has also said that she sees me as handsome, though I need to remind myself that this doesn't necessarily indicate romantic interest. But I feel that our connection is becoming stronger with each conversation. We don't spend a lot of one-on-one time, but we always seem to end up talking to each other in group settings.

Unfortunately, she's engaged. I really want to be respectful of her relationship and not be a homewrecker, but at the same time I feel what I feel. Is there a way forward for us? Should I venture to satisfy my curiosity regarding whether she shares my feelings, or should I keep quiet about this?

ANSWER: While acknowledging the emotional complexities of the situation, I think you've answered your own questions. You want to respect her relationship, you don't want to be a homewrecker, and she's engaged. So that means that no, there's not a way forward for you two romantically, unless she breaks up with her fiancé. And needless to say, if this happens, it can't be because you contributed to it.

People have unrequited romantic feelings all the time, and also requited ones that can't be acted upon in situations such as yours. It's possible she shares your feelings, but it's equally possible she doesn't. And the larger point is that this is a question that needs to remain unanswered. Because, let's say she does share the feelings. Well, then what? There's no way for you two to act on them without breaking ethical rules that we can all agree on. So knowing that she shares these feelings, if she indeed does, would cause you even more torment. 

Continue to engage her as a friend within appropriate boundaries. But as far as romance, approach her with the mentality that romance is off the table and always will be.

QUESTION: I’ve been dating someone wonderful, but I’ve noticed that whenever I try to express a preference—where to eat, what movie to watch, what weekend plans I’d like—he shuts down and insists he’s “fine with anything.” At first it seemed easygoing, but now it feels like he’s afraid to show any desire at all. I don’t want to steamroll him, but it’s exhausting to make every decision. How do I help him feel safe expressing his own wants?

ANSWER: Start by framing this as a desire for intimacy, not efficiency. “It means a lot to me to know what you genuinely enjoy. When you say ‘anything is fine’ every time, I feel like I’m making choices in a vacuum.”

Then ask low-pressure questions with limited options: “Between these two restaurants, which excites you more?” This creates a gentle bridge toward expression.

Also ask what’s underneath the avoidance. Some people fear conflict or disappointing others so deeply that desire feels dangerous. If he can articulate the fear, you can address it together.

The goal isn’t to force preferences out of him. It’s to build a shared space where his desires can emerge without threat.

QUESTION: My younger cousin confided in me that she’s questioning her sexual orientation but is terrified of telling her parents. I feel honored she trusts me, but I’m also scared of giving the wrong guidance. She asked what she “should do,” but I don’t think it’s my place to tell her how to navigate something so sensitive. How do I support her without overstepping?

ANSWER: Start by normalizing her uncertainty. “It’s completely okay to question and explore. You don’t have to have everything figured out right now.”

Then shift the focus from action to agency. “This is your story. You get to choose when, how, and if you share it. No one else can decide that for you.”

Offer practical questions rather than directives: “What would make you feel most safe right now? Who in your life feels supportive? What kind of timeline feels right for you?”

You’re not leading her—you’re walking beside her. That’s the kind of support that actually empowers young people navigating identity.

QUESTION: My partner and I disagree about how much alone time is healthy. I’m someone who needs a fair amount of solitude to reset. He prefers constant togetherness and interprets my need for space as rejection or cooling interest. I’ve tried explaining, but he still feels uneasy when I ask for alone time. I’m worried that if we don’t resolve this, both of us will feel misunderstood. How do we bridge this without pathologizing either temperament?

ANSWER: Begin by reframing alone time as a resource, not a verdict. “When I take time alone, it’s to recharge so I can be more present with you—not because I’m pulling away.”

Then negotiate structure. Maybe you schedule solo time so it doesn’t feel like an emotional surprise. Or maybe you create brief rituals of connection before you separate—five minutes of affection or a short conversation—so his nervous system has something grounding to hold onto.

Also ask what reassurance he needs to feel secure. You’re not shifting your temperament, just adding relational cues that soothe his.

You’re teaching each other how to love across difference, which is one of the core skills of long-term partnership.

QUESTION: I’m in a book club, and one member consistently dominates discussions. She speaks for long stretches, interrupts others, and critiques opinions harshly. No one wants to confront her, but several of us dread meetings because the atmosphere feels suffocating. I don’t want to create tension, but I also don’t want to abandon a group I’ve enjoyed for years. How can we address this constructively?

ANSWER: Approach it as a group norm issue, not a personal flaw. Suggest a gentle structural shift: timed turns for discussion, a rule that no one speaks twice before everyone speaks once, or using a facilitator for each meeting.

If you feel comfortable, you can initiate a conversation outside the meeting: “I love our discussions, but sometimes the pacing makes it hard for quieter voices to be heard. Could we try a structure that gives everyone space?”

If she reacts defensively, keep it grounded in the shared goal: a healthier conversation dynamic. People who dominate often aren’t aware of the impact—they’re filling silence, not trying to silence others. A little structure can transform the atmosphere without scapegoating anyone.

QUESTION: I work from home, as do many people. As many people have experienced in the work-from-home era, this can be at once liberating and lonely. None of my coworkers are even located in the city where I live, so I can't even meet up with them occasionally for coffee. But I have found a warm and inviting professional group in my area. These folks are passionate about the same things that I am, and I've been frequenting the group's meet-ups. I now even pay for a co-working space so that I can spend time with some of the same people during the workday. The culture and the vibe are great, and have been a huge morale boost in my work life.

The problem is that recently a new person has started to come to these meetups. He's kind on the surface, but after a while, he starts making nasty racist jokes and often speaks in a crude manner. He's borderline misogynist and seems to be a political reactionary. When he comes to the meetups, I try to relocate to another table. I haven't confronted him about the jokes because I don't want to rock the boat and cause an unpleasant situation with this group that I care so much about. But if he keeps coming, I don't know if I can keep coming. It would be heartbreaking to let him ruin my experience, however. How can I preserve my experience while also making it clear that his jokes are not okay?

ANSWER: Unfortunately, as you've discovered, a single person can ruin a dynamic. But by the same token, you have agency too. You said that you don't want to cause an unpleasant situation, but from my reading, you're already in such a situation. And I doubt you're the only one to experience discomfort over this. What I would do is: the next time he comes to your table, don't change tables, at least not before confronting him, if needed, in a polite but firm manner. If he makes one of the racist jokes, you can say something like, "Hey, I think that members of X group would find this offensive." Or, "How would you feel if you were in their shoes?" 

This person or others might very well respond by claiming that they're just joking and that you're being too sensitive. But if this happens, then you can say things like, "I know that different people have different brands of humor, but these jokes are dehumanizing, and I don't find them funny." Or, "These jokes cross a line for me, and I'm not comfortable with that. I want this space to remain a place where everyone feels included and can have a good time. Can you please refrain from making these jokes while I'm around?"

A lot will depend not only on how this person responds but also on how others in the group respond, particularly the leadership. If, after taking your concerns to the person in question, the situation still isn't improving, then you might want to take your concerns to the leadership. But if the leadership brushes it off or justifies the jokes in some way, even by just saying, "Oh, they're just joking around, they're not being serious," then I would reconsider what kind of culture these leaders are creating. I know this group is important to you, but I would wager that your integrity is as well. Life sometimes forces us to make hard choices between our integrity and other things that matter to us. I hope this isn't the case, but unfortunately, this might be one of those situations.

QUESTION: My partner recently told me he feels disconnected from the person he used to be. He says work has changed him, adulthood has changed him, and he’s worried that I fell in love with a version of him that no longer exists. I love who he is now, but he keeps pulling away because he doesn’t trust his own consistency. How do I reassure him without becoming the sole source of his identity?

ANSWER: Tell him clearly that you don’t love him for a single fixed version of himself. Tell him, “I didn’t commit to a snapshot of you. I committed to someone who grows and shifts.” Then invite curiosity rather than panic about the changes he feels. Ask what feels different internally, instead of focusing on what he fears you’ll reject. People often withdraw because they believe change makes them unsafe to love. What he needs is reassurance that a relationship is not a preserved artifact but an evolving dynamic built to withstand motion.

At the same time, protect yourself from becoming his identity’s anchor. Say, “I’m here with you, but I can’t be the mirror that tells you who you are.” That boundary isn’t cold; it’s healthy. Encourage him to seek other reflective spaces, such as friends, hobbies, writing, or therapy. Your job isn’t to sculpt him; it’s to walk beside him. Being loved during an internal shift is stabilizing, but being defined by love is not sustainable. You’re offering companionship, not a replacement for self-understanding.

QUESTION: My closest friend just had her first child, and ever since, our relationship feels like it’s fading. She’s exhausted and constantly overwhelmed. I completely understand why, but I also genuinely miss her. When I try to say that, I feel like I’m making her feel guilty. How do I stay connected in a way that respects what she’s going through but doesn’t erase my own needs?

ANSWER: Start by naming both truths at once. Tell her, “I know your life is incredibly full right now, and I don’t expect you to engage the way you did before. I just want you to know that I miss you because you matter to me, not because you’re doing something wrong.” This expresses longing rather than pressure. Then suggest connection formats that fit her capacity—short voice memos instead of phone calls, low-stakes check-ins, or tiny rituals that don’t demand immediate response.

Your goal isn’t to pull her back into the old rhythm; it’s to create a new one small enough to fit into her reality. Early parenthood is chaotic and identity-shifting. You’re not asking for more effort from her; you’re trying to keep the thread between you visible so it doesn’t disappear in the fog. And remember, friendships have seasons. This one is temporary, not a verdict. You stay close by adjusting, not by pretending nothing has changed.

QUESTION: My partner has a habit of agreeing to plans or commitments in the moment, but later he reveals he never wanted to do those things. He says he panics about disappointing people and defaults to yes. I end up feeling misled, and he ends up feeling trapped. How do we break the cycle without turning every simple decision into a negotiation?

ANSWER: The real goal is to make “no” feel emotionally safe. Tell him plainly, “I don’t want you saying yes to spare my feelings. I’d rather hear your real preference at the start.” Remove the idea that disagreement equals conflict. Then shift how you ask questions. Instead of a yes-or-no choice, try “What feels best for you?” or “Which option fits your energy today?” This reframes the conversation as collaboration instead of an evaluation he might fail.

People-pleasing isn’t deception; it’s a survival instinct. He’ll need time to unlearn it. Celebrate the small, honest moments. When he does express a real preference, thank him for trusting you with it. You’re not aiming for perfection. You’re building a relationship where truth has less friction than accommodation.

QUESTION: My father wants to reconnect after decades of emotional distance. Now he’s suddenly sentimental and eager, speaking as if we’ve always been close. I’m open to rebuilding something, but his revisionism makes me furious. I don’t want to reject him, but I refuse to play along with a narrative that erases the pain. How do I move forward?

ANSWER: Start by anchoring yourself in truth rather than his preferred storyline. Tell him, “I’m willing to explore a relationship now, but I can’t do that if we pretend the past didn’t happen.” You’re not demanding confession or dramatic reckoning. You’re asking for reality, which is the minimum requirement for genuine connection. If he tries to bypass that discomfort, it’s often because facing the past feels like facing failure.

Set the pace yourself. You don’t have to match his enthusiasm. You don’t have to hold his emotions or protect him from guilt. If he’s willing to acknowledge even a fraction of what was missing before, that’s enough to start building something new. If he refuses entirely, that tells you he wants comfort, not relationship. Moving forward doesn’t mean agreeing to a beautiful lie; it means choosing a path that doesn’t require self-erasure.

QUESTION: My partner wants to share every detail of his internal experience—every worry, every fleeting insecurity, every doubt. I value emotional openness, but he processes out loud constantly, and I feel like I’ve become his emotional dumping ground. I don’t want to shut him down, but I’m overwhelmed. How do I balance compassion with my own limits?

ANSWER: Begin with affirmation. “I love that you trust me with your feelings.” Then add the boundary with equal gentleness: “But I can’t hold every single thought you have. I need room for my own emotional life too.” Boundaries don’t diminish intimacy; they protect it from overload.

Suggest alternatives to keep the flow intentional rather than constant. Maybe he journals before speaking, or brings you only what still feels important after sitting with it. Maybe certain kinds of processing are saved for a weekly check-in. You’re not asking him to stop sharing. You’re asking him to share in a way that honors both of you. Intimacy isn’t measured by volume. It’s measured by resonance and reciprocity.

QUESTION: I'm 27 and my boyfriend is 30; we've been together for three years and living together for 1.5 years. We get along well and are managing financially, but the problem is with his parents. They're in their late 60s, living on limited income (his father is retired from the military, his mother was a teacher until she quit due to osteoarthritis), but despite their modest pensions, they've made extremely inadvisable financial decisions—luxury cruises, expensive restaurants they can't afford. They're emotionally manipulative, constantly playing on the fact that he's their only child to get him to spend money on them and go into debt. He can't seem to resist, and I think part of it is his sense of duty carried over from when he was in the military—he feels he owes his parents for raising him and wants to give back. They're taking advantage of this. I've tried talking to him about this multiple times, but he always says that his duty to his parents supersedes everything else. I love him and don't want to leave, but I also don't want us to go broke because he can't say no to his parents. Is there any hope left for us?

ANSWER: "He always just says that his duty to his parents supersedes everything else." I think this tells you all that you need to know. I don't doubt that he loves you and that his sense of duty also includes a commitment to you. He sounds like a noble person, but people with a strong sense of duty can be vulnerable to manipulation, as you've seen. In this predicament with his parents, you've asked him multiple times to reconsider his supporting and enabling them, but he isn't responsive to that. And he doesn't seem to respect your input or try to seek any sort of compromise with respect to the money that he spends and the debt that he goes into for them.

This shouldn't remain your problem. You've done your best and made your feelings known to him, but he's ignored them repeatedly. Sadly, I think the best choice that you have is to end the relationship and start over. You don't want to become a second enabler for his parents. Nor do you want his consistent choosing of his parents over you to wreck your own credit and damage your own financial future.

QUESTION: My best friend keeps turning everything into a comparison. If I share something stressful, she says her situation is worse. If I celebrate an achievement, she finds a way to frame her success as bigger. It’s subtle, but it drains me. How do I bring this up without making her feel attacked?

ANSWER: Approach it from the place of wanting closeness. “I love our friendship, and because it matters to me, I want to tell you something honestly.” Then describe the pattern and its impact rather than her intentions. “Lately when I share things, I feel like we slip into comparison instead of connection. I end up feeling unheard, even though I know you’re not trying to do that.”

Make a relational request: “I’d love for us to celebrate and vent without measuring.” Most people who compare compulsively are protecting something fragile in themselves. Your clarity gives her a chance to recognize the pattern without shame. If she’s receptive, the relationship deepens. If not, you can adjust what you choose to share, which is a boundary, not a punishment.

QUESTION: My partner constantly feels like he’s the “less accomplished” one in the relationship. I reassure him often, but he still makes self-critical comparisons and worries he’s not enough. I don’t want to become the manager of his self-esteem. How do I support him without reinforcing the idea that I’m the judge he needs to impress?

ANSWER: Stop trying to out-argue his insecurity. It doesn’t work because the insecurity isn’t rooted in facts. Instead, redirect the conversation to the source of the story he’s carrying. Ask, “What does being accomplished mean to you? Who taught you to measure yourself that way?” When you shift from reassurance to exploration, you move out of the parent-child dynamic.

Then draw the boundary gently. “I love you for reasons that don’t show up on a résumé. But your sense of worth can’t depend on my constant feedback.” Your job is not to overwrite his internal narrative. It’s to anchor the relationship outside the hierarchy he fears. Support doesn’t mean becoming the authority on his value. It means helping him reclaim authorship of his own identity.

QUESTION: My friend is extremely committed to a cause she cares about, but lately every discussion feels like activism. If I express any uncertainty, she treats it as a moral lapse. I support the cause too, but the intensity is exhausting. How do I maintain the friendship without feeling like every conversation is a test?

ANSWER: Shift the focus from ideology to the connection itself. Say, “I care about this cause too, but when every conversation becomes a debate, I feel more evaluated than understood. I want us to be able to talk as friends, not as adversaries.”

Set a conversational boundary without discrediting her passion. “I’m open to discussing this sometimes, but I can’t have it be the only lens we connect through.” A genuine friend will understand the distinction between limiting a topic and rejecting a value. If she interprets your boundary as betrayal, the friendship may need some distance until she can relate in more than one register.

QUESTION: My partner and I disagree about how transparent to be with extended family about our struggles. I prefer privacy, but he feels that honesty builds closeness. I’m increasingly uncomfortable with how much he shares. How do we build a shared boundary that doesn’t feel like silencing him or exposing me?

ANSWER: Start by naming why privacy matters to you—not as secrecy but as emotional safety. “I’m not hiding anything. I just feel more grounded when our vulnerable moments stay between us.” Then ask him what he gets out of being open with family: reassurance? validation? connection? Once you understand the emotional purpose, you can craft alternatives that meet his needs without violating your boundary.

From there, agree on categories of information. Some things are always private. Some can be shared in a general way. Some require explicit check-in. You’re not trying to script him—you’re designing a container for your shared life that neither of you feels unsafe in. Boundaries work best when they’re negotiated, not imposed.

QUESTION: My husband and I are facing a dilemma over how to respond to a problem with how his family treats his brother. Both of us have long suspected that my husband's brother is gay. At one point, the brother even came to my husband asking for advice on how to come out of the closet. However, in large part because of their family's attitudes, the brother has never actually come out to them. From time to time, I overhear some of my husband's family, particularly my father-in-law, make offensive and cruel remarks about gay people. I don't know if the father-in-law suspects that one of his sons is gay or not, but regardless, this creates an alienating environment for us and obviously especially for the brother.

Our dilemma is on how to respond to this, if at all. I would like for us, or at least for my husband, to bring this up with his father and to make clear that we don't approve of these cruel remarks. My husband has made it clear that even though he strongly disapproves of the anti-gay remarks, he wants to preserve his relationship with his father and doesn't want to intervene. I tend to feel that since it's his family, he should have more of a say on how to engage with them. But it really hurts to stand by and say nothing while my husband's father creates such an intolerant environment. Do you think that we should just let this go or do you feel that it's worth risking our relationship with his father to try to improve the situation?

ANSWER: What about the brother's opinion of all this? Before confronting his father, why don't you two, or just your husband, approach the brother and gently ask him what he thinks the best course of action is? Given that he seems to be the one most affected by the remarks, his opinion should be given special weight. Only confront the father if the brother is okay with that. You don't want to risk a backlash by confronting the father and then him responding by treating his son even worse. And even though what the father is saying is clearly abhorrent, the son that you suspect is gay might have his own reasons for wanting to preserve his own relationship with his father.

Regardless of whether you choose to confront the father directly, there are more subtle ways that you can send signals of disapproval about the remarks. For instance, you can limit your visits to those particular relatives when the father is around. You can also invite the brother to spend more time with you and your husband separately, apart from his parents. And the next time you happen to overhear a remark, you might consider going the route of asking a question as opposed to direct confrontation. That is, maybe you could ask the father, "If you were gay, how would you feel about other people saying that about you?" I've often found that when dealing with difficult people, asking them respectful but direct critical questions is often a more effective strategy than simply laying down the law and telling them that they're wrong. Although I admit, I'm human too, and often the temptation for the latter is quite strong in that type of situation. But regardless of what approach you take, remember that empathy and compassion should be your guiding lights. Make sure that the brother's needs are first and foremost in whatever solution you decide on.

QUESTION: My college friend group is planning a reunion trip, but someone who treated me poorly years ago—subtle bullying, exclusion, snide remarks—will be there. No one else remembers the hurt. I want to see my friends, but the thought of being around him again makes me tense. How do I decide whether to go?

ANSWER: Start by asking what being around him would cost you emotionally. Do you have the energy to engage politely? To keep distance gracefully? There’s no moral obligation to reenter a dynamic that once harmed you.

If you do want to go, set internal boundaries beforehand. Decide what level of access he gets. Decide what you’ll share and what you won’t. Consider quietly telling one trusted friend, “This person was unkind to me back then, so I may need some grounding.” Not for drama—just for support.

If you choose not to go, that isn’t avoidance. It’s discernment. Healing doesn’t require testing yourself against old wounds. It requires knowing the difference between bravery and self-sacrifice.

QUESTION: My partner becomes visibly uncomfortable when I’m upset—not because he doesn’t care, but because he instantly shifts into problem-solving mode. I end up feeling rushed out of my emotions. How do I help him understand that presence is sometimes more healing than solutions?

ANSWER: Tell him your emotional timeline. “When I’m upset, I need comfort first, clarity second, and solutions third—if at all.” People who solve quickly often think pain means emergency. Reframing helps him understand that comfort is not passivity; it’s connection.

Offer a simple tool: “When I’m upset, can you ask me, ‘Do you want comfort or help right now?’” This teaches both of you to align needs and responses. And reinforce that his impulse comes from love, not failure. You’re not rejecting his instincts. You’re shaping them so they land where they’re intended.

QUESTION: One of my siblings checks in constantly—late-night calls to make sure I’m not upset with her, repeated questions about whether we’re “okay,” endless reassurance-seeking. I know anxiety drives it, but it’s overwhelming. How do I show love without letting her rely on me to regulate her worry?

ANSWER: Reassurance is helpful only when it helps the other person build stability—not when it becomes the stability. Say, “I love you and we’re okay, but I can’t keep reassuring you every time the worry shows up. It’s not sustainable for me.”

Then shift her attention inward. “What makes you worry something is wrong? What helps you calm yourself without checking in?” This teaches her to seek evidence, not rescue. You’re not withdrawing love. You’re refusing to let the relationship become her anxiety’s pressure valve. Boundaries aren’t abandonment. They’re the conditions for healthier closeness.

QUESTION: My partner wants to integrate finances more now that we live together, but I’m hesitant. Financial autonomy has always been part of how I feel grounded. I’m worried he’ll interpret my reluctance as emotional distance. How do I explain my hesitation without making him feel excluded?

ANSWER: Start with the emotional truth: “Financial independence isn’t about doubting you. It’s about staying connected to a sense of agency that helps me feel stable.” This shifts the conversation from trust to identity.

Then propose structure instead of all-or-nothing thinking. Maybe shared accounts for joint expenses, separate accounts for personal spending, and transparency where it matters. This approach frames integration as collaboration, not surrender.

Reassure him that intimacy and autonomy are not opposites. “This isn’t me pulling away. It’s me creating the foundation I need so I can fully show up with you.” Healthy partnerships make room for both connection and individuality.

QUESTION: I feel that I'm a walking, breathing cliche. I'm a 54-year-old woman whose similarly-aged husband cheated on me with his 24-year-old secretary. It's really the oldest story on God's green earth. I naively took him at his word when he told me that he was working late on Monday and Wednesday evenings. He told me that he had a big project to finish up, and his boss had laid off his assistant, so he was forced to do two people's jobs. Thus, he had to spend many hours at work outside of the workday to get it all done. 

Imagine my surprise when my best friend told me that she had seen my husband and a much younger woman out at a nice restaurant after working hours while my friend was on a date there! I confronted him, and after initial predictable denials, he confessed. He told me that she made him feel young and wanted. Again, you can find countless examples of this story down to the small details. But now that I'm reeling from this betrayal, I'm wondering whether to stay or to leave him. He has always been a good husband and provider, and I believe him when he told me that he hasn't slept with anybody outside of the marriage except for the secretary. He swore to me that he would change. However, a couple of weeks ago, after we tried to reconcile, my friend once again saw him out with the girlfriend at the same restaurant. (He could have at least been smart about it and gone to a different restaurant with her.) Clearly he hasn't ended things with her. He has many good qualities, but I don't know if I can forgive him for this. Should I stay or should I go?

ANSWER: I'm sorry that you're in this situation. Nobody deserves to be cheated on. Whether to stay or go in the event of an extramarital affair is one of those questions where good, reasonable people can disagree. Some are of the opinion that even one incident of cheating is too much, and that the trust can never be restored. On the other hand, others subscribe to the school of thought of allowing their partners a second or even third chance. Clearly you're at least open to the possibility of taking him back, but given that this betrayal has happened multiple times and that the deceit is continuing after his assurances that it wouldn't, I would be hesitant about taking him back.

If you haven't already, find a good therapist to discuss this question with. Try to look for larger patterns. For instance, have you been cheated on before and then taken a partner back? What happened then? Your husband told you that he hasn't cheated on you with anyone except for the secretary, but has he engaged in any other dishonest behavior, such as using family money for questionable purposes? Usually when somebody is deceitful or dishonest in one area, they act similarly in other areas. Ultimately, the decision on whether to stay or go is yours, but I would exercise caution regarding his ability to change given what you've experienced thus far. If there were a graveyard for all failed relationships and marriages, probably about half of the headstones would read: "She tried to change him."

QUESTION: A friend I care deeply about has started isolating herself. She cancels plans, avoids messages, and seems ashamed when she reappears. I’m worried something deeper is going on, but I don’t want to push her into conversations she isn’t ready for. What’s the right balance?

ANSWER: Offer unconditional presence without pressure. “I care about you, and I’m here whenever you want company or conversation. You don’t owe me an explanation.” This relieves the shame that often compounds isolation.

Then send occasional check-ins that don’t demand a response—something as simple as, “Thinking of you today.” Isolation grows when people feel they’ve failed the relationship. Your steadiness reminds her the door is still open.

If you sense real danger, express concern directly but calmly: “I’ve noticed you pulling away, and I’m worried about you. You don’t have to tell me everything, but I want to make sure you aren’t carrying something alone.” You’re not forcing disclosure; you’re offering safety.

QUESTION: My partner gets intensely absorbed in new interests—books, hobbies, projects—and temporarily disappears into them. I admire his passion, but I feel left behind. I don’t want to dim what brings him joy, but I also don’t want to feel like a spectator in my own relationship. How do we create a balance?

ANSWER: Tell him you’re not criticizing his enthusiasm—you’re naming the relational impact. “I love how deeply you dive into things, but when your world narrows around a project, I lose access to you.” This isn’t an attack; it’s a request for connection.

Work together on a simple anchor ritual—something that guarantees a touchpoint even during his immersion. A nightly check-in, a shared meal, a weekend walk. You’re not trying to divide his attention. You’re establishing the minimum tether that keeps the relationship alive while his mind wanders.

Passion and partnership can coexist, but not without intentional return points.

QUESTION: My friend apologized for something hurtful she did years ago, and I truly forgave her. The problem is that she keeps bringing it up—trying to prove she’s changed or checking repeatedly if I’m still okay. I’m tired of revisiting the past, but I don’t want to invalidate her remorse. How do I move us forward?

ANSWER: Tell her clearly and gently, “Your apology meant a lot, and I accepted it. But revisiting it repeatedly keeps us stuck in the past. I want to live in the relationship we have now.” This reassures her that the forgiveness was real and also establishes a boundary against reopening the wound.

Let her know she doesn’t need constant self-surveillance to stay in your life. “If anything ever comes up, we’ll handle it then. But we don’t need to keep returning to what’s already healed.” This frees her from guilt and frees the friendship from looping back into old hurt. Forgiveness doesn’t require maintenance. It requires trust in the present.

<END_OF_SET>

QUESTION: My partner tends to intellectualize everything—feelings, conflicts, even joy. When I open up emotionally, he dissects it like a case study. I know he’s trying to understand me, but I end up feeling analyzed rather than met. How do I ask for emotional presence instead of intellectual interpretation?

ANSWER: Start with the distinction itself. “When I share something emotional, I don’t need it understood from the outside—I need it felt with me from the inside.” Ask him to try mirroring your emotional tone before offering analysis. “Instead of explaining why I might feel something, can you respond to the feeling itself?”

Also invite him to articulate what emotions feel like for him. People who intellectualize often do so because emotions feel chaotic or unfamiliar. You’re not asking him to abandon the analytical part of himself. You’re inviting him to add another register of connection.

The heart doesn’t need a hypothesis. It needs a companion.

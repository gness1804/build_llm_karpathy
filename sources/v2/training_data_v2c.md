QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for three years, and we're talking about moving in together. The issue is pets. I have two cats that I've had for years, and they're like family to me. My partner is allergic to cats and doesn't really like them anyway. They've suggested I rehome my cats before we move in together, but I can't imagine giving them up. My partner says it's not fair to expect them to live with animals they're allergic to and don't want, but I feel like asking me to give up my pets is asking me to give up part of my family. How do we resolve this?

ANSWER: This is a fundamental incompatibility that needs to be addressed before you move in together. Your partner is right that it's not fair to expect them to live with animals they're allergic to, but you're also right that asking you to rehome pets you've had for years is a significant ask. The question is whether there's a compromise that works for both of you, or whether this is a deal-breaker.

First, explore the allergy issue: has your partner tried allergy medication or immunotherapy? Some people can manage cat allergies with medication, though it's not a guarantee. If the allergy is severe and can't be managed, then you're looking at a choice: either you keep your cats and don't live together (at least not in the same space), or you rehome the cats. But before you make that decision, you need to be honest with yourself about what you can live with. If rehoming your cats would cause you lasting resentment, then that's not a viable solution—it will poison your relationship. You might need to consider whether you're compatible for cohabitation right now. Some couples make it work by living separately, or by waiting until circumstances change (like the cats passing away naturally, though that's obviously not something to rush). The key is to have an honest conversation about what each of you can and can't accept, and to make a decision based on that, not on pressure or guilt.

QUESTION: My girlfriend and I have been dating for about eight months. Things are going well, but there's one issue: she's always late. Not just a few minutes—we're talking 30 minutes to an hour late to everything. Dates, meeting up with friends, even important events. When I bring it up, she says she's just not a punctual person and that I need to be more flexible. But I feel like her chronic lateness shows she doesn't respect my time or our plans. I've tried adjusting—showing up later myself, or giving her earlier times—but it's starting to really bother me. Am I being too rigid, or is this a legitimate concern?

ANSWER: You're not being too rigid—chronic lateness is a legitimate concern, especially when it's this extreme. Being 30 minutes to an hour late regularly suggests either poor time management, a lack of respect for other people's time, or possibly an underlying issue like ADHD or anxiety. The fact that she dismisses your concerns and tells you to "be more flexible" rather than acknowledging the problem is also concerning.

Have a direct conversation: "I know you're not a punctual person, but when you're consistently 30 minutes to an hour late, it makes me feel like our time together isn't important to you. I'm happy to be flexible with a few minutes here and there, but this feels different. Can we talk about what's making it hard for you to be on time?" Try to understand the root cause—is it poor planning, difficulty estimating time, or something else? If she's willing to work on it, you can brainstorm solutions together: maybe she sets alarms, builds in buffer time, or you agree on consequences (like if she's more than 15 minutes late, you'll go ahead without her). But if she continues to dismiss your feelings and refuses to make any effort to change, that tells you something about how she values your time and your relationship. Punctuality might seem like a small thing, but it's often a proxy for respect and consideration. You deserve a partner who values your time as much as their own.

QUESTION: My husband and I have been married for six years, and we have a good relationship overall. But there's one recurring issue: he has several close female friends, and he spends a lot of time with them one-on-one—grabbing coffee, going to movies, that kind of thing. I trust him and I don't think he's cheating, but it still makes me uncomfortable. When I've mentioned it, he says I'm being insecure and that he shouldn't have to give up his friendships just because he's married. I don't want him to give up his friendships, but I also feel like there should be some boundaries around opposite-sex friendships when you're in a committed relationship. Am I being unreasonable?

ANSWER: You're not being unreasonable—this is a common issue in relationships, and different couples have different comfort levels around opposite-sex friendships. The key is finding boundaries that work for both of you, not just one person's comfort level. Your husband dismissing your feelings as "insecurity" isn't helpful—your discomfort is valid, even if he doesn't share it.

Have a conversation that focuses on what would make you feel more comfortable rather than asking him to end friendships: "I trust you, and I don't want you to lose your friends. But the one-on-one time with your female friends makes me uncomfortable. Could we talk about some boundaries that would work for both of us?" Maybe that means group hangouts are fine, but one-on-one dinners feel too intimate. Or maybe it means you get to know these friends better so they feel less like strangers. Or maybe it means certain activities are off-limits (like late-night hangouts or weekend trips). The goal is to find a middle ground where he can maintain his friendships while you feel secure in your relationship.

If he's completely unwilling to consider any boundaries and continues to dismiss your feelings, that's a bigger issue. A healthy partnership requires both people to consider each other's comfort levels, even if they don't fully understand them. Your feelings matter, and a good partner will want to address them rather than just telling you to get over it.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for two years, and we're both in our mid-30s. We have a good relationship, but there's one thing that's been bothering me: they talk about their exes a lot. Not in a "I miss them" way, but just bringing them up in conversation—comparing things I do to things their ex did, telling stories about their past relationships, that kind of thing. When I've mentioned that it makes me uncomfortable, they say I'm being insecure and that their past is part of who they are. I understand that, but I also feel like constantly bringing up exes is disrespectful to our relationship. Am I overreacting?

ANSWER: You're not overreacting—constantly bringing up exes in a current relationship can feel like you're being compared or that your partner isn't fully present with you. While it's true that past relationships are part of someone's history, there's a difference between occasionally referencing the past and making it a regular topic of conversation. The fact that your partner dismisses your feelings as "insecurity" is also problematic—your discomfort is valid, regardless of their intent.

Have a conversation that focuses on how their behavior makes you feel: "I understand that your past relationships are part of your history, and I'm not asking you to pretend they never happened. But when you frequently bring up your exes or compare me to them, it makes me feel like I'm being measured against your past relationships rather than appreciated for who I am. Can we talk about ways to share your past that feel less like comparisons?" You might find that the issue is less about mentioning exes at all and more about how they're being mentioned—maybe stories about exes are fine, but comparisons aren't. Or maybe you both agree that exes come up less frequently in general conversation.

If your partner continues to dismiss your feelings and refuses to make any changes, that's a red flag. A good partner will want to make you feel valued and secure, even if they don't fully understand why something bothers you. Your feelings matter, and they deserve to be taken seriously, not brushed off as insecurity.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been together for a year, and things are mostly good. But there's one issue: we have very different comfort levels with public displays of affection. I'm someone who likes to hold hands, give quick kisses, put my arm around my partner when we're out. He's much more reserved and says he's not comfortable with PDA—he'll hold my hand sometimes, but that's about it. When I try to be affectionate in public, he pulls away or seems embarrassed. I feel rejected, and he feels pressured. We've talked about it, but we can't seem to find a middle ground. How do we navigate this?

ANSWER: This is a common issue, and both of your comfort levels are valid. The key is finding a compromise that respects both of your boundaries rather than one person having to completely accommodate the other. Start by having a conversation about what specifically makes each of you uncomfortable: is it any physical contact in public, or are certain things okay (like holding hands) while others aren't (like kissing)? Understanding the specifics can help you find a middle ground.

Then, try to meet in the middle: maybe you agree that holding hands and brief hugs are okay, but more intimate displays of affection are saved for private. Or maybe you have certain contexts where PDA is more acceptable (like at a party with friends) versus others where it's not (like in a professional setting or around family). The goal is to find a level of affection that you're both comfortable with, not to convince him to be more affectionate or you to be less affectionate.

It's also worth considering whether this is a symptom of a larger issue: does he show affection in private? Does he make you feel loved and valued in other ways? If the only issue is public affection and you're both happy with your private relationship, then this might just be a difference in comfort levels that you can work around. But if he's also reserved in private or if you're feeling generally unloved or rejected, then this might be a sign of a deeper incompatibility that needs to be addressed.

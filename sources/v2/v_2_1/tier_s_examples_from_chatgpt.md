QUESTION: My mother was abusive throughout my childhood. Emotionally, verbally, sometimes physically. I cut contact with her years ago, and that distance has been necessary for my mental health. Recently, she died. My sister, who was also abused but to a lesser degree, is now furious with me because I refuse to help plan the funeral or attend it. She says that “family is family” and that I’m being cruel by refusing to participate. I feel numb more than anything else. Am I obligated to show up just because she’s dead?

ANSWER: No one is obligated to perform grief on demand. And no one is required to honor someone who caused them harm simply because that person has died. Death does not retroactively transform abuse into love, nor does it impose new moral debts on the people who were hurt.

What you’re describing is not indifference. It’s emotional exhaustion and self-protection after a long history of pain. For many people who grew up with abuse, numbness is not a failure to grieve. It’s the nervous system finally standing down after years of vigilance. That response deserves respect, not judgment.

Your sister’s anger is understandable, but it does not override your experience. People who endured different degrees or forms of abuse often arrive at different conclusions about what they owe, if anything, to the person who harmed them. Some need rituals. Some need distance. Some need silence. None of these responses are morally superior to the others.

You can acknowledge your sister’s grief without sacrificing your own wellbeing. That might sound like: “I understand that this loss is painful for you, and I respect your need to mourn in your own way. I’m not able to participate, and that boundary is about my own health, not a judgment of you.”

Funerals are for the living. But they are not for everyone. Protecting yourself now is not cruelty. It’s honesty, practiced late but carefully.

QUESTION: I’m getting married soon, and I’m seriously considering not inviting my father. He has been verbally abusive and relentlessly negative my entire life. We’re currently not speaking. He’s elderly and in poor health, and some relatives say I’ll regret excluding him. Am I being too rigid by not wanting him at my wedding?

ANSWER: A wedding is not a referendum on forgiveness, nor is it a moral obligation to reopen relationships that have caused consistent harm. It is a day that places you in a vulnerable emotional position, and it is reasonable to want that day to be as safe and grounded as possible.

Relatives often invoke regret as a way of pressing people into tolerating mistreatment. But regret is not a one-way street. Many people regret inviting someone who has hurt them into a space that was meant to be joyful, especially when that person behaves exactly as they always have. Age and illness do not erase patterns. If anything, they make change less likely, not more.

It’s important to be clear about what this choice is and isn’t. You are not excluding your father to punish him. You are choosing not to expose yourself to a situation that history suggests will be painful. That distinction matters.

If reconciliation were genuinely possible, it would begin with accountability and repair, not an invitation. You are allowed to decide that your wedding is no place for unfinished business.

You can hold this boundary calmly and without debate. “This is what I need in order to feel present and protected on my wedding day” is a complete explanation. Anyone who cannot accept that is asking you to prioritize appearances over wellbeing.

QUESTION: My adult children have limited contact with me because of how my second husband treated them when they were growing up. He was harsh and controlling. There was yelling but no physical abuse. I didn’t intervene as much as I should have, and now my kids say I never chose them. I’m devastated and don’t know how to move forward.

ANSWER: This is a devastating place to find yourself, and there’s no way to soften that. What your children are responding to is not only how your husband behaved, but how alone they felt while it was happening. When a parent does not intervene, children often experience that as abandonment, even if the parent was also overwhelmed, afraid, or conflicted.

One of the hardest truths here is that intention and impact are not the same. You may have believed you were keeping the peace, protecting the household, or surviving a difficult marriage. Your children experienced a parent who did not step in when they needed protection. Both things can be true at once.

If there is a path forward, it begins with acknowledgment rather than explanation. That means resisting the urge to contextualize your choices too quickly, even if your reasons felt real and complex. Repair starts with something like: “I didn’t protect you the way I should have. I understand why that hurt you, and I’m sorry.” Full stop.

After that, the timeline belongs to them. They may need distance. They may never return to the relationship you want. Accepting that is part of accountability, painful as it is. The goal is not to feel forgiven. The goal is to become someone safer now than you were then.

QUESTION: My husband’s parents are openly hostile toward me and have questioned our marriage. I’ve opted out of seeing them. Now I’m pregnant with twins, and they suddenly want access. Am I wrong to keep my distance?

ANSWER: You are not wrong to protect yourself, and by extension your children, from people who have shown you sustained disrespect. Pregnancy does not obligate you to reopen relationships that were harmful before it began.

The crucial distinction here is between reconciliation and access. Reconciliation requires accountability and changed behavior. Access requires only opportunity. What your in-laws are asking for sounds like the latter without offering the former.

It is reasonable to say that relationships with your children will be shaped by how you are treated. That is not leverage. It is reality. When someone consistently undermines or disrespects a parent, they undermine the family unit as a whole.

Your husband’s role matters. Supporting you does not necessarily mean cutting off his parents. It does mean respecting the boundaries you need to feel safe and supported, especially during a physically and emotionally demanding time.

Twins will require enough of you. You are not obligated to carry unresolved family conflict alongside that responsibility.

QUESTION: I’m 21 and interested in a man who is 13 years older than me. He says he’s attracted to me but hesitant because he doesn’t want to “take advantage of my youth.” I don’t know what to make of that.

ANSWER: His hesitation is not a red flag. In fact, it suggests that he’s thinking seriously about power, timing, and responsibility rather than ignoring them.

Age gaps are not inherently wrong, but they do introduce asymmetries in life experience, stability, and power that deserve attention. What matters is not your age alone, but whether both of you feel free to slow down, to take a serious look at the situation, and to discuss these difficult matters as equals. Because if there's any asymmetry in how the two of you talk about the question of whether to have a relationship in the first place, these asymmetries are going to reappear again and again during an actual relationship.

His concern may reflect care rather than ambivalence. At the same time, attraction alone does not resolve these questions. If this relationship were to move forward, it should do so slowly and transparently, with space for you to articulate your needs and expectations clearly.

If he remains stuck in hesitation, that may simply mean he is not available for the kind of relationship you want right now. That can be disappointing without being anyone’s fault.

Sometimes care expresses itself not through action, but through restraint.

QUESTION: My sister resents me for being more academically successful. She says I make her feel inferior, even when I try to downplay my achievements. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells.

ANSWER: It’s exhausting to feel responsible for someone else’s sense of worth, especially when you didn’t create the comparison in the first place. You are allowed to exist fully as yourself without shrinking to manage someone else’s discomfort.

Your sister’s resentment likely reflects unresolved feelings about her own path rather than anything you’ve done wrong. While empathy is appropriate, self-erasure is not a sustainable solution. Playing smaller rarely heals envy. More often, it entrenches it.

You can acknowledge her feelings without accepting blame. “I’m proud of my work, and I don’t intend that as a judgment of you” is a reasonable boundary. If she continues to lash out, it may be necessary to limit how much of yourself you share with her.

Healthy relationships allow for difference without punishment.

QUESTION: I feel pressured to reconcile with a parent who has never acknowledged the harm they caused. Other family members say I should “move on.” Am I being unforgiving?

ANSWER: Forgiveness without accountability is not healing. It’s erasure. Moving on does not require reopening relationships that remain unsafe or unresolved.

Often, the pressure to “move on” reflects other people’s discomfort with conflict rather than a genuine concern for your wellbeing. Family equilibrium is frequently prioritized over individual repair, but those are not the same thing.

You are allowed to let go of anger without granting access. Those are separate decisions. Reconciliation, if it ever happens, must be built on recognition of harm and changed behavior. Without that, distance is a reasonable form of self-protection.

You are not unforgiving for refusing to pretend that nothing happened.

QUESTION: I’m estranged from a sibling, and my parents keep pushing us to “make peace.” They say it’s breaking their hearts. What should I do?

ANSWER: Parents often want resolution because conflict threatens their sense of family cohesion. That desire is understandable, but peace imposed from above rarely heals what’s broken below.

Without more context, it's hard to know exactly what advice to give. What exactly happened to cause the estrangement? If it's a matter of abuse, then certainly you have no obligation to reconcile, whether to "make peace" or for any other reason. (In this context, "abuse" can be defined as bullying or other forms of consistent physical and/or verbal attacks.) When abuse has taken place, you're absolutely within your rights to keep distance and to restrict or completely halt any sort of communication with your sibling. Family ties and your parents' expectations don't justify damaging your mental health by allowing an abusive sibling into your life.

If the problem is less serious than abuse, then the situation becomes a bit more nuanced. I have known situations of sibling estrangement that weren't caused by abuse, but rather by personality differences, a history of sibling rivalry, or some other complicated factor where one really can't "blame" either side for the estrangement. If the issue falls into this category and you feel a genuine desire to reconnect with your sibling, then I would encourage you to reach out. Say something like, "[Sibling], I know that we've been a bit distant from each other because of [X]. But I would like for us to be closer. How can we work together to build a stronger relationship?"

The wording of your letter, however, implies that you're either hesitant or opposed to reaching out to your sibling. And if this is the case, then you're under no obligation to do so. Once we become adults, our relationships with other members of our family of origin become strictly voluntary. In this respect, it's a bit like if you had a good friend you'd grown apart from over time, either because of a falling out or because your lives and interests diverged. In that case, you'd be well within your rights to decide not to try to rekindle the friendship. 

If reconciliation were possible, it would require willingness and accountability on both sides. Pressure cannot substitute for repair. You can empathize with your parents’ sadness without sacrificing your own boundaries.

It’s fair to say to them: “I understand this is hard for you. But I’m not willing to reconnect under pressure or pretense. If I do decide to reconnect with [Sibling], then it will be on my own timeline and for my own reasons.” That response is honest without being cruel.

Sometimes the most loving choice is to stop pretending a relationship exists when it doesn’t.

QUESTION: My best friend is going through a divorce and calls me almost every night to vent. At first I wanted to be there for her, but it’s been months now, and every conversation turns into a two-hour monologue about her ex. I’m emotionally exhausted and starting to dread her calls. Am I a bad friend if I pull back?

ANSWER: Wanting to be there for someone during a painful chapter of their life does not mean you are required to absorb their pain indefinitely. There is a difference between being supportive and being smothered.

Your inclination to pull back appears to be a conflict between wanting to be there for your friend and the need to protect your own time and mental health. Sacrificing the latter in the name of your love and concern for your friend isn't really tenable for either of you. That doesn’t make you uncaring. It means you have limits. When those limits are ignored for long enough, even the most generous people begin to feel resentment, dread, and withdrawal. Those feelings are signals, not moral failures.

Pulling back does not have to look like abandonment. It can look like recalibration. You might say something like: “I care about you and I want to support you, but I don’t have the capacity for long nightly calls anymore. Can we find a different way to stay connected that works for both of us?” That opens the door to adjustment rather than rupture. And if she presses you on why you're pulling back, you can explain to her that while you absolutely want to continue to be there for her, the long calls are draining you emotionally. Say that to be fully present for her and be the best friend that you can be, you have to take care of yourself, too. And this requires less frequent and less lengthy discussions of divorce-related matters. 

Being a good friend does not require sacrificing your own emotional health. Care that is sustainable is ultimately more loving than care that quietly burns out.

QUESTION: I’ve been married for 20 years and recently realized I’m deeply unhappy. There’s no abuse, no infidelity, just a growing sense that we became roommates. Is it selfish to consider leaving?

ANSWER: Long-term unhappiness does not require dramatic justification to be legitimate. Many marriages unravel quietly, not through betrayal or cruelty, but through emotional erosion and disconnection over time. There are many reasons why most marriages eventually end before the death of one of the spouses. But the slow, mundane distancing that you describe is a common one.

Recognizing this can bring a particular kind of guilt, especially when nothing “bad enough” seems to have happened. But the absence of abuse does not obligate you to ignore your own inner life. Wanting more emotional presence, intimacy, or meaning is not selfish by default. When you've been living under the same roof as somebody for many years, but you don't feel the same strong connection that you once did, that can be very uncomfortable and guilt-inducing. Society tells us that marriage is forever, and that once in love, always in love. But as you and countless others have experienced, reality is usually different.

At the same time, awareness is not the same as certainty. Before making irreversible decisions, it’s worth exploring whether the unhappiness reflects neglect that could be addressed or a deeper incompatibility that cannot. That exploration might include honest conversation, counseling, or simply allowing yourself to name what you’ve been avoiding. Also you might try a "free writing session" in which you write down anything and everything that comes to mind with respect to your marriage. Free writing involves letting go of any inhibitions and writing whatever comes to your mind, however silly or scary it might seem. Writers often find this useful for brainstorming, but it can also be applied to trying to figure out interpersonal situations as well, especially since we usually heavily self-censor when it comes to thinking about delicate emotional topics. Resolve to never let anyone see the result of the free-writing. You can even destroy the document after writing it. Hopefully this, along with simple unstructured reflection, will help you understand more where you want to go with respect to your marriage. 

If you feel that it's worth trying to save the marriage, and that the underlying problems can be solved within the marriage, then you might say something to your spouse like: "Honey, we've grown apart over the last few years, and I'm sure you've noticed it too. I realize that we are different people than when we first married. But I want us to be closer again. What do you think is missing, and how could we both work towards fixing it?"

But if you decide after this reflection that ending the marriage is the best course of action, do it. Hopefully you and your husband have an amicable enough relationship that a divorce would be relatively smooth. Also, you don't mention if you have children. But even if you do, divorce in an unhappy marriage is a better alternative to modeling an unhappy relationship to your children.

There is no moral virtue in endurance for its own sake. The ethical question isn’t whether you’re allowed to want more, but how to proceed with honesty and care for both yourself and your spouse. Sometimes the most courageous and loving thing you can do is walk away.

QUESTION: My adult son rarely calls or visits. When I bring it up, he says he’s busy. I feel rejected and don’t know how to respond without pushing him further away.

ANSWER: Distance from adult children can feel like a quiet, ongoing loss. It often triggers questions about what went wrong or what could have been done differently. Those feelings are real and deeply human. Parents usually operate on the implicit, unspoken assumption that when their children grow up, they will stay in close contact. Or at least that they will make a regular effort to call and visit. When this proves not to be the case, after children grow up and start their adult lives, this can create feelings of rejection, even though the reason for the reduced contact might simply be that the adult child is very busy with their own life.

Your question doesn't mention important facts such as: How old your adult son is, whether he has a family of his own, or whether anything specific happened that might have triggered this distancing, as opposed to it just being the result of him having a lot on his plate. All these factors matter. And many adult children simply get wrapped up in their lives and contacting their parents often falls by the wayside, especially if they have children of their own. The communication rules of yesteryear have broken down, while at the same time, young families and young adults are particularly overwhelmed these days with all the stresses of daily life, the uncertain economy, the influence of social media, the impossible expectations around child-rearing, and so many other things. So it's entirely possible that his relative silence is simply a byproduct of these forces, rather than anything you or his other parent specifically did.

What creates space for reconnection is signaling that the relationship is safe and non-demanding. Next time you talk to him about a visit, and he mentions being busy, you can say something like: “I miss you and enjoy hearing from you whenever you have time." That's it. Don't propose a time to meet or talk or even just say something like, "I would like to catch up sometime." 

The trick is to strike a balance between expressing your wish to reconnect without crossing the line into pressure. Pressure rarely produces closeness. When adult children feel obligated to manage a parent’s disappointment, they often retreat further. 

That doesn’t mean suppressing your feelings entirely. It means expressing them without making them your child’s responsibility.

Sometimes the most loving thing a parent can do is leave the door open and trust that their child will walk through it when they’re able.

QUESTION: My partner frequently jokes at my expense in social settings. When I ask him to stop, he says I’m too sensitive. Am I?

ANSWER: Humor that repeatedly lands at one person’s expense stops being harmless, especially when concerns are dismissed rather than addressed. Being told you’re “too sensitive” often serves to deflect responsibility rather than resolve the issue. Cowards everywhere use humor as a shield to say something without owning it. And when the person perpetrating this problem is doing it to their partner, then that's a particularly cruel and cowardly act. It conveys the message that the person telling the joke cares little about their partner's feelings and cares more about themself. This can make the target of the joke feel humiliated, dehumanized, and unloved.

The common sense, reasonable-person rule of thumb regarding jokes at someone else's expense is that when the target of the joke expresses discomfort or explicitly asks the teller of the joke to stop, then the teller must stop immediately. He must never tell any more of these jokes. Your partner evidently has not learned this rule, or he doesn't care. He's also gaslighting you by causing you to question your own legitimate feelings of hurt. What a decent and reasonable person would do if he were in your partner's shoes is not tell any more of the jokes, even if he personally couldn't understand why you find them offensive. The fact that they hurt you is itself enough of a reason to stop telling the jokes.

The fact that your partner hasn't done this suggests that there probably isn't much hope for this relationship. But if you want to make one last-ditch effort, you might use the following script as a template. "[Partner], You've told a lot of jokes lately that I have been the butt of. I've told you that I don't appreciate it. And when you brush me off by saying I'm too sensitive, it communicates to me that you don't truly care about my feelings. You might find the jokes funny, but I don't. When you tell them it makes me feel hurt and humiliated. Please stop." 

While I'm not usually a fan of "tests" in relationships, in this case whether your partner continues telling the jokes after that point will tell you all you need to know about whether to stay with him. If he keeps telling jokes, get out of that relationship as quickly as possible. You deserve better than someone who will treat you in a mean-spirited fashion and then criticize you when you express hurt at this treatment.

Life is hard enough without your own partner putting you down and then not even taking responsibility for it. A partner who respects you will care more about how their words land than about defending their sense of humor.

You are not obligated to tolerate being the punchline to "keep the peace" in your relationship. Asking for basic respect is not fragility. It is a reasonable boundary.

QUESTION: I feel guilty for being relieved after ending a relationship. Does that mean I never really loved them?

ANSWER: Relief after a breakup does not invalidate the love you felt. Often it reflects the lifting of a burden that had become unbearable over time.

Your letter is sparse in context, so it's unclear what the underlying circumstances are. But many, many people feel relief after a relationship ends. Some people feel this way because they were smothered in a codependent relationship, or one in which they had to bear more than their share of the emotional and/or household labor. Others feel relief because disagreements with their partner had surpassed their emotional pain threshold. There are also cases of abuse and infidelity, in which case it's definitely a relief to leave the relationship. Or there are much more mundane cases in which neither spouse did anything "wrong," but the relationship just lost its luster over time and became more of a burden than a joy.

I'm not implying that any of these things were true of your own relationship. Rather, the preceding paragraph is an attempt to illustrate how common it is for people to feel relieved after a relationship ends. It's perfectly normal and doesn't make you a bad person, nor does it mean that you didn't love your partner. Love evolves and changes over time. Sometimes people fall out of love, while at other times love evolves into something that no longer fits well within the space of the relationship in which it started. You can deeply love someone but still come to realize that for any of the reasons listed above, or any number of others, the relationship just isn't right. Leaving a relationship in that circumstance often does feel like a relief, even as it's also heartbreaking. These two things can be true at the same time.

You don’t need to rewrite your history to justify your present emotions. Mixed feelings are common after loss, particularly when love and strain coexisted for a long time. In my parents' case, they were married for over 30 years and there was clearly a lot of love between them. But for various reasons, the relationship fell apart. After an intense grieving period, my mother felt a lot of relief at being able to live a new life on her own terms. I think even today she still loves my dad in some way, but also feels that the divorce was the right thing to do.

Emotions are signals, and your relief is telling you that something about that relationship wasn't right. It isn't telling you anything about whether or not you loved your partner. A chapter of your life has ended, but that doesn't mean that you didn't have a lot of love for the co-author of that chapter.

QUESTION: My parents expect me to visit every holiday, even though doing so leaves me anxious and depleted. I feel trapped between obligation and self-care.

ANSWER: Traditions have a special place in our culture and can often bring great happiness. But they are not automatically healthy. When a tradition consistently leaves one person anxious or depleted, it deserves reevaluation. Because a tradition that is continued to the detriment of one or more of the participants ceases to be a reaffirmation of connection and love. Rather, it becomes a burden and often a source of resentment.

The outsized importance of traditions in our culture, particularly around the holidays, can often mask the complex emotions and stress often associated with them. And as you and countless others have seen, traditions often come with heavy expectations. Many of our traditions also involve substantial emotional labor. Not only with the holidays, but also think of things like planning a wedding, trying to create an invite list for your child's birthday party that doesn't hurt anyone's feelings, and also some faith traditions where devotees engage in a variety of rituals and often have to master complex subject matter. In light of all this, traditions can often be exhausting, even when we treasure them.

The good news is that you are allowed to renegotiate expectations as an adult, even if doing so disappoints others. Choosing not to attend every gathering is not a rejection of your family; it’s an acknowledgment of your limits. You might explain to your parents that while you love seeing them and visiting for holidays, you're not able to attend for every holiday. You could, for instance, say that you're coming to see them for Christmas, but you have other plans for Thanksgiving. If they press you for details on why you're not going to see them for every holiday, you don't need to provide an exhaustive explanation. “This is what I can manage right now” is enough.

QUESTION: I discovered that my partner reads my private messages “out of concern.” They say they’re just trying to protect the relationship. How serious is this?

ANSWER: Reading private messages without consent is a serious breach of trust, regardless of the motivation offered. Concern does not justify surveillance. When a partner violates trust and privacy in this manner, one often feels frustration, disappointment, and anger. It conveys that the partner who reads the messages doesn't see their partner as an equal and doesn't respect their autonomy.

It's unclear from your message what your partner thinks that they need to protect the relationship from. Do they suspect infidelity? Is there some other situation in your life that they're concerned about, but they're expressing this concern by violating your privacy? Regardless, this behavior is never justified. Healthy relationships rely on mutual respect for autonomy and privacy. When one partner monitors the other, it often reflects insecurity or a need for control rather than genuine care.

This behavior deserves to be addressed directly and taken seriously. You might say something like, "I want to talk to you about reading my private messages. You claim that you're just trying to protect the relationship and that you're concerned. But this isn't okay. It's a violation of privacy. If you have any concerns about me or about the relationship, you need to express them openly and directly rather than going behind my back and violating my privacy."

If your partner minimizes it, refuses to stop, or reframes it as your fault, that signals a deeper issue around boundaries and trust. In that case, you might want to think hard about whether to stay in this relationship. Love doesn't justify subjecting yourself to repeated privacy violations. There are plenty of people out there who do respect basic privacy rights.

Protection that requires violation of privacy is not protection; it's snooping.

QUESTION: My partner says I’m “too independent” and that it makes him feel unnecessary. I don’t see independence as a flaw, but he seems genuinely hurt. How do I respond without apologizing for who I am?

ANSWER: Independence is not a character defect, nor does it automatically render one's partner "unnecessary." For many people, it is a hard-earned strength that reflects resilience, self-trust, and a stable sense of identity. It’s understandable that you don’t want to apologize for that. Nor should you.

This behavior on the part of your partner could reflect a controlling nature or it could simply mean that he is insecure about something. Men in our society are socialized to feel a strong need to be useful. If they perceive that this is no longer the case, it often causes anxiety and insecurity, which can be expressed in multiple ways, including criticizing a partner for supposedly being too independent. On the other hand, controlling partners often try to make their partners dependent on them. Does your partner engage in any other controlling behaviors?

If this is a case of a controlling partner, you should seek the exit as soon as possible. But if it's just insecurity that's causing your partner to react this way, then there are ways to work with him to address this. You can affirm the relationship without disowning your independence. You might say something like: “I value you and choose you. My independence isn’t about pushing you away; it’s about being whole as a person. I want us to be partners, rather than one of us depending on the other.” 

If this is reflective of a fear of being unneeded or replaceable, then that fear deserves empathy, but it does not justify asking you to become smaller or less capable. Independence is not a zero-sum game. One partner's independence does not depend on the other losing it.

If your reassurance doesn’t land, the issue may not be your independence at all. It may be a mismatch in expectations about what closeness should look like. A healthy relationship makes room for two complete people standing side by side, not one person shrinking so the other can feel essential. Reassuring someone you love shouldn't come at the cost of making yourself smaller.

QUESTION: My adult daughter constantly asks for financial help but dismisses my advice and resents any boundaries I try to set. I feel used and guilty at the same time. What’s the right response?

ANSWER: This is an emotionally fraught position to be in. Wanting to help your child doesn’t go away just because they’re grown, and guilt often rushes in the moment you consider pulling back. But generosity that consistently leaves you feeling used is a signal that something is out of balance. In interacting with an adult child, there need to be clear boundaries on each side, especially when it comes to financial matters. A lack of boundaries or violation of them is usually a recipe for trouble in the relationship.

You say "financial help," but you don't fully specify what this means. Is it just advice, or is it also money in the form of a loan or a gift? If it's the latter in particular, then guilt is no reason to justify being taken advantage of financially. Because that's what happens when people asking for money (or even just advice) don't observe boundaries. When financial support is offered without mutual respect or clear limits, it often becomes entangled with resentment on both sides. Money starts standing in for connection, approval, or control, and this is typically toxic for a relationship over time.

Setting boundaries here is not a withdrawal of love. It’s a clarification of what kind of help you can offer without harming the relationship or your retirement funds. You might say: “I care about you, but I’m no longer comfortable providing financial support under these conditions.” That statement is not punitive. It’s honest.

Your daughter may be angry, and that will be painful. But guilt alone is not a reason to continue a pattern that leaves you resentful and her dependent. Boundaries, while uncomfortable, often create the possibility for a healthier adult relationship over time.

QUESTION: My spouse keeps forgiving a family member who repeatedly disrespects me. I feel like my feelings always come second. Is this a marriage problem or a family problem?

ANSWER: When a spouse repeatedly prioritizes a family member over their partner’s wellbeing, it stops being just a family issue and becomes a marital one. Partnership implies a baseline commitment to protecting each other from harm, especially when that harm is ongoing and predictable.

Forgiveness on its own does not justify a lack of accountability or enforcement of boundaries. You can forgive someone, but still stand up to them if they keep engaging in problematic behavior. Your letter implies that your husband is not standing up to the family member who keeps treating you poorly. This is a big problem and very common. For various reasons, people in marriages or other long-term relationships often choose their own relatives over their spouse or partner. This is often the case even when their relative is disrespecting or otherwise mistreating the spouse or partner. But protecting a family member that's mistreating one's spouse is never okay.

When someone refuses to protect their spouse from harm caused by a family member, then it becomes a marital problem, first and foremost. And that's where the repair should start, within the marriage. This is worth addressing directly, not as an accusation but as a statement of need. Something like: “I need to know that you will take my side when someone treats me poorly.” You don't mention if you brought this up to your spouse before, but even if you have, it's worth bringing up again because, clearly, the problem is still there.

Forgiveness can be meaningful, but forgiveness that bypasses accountability often turns into enablement. Your spouse may believe they’re being peacemaking or generous, but the effect is that you’re left exposed and unsupported.

QUESTION: My coworkers often interrupt or talk over me in meetings. When I try to assert myself, I’m labeled “difficult.” How do I handle this without damaging my reputation?

ANSWER: Interruption is one of the worst conversational habits. In our extrovert-worshipping society, conversation can often seem to be tantamount to a contact sport in which the person who's willing to interrupt the most often gets the most floor time. And since you're talking about a workplace specifically, there are added dimensions to this problem. A workplace should have more explicit and implicit expectations that all voices are listened to. When this doesn't happen, it leaves those who are frequently interrupted feeling like their voices don't matter. Being interrupted repeatedly is not a personal failure. It’s a structural and social problem that often affects certain people more than others, regardless of competence or preparation. The frustration you feel is justified.

I myself have suffered from being interrupted a lot, both at workplaces and in other settings. Over time, I've learned strategies that enable me to speak up for myself without appearing overly confrontational. I try to say things like, "excuse me, I wasn't finished talking," or "can you please let me finish what I was saying?" In American workplaces, people are socialized to want to appear as "team players." Which is why you fear reputational damage for calling out these interruptions. But it's possible to maintain a reputation as a good member of the team while still standing up for your own right to express your full idea when you're speaking in a meeting.

For instance, if you maintain calm and composure while standing up for yourself when you're being interrupted, using phrases like I suggested above, then the risk of you appearing as someone who is "difficult" will be reduced. That being said, it is important to note that there's also a gender component to all this. You don't tell me which gender you identify with or which gender others identify you as. But if others identify you as female, then unfortunately, you're in good company with respect to constantly being interrupted. Women face a double bind at work because if they speak up too little, they're seen as not being a team player or not caring about what happens on a particular project. But if they speak up “too much,” they're seen as being too aggressive. This can also often damage them professionally. So if you're a woman, unfortunately, your task is particularly difficult, but it's not impossible.

If the pattern continues, it may be appropriate to document specific instances and raise the issue with a manager, framing it as a collaboration problem rather than a grievance. That helps protect your credibility while naming the issue. And if you've noticed other colleagues also being interrupted during meetings, which is likely, you can bring them up as well. Don't mention them by name, but say something like, "I have also noticed that other colleagues of mine are also often being interrupted at our meetings. I want our workplace to be an environment where everybody can feel free to express their full and complete opinions on work-related matters. I think that doing this will help us be the best team that we can be." 

Wanting to be heard is not “being difficult.” It’s asking for basic professional respect.

QUESTION: I’m considering ending a friendship because our political views have diverged dramatically. We can’t talk without it becoming tense. Is that shallow?

ANSWER: Political differences often reflect deeper values about power, responsibility, and empathy. And the place of outsiders and historically marginalized groups in our society. When those values diverge sharply, conversation can become exhausting rather than enriching. Especially in the current political climate, "agreeing to disagree" can be hard to accept when it seems like every issue is a battle between diametrically opposed values. And in the age of social media, we know much more about the political opinions of even neighbors and friends of friends than most of us would want to know. Just this year I learned that a spouse of a relative seems to see the opposite political party as being gleeful at a deadly natural disaster that happened in our state. Such revelations really do reveal sharply different values. Given all this, I don't think you're shallow to question ending the friendship. 

That said, ending the friendship may or may not be the best move, depending on circumstances. When the subject of conversation isn't politics, do the two of you generally have amicable and pleasant discussions? And notwithstanding what I said about agreeing to disagree above, have you ever explicitly asked your friend to keep politics off the table in your discussions, knowing that the two of you aren't going to agree and that it will only cause hurt feelings? Your sentence, "we can't talk without it becoming tense," seems to imply that politics often comes up in your conversations. If so, does one of you almost always raise the topic? If it's you, then you can simply not bring it up anymore. If it's her, you can politely ask your friend to not bring it up. Say something like, “I care a lot about you and our friendship, but I've noticed that every time we discuss politics, our conversations get tense and difficult. While I don't want to shy away from discussing difficult issues on principle, I just feel that in our friendship discussing politics does way more harm than good. Neither of us is going to persuade the other of their view, and it's very difficult to discuss this topic without lots of negative emotions coming up. Would you agree to just stay away from the subject from now on and talk about things that aren't as difficult?”

If after this conversation she still keeps bringing up politics, then that sends you a signal that your friend is willing to put their own political interest and passions above your feelings. In that case, ending the friendship or drastically reducing the amount of time that you talk with her would be an entirely appropriate response. Ending or distancing a friendship over this is not inherently shallow. It’s a recognition that mutual understanding may no longer be possible.

Many friendships can withstand political differences, but many others cannot. The question of which of these applies to your friendship will be determined by whether the two of you are able to come to a mutually satisfactory agreement about discussing politics and then actually stick to it. Because the status quo isn't sustainable.

It's not weak or "shallow" of somebody to request that a difficult topic be kept out of conversations. In fact, it takes a strong person to make such a request and risk the ire of the other person or even the end of the friendship. Bottom line: you don’t owe perpetual engagement at the cost of your own peace.

QUESTION: I am in my late twenties and recently moved into my own place. My mom has a key for emergencies, which I was fine with. Lately she has started “dropping by” unannounced when I am at work to leave food, do small chores, or reorganize things “to help.” She means well, but it feels like my space is not really mine. I tried joking about it, but she did not get the hint. How do I set a boundary without hurting her feelings?

ANSWER: It sounds like your mom is trying to be loving and helpful, but the way she's doing it is blurring the line between support and intrusion. You're not wrong to feel unsettled by that. When a parent oversteps reasonable boundaries in an adult child's life, it can leave the adult child feeling a range of emotions. You want to be able to feel that your space is yours, but you also don't want to hurt your mother's feelings, especially since you know that she means well. It's a painful dilemma.

Unfortunately, there are very few, if any, cases in which setting boundaries doesn't risk hurting someone's feelings. When boundaries need to be set with someone, almost by definition, you're asking them to get outside of their comfort zone and to rethink old assumptions that they had had, often unconsciously. When setting a boundary with your mom, you want to strike a tone of loving but firm.

You might say something to the effect of, "Mom, I love you, and I really do enjoy having you over. But when you come over, I want it to be for a visit where we're both present and can enjoy each other's company. I know that you mean well in coming over and performing chores and leaving food, but it undermines my own sense of independence and sense that my space really is my own. Moving forward, can we both agree that the key that I gave you should be only used for emergencies, and that any other times when you come over, it should not be a surprise?" 

Relationships between parents and adult children often involve recalibration. This is one of those times. With love and patience, You will be able to strengthen and re-calibrate your relationship towards more autonomy for you.

# Scenarios to base new Tier S examples on.

These are real questions that I found in various sources, namely in online newspapers. I've included just the questions, not the answers. It'll be your job to generate the answers, as well as to change the questions to make them more "Tier S"-like.

Instructions: for each example, turn it into a gold "Tier S" Q&A example.
1. Take the original question and rewrite it using my voice.
2. Create an answer to the question that also expresses my columnist voice and insight in my strongest style.

Again, both question and answer should be "gold."
Format the questions and answers into a human-readable question-and-answer format as follows:

```markdown
QUESTION: <the question>
ANSWER: <the answer>

<END OF SET>
```

No metadata, titles, or any other data should appear in your response aside from the exact question-answer-end-of-set format above.

This should be text that can easily be copied and pasted into a Markdown document. Later on, I will combine these with other Q&A sets and then create a new training document in the JSON-L format to feed into the model. But right now, let's just create the markdown.

Please output the results in batches of 10. Obviously, for the last batch, if it's less than 10, just output however many there are left.

(NOTE: many of these examples are from Carolyn Hax columns or other copyrighted material. But rewriting them in my own words and style, and maybe changing a few minor details while keeping the core question intact, should solve this problem.)

## Daughter wants nothing to do with planning abusive of mother's funeral.

Are we obligated to be there for someone just because we are related? My mother, an abusive, horrible woman who never had a nice word for me, recently died. We had not spoken for years, which was just fine with me and with her.

My sister is resentful that I’m not helping with the funeral arrangements. My mother also abused my sister — not as badly as she abused me, but she was still terrible to her.

My sister feels like she needs to step in — my father is deceased — but that’s her decision. I told her I’d send her money, but I want nothing to do with this hateful woman, and she wanted nothing to do with me.

## Weighing whether to exclude abusive father from wedding.

Father is elderly and in poor health. Has been verbally abusive to me my entire life as well as a control freak. After getting into yet another argument on the phone, we’re not speaking.

I’m getting married and seriously not feeling him at my wedding since he will inevitably turn it into his day; he has a perverse need for attention that has disrupted many major milestones and events in my family, including my mother’s funeral.

Am I being too rigid about this? He's so negative about everything I do, I can't take it anymore — especially on my wedding day. 

## Adult children limit contact with their harsh stepfather.

I am in the throes of a true dilemma with no good choices. I went through a nasty divorce when my kids were small and remarried fairly hastily. My husband brought his son into the marriage.

My husband took it upon himself to help discipline all the kids and tended to have a temper and be harsh. There was yelling but no physical abuse.

Fast-forward 30-plus years. My kids are in therapy and blame my husband for their unhappy childhoods and me for not doing more to prevent it. I am in therapy, too, because I never realized it was that bad, and I seem to no longer have much of a relationship with my daughters and son. I do get along with his son, his wife and their two kids, however. Mother’s Day came and went: crickets.

My kids feel as if I never chose them when they were younger but just wanted to keep the peace with my husband. Short of divorcing him, I (and my therapist) don’t know how to make this better. But I don’t want to be alone, which is probably why I married so quickly.

I can’t undo what has been done and wish we could move forward, but I don’t know how. Please be blunt with me: What would you do?

## Intolerant in-laws cause headaches for a couple that's expecting twins.

I haven't spoken to my husband's parents since a week after our wedding. Several things happened that caused increasing tension, including: my mother-in-law blowing up at me when I articulated concern about a racially insensitive comment (I made several olive-branch attempts to reason with her on the importance of my speaking up); my father-in-law dramatically suggesting they not come to the wedding (for reasons we could not determine); and my mother-in-law uttering the morning after the wedding, "Now you don't have to worry about me trying to convince [my son] not to marry you anymore."

When my husband and I asked for "clarification" about this — not jumping to conclusions — my in-laws turned to gaslighting and said they did not want to speak to me until I dealt with my insecurity.

I have since opted out of interactions with them, and except for relatively transactional information-sharing, my husband has as well. Given his lifetime of being close with them, this has been very difficult for him, and I empathize.

I am now pregnant with twins, and they have — quite predictably — reframed their distance from us as "a kindness" as we went through difficult IVF procedures. My husband wants to find a path to reconcile with them, while they have made zero effort to reconnect. They have continued to judge me, my personality, my opinions, my family and my past despite their son being the happiest in his life.

Am I wrong in continuing to opt out of this relationship? I've suggested that if one or the other of them was declining, I'd do what was necessary to ensure that my husband did not have regrets after their passing.

## Trying to understand a love interest's concern about their 13-year age gap.

I’m facing a situation, and I honestly have no clue how to deal. I’m in a sort-of relationship with a man who is 13 years my senior (I’m 21), and we have a lot in common. I am genuinely attracted to him in more ways than sexually; he is just an incredible person. And he’s already expressed his attraction toward me.

The only thing that’s stopping us from going to the next level is the fact that he feels slightly uneasy about our age difference. I don’t — I like dating an older man, especially one who makes me feel the way he does. But this uneasiness comes between us; he keeps telling me that he wants to take things slowly and that he doesn’t want to “take advantage of my youth” (his words, letter for letter).

What does that mean? I tried asking him, but I get responses like, “You’re younger than me, and . . . I don’t know . . . ” or something along those lines. It frustrates me, because I’m really falling for him, and yes, yes, I’m young and a bit naive, but there is something there. I can feel it. How can I show him that we’ve got real potential, and help bring down the walls he’s placing in between us? Or, better yet, should I break down these walls?

## Sister is resentful towards more academically successful sibling.

I have always been the smart one. The sister was an average student, and I have always excelled in all areas of academia. This sounds conceited, I know, and I’m not writing off my sibling. She has many talents that I simply don’t possess, like the ability to make people feel comfortable.

My problem is that my sister despises me for my brains. I started school a year early, putting me just a grade behind her, although there is more than two years’ difference in age between us. I got better grades and more awards, and the attention paid to my successes made her feel horrible. I knew this and tried all through high school to play down my talents.

After graduation, she became a hairstylist and insists she loves her job. I went on to college. I am 19 and about to begin my junior year. I love my university and my studies, but every time I mention school in any way (an organization, a football game, a paper that’s due) my sister bashes the school and reminds everyone that she is out in the world earning money, not just studying “useless abstract things.” She has even become a fan of our rival school’s football team!

I try to avoid these “trigger” topics, but academics are my life. I want to pursue a career in research and teaching. I hate that my abilities have poisoned our relationship, but I think this is her problem, not mine. If she is as contented with her life as she claims to be, then she shouldn’t feel the need to bad-mouth my studies. How do I make the insults stop?

## Adult struggles with the perceived difficulty of making friends after college.

When I left school, I was fortunate to move to a city with virtually all my closest friends. But, as happens, we’ve all moved on to new phases of life, and virtually everyone has moved away.

I love my city, partner and career, but I am having a hard time shaking a really heavy sadness over feeling suddenly alone. I’m fairly independent and am happy to do things solo, but I’ve always preferred the company of others and relied on friends as an important outlet. Of course my friends haven’t stopped being my friends, but I miss the small day-to-day benefits of having friends nearby — being able to grab an impromptu dinner after a karpy day at work, or having someone to talk to about a new musical.

My partner is great, but I struggle with the feeling that my world has become limited to my relationship with him. I’m sure the solution is to make a few new friends, but it’s just so daunting as an adult. Any tips? Are there other solutions? Do I just have to accept that when you grow up, you do become more defined by your nuclear family and less by your friend family?

## Writer questions whether they are ready to commit to the person they're in love with.

I am 26 and in love. I have been in love before, but it is now clear to me that I would have been miserable if I had made a long-term commitment to a person I thought was perfect for me 10, five or even two years ago. I was just too young; I lacked perspective.

But how do I know that I'm old enough now to be able to judge whether my partner and I could be a good long-term fit? I FEEL as if I have a better sense of what sorts of things might come up and how we would handle them together vs. in college when I was mainly concerned with what felt good in the moment. But what if my 30-year-old self would someday think it was laughable that at this age I felt ready to settle down?

## Mother-in-law is trying to coerce her way into the delivery room for the birth of her grandson.

My mother-in-law is insisting she should be in the delivery room when my son is born. I don’t want extra people in the room, anyone other than my husband and my own mother. (I will be trying to do this drug-free.)

My husband feels as if he is between a rock and a hard place, since his mother and I are both adamant. But I think I get to choose, since I will be the one in labor.

I already told my mother-in-law I am uncomfortable with her presence during delivery, and she apparently spent a week crying about it, much to the dismay of my husband and father-in-law, who are pressuring me to change my mind, because they are used to giving her her way when she does the drama thing.

But I feel it is important to set some boundaries and not be manipulated. Do you think I am being unfair?

## Husband wants letter writer to cut ties with ex-sisters-in-law, who she still considers to be "my sisters."

My husband says that, because my two brothers divorced, their exes are out of our family. I am nice to my brothers’ new girlfriends, but the marriages were both for 20 years, and I think of the exes as my sisters.

Also, I’ve known my husband’s brother’s ex-wife since junior high school — longer than I’ve known my brother-in-law. We still hang out, and I consider her a good friend. My husband says my loyalty should be with the new women and none of the exes.

I don’t want to be thought of as disloyal, but I have a very hard time with this situation. I don’t want to have to pick one side.

## Letter writer struggles with guilt over complicated emotions regarding being a bridesmaid after her own "almost fiancé" broke up with her.

My almost-fiance and I broke up in January because we could not reconcile our futures. We had been together for more than three years and had planned on getting married for a long time. I have my engagement ring and everything. It has been really hard on me, because he was my best friend, and now we don’t speak.

This year, I am a bridesmaid in three separate weddings, and although I am happy for my friends, I often find the process painful. My friends have not been through serious breakups, so most of them don’t seem to understand (or want to understand) how I might be feeling. I try to put on a brave face for engagement photos, wedding plans, etc., but it leaves me feeling so drained and sad.

I am struggling to keep up the enthusiasm. Am I just bitter, immature and resentful for feeling this pain?

## Tension with partner over her co-dependency with a family member.

My partner is enmeshed with her family member. I think it may have something to do with a family trauma, and it may also be cultural.

I am wondering if there is any hope for a couple when one partner does not realize they are enmeshed. She sees their relationship as completely normal, but my boundaries are regularly violated: family member showing up to work events, last-minute changes of plan that I am forced into accommodating, family member getting angry when not included in private social events, shows of physical affection that seem inappropriate to me (but are cultural and not sexual, so I’m trying to get over my inner squick).

My partner and I know there is a problem, but we have different views on what the problem is. She views my boundaries as rejection and being rigid, and believes an outright refusal to involve her family member in certain areas of our lives puts her in an impossible position.

We have said out loud that we want our relationship to work, we want to do the work, and we are willing to look into counseling. We love each other.

But I feel so scared. This sort of thing seems so ingrained and cultural, and I fear that any attempt to make her see it will drive her away.

Can you please give me hope? Have others surmounted such steep challenges?

## Letter writer, after 3 births, feels shame over resenting mother-in-law for talking about weight and dieting.

I am fortunate to be very close with my mother-in-law. We see her often and chat frequently. She has struggled with her weight for most of her life, but in the last 20 years made significant changes and has become very fit.

After welcoming my third child, I am quite the opposite. I know I need to lose weight, and I am working with my therapist on overcoming the shame and inability to prioritize self-care. I still struggle and reach for the carbs and sugar, especially on the (frequent) mornings when I have barely slept.

My mother-in-law talks frequently about her diet, the foods she cannot eat, needing to watch calories, etc. It all adds to my feelings of shame. I know it’s my burden to carry (and unload), but I want to politely, kindly tell her to stop. Am I just being like my kids — a baby?

## Future sister-in-law stokes discomfort with her petty competitiveness.

I just got engaged to one of four brothers who are very close. My fiance’s oldest brother has been married to “Jackie” for a year. I sense Jackie is used to getting a lot of attention for being “the daughter we always wanted” to my future parents-in-law, and may also have some vision of herself as the up-and-coming family matriarch (gag).

I don’t care about any of this; I am just doing my own thing and hoping to get along with everyone. I happen to be a nurse practitioner and the first medical professional to join the family. I do not brag about this or really talk about it, but the family likes to bring it up when introducing me to new people.

Jackie seems to find it threatening and has started telling everyone who will listen that she also has a “nursing degree,” which is technically true but pretty misleading. She has an associate degree from a college where she took some pre-nursing courses, but her degree itself is in something else and she never attempted any licensure exams.

While I get these weird misstatements are about her and not me, and are not hurting anyone (unless she tries to intervene in someone’s medical emergency), it drives me crazy that she’s trying to make a competition out of something that isn’t one, and I’d really like to nip it in the bud. Any suggestions?

## Letter writer has lost trust in her serial cheater of a husband, but is hesitant to leave him because of the kids.

I have been married for about 28 years. My husband was always a little controlling and insecure. Over the years, as he has matured, he has gotten better in those areas.

I realized a few months after our second child was born that he was having an affair. As you can imagine, this was a very hard time. I was really surprised because, as far as I knew, he was not a cheater. However, a few years after that, he cheated again. This time, the woman was from out of town (she was a colleague), and he invited her to stay in our house, saying she was just a friend.

The kids were still little, and to be honest, I did not want this woman raising my kids, which is what would almost certainly have happened if we had divorced then.

Recently, I noticed he was still in contact with the second one through social media. He acted like he wasn’t aware and said he stopped contact.

At this point, I really cannot imagine how to improve this relationship. We are in counseling. He says he wants to stay together. I kind of feel numb toward him, and I really feel like I can’t trust him.

Is this relationship savable? If so, how? Also, how badly would a divorce impact older kids? A while back, a person wrote in about leaving his wife, and you seemed to indicate it was even worse for older kids than for younger, and I do not want to hurt my kids any more than we already have.

## Boyfriend who is still close with ex who still loves him refuses to set any boundaries.

My boyfriend is still in regular contact with his ex-girlfriend. He is her confidant, and she admits she still loves him. He keeps her posted on our relationship, which is rocky because I am jealous of their relationship. I am not allowed to set any boundaries about this.

I want to ask him to stop being her confidant and to stop telling her about our relationship. They can remain friends, just not with such intimate conversations. He absolutely refuses any boundaries because “I am not going to let you pick my friends.”

Should I just exit this situation? For context, he and I are on and off because of this, and he usually dates her again when we are off.

## Son who cut off contact with parents now wants to be at his mother's funeral.

Our son cut off contact with my wife and me about four years ago. After he started therapy, he suddenly started talking about his childhood in a way that we couldn’t understand. He said we had been emotionally abusive and eventually said that he needed to “go no contact” for his mental health. He also didn’t allow us to see his children, our grandchildren, to whom we were very close — especially my wife. I was very angry and my wife was heartbroken. Maybe there’s more we could have done, but we truly felt we tried everything to heal the distance between us. He has struggled with depression for years, and before he ended contact, we helped pay for his therapy and medication.

Tragically, my wife died suddenly from a heart condition. The funeral is next week and he wants to come. Given everything he put her through, I don’t want him there. I don’t think he deserves to be there. My sister says, “family is family,” but I’m not so sure about that.

## Husband is Scrooge during holidays because of past trauma. Wife resents this.

Is it fair for my husband, who doesn’t enjoy gifting and major holiday celebrations, to spoil them for me? He grew up in a family that argued 24/7, relentlessly. That was their primary style of communication, even on birthdays and special holidays, and everything came with a price tag.

I’m the opposite when it comes to entertaining, decorating, and the joy of finding creative, thoughtful presents for family and friends. He is more of an introvert. We’re well off, but entertaining is too much effort and gift giving is a waste of money to him. Instead, he buys one big birthday and Christmas gift for himself every year.

Even though I try to make the most of each holiday on my own terms, it is still a deeply disappointing, inwardly lonely experience. To me, his outlook is incredibly selfish and narcissistic. I’m well aware that he may be incapable of change, but how do I rationally cope with my ongoing resentment toward his insensitivity?

## Friend wants letter writer to censor themselves on Facebook because of political disagreements.

I have a friend who is on the opposite side of politics from me. She sent me this message: “After seeing your vile and disgusting lies on Facebook I have no desire to be friends with anyone on the left.”

We have never approached any private political conversation as we recognize there is no convincing each other to change our thinking. We agree to disagree, but she wants me to censor what I post on Facebook on her behalf. I think she should pause notifications of my posts if she doesn’t agree. I don’t think it’s fair of her to make these demands as she is the only friend who can’t endure my daily assault with reposts. They are not directed personally at her. She rarely posts anything and if she does, she doesn’t tag me. If she doesn’t like what I post, then she shouldn’t bother reading them.

This is the second time she has gotten so mad that she wouldn’t speak to me for at least a year. The first time (20 years ago) was when I didn’t realize that she had tucked a beaded necklace that she made inside something meaningless. I didn’t realize and gave the odd present to Goodwill.

What’s your take on all this?

## Long-lost friend calls two or three times a day. Letter writer wants to reduce this.

I have a buddy that I reconnected with after more than 10 years. I’ve known him 40 years. He lives in another state about seven hours away. I enjoy chatting with him and we cut up a lot.

The problem is he calls two to three times a day. He is 80 years old in good health, very active and a single guy.

He did lose his wife about two years ago, but he has lots of friends and family in the same city.

It drives me nuts for him to call so much. I’ve tried not answering and suggested texting is better for me. To no end, he calls two to three times a day. Telling him once a day at most is okay would make him mad. What do I do?

## Fiance's texts with coworker cross a line.

My boyfriend of four years and I moved in together and got engaged. Things were going very well initially — everything I had hoped.

However, I had been a little suspicious of his co-worker “Missy.” I confronted him and he confessed they had feelings for each other but nothing happened. I believe nothing physical happened, but it’s clear from texts he showed me that he emotionally cheated.

Missy has moved to another state, and he has agreed not to reach out to her again. But I am deeply hurt that he “fell” for someone else while we were beginning our life together. He proposed to me during this time and I feel deeply betrayed. He says I am overreacting and that crushes like his happen in long-term relationships. Am I overreacting?

## Quandary over what to write in the annual holiday Christmas card in light of an impending divorce.

My quandary is about Christmas cards. I am separated from my husband of 25 years, and while it’s mostly amicable, I feel disingenuous including him on the card this year. Our divorce will be final less than a month after Christmas. I am also going back to my maiden name so I thought it might be a good way to announce that as well. We share four children (and a cat) who I’d like to include. Any ideas on wording that is classy or funny to express this new family identity that doesn’t skew weird or inappropriate?

## Well-off couple struggles with how to keep gifts to adult children equitable.

My wife and I have three children in their 20s. We paid for their college educations; they have no debt.

Each has their own unique ambitions. My oldest child has a professional job, the youngest just graduated college and is still figuring out his path. My middle child will go to law school, and I plan to pay for it, for many reasons, but one of which is that I have plenty of money.

Other situations may arise, like perhaps advancing another child’s funds to purchase a house or something similar.

To sort of keep it fair, I was thinking that every time I make a tuition payment, I would also make a monetary gift to the other children.

Is this reasonable and if so, should I not advertise it to the law student? All the kids have a trust fund, so they will all inherit plenty of money at some point.

Rich problems, I know, but thanks all the same.

## Cultural and interpersonal conflicts with mother.

I’m in my mid-40s and have a tween daughter. I recently got divorced after being married to a White guy — who my family didn’t approve of — for 20 years. My dad sadly passed away, and my mom has been living with my sibling for the last several years. She didn’t want to live with me because of my ex, but now that I’m divorced she’s wanting to do all the things with me — move in, go on vacations, etc.

My daughter and mom can’t communicate well because of the language barrier and because my mom is hard of hearing. My mom puts in no effort to engage with her. I understand that after my dad’s passing she had to leave everything behind to move to a foreign country. However, she has quite a harsh tongue, criticizes liberally and hardly ever compliments anyone.

Post-divorce, I’m trying to do the best for my daughter and maintain the strong bond between us as she’s stepping into her teen years. I honestly do not want my mom to move in with me or go on all the vacations with me, but I understand my sibling can use a break. I’ve tried to be honest and speak openly with my family, but they say, “Mom will help you out with cooking, etc. since you are already overburdened with parenting and working a job.”

Being the youngest in the family, I didn’t learn how to build healthy boundaries. When I try to explain this situation to my family, I’m met with words that make me feel guilty, like, “You can’t even take care of your own mom?” Or, “What kind of a daughter are you?” Or, “Selfish!”

How do I handle this situation?

QUESTION: I was in what I thought was a long-term, loving relationship for over a year. My partner, "J", and I shared a lot of interests, got along mostly well, and overall really connected. We had even started talking about marriage, although only semi-seriously. But then J goes on a business trip for two weeks. On his last day, he calls me and says that he needs to take some time for himself. I thought, This is odd, but if he needs his space for a while and to recharge, then I'm all for it. But after this conversation, he dropped off the face of the earth. No calls, texts, e-mails. I called and texted him multiple times to try to understand what's going on, but I was continually met with silence. 

After two agonizing months of no contact from him at all, he calls me out of the blue one evening. He says he wants to pick up where we left off. I'm incensed. I gave him a piece of my mind and let him know that it's not acceptable to ghost your partner like that, especially given the level of commitment that I thought we had had. We had a big fight, and I told him that I never wanted to see him again. (I should note that I did ask him whether something tragic or drastic had happened, such as one of his parents passing away, and he said no, there was nothing like that. He didn't give a real explanation.) But now looking back, I feel guilty. Did I overreact?

ANSWER: Anyone who invests a year in a relationship, openly discusses marriage, and then gets cut off without warning would be shaken. A year together is a major emotional investment. When someone disappears at that stage, people often experience a kind of emotional disorientation—guilt, shame, confusion, and, very often, self-doubt. But it’s important to remember that he was the one who chose to walk out, and his choice reflects on him, not on your worth. You weren’t being overly dramatic. You were responding like any person would when a trusted partner suddenly vanishes.

A year together signals seriousness for most people. By that point, ending things by text already feels too abrupt and impersonal, let alone disappearing entirely. Ghosting after that level of intimacy isn’t a momentary lapse in judgment. It’s a deep breakdown in basic relational responsibility.

If he reaches out again hoping to reopen the conversation, you can keep your response simple:
"I'm not interested in revisiting this. You disappeared for two months without explanation, and I can't overlook that. I've moved on. I wish you well, but I'm not available for further contact."

That isn't punishment. It’s a boundary.

It’s also worth remembering that two months is a sixth of your entire relationship and longer than many relationships last in total. You deserve someone who honors your time and your presence instead of leaving for an extended period and returning only when it’s convenient for him. If working through all of this brings up self-doubt or lingering guilt, a therapist can be a helpful partner in making sense of what happened—not because you did anything wrong, but because experiences like this can shake your sense of stability. A good therapist can help you internalize that this rupture was about his avoidance, not your value, and sometimes hearing that clearly and consistently is the best medicine as you move forward.

QUESTION: My boyfriend of a year and a half broke up with me last month. Like most breakups, it wasn't pleasant. Our issues were multiple: we didn't see eye-to-eye on finances. He was more religious than me and was becoming dissatisfied that I didn't want to convert to his faith. I didn't get along well with parts of his family and a few other things. I realize that you and most advice columnists would probably see these as a big deal, and I mean they are, I admit that. But the frustrating thing is, when it was just the two of us watching Netflix or eating dinner or just talking, it felt magical. During those moments, I felt that we really did have a long-term future together. But I suppose the cliché is true: love alone isn't enough.

At least he had the courage to end things in person. We went to our favorite restaurant, and as we were finishing dinner, he told me he had something to tell me. He explained that while he loves me and I will always have a part of his heart, at our core we just aren't compatible. He cited some issues I mentioned above. I was very hurt, but I acknowledged his right to end things. After all, all relationships have to be mutual.

After that dinner, I moved out, and I've been living with my sister until I can find a place to live alone again. The reason I'm writing to you is that I still really want closure, but he doesn't seem interested. I want to know what I could have done differently, and I have some questions for him concerning how we might have been able to resolve some of our differences, like in terms of finance and family. I feel that he did not fully explain his reasons for ending things, and I didn't get closure as a result. I feel he left me hanging when it came to some of the particulars. Am I right to feel this way? Is there a way that I can get closure from him, or should I just drop this?

ANSWER: The hardest breakups, and the ones that often leave us with the most questions, are usually the ones where nobody did anything “wrong.” When a relationship ends this way, it’s common to feel blindsided, especially after investing a year and a half of your life. Wanting a fuller explanation isn’t a sign that you’re stuck or unreasonable; it’s a very human attempt to make sense of a meaningful loss.

The desire for closure is rooted in a powerful need to create a narrative around painful events. Without one, it’s easy to get caught in a loop of unanswered questions and imagined alternatives. But people process breakups differently. Some want to talk everything through, while others need distance to move on. Neither approach is inherently wrong, but when those needs don’t align, there often isn’t a satisfying middle ground. In situations like this, unless there’s some unusual or unresolved circumstance, continuing to press for answers usually prolongs the pain rather than easing it.

If you feel the urge to text or call him in search of closure, it can help to pause and tell yourself something like: “This relationship ended, and it hurts. I may never know every detail of what he was thinking, and that’s okay. Sometimes the fit just isn’t there, and I don’t need a complete explanation in order to heal or move forward.” That isn’t resignation; it’s self-protection.

Instead of anchoring your healing to an explanation he may never be willing or able to give, try grounding yourself in what you already know. The differences you described—around finances, religion, and family—are substantial, and any one of them is enough to end a relationship, let alone all of them combined. And regardless of how things ended, you’re still you: someone worthy of love, compatibility, and stability.

What you're going through is common, but I know that doesn't make it hurt any less. If you find yourself stuck in self-doubt or rumination, a therapist can be a helpful partner in sorting through those feelings. Learning to let your own understanding, rather than someone else’s explanation, carry the weight of your healing is not only less emotionally risky; it’s also far more empowering.

QUESTION: My brother has a good friend who he seems to have a love-hate relationship with. The friend is less "conventionally successful" than my brother. For instance, while my brother has multiple advanced degrees and a six-figure job, the friend has "only" a bachelor's degree and a job that pays tens of thousands of dollars less than my brother's. (I say "only" a bachelor's degree not to minimize that achievement, but just to try to create more context, hence the quotes around the word.) My brother also has a group of tech friends that he hangs out with (he works in the tech industry), and I think he gets a lot out of being around people who he sees as closer to his success level. My brother is also married, for what it's worth, while his friend is in what the friend himself admits is a dead marriage. Long story, but for our purposes, it's another status mismatch between the two.

My brother pays lip service to not caring about these superficial factors, but his actions tell a different story. My brother always talks about hanging out with the friend begrudgingly, as if it's a chore or obligation he has to do, like going to the supermarket. And my brother is always trying to postpone or shorten their gatherings. The friend never seems to mind. Whether that's out of otherworldly emotional restraint and perspective, or desperation, or something else, I'm not sure. The friend has always struggled socially, while my brother, even though he's had his own issues, has generally done better.

Is it wrong of me to consider talking to my brother about this? I mean, his friendships really should be his business, but it hurts to see him treating his friend like this. Is that my place to talk with him about this? Or is this something I should just let go?

ANSWER: It must be quite painful to see your own brother engaging in actions that harm others. You clearly care about the friend and your brother. So you're not wrong to feel hurt even though your brother's actions aren't directed at you. You don't mention that there's been any outright abuse in this friendship. Had there been, the case for intervention would have been a slam dunk. Assuming no abuse, this is a tough nut to crack. You want your brother to treat his friend better, but you also don't want to get involved in his life. You respect his autonomy as I'm sure you would want him to respect yours. But yet you also see him engaging in actions that violate your moral compass.

But that being said, I think this issue is more complex than just your brother's autonomy vs. compassion. This is a situation where you don't have to speak up right away, unprovoked (again, if there was abuse, then the advice would be very different). But the next time the topic of the friend comes up, and especially if your brother says something dismissive towards him, then you might want to speak up. You might say something like the following: "[Brother], I know that your friendships are your own business, but as your sister and as a friend, I can't help but notice that you've been treating your friend a bit dismissively. This conveys to the friend that you don't think that he's worthy of your time. Would you like to be treated like that?"

Such a conversation might be hard, but if your brother is open-minded and willing to reconsider his attitudes, then that will help far more people than just his friend. Being reminded of where we're falling short when it comes to compassion and empathy can help us grow in ways that benefit us all. And if he pushes back or chooses not to engage, you can still take some peace in knowing that you spoke up in a way that was measured, compassionate, and aligned with your values. Sometimes doing that is all that’s within our control, and sometimes that’s enough.

QUESTION: I recently ended things with my girlfriend, and now I regret having done so. It's always easy to idealize somebody after a breakup, but in this case, she really was the total package: kind, compassionate, very smart, and seemed to really love me. So why did I let her go? Because of family pressure. 

Our family has always focused on academic achievement. In my immediate family alone, there are two doctors, a lawyer, and an accountant. I myself am a professor at a mid-sized regional university. I was raised to believe in the value of education. Unfortunately, in our case, this too often veered into perfectionism. And even worse, into mistreatment or dismissal of others who didn't meet our lofty academic standards. 

My ex is a social worker with "only" an undergrad degree from a state school. She also had always done well in school, but it wasn't her life. She cared more about improving the world and other passions like art. That's a major reason why I fell for her, but it's also why my family never truly accepted her. Sometimes they paid lip service to accepting her, but more often they would make snarky comments behind her back about how she didn't measure up or how she wasn't "Yale material." Those comments affected me more than I thought. Last month, I found myself telling her that we just weren't a good fit. I never really explained why, but she was smart enough to figure it out. She said something to the effect of, "Well, if you think you're too good for me, then I never want to see you again." Which I deserved.

I sorely regret ending things. Is there a way back into her life? Or even failing that, should I simply reach out to her to apologize? It's been a few weeks, and we haven't talked since that conversation. We didn't live together or have kids or anything, so it was a relatively easy split logistically. But emotionally, I'm still tied in knots. Help?

ANSWER: You were clearly caught between a woman you loved and a family that possesses a narrow definition of success in life. And now you regret having listened to your family rather than honoring your own feelings and those of the person that you were with. It was an awful situation, and I'm sorry you had to go through it. But it seems like a hard lesson in what not to do when faced with conflict between family expectations and what your heart is telling you.

I would not attempt further contact with her. You ended things. She made it clear she didn't want to interact with you anymore. And even though you didn't respect her life choices during the relationship, you should at least respect her choice now to end contact with you. If by chance she does reach out to you, which would probably be for logistical reasons rather than any interest in renewing your relationship, do not attempt to win her back. You can tell her something like, "I'm so sorry for how I treated you. I don't expect you to forgive me, and I certainly don't expect you to take me back. But I just wanted to express that I feel awful for having treated you so poorly. You didn't deserve that, and I didn't deserve you." And mean it.

If she doesn't reach out, don't reach out to her. You seem wracked with guilt and a strong need to apologize to her. But reaching out would probably do more harm than good, especially since she expressed the wish to not see you again. And she would likely take an unsolicited apology as an empty gesture meant more to comfort you than to sincerely atone for the mistakes that you made and the hurt that you caused. Guilt can be a useful signal to us to do better. Now that you're more aware of how others' opinions can sway you and of some of your own blind spots, you'll be better equipped for future relationships. Let this person go. Do better next time.

QUESTION: My wife and I are facing a quandary concerning faith. When we met, we were at a somewhat different place regarding religion, but we felt that we were basically compatible. Long story short, she believes in God, I don't, but we both have the same basic values. I let her know of my leanings early on, and she was always accepting. She comes from a very religious family, but questions many aspects of organized religions, particularly the one that she was raised in. We went through a rough patch with her parents accepting me because of the religious issues, but we moved beyond that.

Now, however, we seem to be moving in opposite directions. If you can imagine a 0-to-10 scale with respect to warmth towards religion, with 0 being completely cold to religion and 10 being extremely accepting, as of this time a year ago, I was probably about a 4 while she was a 6 or 7. But now she's probably an 8 or a 9, while I'm a 2. For a variety of reasons, not least of which is the current political climate in this country, I'm feeling even more turned off by religion than I was a year or two ago. But at the same time, she's interested in re-exploring the faith she grew up in. She's even singing in a church choir and has been for a few months. Recently, I saw a cross which had been banished to our garage, now in our guest bedroom on the bed.

How can we accommodate this difference? We haven't had any arguments over it yet, but I feel that there's some tension. I want to respect her faith and her own spiritual decisions, but my allergic reaction to religion makes that difficult. How can we both coexist under the same roof with different attitudes towards religion?

ANSWER: Religious differences can be particularly painful because they often involve not only abstract belief but also matters of identity, family, and morality. And when one feels that a fragile equilibrium in their life is disrupted, it's often unsettling. Particularly when that fragile equilibrium was perceived to protect them from something that's long been triggering. But it sounds like you and your wife are both coming from a place of compassion and respect. That matters a great deal. 

This will position you better to explore the thorny issues your letter raises. I would sit down with her and have a calm, respectful conversation regarding your religious differences. Mention that you've observed her re-embracing the faith that she grew up in. Don't express judgment or condemnation. Then give your side of the story--that religion is still triggering for you and you need a certain degree of space from it. You might even remind her of one or two examples, if you can keep from turning it into a laundry list of grievances. You might say something like, "Honey, I know that we have differences in opinion regarding religion and its place in our lives. But I want us to come to a solution that honors and respects both of us, our shared space, and our respective mental and emotional health. What are your suggestions?"

Such a conversation is important because ultimately, a compromise will be needed here. Maybe she can place the cross in a room that only she mostly uses. Maybe you agree to attend services with her once or twice a month when her choir is singing. And these services need not all be in person. Many churches now offer hybrid services; that is, services both online and in-person. If she's amenable to it, maybe you can agree to an arrangement like you attending church once a month when she's singing, and for the rest of the services, you watch virtually. This could be a way of supporting her without being in the triggering environment as much. And, of course, she should agree to give you the space to explore your own philosophy and ideas without judgment. There are many secular groups in many parts of the country such as the Ethical Society, humanist groups, and atheist groups. I have known multiple non-religious people who have found much of the same community and sense of purpose in these groups as many others do in churches, but without the beliefs or rituals that they find problematic.

By marrying into a religious family, apparently you're already accommodating religion to a certain extent. Remember also that making these accommodations for your wife doesn't imply that you believe what she does or vice versa. Making modest accommodations for each other isn't surrender. It's displaying love and respect. And ultimately, that's what life should be all about, whether or not one is devout.

QUESTION: My dad and I have a complex relationship. Growing up, my household was fairly traditional. He was the main breadwinner, my mother stayed at home during most of my childhood, and he had very traditional attitudes about who should be in charge of the household. On the plus side, he provided for us well financially. He was able to give three kids a materially comfortable childhood and then send all of those kids to college without them owing a dime in debt, all with a mostly non-working spouse. An achievement that neither I nor most others in my generation would be able to replicate. And he was always there for my sports practices and taught me a lot about work ethic. On the negative side of the ledger, he had serious problems with anger. He was unable to control his anger, and that frequently made the house a terrifying place to live in. He never physically abused us aside from spanking, which is seen as abuse in some quarters. But he would often erupt at the smallest provocation and would do things like destroy my toy planes that he and I had built together when I was a small child. He made it clear that we should live in fear of him. All of us, including my mom, walked on eggshells. 

Now I'm in my 40s. I don't have kids of my own partly due to my own difficult childhood. But I am married, and I try every day to treat my spouse and others differently than my father treated us. Now my father is in his mid-70s. Given his family's historical longevity, he has maybe ten years left. Perhaps add one or three for modern medical advances that weren't around when his own parents were in their last years. My dilemma is whether I should confront him about what happened long ago. I feel that confronting him might give me a sense of closure if I make clear that what he did wasn't okay, and that he should at least acknowledge it, if not apologize for it. And I worry that if I don't talk to him about it within the next few years, then I will forever lose my chance to do so and forever regret it. Another part of me says that I probably wouldn't get an apology from him anyway, and that pursuing one is just a recipe for emotional disappointment. That would compound the pain he inflicted even more. What should I do?

ANSWER: When somebody you love hurts you deeply, it often leaves scars that last for a long time. Many people feel the need to try to close these wounds by confronting the person who caused them. But in any situation, not just this one, conditioning healing or closure upon somebody else's approval or apology is setting ourselves up for painful disappointment.

A recurring theme in this and other advice columns is boundaries. That is, setting appropriate boundaries for people who cause harm, be it intentional or otherwise. In your particular case, though, the tragedy is that children can't really set boundaries in the same way that adults can. They lack the power to do so. So your father's constant violations of reasonable boundaries in your household, against you and your siblings and your mother, happened apparently unimpeded. At this point, the boundary that you now have the power to set is with your own expectations. I would not recommend reaching out to him if the purpose is to gain an apology or otherwise get closure from him. Considering he's not reached out to you about this in all these years, all these decades, it's unlikely he'll be receptive to your message now. Confronting him directly would likely reopen old wounds without giving you what you want.

I would recommend a more introspective approach. Write him a letter you know he will never read because you will never give it to him. In this letter, don't pull punches. Don't hold back. Tell him exactly how his actions make you feel, how they hurt you, and what you want from him now. In many cases, people find that this exercise enables them to defuse a lot of pain and emotional tension, and it reduces their urge to confront the person for real. And if you aren't already, you might also consider working with a therapist to help you process some of these issues. Your dad's treatment of you was definitely not okay, but you don't need to compound the pain by hoping for a closure that probably will never come. Your past self deserved better, and you deserve better now.

QUESTION: Growing up, my sister was always the favorite child. There are two of us, and she's the older one by two and a half years. Consistently, as we went through school and then started our adult lives, our parents would pay more attention to her than to me. Let's call her Rosie. My parents would praise Rosie's grades much more than mine, even though we usually brought home similar report cards throughout our schooling. Rosie also participated in several sports, including swimming, while I leaned towards more academically oriented extracurriculars. Our parents attended almost every one of her athletic events and would give her high praise, even when she or her team didn't do well. By contrast, whenever I would win an academic bowl or a forensics tournament, our parents might give an off-handed "good job" at best. Usually they didn't even seem to notice. 

This is continued into adulthood. When Rosie's first child was born a few years ago, her parents were overjoyed. As one might expect at the birth of a first grandchild, or really any grandchild. They showered her with presents and praise and offered to do whatever she needed when it came to babysitting, etc. (We live only about an hour away from our parents.) But now, I'm expecting my first child, and our parents seem almost like they don't care. They congratulated me at first when I told them the news, but they haven't bestowed anywhere near the attention on me that they did on Rosie during her pregnancy. I shudder to think what will happen once my child is born. I fear that my parents will replicate their dysfunctional favoritism to the next generation, such that my children might start to feel resentful or less than because of their grandparents' behavior. My husband and I have sworn that we would never do that to our children, that we would treat them equally and not engage in favoritism. So we certainly don’t want the grandparents replicating their mistakes with the next generation. 

Do you think I should keep grandparents at bay after our children are born? Rosie and I already have a fairly distant relationship, mostly because of what happened as children. I don't want my children to grow up feeling that their worth is any less than anybody else's just because their grandparents can't figure out how to treat children equally. But I do want them to have a meaningful and rich relationship with their grandparents, especially since my own relationship with mine was mine. How should we handle this?

ANSWER: I think that most parents worry about the perpetuation of dysfunctional patterns onto their own children. This is especially true when the issue is parental favoritism. Favoritism can create emotional scars and ruptures that last a lifetime. It teaches children that some are more worthy of love than others and it erodes sibling bonds by pitting children against each other in a brutal contest for parental favor. It can also harm the favored child by creating a sense of entitlement and a sense that actions don't have consequences or, at least, consequences that are as severe as for other people. I've seen this a lot in my own life. But I'm sure you intuitively know all this already. In your case, it seems like you're torn between the hope of keeping your parents in your future kids' lives while not wanting them to be negatively affected by what your parents inflicted on you. That's a tough place to be in. But I also worry that you're reacting to problems that haven't happened yet, however likely it seems that they will in the future. 

I would take the approach of "trust but verify." Assume good intentions from the grandparents until you see evidence otherwise. At the same time, don't be naive. Try to be there as much as you can when the grandparents are over so that you can observe how they interact with your kids. If you observe problematic behavior, intervene. Pull your parents aside and say something like: “Mom and Dad, my children and I love you. But when we see you exercising favoritism for Rosie's children over mine, such as [Examples A and B], it sends the wrong message to both sets of children. Can you work on treating all of your grandchildren more equally in the future?”

If they won't play ball, limit your children's interaction with your parents. And if this keeps happening, you might want to make the hard decision to keep your children separate from their grandparents until the grandparents express a genuine wish to treat their grandchildren more fairly, and then you see evidence of this. It would be heartbreaking to have to explain to your children why they don't get to see their grandparents very often. But the emotional harm that your grandparents will cause if they play the same favoritism game with their grandchildren outweighs this concern. Ultimately, you might have to end up doing for your parents what they failed to do for you and your sister: modeling an equitable approach to children. Love alone can't justify knowingly subjecting your children to cruel and arbitrary treatment.

QUESTION: I'm 15. My parents are going through a nasty divorce. I won't bore you with the details, but they are using me as a go-between. My father is living in an apartment with his new girlfriend, so cliche. And I'm at home with my mother. Since the court hasn't ruled yet, our family is working out visitation practices on the fly. For example, I spent last weekend with my dad, and he also got to see me Wednesday and Thursday of the week before that. There's no rhyme or reason to it. 

But that's small potatoes compared with the main problem. My parents don't seem to be capable of speaking to each other unless they are yelling. My mother will often ask me to “tell your father that I will be dropping off his clothes at such-and-such time.” My father might tell me something like, “Ask your mother why she won't set our court date yet and also why she's being such a bitch.” I’m sorry to use that word, but it's important for context. They are also constantly bad-mouthing each other to me behind their backs and clearly want me to side with one over the other. This is devastating to me.

I don't want to be my parents' messenger pigeon. I want them both to love me equally, and I want to have a good relationship with both. I don't want to have to choose between them. Is this going to be my life for the rest of their days, or is there some way out of this?

ANSWER: I’m so sorry that you have to go through that. No child deserves to be treated as a go-between by their parents. And no child should be forced into the heartbreaking position of having to choose one parent over the other. This is not only deeply unfair, but it also teaches children to be perpetually wary of those who are supposed to love them the most, lest their trust be betrayed again. It teaches children terrible lessons about communication, basic decency, and how to "fight fair" with a spouse or partner, including during a breakup or divorce.

I know all this sounds scary. But the good news is that you do have some tools at your disposal. And you seem to have a good head on your shoulders. The road ahead will be hard, but there are ways to lighten the burden.

You can start by having a difficult but important conversation with your parents, presumably separately. You might tell them, for instance, to not insult the other and to not try to get you to pick sides. You can encourage them to talk to the other parent directly whenever possible. If you need a “script,” then you can say something like the following: “I love you. But when you fight with [Other Parent], it hurts me a lot. I want to feel loved and accepted by both of you, and I don't want to feel that you are using me to get back at the other person. Can you please stop making me choose between you and [Other Parent]?”

There are also resources out there to help you, and I encourage you to take advantage of them. For instance, have you talked to your school guidance counselor about the problem? They might be able to refer you to some resources that could help. Also, while I don't know the exact details of your parents’ legal situation, in many cases, there will be a court-appointed child advocate to speak up for children in situations like yours. If you have one already, then please go to them and talk to them about how best to handle this difficult situation. If you don’t have one, then ask one of your parents' attorneys or an official at the court during the next legal hearing if you can be provided with one. These professionals are trained to represent children's interests in cases like yours.

From your letter, it's evident that you have a lot of courage and you're trying to do what's right. In closing, I want to make it very clear that none of this is your fault. The problem is between your parents, not with you. And none of the pain that you're going through should be interpreted as a result of something you did wrong. You are just caught in a very hard situation, and you seem to be doing your best to manage it. Best of luck to you.

QUESTION: I'm male, 40 years old, work in tech. For a few years now, I've been attending a professional meetup of other tech enthusiasts and professionals. We meet a few times a month and engage in activities such as discussing technical books, delivering presentations, but mostly just hanging out and coding. My first year in the group, I met another guy, let's call him John. John and I seemed to be fast friends. We were both interested in the same types of technology and seemed to have compatible personalities. I was a bit further along in tech than he was, so I sort of took on a mentorship role. But over time, he's learned a lot too. More importantly, we've hung out a lot outside of tech, doing things like movie nights, going bowling together, and meeting up for coffee. We even write each other Christmas cards. 

The problem is that over time, this friendship has gotten to be one-sided. Over the last year or two, I'm virtually always the only one to initiate. I'm always the one to suggest going out for coffee or going to see a movie or having lunch. And this is also the case in deeper aspects of the friendship. For instance, he has a disabled adult nephew. I often come over and perform basic tasks, such as helping to prepare meals or simply just talking to the nephew, which considerably eases the burden on the rest of the family. This isn't to toot my own horn, but just to establish context. But when it comes to reciprocity, John's nowhere to be found. My wife is on disability, and I have a niece who's been struggling with a nasty eating disorder and has had to live at home instead of leaving town for college. When I ask John to do simple things, such as drive me to my niece's medical appointment when my car is in the shop, or to just simply come over and help with my family the same way I help with his, he's nowhere to be found. He's always making excuses such as “I'm too tired” or “I have to work tomorrow.” Oh and also when I ran a marathon last year, he was nowhere to be found - either in encouraging me before the race when I was going through grueling training or in going to see the actual event. But when his local hockey league plays games, I'm almost always there. I realize that everybody has an outside life, but after years of this, you start to wonder. 

It's gotten to a point where this is one-sided and exhausting. None of my other friends are like this. I feel guilty complaining about this and I don't want to hurt John's feelings. That's why I haven't brought this up before. But this isn't sustainable. What should I do? 

ANSWER: A friendship where one person does all the giving becomes unsustainable over time. When such arrangements persist for years, people often feel taken advantage of and even like they're being used. You understandably want reciprocity, but he seems to not be delivering. Lack of reciprocity can destroy a friendship like death by a thousand cuts. It can also cause lasting feelings of distrust that might spill over into other relationships in a person's life. And in your case, you don't want to hurt your friend's feelings, but you also have come to feel that the situation is untenable. 

The reality, though, is that sometimes you have to risk hurting someone's feelings to stand up for yourself. While every person and every relationship is different, most people do agree that there needs to be a degree of reciprocity in a friendship, especially with respect to the big things, such as family caregiving or supporting the other person in a big life event. If a friendship stops being a two-way street, then it risks becoming a burden or even a dependency. And this is something that most people don't want.

I recommend having a conversation with John where you respectfully but firmly lay out the problem and your boundaries. You could say something like, "Hey John, I really like having you as a friend and hanging out with you, but I've noticed that I initiate almost all of our hangouts and that you haven't come to important things of mine, such as helping out with family or coming to my marathon, whereas I have tried to do those things for you as much as I can. How can we fix this?"

If he responds amicably, then it's just a matter of nudging the balance in a more equitable direction, probably over time. The challenge in this case will be to try to make things more equitable without falling into the trap of “bean counting.” And if this happy outcome does come to pass, then you can ignore the rest of this letter. But if his response is unfriendly, such as being defensive or stonewalling, or even just apathetic (which can be just as hostile in its own way) then you might want to reconsider how you've been investing your time. In this case, you might have to decide whether his companionship is worth the emotional and logistical stress of him relying on you for important things, but not being able to do the same yourself. Retaining a friendship with someone you care about isn't worth it if the friendship is drastically one-sided and you're carrying all of the burden. Sometimes doing the hard thing and ending a friendship and hurting the other person's feelings is necessary to shift your time investment to people who have your back as well.

QUESTION: My mother was abusive throughout my childhood. Emotionally, verbally, sometimes physically. I cut contact with her years ago, and that distance has been necessary for my mental health. Recently, she died. My sister, who was also abused but to a lesser degree, is now furious with me because I refuse to help plan the funeral or attend it. She says that “family is family” and that I’m being cruel by refusing to participate. I feel numb more than anything else. Am I obligated to show up just because she’s dead?

ANSWER: No one is obligated to perform grief on demand. And no one is required to honor someone who caused them harm simply because that person has died. Death does not retroactively transform abuse into love, nor does it impose new moral debts on the people who were hurt.

What you’re describing is not indifference. It’s emotional exhaustion and self-protection after a long history of pain. For many people who grew up with abuse, numbness is not a failure to grieve. It’s the nervous system finally standing down after years of vigilance. That response deserves respect, not judgment.

Your sister’s anger is understandable, but it does not override your experience. People who endured different degrees or forms of abuse often arrive at different conclusions about what they owe, if anything, to the person who harmed them. Some need rituals. Some need distance. Some need silence. None of these responses are morally superior to the others.

You can acknowledge your sister’s grief without sacrificing your own wellbeing. That might sound like: “I understand that this loss is painful for you, and I respect your need to mourn in your own way. I’m not able to participate, and that boundary is about my own health, not a judgment of you.”

Funerals are for the living. But they are not for everyone. Protecting yourself now is not cruelty. It’s honesty, practiced late but carefully.

QUESTION: I’m getting married soon, and I’m seriously considering not inviting my father. He has been verbally abusive and relentlessly negative my entire life. We’re currently not speaking. He’s elderly and in poor health, and some relatives say I’ll regret excluding him. Am I being too rigid by not wanting him at my wedding?

ANSWER: A wedding is not a referendum on forgiveness, nor is it a moral obligation to reopen relationships that have caused consistent harm. It is a day that places you in a vulnerable emotional position, and it is reasonable to want that day to be as safe and grounded as possible.

Relatives often invoke regret as a way of pressing people into tolerating mistreatment. But regret is not a one-way street. Many people regret inviting someone who has hurt them into a space that was meant to be joyful, especially when that person behaves exactly as they always have. Age and illness do not erase patterns. If anything, they make change less likely, not more.

It’s important to be clear about what this choice is and isn’t. You are not excluding your father to punish him. You are choosing not to expose yourself to a situation that history suggests will be painful. That distinction matters.

If reconciliation were genuinely possible, it would begin with accountability and repair, not an invitation. You are allowed to decide that your wedding is no place for unfinished business.

You can hold this boundary calmly and without debate. “This is what I need in order to feel present and protected on my wedding day” is a complete explanation. Anyone who cannot accept that is asking you to prioritize appearances over wellbeing.

QUESTION: My adult children have limited contact with me because of how my second husband treated them when they were growing up. He was harsh and controlling. There was yelling but no physical abuse. I didn’t intervene as much as I should have, and now my kids say I never chose them. I’m devastated and don’t know how to move forward.

ANSWER: This is a devastating place to find yourself, and there’s no way to soften that. What your children are responding to is not only how your husband behaved, but how alone they felt while it was happening. When a parent does not intervene, children often experience that as abandonment, even if the parent was also overwhelmed, afraid, or conflicted.

One of the hardest truths here is that intention and impact are not the same. You may have believed you were keeping the peace, protecting the household, or surviving a difficult marriage. Your children experienced a parent who did not step in when they needed protection. Both things can be true at once.

If there is a path forward, it begins with acknowledgment rather than explanation. That means resisting the urge to contextualize your choices too quickly, even if your reasons felt real and complex. Repair starts with something like: “I didn’t protect you the way I should have. I understand why that hurt you, and I’m sorry.” Full stop.

After that, the timeline belongs to them. They may need distance. They may never return to the relationship you want. Accepting that is part of accountability, painful as it is. The goal is not to feel forgiven. The goal is to become someone safer now than you were then.

QUESTION: My husband’s parents are openly hostile toward me and have questioned our marriage. I’ve opted out of seeing them. Now I’m pregnant with twins, and they suddenly want access. Am I wrong to keep my distance?

ANSWER: You are not wrong to protect yourself, and by extension your children, from people who have shown you sustained disrespect. Pregnancy does not obligate you to reopen relationships that were harmful before it began.

The crucial distinction here is between reconciliation and access. Reconciliation requires accountability and changed behavior. Access requires only opportunity. What your in-laws are asking for sounds like the latter without offering the former.

It is reasonable to say that relationships with your children will be shaped by how you are treated. That is not leverage. It is reality. When someone consistently undermines or disrespects a parent, they undermine the family unit as a whole.

Your husband’s role matters. Supporting you does not necessarily mean cutting off his parents. It does mean respecting the boundaries you need to feel safe and supported, especially during a physically and emotionally demanding time.

Twins will require enough of you. You are not obligated to carry unresolved family conflict alongside that responsibility.

QUESTION: I’m 21 and interested in a man who is 13 years older than me. He says he’s attracted to me but hesitant because he doesn’t want to “take advantage of my youth.” I don’t know what to make of that.

ANSWER: His hesitation is not a red flag. In fact, it suggests that he’s thinking seriously about power, timing, and responsibility rather than ignoring them.

Age gaps are not inherently wrong, but they do introduce asymmetries in life experience, stability, and power that deserve attention. What matters is not your age alone, but whether both of you feel free to slow down, to take a serious look at the situation, and to discuss these difficult matters as equals. Because if there's any asymmetry in how the two of you talk about the question of whether to have a relationship in the first place, these asymmetries are going to reappear again and again during an actual relationship.

His concern may reflect care rather than ambivalence. At the same time, attraction alone does not resolve these questions. If this relationship were to move forward, it should do so slowly and transparently, with space for you to articulate your needs and expectations clearly.

If he remains stuck in hesitation, that may simply mean he is not available for the kind of relationship you want right now. That can be disappointing without being anyone’s fault.

Sometimes care expresses itself not through action, but through restraint.

QUESTION: My sister resents me for being more academically successful. She says I make her feel inferior, even when I try to downplay my achievements. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells.

ANSWER: It’s exhausting to feel responsible for someone else’s sense of worth, especially when you didn’t create the comparison in the first place. You are allowed to exist fully as yourself without shrinking to manage someone else’s discomfort.

Your sister’s resentment likely reflects unresolved feelings about her own path rather than anything you’ve done wrong. While empathy is appropriate, self-erasure is not a sustainable solution. Playing smaller rarely heals envy. More often, it entrenches it.

You can acknowledge her feelings without accepting blame. “I’m proud of my work, and I don’t intend that as a judgment of you” is a reasonable boundary. If she continues to lash out, it may be necessary to limit how much of yourself you share with her.

Healthy relationships allow for difference without punishment.

QUESTION: I’m estranged from a sibling, and my parents keep pushing us to “make peace.” They say it’s breaking their hearts. What should I do?

ANSWER: Parents often want resolution because conflict threatens their sense of family cohesion. That desire is understandable, but peace imposed from above rarely heals what’s broken below.

Without more context, it's hard to know exactly what advice to give. What exactly happened to cause the estrangement? If it's a matter of abuse, then certainly you have no obligation to reconcile, whether to "make peace" or for any other reason. (In this context, "abuse" can be defined as bullying or other forms of physical and/or verbal attacks, especially on a consistent basis.) When abuse has taken place, you're absolutely within your rights to keep distance and to restrict or completely halt any sort of communication with your sibling. Family ties and your parents' expectations don't justify damaging your mental health by allowing an abusive sibling into your life.

If the problem is less serious than abuse, then the situation becomes a bit more nuanced. I have known situations of sibling estrangement that weren't caused by abuse, but rather by personality differences, a history of sibling rivalry, or some other complicated factor where one really can't "blame" either side for the estrangement. If the issue falls into this category and you feel a genuine desire to reconnect with your sibling, then I would encourage you to reach out. Say something like, "[Sibling], I know that we've been a bit distant from each other because of [X]. But I would like for us to be closer. How can we work together to build a stronger relationship?"

The wording of your letter, however, implies that you're either hesitant or opposed to reaching out to your sibling. And if this is the case, then you're under no obligation to do so. Once we become adults, our relationships with other members of our family of origin become strictly voluntary. In this respect, it's a bit like if you had a good friend you'd grown apart from over time, either because of a falling out or because your lives and interests diverged. In that case, you'd be well within your rights to decide not to try to rekindle the friendship. 

If reconciliation were possible, it would require willingness and accountability on both sides. Pressure cannot substitute for repair. You can empathize with your parents’ sadness without sacrificing your own boundaries.

It’s fair to say to them: “I understand this is hard for you. But I’m not willing to reconnect under pressure or pretense. If I do decide to reconnect with [Sibling], then it will be on my own timeline and for my own reasons.” That response is honest without being cruel.

Sometimes the most loving choice is to stop pretending a relationship exists when it doesn’t.

QUESTION: My best friend is going through a divorce and calls me almost every night to vent. At first I wanted to be there for her, but it’s been months now, and every conversation turns into a two-hour monologue about her ex. I’m emotionally exhausted and starting to dread her calls. Am I a bad friend if I pull back?

ANSWER: Wanting to be there for someone during a painful chapter of their life does not mean you are required to absorb their pain indefinitely. There is a difference between being supportive and being smothered.

Your inclination to pull back appears to be a conflict between wanting to be there for your friend and the need to protect your own time and mental health. Sacrificing the latter in the name of your love and concern for your friend isn't really tenable for either of you. That doesn’t make you uncaring. It means you have limits. When those limits are ignored for long enough, even the most generous people begin to feel resentment, dread, and withdrawal. Those feelings are signals, not moral failures.

Pulling back does not have to look like abandonment. It can look like recalibration. You might say something like: “I care about you and I want to support you, but I don’t have the capacity for long nightly calls anymore. Can we find a different way to stay connected that works for both of us?” That opens the door to adjustment rather than rupture. And if she presses you on why you're pulling back, you can explain to her that while you absolutely want to continue to be there for her, the long calls are draining you emotionally. Say that to be fully present for her and be the best friend that you can be, you have to take care of yourself, too. And this requires less frequent and less lengthy discussions of divorce-related matters. 

Being a good friend does not require sacrificing your own emotional health. Care that is sustainable is ultimately more loving than care that quietly burns out.

QUESTION: I’ve been married for 20 years and recently realized I’m deeply unhappy. There’s no abuse, no infidelity, just a growing sense that we became roommates. Is it selfish to consider leaving?

ANSWER: Long-term unhappiness does not require dramatic justification to be legitimate. Many marriages unravel quietly, not through betrayal or cruelty, but through emotional erosion and disconnection over time. There are many reasons why most marriages eventually end before the death of one of the spouses. But the slow, mundane distancing that you describe is a common one.

Recognizing this can bring a particular kind of guilt, especially when nothing “bad enough” seems to have happened. But the absence of abuse does not obligate you to ignore your own inner life. Wanting more emotional presence, intimacy, or meaning is not selfish by default. When you've been living under the same roof as somebody for many years, but you don't feel the same strong connection that you once did, that can be very uncomfortable and guilt-inducing. Society tells us that marriage is forever, and that once in love, always in love. But as you and countless others have experienced, reality is usually different.

At the same time, awareness is not the same as certainty. Before making irreversible decisions, it’s worth exploring whether the unhappiness reflects neglect that could be addressed or a deeper incompatibility that cannot. That exploration might include honest conversation, counseling, or simply allowing yourself to name what you’ve been avoiding. Also you might try a "free writing session" in which you write down anything and everything that comes to mind with respect to your marriage. Free writing involves letting go of any inhibitions and writing whatever comes to your mind, however silly or scary it might seem. Writers often find this useful for brainstorming, but it can also be applied to trying to figure out interpersonal situations as well, especially since we usually heavily self-censor when it comes to thinking about delicate emotional topics. Resolve to never let anyone see the result of the free-writing; this will provide much more psychological space to fully express yourself. You can even destroy the document after writing it. Hopefully this, along with simple unstructured reflection, will help you understand more where you want to go with respect to your marriage. 

If you feel that it's worth trying to save the marriage, and that the underlying problems can be solved within the marriage, then you might say something to your spouse like: "Honey, we've grown apart over the last few years, and I'm sure you've noticed it too. I realize that we are different people than when we first married. But I want us to be closer again. What do you think is missing, and how could we both work towards fixing it?"

But if you decide after this reflection that ending the marriage is the best course of action, do it. Hopefully you and your husband have an amicable enough relationship that a divorce would be relatively smooth. Also, you don't mention if you have children. But even if you do, divorce in the case of an unhappy marriage is a better alternative to modeling an unhappy relationship for your children.

There is no moral virtue in endurance for its own sake. The ethical question isn’t whether you’re allowed to want more, but how to proceed with honesty and care for both yourself and your spouse. Sometimes the most courageous and loving thing you can do is walk away.

QUESTION: My adult son rarely calls or visits. When I bring it up, he says he’s busy. I feel rejected and don’t know how to respond without pushing him further away.

ANSWER: Distance from adult children can feel like a quiet, ongoing loss. It often triggers questions about what went wrong or what could have been done differently. Those feelings are real and deeply human. Parents usually operate on the implicit, unspoken assumption that when their children grow up, they will stay in close contact. Or at least that they will make a regular effort to call and visit. When this proves not to be the case, after children grow up and start their adult lives, this can create feelings of rejection, even though the reason for the reduced contact might simply be that the adult child is very busy with their own life.

Your question doesn't mention important facts such as: How old your adult son is, whether he has a family of his own, or whether anything specific happened that might have triggered this distancing, as opposed to it just being the result of him having a lot on his plate. All these factors matter. And many adult children simply get wrapped up in their lives and contacting their parents often falls by the wayside, especially if they have children of their own. The communication rules of yesteryear have broken down, while at the same time, young families and young adults are particularly overwhelmed these days with all the stresses of daily life, the uncertain economy, the influence of social media, the impossible expectations around child-rearing, and so many other things. So it's entirely possible that his relative silence is simply a byproduct of these forces, rather than anything you or his other parent specifically did.

What creates space for reconnection is signaling that the relationship is safe and non-demanding. Next time you talk to him about a visit, and he mentions being busy, you can say something like: “I miss you and enjoy hearing from you whenever you have time." That's it. Don't propose a time to meet or talk or even just say something like, "I would like to catch up sometime." 

The trick is to strike a balance between expressing your wish to reconnect without crossing the line into pressure. Pressure rarely produces closeness. When adult children feel obligated to manage a parent’s disappointment, they often retreat further. 

That doesn’t mean suppressing your feelings entirely. It means expressing them without making them your child’s responsibility.

Sometimes the most loving thing a parent can do is leave the door open and trust that their child will walk through it when they’re able.

QUESTION: My partner frequently jokes at my expense in social settings. When I ask him to stop, he says I’m too sensitive. Am I?

ANSWER: Humor that repeatedly lands at one person’s expense stops being harmless, especially when concerns are dismissed rather than addressed. Being told you’re “too sensitive” often serves to deflect responsibility rather than resolve the issue. Cowards everywhere use humor as a shield to say something without owning it. And when the person perpetrating this problem is doing it to their partner, then that's a particularly cruel and cowardly act. It conveys the message that the person telling the joke cares little about their partner's feelings and cares more about themself. This can make the target of the joke feel humiliated, dehumanized, and unloved.

The common sense, reasonable-person rule of thumb regarding jokes at someone else's expense is that when the target of the joke expresses discomfort or explicitly asks the teller of the joke to stop, then the teller must stop immediately. They must never again tell any more of these jokes. Your partner evidently has not learned this rule, or he doesn't care. He's also gaslighting you by causing you to question your own legitimate feelings of hurt. What a decent and reasonable person would do if he were in your partner's shoes is not tell any more of the jokes, even if he personally couldn't understand why you find them offensive. The fact that they hurt you is itself enough of a reason to stop telling the jokes.

The fact that your partner hasn't done this suggests that there probably isn't much hope for this relationship. But if you want to make one last-ditch effort, you might use the following script as a template. "[Partner], You've told a lot of jokes lately that I have been the butt of. I've told you that I don't appreciate it. And when you brush me off by saying I'm too sensitive, it communicates to me that you don't truly care about my feelings. You might find the jokes funny, but I don't. When you tell them it makes me feel hurt and humiliated. Please stop." 

While I'm not usually a fan of "tests" in relationships, in this case whether your partner continues telling the jokes after that point will tell you all you need to know about whether to stay with him. If he keeps telling jokes, get out of that relationship as quickly as possible. You deserve better than someone who will treat you in a mean-spirited fashion and then criticize you when you express hurt at this mistreatment.

Life is hard enough without your own partner putting you down and then not even taking responsibility for it. A partner who respects you will care more about how their words land than about defending their sense of humor.

You are not obligated to tolerate being the punchline to "keep the peace" in your relationship. Asking for basic respect is not fragility. It is a reasonable boundary.

QUESTION: I feel guilty for being relieved after ending a relationship. Does that mean I never really loved them?

ANSWER: Relief after a breakup does not invalidate the love you felt. Often it reflects the lifting of a burden that had become unbearable over time.

Your letter is sparse in context, so it's unclear what the underlying circumstances are. But many, many people feel relief after a relationship ends. Some people feel this way because they were smothered in a codependent relationship, or one in which they had to bear more than their share of the emotional and/or household labor. Others feel relief because disagreements with their partner had surpassed their emotional pain threshold. There are also cases of abuse and infidelity, in which case it's definitely a relief to leave the relationship. Or there are much more mundane cases in which neither spouse did anything "wrong," but the relationship just lost its luster over time and became more of a burden than a joy.

I'm not implying that any of these things were true of your own relationship. Rather, the preceding paragraph is an attempt to illustrate how common it is for people to feel relieved after a relationship ends. It's perfectly normal and doesn't make you a bad person, nor does it mean that you didn't love your partner. Love evolves and changes over time. Sometimes people fall out of love, while at other times love evolves into something that no longer fits well within the space of the relationship in which it started. You can deeply love someone but still come to realize that for any of the reasons listed above, or any number of others, the relationship just isn't right. Leaving a relationship in that circumstance often does feel like a relief, even as it's also heartbreaking. These two things can be true at the same time.

You don’t need to rewrite your history to justify your present emotions. Mixed feelings are common after loss, particularly when love and strain coexisted for a long time. In my parents' case, they were married for over 30 years and there was clearly a lot of love between them. But for various reasons, the relationship fell apart. After an intense grieving period, my mother felt a lot of relief at being able to live a new life on her own terms. I think even today she still loves my dad in some way, but also feels that the divorce was the right thing to do.

Emotions are signals, and your relief is telling you that something about that relationship wasn't right. It isn't telling you anything about whether or not you loved your partner. A chapter of your life has ended, but that doesn't mean that you didn't have a lot of love for the co-author of that chapter.

QUESTION: My parents expect me to visit every holiday, even though doing so leaves me anxious and depleted. I feel trapped between obligation and self-care.

ANSWER: Traditions have a special place in our culture and can often bring great happiness. But they are not automatically healthy. When a tradition consistently leaves one person anxious or depleted, it deserves reevaluation. Because a tradition that is continued to the detriment of one or more of the participants ceases to be a reaffirmation of connection and love. Rather, it becomes a burden and often a source of resentment.

The outsized importance of traditions in our culture, particularly around the holidays, can often mask the complex emotions and stress often associated with them. And as you and countless others have seen, traditions often come with heavy expectations. Many of our traditions also involve substantial emotional labor. Not only with the holidays, but also think of things like planning a wedding, trying to create an invite list for your child's birthday party that doesn't hurt anyone's feelings, and also some faith traditions where devotees engage in a variety of rituals and often have to master complex subject matter. In light of all this, traditions can often be exhausting, even when we treasure them.

The good news is that you are allowed to renegotiate expectations as an adult, even if doing so disappoints others. Choosing not to attend every gathering is not a rejection of your family; it’s an acknowledgment of your limits. You might explain to your parents that while you love seeing them and visiting for holidays, you're not able to attend for every holiday. You could, for instance, say that you're coming to see them for Christmas, but you have other plans for Thanksgiving. If they press you for details on why you're not going to see them for every holiday, you don't need to provide an exhaustive explanation. “This is what I can manage right now” is enough.

QUESTION: I discovered that my partner reads my private messages “out of concern.” They say they’re just trying to protect the relationship. How serious is this?

ANSWER: Reading private messages without consent is a serious breach of trust, regardless of the motivation offered. Concern does not justify surveillance. When a partner violates trust and privacy in this manner, one often feels frustration, disappointment, and anger. It conveys that the partner who reads the messages doesn't see their partner as an equal and doesn't respect their autonomy.

It's unclear from your message what your partner thinks that they need to protect the relationship from. Do they suspect infidelity? Is there some other situation in your life that they're concerned about, but they're expressing this concern by violating your privacy? Regardless, this behavior is never justified. Healthy relationships rely on mutual respect for autonomy and privacy. When one partner monitors the other, it often reflects insecurity or a need for control rather than genuine care.

This behavior deserves to be addressed directly and taken seriously. You might say something like, "I want to talk to you about reading my private messages. You claim that you're just trying to protect the relationship and that you're concerned. But this isn't okay. It's a violation of privacy. If you have any concerns about me or about the relationship, you need to express them openly and directly rather than going behind my back and violating my privacy."

If your partner minimizes it, refuses to stop, or reframes it as your fault, that signals a deeper issue around boundaries and trust. In that case, you might want to think hard about whether to stay in this relationship. Love doesn't justify subjecting yourself to repeated privacy violations. There are plenty of people out there who do respect basic privacy rights.

Protection that requires violation of privacy is not protection; it's snooping.

QUESTION: My adult daughter constantly asks for financial help but dismisses my advice and resents any boundaries I try to set. I feel used and guilty at the same time. What’s the right response?

ANSWER: This is an emotionally fraught position to be in. Wanting to help your child doesn’t go away just because they’re grown, and guilt often rushes in the moment you consider pulling back. But generosity that consistently leaves you feeling used is a signal that something is out of balance. In interacting with an adult child, there need to be clear boundaries on each side, especially when it comes to financial matters. A lack of boundaries or violation of them is usually a recipe for trouble in the relationship.

You say "financial help," but you don't fully specify what this means. Is it just advice, or is it also money in the form of a loan or a gift? If it's the latter in particular, then guilt is no reason to justify being taken advantage of financially. Because that's what happens when people asking for money (or even just advice) don't observe boundaries. When financial support is offered without mutual respect or clear limits, it often becomes entangled with resentment on both sides. Money starts standing in for connection, approval, or control, and this is typically toxic for a relationship over time.

Setting boundaries here is not a withdrawal of love. It’s a clarification of what kind of help you can offer without harming the relationship or your retirement funds. You might say: “I care about you, but I’m no longer comfortable providing financial support under these conditions.” That statement is not punitive. It’s honest.

Your daughter may be angry, and that will be painful. But guilt alone is not a reason to continue a pattern that leaves you resentful and her dependent. Boundaries, while uncomfortable, often create the possibility for a healthier adult relationship over time.

QUESTION: My spouse keeps forgiving a family member who repeatedly disrespects me. I feel like my feelings always come second. Is this a marriage problem or a family problem?

ANSWER: When a spouse repeatedly prioritizes a family member over their partner’s wellbeing, it stops being just a family issue and becomes a marital one. Partnership implies a baseline commitment to protecting each other from harm, especially when that harm is ongoing and predictable.

Forgiveness on its own does not justify a lack of accountability or enforcement of boundaries. You can forgive someone, but still stand up to them if they keep engaging in problematic behavior. Your letter implies that your husband is not standing up to the family member who keeps treating you poorly. This is a big problem and very common. For various reasons, people in marriages or other long-term relationships often choose their own relatives over their spouse or partner. This is often the case even when their relative is disrespecting or otherwise mistreating the spouse or partner. But protecting a family member that's mistreating one's spouse is never okay.

When someone refuses to protect their spouse from harm caused by a family member, then it becomes a marital problem, first and foremost. And that's where the repair should start, within the marriage. This is worth addressing directly, not as an accusation but as a statement of need. Something like: “I need to know that you will take my side when someone treats me poorly.” You don't mention if you brought this up to your spouse before, but even if you have, it's worth bringing up again because, clearly, the problem is still there.

Forgiveness can be meaningful, but forgiveness that bypasses accountability often turns into enablement. Your spouse may believe they’re being peacemaking or generous, but the effect is that you’re left exposed and unsupported. You're left understandably wondering if your spouse cares more about you or about protecting the feelings of the family member who is harming you.

Bottom line: Don't stand for mistreatment. You deserve much better than that.

QUESTION: My coworkers often interrupt or talk over me in meetings. When I try to assert myself, I’m labeled “difficult.” How do I handle this without damaging my reputation?

ANSWER: Interruption is one of the worst conversational habits. In our extrovert-worshipping society, conversation can often seem to be tantamount to a contact sport in which the person who's willing to interrupt the most often gets the most floor time. And since you're talking about a workplace specifically, there are added dimensions to this problem. A workplace should have more explicit and implicit expectations that all voices are listened to. When this doesn't happen, it leaves those who are frequently interrupted feeling like their voices don't matter. Being interrupted repeatedly is not a personal failure. It’s a structural and social problem that often affects certain people more than others, regardless of competence or preparation. The frustration you feel is justified.

I myself have suffered from being interrupted a lot, both at workplaces and in other settings. Over time, I've learned strategies that enable me to speak up for myself without appearing overly confrontational. I try to say things like, "excuse me, I wasn't finished talking," or "can you please let me finish what I was saying?" In American workplaces, people are socialized to want to appear as "team players." Which is why you fear reputational damage for calling out these interruptions. But it's possible to maintain a reputation as a good member of the team while still standing up for your own right to express your full idea when you're speaking in a meeting.

For instance, if you maintain calm and composure while standing up for yourself when you're being interrupted, using phrases like I suggested above, then the risk of you appearing as someone who is "difficult" will be reduced. That being said, it is important to note that there's also a gender component to all this. You don't tell me which gender you identify with or which gender others identify you as. But if others identify you as female, then unfortunately, you're in good company with respect to constantly being interrupted. Women face a double bind at work because if they speak up too little, they're seen as not being a team player or not caring about what happens on a particular project. But if they speak up “too much,” they're seen as being too aggressive. This can also often damage them professionally. So if you're a woman, unfortunately, your task is particularly difficult, but it's not impossible.

If the pattern continues, it may be appropriate to document specific instances and raise the issue with a manager, framing it as a collaboration problem rather than a grievance. That helps protect your credibility while naming the issue. And if you've noticed other colleagues also being interrupted during meetings, which is likely, you can bring them up as well. Don't mention them by name, but say something like, "I have also noticed that other colleagues of mine are also often being interrupted at our meetings. I want our workplace to be an environment where everybody can feel free to express their full and complete opinions on work-related matters. I think that doing this will help us be the best team that we can be." 

Wanting to be heard is not “being difficult.” It’s asking for basic professional respect.

QUESTION: I’m considering ending a friendship because our political views have diverged dramatically. We can’t talk without it becoming tense. Is that shallow?

ANSWER: Political differences often reflect deeper values about power, responsibility, and empathy. And the place of outsiders and historically marginalized groups in our society. When those values diverge sharply, conversation can become exhausting rather than enriching. Especially in the current political climate, "agreeing to disagree" can be hard to accept when it seems like every issue is a battle between diametrically opposed values. And in the age of social media, we know much more about the political opinions of even neighbors and friends of friends than most of us would want to know. Just this year I learned that a spouse of a relative seems to see the opposite political party as being gleeful at a deadly natural disaster that happened in our state. Such revelations really do reveal sharply different values. Given all this, I don't think you're shallow to question ending the friendship. 

That said, ending the friendship may or may not be the best move, depending on circumstances. When the subject of conversation isn't politics, do the two of you generally have amicable and pleasant discussions? And notwithstanding what I said about agreeing to disagree above, have you ever explicitly asked your friend to keep politics off the table in your discussions, knowing that the two of you aren't going to agree and that it will only cause hurt feelings? Your sentence, "we can't talk without it becoming tense," seems to imply that politics often comes up in your conversations. If so, does one of you almost always raise the topic? If it's you, then you can simply not bring it up anymore. If it's her, you can politely ask your friend to not bring it up. Say something like, “I care a lot about you and our friendship, but I've noticed that every time we discuss politics, our conversations get tense and difficult. While I don't want to shy away from discussing difficult issues on principle, I just feel that in our friendship discussing politics does way more harm than good. Neither of us is going to persuade the other of their view, and it's very difficult to discuss this topic without lots of negative emotions coming up. Would you agree to just stay away from the subject from now on and talk about things that aren't as difficult?”

If after this conversation she still keeps bringing up politics, then that sends you a signal that your friend is willing to put their own political interests and passions above your feelings. In that case, ending the friendship or drastically reducing the amount of time that you talk with her would be an entirely appropriate response. Ending or distancing a friendship over this is not inherently shallow. It’s a recognition that mutual understanding may no longer be possible.

Many friendships can withstand political differences, but many others cannot. The question of which of these applies to your friendship will be determined by whether the two of you are able to come to a mutually satisfactory agreement about discussing politics and then actually stick to it. Because the status quo isn't sustainable.

It's not weak or "shallow" of somebody to request that a difficult topic be kept out of conversations. In fact, it takes a strong person to make such a request and risk the ire of the other person or even the end of the friendship. Bottom line: you don’t owe perpetual engagement at the cost of your own peace.

QUESTION: I am in my late twenties and recently moved into my own place. My mom has a key for emergencies, which I was fine with. Lately she has started “dropping by” unannounced when I am at work to leave food, do small chores, or reorganize things “to help.” She means well, but it feels like my space is not really mine. I tried joking about it, but she did not get the hint. How do I set a boundary without hurting her feelings?

ANSWER: It sounds like your mom is trying to be loving and helpful, but the way she's doing it is blurring the line between support and intrusion. You're not wrong to feel unsettled by that. When a parent oversteps reasonable boundaries in an adult child's life, it can leave the adult child feeling a range of emotions. You want to be able to feel that your space is yours, but you also don't want to hurt your mother's feelings, especially since you know that she means well. It's a painful dilemma.

Unfortunately, there are very few, if any, cases in which setting boundaries doesn't risk hurting someone's feelings. When boundaries need to be set with someone, almost by definition, you're asking them to get outside of their comfort zone and to rethink old assumptions that they had held, often unconsciously. You're pushing back on something that somebody else is doing, and very often they're going to take it personally.

When setting a boundary with your mom on this matter, you want to strike a tone of loving but firm. You might say something to the effect of, "Mom, I love you, and I really do enjoy having you over. But when you come over, I want it to be for a visit where we're both present and can enjoy each other's company. I know that you mean well in coming over and performing chores and leaving food, but it undermines my own sense of independence and sense that my space really is my own. Moving forward, can we both agree that the key that I gave you should be only used for emergencies, and that any other times when you come over, you ask me first?" 

Relationships between parents and adult children often involve recalibration. This is one of those times. With love and patience, you will be able to strengthen and re-calibrate your relationship towards more autonomy for you.

QUESTION: My husband and I have been married for 10 years, and while it's mostly been a good marriage with the usual ups and downs, a toxic dynamic has evolved where both of us rush to blame the other during arguments. For example, last week our cat escaped and my youngest child and I spent several hours looking for her before a neighbor thankfully found and returned her. The relief of having her back should have been the end of it, but instead the incident sparked a painful argument about whose "fault" it was—-my husband blamed me for leaving the door open when I went out to tend to our plants (I was only outside for a few minutes), while I blamed him because the only reason I went out to water the plants was that he had neglected to do it after saying he would take care of them. The argument was unproductive, as almost all our arguments are. We've been in couples therapy but haven't made much progress, in part because my husband doesn't take therapy seriously. How can we overcome this blame dynamic and develop a better marital relationship?

ANSWER: This is a common problem, so you're hardly alone in facing this. Your husband's reluctance to take therapy seriously is discouraging, but there are other approaches you can take. During a moment when both of you are calm, approach him and say something like, "Honey, I've noticed that when we fight, we often blame each other for problems, and this doesn't resolve anything. It just results in hurt feelings for both of us. What do you think we can do to address this?"

Much will depend on how he responds. If he doesn't respond well, particularly after repeated attempts to address this amicably, then you might want to consider solo therapy to explore any underlying problems behind this pattern. But if he is open to engaging with you, try this exercise: the next time you have an argument and one of you starts blaming the other, get out a piece of paper and each of you write down possible solutions, with a rule that nobody can write anything blaming the other partner—just focus on solutions. Blame is a dynamic that tends to be self-reinforcing: the more you resort to blame, the more it feels natural, but the good news is that it works the other way as well—the less you engage in blame over time, the less it becomes the default way of "solving" problems. Over time, this exercise should help change this difficult dynamic while also solving the original problems more quickly. I would also recommend reading John Gottman's book, "The 7 Principles for Making Marriage Work," which contains excellent advice about the blame game and other marital challenges.

QUESTION: Like so many others, my teenage daughter is struggling with an eating disorder. In her case, she's lost so many pounds in the last few weeks that she barely resembles her old self. She's obsessed with the idea that she's fat, but in reality, she's dangerously underweight. Making matters worse, my husband seems to not take her situation seriously enough. While I fear for her life if she doesn't get treatment soon, my husband often brushes off the subject when I talk to him about it. He says things like, "Oh, she's just going through a phase," or "Maybe she just doesn't like the food that you cook." I think that my daughter is overhearing this and it might be encouraging her to starve herself even more.

I've always been the non-confrontational type, which I fear has contributed to my daughter getting into the mess that she's in. So I'm not really sure how to confront my husband about this. What do you suggest?

ANSWER: As you noted, this is a life-or-death situation. What I would do is urgently get both your daughter and husband educated on the serious problem of eating disorders, "tout de suite." First, if you haven't already, inform your daughter of the following resources: the 24/7 eating disorder hotline (866-932-1264) and the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD) Helpline (888-375-7767). I would also insist that both your daughter and your husband visit the website of the National Eating Disorders Association, particularly their helpful article "Busting The Myths About Eating Disorders" (https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/busting-myths-about-eating-disorders/). 

The immediate problem, of course, is helping your daughter to get healthy and overcome the disorder, and to learn the skills needed to prevent relapses in the future. This starts with a conversation with her primary care physician and also her therapist, if she has one. But I suspect you're doing most of this already. What you wrote to me about was really a problem of attitudes and education on the part of your husband. In addition to showing him the above-mentioned resources, I would have a serious conversation with him about how his attitudes might be harming his daughter. There is also some underlying sexism and misogyny in his remarks, particularly about what he said about the food that you cook. But educating him on eating disorders is the first priority. Then you can have a longer discussion with him (ideally also with a couples therapist) addressing some of these problematic assumptions that he seems to have about you and about gender roles.

Finally, by all means, whenever your husband makes one of these remarks and there's even the possibility that your daughter could have been around, seek her out at your first opportunity and emphasize to her that what her father said was wrong. Tell her the facts in a calm manner, not to demonize her father but rather to show that his harmful views aren't correct. Facts and sincere affirmation are the best antidotes to misguided and harmful ignorance.

QUESTION: My husband and I are facing a dilemma over how to respond to a problem with how his family treats his brother. We both have long suspected that my husband's brother is gay. At one point, the brother even came to my husband asking for advice on how to come out of the closet. However, in large part because of their family's attitudes, the brother has never actually come out to them. From time to time, I overhear some of my husband's family, particularly my father-in-law, make offensive and cruel remarks about gay people. I don't know if the father-in-law suspects that one of his sons is gay or not, but regardless, this creates an alienating environment for us and obviously especially for the brother.

Our dilemma is on how to respond to this, if at all. I would like for us, or at least for my husband, to bring this up with his father and to make clear that we don't approve of these cruel remarks. My husband has made it clear that even though he strongly disapproves of the anti-gay remarks, he wants to preserve his relationship with his father and doesn't want to intervene. I tend to feel that since it's his family, he should have more of a say on how to engage with them. But it really hurts to stand by and say nothing while my husband's father creates such an intolerant environment. Do you think that we should just let this go or do you feel that it's worth risking our relationship with his father to try to improve the situation?

ANSWER: What about the brother's opinion of all this? Before confronting his father, why don't you two, or just your husband, approach the brother and gently ask him what he thinks the best course of action is? Given that he seems to be the one most affected by the remarks, his opinion should be given special weight. Only confront the father if the brother is okay with that. You don't want to risk a backlash by confronting the father and then him responding by treating his son even worse. And even though what the father is saying is clearly abhorrent, the son that you suspect is gay might have his own reasons for wanting to preserve his own relationship with his father.

Regardless of whether you choose to confront the father directly, there are more subtle ways that you can send signals of disapproval about the remarks. For instance, you can limit your visits to those particular relatives when the father is around. You can also invite the brother to spend more time with you and your husband separately, apart from his parents. And the next time you happen to overhear a remark, you might consider going the route of asking a question as opposed to direct confrontation. That is, maybe you could ask the father, "If you were gay, how would you feel about other people saying that about you?" I've often found that when dealing with difficult people, asking them respectful but direct critical questions is often a more effective strategy than simply laying down the law and telling them that they're wrong. Although I admit, I'm human too, and often the temptation for the latter is quite strong in that type of situation. But whatever approach you take, remember that empathy and compassion should be your guiding lights. Make sure that the brother's needs are first and foremost in whatever solution you decide on.

QUESTION: My wife and I are expecting our first child, a daughter. As you might imagine, we're over the moon about being new parents and nurturing and loving this new human. Nevertheless, my wife and I are engaged in a nasty recurring argument over whether to baptize our future daughter. My wife came from a fairly secular family but experienced trauma in her early adulthood, including a sexual assault. She found an on-campus religious community that provided tremendous support to her in her healing. And after college she has continued to attend church in that same denomination. She's been a part of this denomination for about 15 years at this point, and I have nothing against her doing this. Obviously she's an autonomous adult, and we don't have to agree on religion. But in my case, I'm an atheist who had some very bad experiences with religion growing up, including multiple attempts to proselytize me. I also had a friend who was abused by a priest. And so for me, organized religion is the root of much evil with corporate greed being the root of most of the rest.

My wife wants to baptize our daughter in her denomination because she wants to pass on to her child the deep connection that she has to her faith. And also, I suspect, because she feels that on some level being part of this religious community might shield her daughter from the trauma that she went through as a younger woman. But for me, I worry that baptizing our daughter in this religion would essentially brainwash and indoctrinate her. I fear our daughter wanting to marry young and then becoming obedient to her husband due to our church's teachings. The denomination is one of the more conservative ones, and I don't agree with most of their teachings. I want our daughter to be a strong young woman, not a slave to her future husband because of religious brainwashing. Should I just give in and let her get indoctrinated, or should I fight harder for her to not be baptized?

ANSWER: It seems like you're falling into a trap that many religious and secular people alike fall into: framing a problem as a strict black-and-white either/or matter. Fundamentally, it seems to me that both you and your wife are coming from a place of love, and your differences are rooted in very different life experiences with religion. I don't know how much you've talked to your wife about this, but if you haven't, I would suggest first having an open and frank discussion with her about religion in general and what it means to each of you. Frame this in a way that respects her beliefs and life experiences while also reminding her that yours are just as valid, and agree to temporarily stay away from the subject of your daughter's potential baptism. This might help you two to get on the same page on religion in general, and not just over the question of baptizing your daughter. 

Then, when you two have found some common ground over religion (even if it is very limited), return to the subject of the baptism. There might be multiple ways to skin this cat that respect both of your viewpoints and beliefs. For instance, might you agree to having the daughter baptized in a more liberal denomination? This might satisfy your wife's wishes for her to be baptized as a Christian without being baptized in the same denomination whose beliefs you find so problematic. This might seem like an unacceptable compromise, but it's worked for a lot of couples. For instance, when I was dating my wife, I was very reluctant to convert to the dominant religion of her family because I found it unpalatable in many ways. But we compromised, and I converted into a more liberal denomination of the faith, which ended up working out fairly well for us. And don't forget to keep in mind the bigger picture of what your daughter herself might eventually want. Hopefully you and your wife would both agree that when your daughter is old enough to do so, she should be the one to determine her future path, be it a religious path or a secular one. So I think it makes sense to expose her to a mixture of religious and secular viewpoints. The exact contours of this will, of course, be up to you and your wife and eventually up to her. But by coming from a place of compassion and love, you will put her in a position to be well-equipped to make her own faith decision when the time comes.

QUESTION: My best friend recently got back together with her ex-boyfriend, who I know was emotionally abusive to her. She cut off her other best friend for telling her to leave him, and now she's threatening to cut me off too over a trivial political disagreement we had. I'm trying to be a safe presence for her like people advised, but it's getting harder as she keeps ghosting me or being cold and distant. How do I handle this without losing my friend completely, and how do I stop feeling terrible about it?

ANSWER: You can't fix this for her, and you shouldn't try to. Your friend is in a cycle of abuse where she's isolating herself from people who care about her—this is unfortunately common in abusive relationships. The person who's supposed to be her safe place (you) is being pushed away, while the person causing harm is being drawn closer. Your role right now isn't to be a regular friend who gets regular friendship back. It's to be a lifeline that stays available even when she's not using it.

That means: keep reaching out periodically with low-pressure check-ins. Don't expect her to respond, and don't take her distance personally. When she does respond, don't lecture her about the boyfriend—just be present. Say things like, "I'm here whenever you need me, no questions asked." The goal is to make sure she knows you're still there when she's ready to leave. As for feeling terrible about it—that's actually appropriate. It is terrible to watch someone you care about self-destruct. But remember: her choices aren't your fault, and you can't rescue her if she doesn't want to be rescued. You can only keep the door open. In the meantime, make sure you're taking care of yourself. This is emotionally draining work, and you deserve support too. Consider talking to a therapist or joining a support group for friends and family of people in abusive relationships.

QUESTION: My wife and I have been married about 15 years. For the first few years, our sex life was great. We were, as the saying goes, "f***ing like bunnies". But as the years wore on, especially once we had kids, we hit a rough spot in the bedroom. Since we had our second and final child, my wife only wants sex once every few weeks, and sometimes once every few months. When we do have sex, I almost always have to initiate, and she's just not as, shall we say, vigorous as was the case before. I love my wife and want to respect her preferences, but at the same time, I feel that my sexual needs are no longer being met. Am I doomed to spend the rest of my days in a sexually unsatisfying marriage, or is there hope for us?

ANSWER: As you might be aware, this is a very common problem, but that doesn't make it any less painful. Since there is such a huge spectrum of sexual desire/libido among humans, it's very likely that any given marriage will have a mismatch in libido, be it large or small. Working this out depends on many things, particularly: How large the libido gap is, the personalities of the partners, and how open both partners are to compromise.

There are, of course, a few basic ground rules: First, nobody should ever have sex that they don't want to have. And second, any negotiations or discussions about sex should be done in a loving and compassionate manner.

With that in mind, have a frank discussion with your wife about this issue. Frame the problem not as her not giving you what you want, but rather as an apparent mismatch in sexual interest. Don't frame your own higher libido as better or normative. Approach this in a compassionate manner, and ask if she might be willing to compromise. For instance, ask if you both could have sex a little more often, but still within her comfort zone. Also, there is a lot of stigma around this, but there is no shame in satisfying your needs on the side as long as it doesn't involve an extra-marital affair. That is, as long as it's done ethically. By this I mean, well, sometimes taking solo flights when the dual flight is canceled or delayed. Almost all married people, even in happy marriages, satisfy themselves sometimes. And that's perfectly normal, as long as it doesn't substitute for your actual sex life. For a compassionate and common-sense view of such matters, and male sexuality in general, I'd highly recommend checking out Bernie Zilbergeld's book, "The New Male Sexuality." It's an oldie but goodie that even after a few decades still stands the test of time.

QUESTION: My husband has a habit of criticizing me when I do something wrong, or when he thinks I do something wrong. This behavior has unfortunately been escalating in recent months. It started even before our wedding. For instance, he would remark upon my having chosen the "wrong" dress rather than telling a white lie that he liked the dress. Also, he would say things like, "You must be so glad you found me given how you were living before." Like most people in love, I brushed off these red flags, thinking that he would change after the wedding. But alas, things only got worse from there. Now that we've been married several years and have two kids, he started insulting me in front of the kids. He also tries to make me believe things that I know aren't true. For instance, by repeating lies to me, such as accusing me of losing our house keys, when in fact he's the one who misplaced them. They were found in the pocket of his suit jacket, for goodness sake!

My husband is mostly a wonderful man and a good father, and I dread the prospect of becoming a single mother, so I don't want to lose him. I've tried talking with him about the insults, but he always brushes me off. Is there a way that I can address this to salvage the marriage? Or do you think I should seek the exit?

ANSWER: Oh my goodness, you should run and not walk to the exit door. This is a textbook case of emotional and verbal abuse and gaslighting. Your husband insults you even after you've pointed it out and asked him to stop. He tries to get you to believe things that you know aren't true, and thus to undermine your confidence in yourself and your sense of reality, which is the definition of gaslighting. And he's doing it in front of your children. You even say that these are "red flags." This marriage is clearly beyond the point of no return. Rather than trying to change him, you should look for the safest and quickest way out of the marriage, which I know won't be easy.

The good news is that there are resources for domestic violence victims like you to get out safely. The first steps should be to find a time when he's not around and call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233. This service is available in many languages to anyone in need. They will help you devise an escape plan. Also, what support network do you have? Do you have a mother or sister or brother or best friend who could help you? Talk to someone you trust about the situation. Hopefully, they will see the obvious fact that this is domestic abuse and they will rush to help. If not, don't let them convince you that what you're seeing isn't true. Go to somebody else you trust. If you don't have anyone around you to trust, find a local women's shelter. They can provide you with a lot of resources. And when the time comes, of course, you'll need to visit an attorney. But your safety comes before everything else. You deserve much better, and you need to get out now. Good luck to you.

QUESTION: I'm engaged to be married to a wonderful man. We met online about a year and a half ago. When he proposed, I was truly over the moon. This has been a fairytale story, except for one major aspect: my extremely religious sister doesn't approve of him. Why? It boils down to the fact that he's divorced. In our religious tradition, if you enter into marriage with somebody, even if the marriage itself was not in this tradition, and you then divorce, our church has to find a reason why the divorce is invalid to permit the person to marry a second time within this church. It's called an annulment. My fiance has been willing to go quite far for my family with regards to religion, including even getting baptized, albeit not in our same denomination. But very reasonably, he's decided not to do an annulment on the grounds that it would be an unacceptable intrusion into his private life. And he's right. We don't need priests digging into his past life.

But this refusal to do the annulment is a deal-breaker for my sister, who will only attend my wedding if the annulment happens and if my fiance gets baptized into the "right" sect. It's looking like a real possibility that my sister will skip the wedding. I really want her there, and I've tried to explain this to her and get her to understand that even though she may not agree with the wedding or with my choice of a partner, she needs to attend because that's what sisters who love their sisters do. I am politically liberal, but if she were to marry someone who's a huge Trump supporter and conservative, I wouldn't hesitate to attend. (She is single now.) Because again that's what sisters do.

Is there a way that I can approach the topic that I haven't thought of that might help come around to seeing reason, or should I just deal with not having my beloved sister at the wedding? (Oh, and one thing I forgot to mention, I encouraged her to see a priest to discuss this matter in the hope that he would tell her something along the lines of: "Yes, go to the wedding because you love your sister and it's the right thing to do. It's not anything that will undermine your faith or commitment to God." But she won't go, and my husband suspects the reason is because she knows that the priest will probably say something along these lines.)

ANSWER: Your predicament is unfortunate, and I'm sorry you have to go through that. Unfortunately, when dealing with other adults, there's always only so much that you can do to get them to do what you want. It seems like you have tried to engage her in a loving and compassionate manner, and try to convince her to come to the wedding, but it sounds like she won't budge. You might try one more time with something along the lines of: "[Sister], I know that you love me and I love you. And I would gladly attend your wedding if you have one in the future, regardless of the groom that you choose or what his faith is. So can you please find it within yourself to come to our wedding? It's not going to be any judgment on you or your faith. It's just an expression of love for me, and it would mean the world to me."

My only other real suggestion to try to get her to come around would be something that you've already effectively ruled out: talking to a faith leader in her tradition about the subject. You might still consider talking to a faith leader yourself and with your partner, but without your sister present. Not because you think he's going to give you some sort of argument to convince her to come to the wedding, but just to hear his perspective. (If this is the faith that I think it is, the priest will only be a "he".) He might give you a compassionate perspective on accepting your sister not coming to the wedding because realistically, that seems to be your only real option at this point assuming that your Hail Mary (sorry) doesn't pan out. As hard as it may be, don't take it personally and encourage your fiancé to not take it personally either. This is all about the sister and has nothing to do with you or your fiancé or your choice of a partner. So go to the wedding, enjoy it, and savor the time around people you love. Your sister will be there for other events. Above all, try not to let her absence dominate your wedding experience. Her absence is unfortunate, but it's one of those things that happens in life that one just has to deal with. I wish you and your fiance many years of happiness and a beautiful wedding.

QUESTION: I'm on the autism spectrum and my partner is also neurodivergent, albeit differently. This has been a source of connection, but also a source of struggle. For example, they frequently express frustration when I'm not reading their social cues in the way that they expect me to. They also get irritated if I leave the room because they're cooking a certain thing, or if I'm focusing on obsessive interest, as we autists are known for. I do try to communicate my needs to them, and they seem receptive to it. But often it seems like we're getting nowhere. Our brains are wired too differently. Any recommendations on how to bridge the gap?

ANSWER: This is a common problem in neurologically mixed relationships. Even with both partners being neurodivergent, being neurodivergent in different ways is often just as challenging as one partner being neurodivergent and the other neurotypical. But you're not alone in this struggle. If you aren't doing it already, I would highly recommend couples counseling. This should help you begin to work through some of these issues. There are many compromises that you can make that would be worthwhile. For instance, your partner agrees not to cook certain food with you around, or you agree to set aside a certain amount of time for them each day so that you don't get sucked into your strong interest as much. The keys are: compassion, empathy, and a willingness to listen.

There's also a growing pool of resources for couples in your situation. In particular, I would recommend that you both read the book "The Autism Partner Handbook: How to Love an Autistic Person" by Elly Blue, Faith G. Harper, and Joe Biel. It's a quick read and offers a lot of useful suggestions for your situation. Navigating neurodivergence is a challenge, but many other couples have done it. Good luck.

QUESTION: My partner and I are both liberal, but most of my family is strongly conservative, as in hardcore Trump-loving conservative. As you can imagine, we've had our share of disagreements, but we've found ways to agree to disagree. We just try not to discuss politics, and we have a rule to never talk to each other on the day of a major election, like the midterms or a presidential election. This has worked reasonably well for us and has managed to keep us in relatively close contact.

The problem is that my partner, who's an outspoken activist in our local Democratic Party, refuses to come to family events. He came to our Easter celebration one year and was visibly upset by some of the things my parents said about Trump and immigrants. Even though I 100% agree with my partner that those things were wrong, it's still important for me to spend time with my family. Lately, my partner will make excuses for not coming to family events. He'll say he's too tired or he'll say that it's too long of a drive (they live 3 hours away, but my husband routinely makes drives longer than that for work and to go to his video game conventions.) 

My family has asked why he's not coming, and I have to fudge it or come up with half-true excuses. They're smart people, and they've started to suspect the real reason for his not coming. I've tried to talk to him about it, but again he's always evasive. Should I sit down with him and ask him point-blank to please tell me the truth so we can clear the air? Or should I respect his opinions as a fellow adult and just drop the matter?

ANSWER: This is a difficult situation, I'm sorry. On the surface, I feel for your partner, as I have similar political opinions to the two of you. I still get roiled up when I hear certain types of remarks, even after 10 years of Donald Trump being in the national political spotlight. But I still think your partner is being a bit of a coward. He won't admit what's plainly obvious to you and what your family is starting to catch on to. It's fine to have differing opinions, but one shouldn't tell half-truths or be evasive when it comes to the reason for not seeing their significant other's family. At this point, this is starting to cost you time with people you love, and that's not okay. So, what I would do is sit down with him and have the conversation that you propose. Tell him you know the real reason he's avoiding them. And that it's deceitful and insulting to your intelligence for him to not admit that. And then tell him that you want to be around your family more than he's allowing you to be (assuming that's true). Ask him to reconsider his boycott of your family if only for your sake. You might want to reassure him about how you have found ways of accommodating political differences with your family, and tell him that he can use similar strategies with them to do the same. (And if your family is anything like conservative (and liberal) relatives that I know, they will care more about his character and how he treats you than how he votes at the ballot box.) Right now, frankly, his actions don't reflect well on his character.

If he still won't be accommodating to you after having a frank and honest discussion with him and laying out what I just said and anything else that you feel to be important, then honestly, I'd reconsider your choice of a partner. You don't want to be around somebody who's not willing to experience discomfort for the sake of their partner or to defend their beliefs in the presence of people who disagree with them. Because if you go on to marry this person or have a lifelong partnership with them outside of marriage, what would you be signing up for? Do you want decades with someone who won't stand up for you or defend what he believes in when challenged?

QUESTION: I'm going through a nasty divorce. My husband and I were married for about 20 years, and the marriage unraveled for a variety of reasons. Yes, there was infidelity, but that honestly wasn't the biggest part of it. The infidelity was really a symptom rather than a cause of what broke us up. Effectively, we just weren't communicating well, and we realized that we would be happier with other people.

The specific problem that I am writing to you about is our families' very different opinions about divorce and their impacts on me. Not to be stereotypical, but my family is from the West Coast, and they have a more relaxed attitude towards things like divorce. Obviously they don't like divorce, but they accept that it's sometimes necessary when a marriage has run its course or otherwise is damaged beyond repair. They're being very compassionate and graceful towards me and even towards him. My soon-to-be ex-husband's family, on the other hand, is much more religious and conservative. They feel that divorce is a sin and that he must stay in the marriage at all costs. Perhaps owing to the fact that their religious tradition is more than a little patriarchal, they've been venting most of their anger on me rather than him. Even though he's the one who cheated. They've been making snide remarks towards me about how I didn't cut it as a wife and mother. And they even called me a few times and half cajoled me, half insulted me into trying to reconsider ending the marriage.

Now I know that after the divorce, I will have less reason to interact with them. But the fact that I have three children with my husband means that they won't be out of our lives entirely. At least until the kids grow up. And that's assuming the children decide to cut ties with them, which is unlikely because our daughter in particular is close to one of her uncles and those cousins. Obviously, once our children become adults, they'll have every right to make their own independent decisions on whether to maintain ties with these soon-to-be former relatives. But I fear that keeping these relatives in our lives for the children's sake is just going to mean that the insults and other poor behavior will continue. How can I respect my children's wishes to choose their own relationship with their in-laws while protecting myself from their vitriol?

ANSWER: This is a dilemma for sure, but like many relationship dilemmas, the imperfect but necessary solution is to create boundaries. You can't control how these soon-to-be former in-laws view you or your husband or the institution of marriage. But you can control, wherever possible, how far they can be in your lives. One suggestion is to try to have a conversation with them to clear the air and push for better treatment. Discuss how hurt you feel by their remarks and say that, while you disagree with them on the divorce, it's your and your husband's right as adults to choose whether or not to stay in the marriage. Maybe even invoke some Christian teachings to try to get them to rediscover their compassionate side around you.

But if this doesn't work, and my spidey sense thinks that it won't, your only real option is to set strict boundaries with them. For instance, make it a rule that you will never talk to them unless it pertains to your children. And while your children are still minors (I presume they still are due to the context of this letter), try to arrange meetings between them and those relatives where you have minimal contact. If possible, ask your ex-husband if he can attend these meetings without you. Remember that you don't owe anybody anything except for your children, and to the extent required by law and common ethics, your husband as well. (For example, he will presumably be entitled to some amount of custody as the father of the children, unless he's a true monster.) And even while your kids are still minors, you don't have to agree to a Christmas or Thanksgiving or anything else with these in-laws. Those expectations collapsed when the marriage did. You can limit your interaction with them to the extent necessary to facilitate periodic visits between them and your children. And after these children become adults, they can conduct their completely autonomous relationships with these relatives if they so choose, without you having to be involved at all. Good luck and chin up. It will get better.

QUESTION: I'm a 37-year-old man, and I live with my long-term partner. No kids. My brother and I are not close. He lives just a 3-hour drive away, and we routinely make drives longer than that for various reasons, but we only see him maybe once every couple of years. And this includes Christmases and Thanksgivings. We are not actively hostile. We get along relatively well, and we have a few things in common. But we really are at the level of at most casual friends. I have co-workers who I'm closer to than my brother. I want to reconcile with him, but I really don't know how. Do you have any strategies for trying to connect with a semi-estranged but not hostile sibling?

ANSWER: It's hard to know exactly what advice to provide, given the limited context I have here. For instance: what are the reasons for the estrangement? Was there a sibling rivalry growing up, such as competition over grades or sports? Did you two fight a lot as children?

The general advice on family estrangement is that it's heavily context-specific. In the most extreme cases, such as abuse, the right and reasonable course of action is to cut off contact to the extent possible. But it doesn't sound from your letter like this is the case. In less extreme situations, it really depends a lot on the reasons for the estrangement and knowing the other person, how you think they would react. In these less extreme situations, it's usually a good idea to reach out directly to the person and try to clear the air. This doesn't necessarily need to involve a tell-all or a play-by-play recounting of what happened in the past between you. It could just be something along the lines of: "Hey [Brother], I'm sure you've noticed we don't talk very often and I'd like to change that. I value you as a sibling and love you and hope we can have a good relationship. What do you think about that?" 

That conveys that you've taken the initiative to try to improve the situation, and that then puts the ball in his court. Ultimately, it will depend on how he responds as to whether or not you two can have a closer relationship. You will have done your part by starting the conversation just mentioned. Another thing I would suggest is to try to meet him at his place rather than the reverse. You can make that 3-hour drive as an additional gesture of your goodwill. Obviously with some advance notice, however. Good luck.

QUESTION: My daughter just came out to my husband and me. It happened relatively undramatically. We were all sitting around the kitchen table, eating dinner, and she mentioned that she had something to tell us. She said that her friend, who we will call Chloe, is actually her girlfriend, and that she's been pretty sure that she is gay for some time. She's 16. She says that while she's been attracted to other girls aside from Chloe, Chloe is the first one to actually reciprocate. And she says she's never been attracted to any boys.

My husband and I paused for a moment, not out of disapproval, but because we simply didn't know how to respond. Finally, we both said something about how we love her and that she's glad and that we're glad that she has enough trust in us to confide in us about this. Neither my husband nor I are homophobic. We have both long supported gay rights, and we've both been close to people who are gay. My husband even bought a small pride flag for her room. The problem though is how do we go about actually relating to her? While my husband and I are honestly elated that we won't have to deal with any teen pregnancy scares, we're also unsure about how we as straight people can truly relate to her experiences. We know that, when it comes to dating and relationships, gay and straight people have many things in common, more so than what divides them. But being gay in our still substantially homophobic society is an experience that neither my husband and I have ever known firsthand. Do you have any suggestions or resources on how to connect with her on this?

ANSWER: About three-quarters of the battle has already been won. She is very lucky to have such loving and supportive parents. Sadly, many people in her situation don't. When it comes to the question of how to relate to her better, you can start the conversation with what you mentioned to me: that there are many similarities between what people experience in gay relationships and what they experience in straight ones. The giddiness and euphoria of a first love, the experience of heartbreak, rejection, hope, physical and emotional intimacy-- these experiences are universal and don't conform to sexual labels. You can probably relate a great deal to what she's going through if you had a relationship or a crush at her age.

And as far as the experiences that don't overlap between straight and gay people, compassion and proactivity is the name of the game. Reinform your unconditional love and support for her and for her choice of partner, whoever that may be. Be proactive without being overbearing. Initiate some of these conversations and discussions, while also knowing when to hang back. And above all, just be there for her. Gay or straight, teenagers need to have that affirmation from parents. With parents also granting them more autonomy, assuming that their behavior and maturity justify it. And yes, by all means, celebrate that when she goes out with her girlfriend, there's not the risk of a pregnancy involved. And remember that even though she still needs guardrails, as all under-18s do, she's also on the cusp of adulthood and is experiencing a situation that's novel for her. Be there with love, compassion, and common sense, offering advice when needed, but generally leaving her to have her own experiences and make her own mistakes. This is the best way to equip her to navigate not only her current relationship but all the ones that follow.

QUESTION: I'm 28 years old (female), and my boyfriend is 33. We get along well and he's a great guy, loves me, loves my dog, wants kids, is usually pretty low maintenance. The problem is, well, I suppose a common one. It's a new time and in many cases, women are working and earning more than men. We are a textbook example of this. Although in our case, I am the only one earning anything at all! I just finished grad school last year and I have a really good, promising job in the finance industry. Nothing like those Wolf of Wall Street financiers but still a good, sustainable job. My boyfriend, by contrast, has always been a bit of a dreamer. He dropped out of college once, then finished a couple years later after volunteering in several cities in America and earning very little money. I met him during his second college stint when I was finishing up college myself. We had a period of long distance but long story short, decided it was worth it, stuck out the long distance, and then started living together after he was able to move back to our town. He also got a master's degree somewhere along the way but isn't using it. He says he wants to change the world and has big plans to end world hunger and improve global education.

Part of why I fell in love with him was that idealism. But honestly, the situation is starting to become untenable. As I mentioned, he doesn't work right now. He's in a volunteer gig and he sometimes picks up shifts as an Uber driver. But that's hardly what he went to grad school to do. When I urge him to help pay at least a respectable portion of the rent, he keeps talking to me about how his dreams are so important and how so many people in third-world countries are living so much worse than us. So you shouldn't be complaining. I get and understand that there are lots of people who have it worse off than us. But that's still no excuse in my view for what he's doing. As I alluded to earlier, I'm interested in starting a family soon, but can't imagine doing it with him until he does a 180 with his life. And when I have mentioned kids around him, he seems at best ambivalent. What should I do? Stay or go?

ANSWER: I think you've probably answered your own question. You tell me that you've talked to him about the problem, but he blows you off talking about his big dreams. And it seems like he's been like this for some time based on your letter. So, honestly, your lifestyles and what you want in the future just aren't compatible. You have a promising career. He seems to just want to follow his dreams by not working. And you've said that he "seems at best ambivalent" about having children, which you say is one of your big goals. And at 28, you're probably aware that you won't have forever to make this happen. 

You've invested a number of years in this man, and I have no doubt that there's lots of love between you. Any breakup would be devastating, but would breaking up with him be any more devastating than forgoing your wish to have children to accommodate someone who has had years to start to build a gainful career but apparently hasn't done so? And even with your well-paying job, I imagine that the stress of having to support him, and yourself, is starting to get to you. My younger sister had a boyfriend much like him. Sweet guy, really loved her, great with her dog. But he just wouldn't get his life together. He was working a dead-end job and he made no meaningful efforts to try to better his situation, either by going back to school or by looking for another job. My sister made the heartbreaking but necessary decision to end it with him. You seem to be in a very similar situation. So unless there is something big that you haven't told me about in this letter that would change this situation, I would urge you to likewise end this relationship and look for someone who is going to pull his weight in a relationship, and eventually as a father. I know it's always very hurtful to end a relationship, but I think that you, as my sister did, will look back on this breakup and realize that although it hurt, you did the right thing for both of you.

QUESTION: I'm 27 and my boyfriend is 30; we've been together for three years and living together for 1.5 years. We get along well and are managing financially, but the problem is with his parents. They're in their late 60s, living on limited income (his father is retired from the military, his mother was a teacher until she quit due to osteoarthritis), but despite their modest pensions, they've made extremely inadvisable financial decisions—luxury cruises, expensive restaurants they can't afford. They're emotionally manipulative, constantly playing on the fact that he's their only child to get him to spend money on them and go into debt. He can't seem to resist, and I think part of it is his sense of duty carried over from when he was in the military—he feels he owes his parents for raising him and wants to give back. They're taking advantage of this. I've tried talking to him about this multiple times, but he always says that his duty to his parents supersedes everything else. I love him and don't want to leave, but I also don't want us to go broke because he can't say no to his parents. Is there any hope for us?

ANSWER: "He always just says that his duty to his parents supersedes everything else." I think that tells you everything you need to know. I don't doubt that he loves you and that his sense of duty also includes a commitment to you. He sounds like a noble person, but people with a strong sense of duty can be vulnerable to manipulation, as you've seen. In this predicament with his parents, you've asked him multiple times to reconsider his supporting and enabling them, but he isn't responsive to that. And he doesn't seem to respect your input or try to seek any sort of compromise with respect to the money that he spends and the debt that he goes into for them.

This shouldn't remain your problem. You've done your best and made your feelings known to him, but he's ignored them repeatedly. Sadly, I think the best choice that you have is to end the relationship and start over. You don't want to become a second enabler for his parents. Nor do you want his consistent choosing of his parents over you to wreck your own credit and damage your own financial future.

QUESTION: My wife started seeing a therapist about a year ago after her mother died, which I fully supported. But now our marriage is falling apart because of it. When we have disagreements, she comes home from her sessions and immediately brings up whatever we're fighting about, but now she says things like "My therapist says you should..." or "My therapist says I need to..." and then she becomes completely inflexible, treating her therapist's advice like it's a binding court ruling. I feel like I'm being ganged up on by two people, and I can't even defend myself because I'm not in the room with them. I've asked to join a session or see a couples counselor together, but she says her therapist recommended a different therapist for couples work, and I'm resistant because these therapists are expensive and I don't want to cede control of our marriage to them. We're now talking about separating, which I never thought would happen. How can I save our marriage without giving up all control to therapists?

ANSWER: First, let's address the control issue directly: you're already losing your marriage, so the question isn't whether to involve professionals, but which professionals and how. Your wife's individual therapist is correct that couples counseling requires a different therapist—that's standard practice, not a power play. The individual therapist's job is to support your wife's growth, not to referee your marriage. That's why couples work needs its own neutral space.

The real issue here is that you're hearing your wife's version of what happens in therapy, not what actually happens. Therapists don't typically say "You should do X" or "Your spouse needs to Y"—they help people explore their feelings and needs. Your wife may be misrepresenting what's being said, or she may be taking the therapist's guidance and turning it into demands. Either way, you need to be in the room to hear it for yourself. I'd strongly recommend accepting the couples counseling offer. Think of it this way: you're not ceding control to therapists, you're getting professional help to communicate better. If the cost is truly prohibitive, many therapists offer sliding scale fees, and some community health centers provide low-cost counseling. But if you're choosing between paying for therapy or paying for two separate households, the math is pretty clear. The goal isn't to have therapists run your marriage—it's to learn tools to run it better yourselves.

QUESTION: My husband has always been particular about cleanliness, but since he started a high-stress job, it's gotten much worse. When he's on his way home, I can feel my whole body tense up. I rush around cleaning counters, vacuuming, putting away dishes, making sure no toys are out—all before he walks through the door. If anything is out of place when he arrives, he immediately starts straightening and cleaning, often before even saying hello. I've adapted to his standards over the years, and we're both tidy now, but I feel like I'm living under constant pressure to keep things perfect so he doesn't spiral into cleaning mode. Our kids are experiencing the stress too, and it's getting to them. It's exhausting, and I hate that I sometimes dread his return because of the energy shift it brings. We've talked about it many times, but not much has changed. He refuses counseling and says he'll "work on it," but I don't see real progress. How can I support him without losing my peace or turning our home into a stress zone for everyone?

ANSWER: His anxious behavior is affecting your entire family. The fact that you're pre-cleaning before he gets home to avoid triggering him is a sign that his needs have expanded beyond reasonable boundaries. You can't make him get help, but you can set boundaries around how his anxiety affects you and your children. At least in the short term.

Start by having a direct conversation when you're both calm: "I love you, and I can see that your need for order is tied to managing stress from work. But when you come home and immediately start cleaning without greeting us, it makes me and the kids feel like we're less important than a clean counter. I also notice that I'm spending energy trying to prevent your reactions, which isn't sustainable for me." Then propose specific changes: he agrees to say hello and spend five minutes with the family before addressing any mess, and you agree to maintain reasonable tidiness without the pre-cleaning scramble. If he can't commit to these small changes, then you need to consider whether this is the life you want. 

And even if you can, the changes that I just proposed are just a band-aid. They can buy you some time to make your house a bit of a less stressful place while you ask your husband to reconsider his refusal to get professional help. Because in the long term, if you want to truly get this problem under control, he's going to need professional help. His refusal to get such help for what's clearly impacting his family is a choice he's making, and you don't have to accommodate it indefinitely. You might also benefit from individual therapy to help you set and maintain these boundaries without feeling guilty and to talk through what the future might look like if your husband keeps refusing to get professional help in the longer term.

QUESTION: My wife comes from a large, close-knit family, while I come from a much smaller family. Sometimes it seems like I have lived through "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." But movie references aside, this has resulted in cultural adaptations for both of us. Geography also shapes our interactions with our respective families, especially around the holidays. Her family is mostly local. Most live within an hour's driving radius. By contrast, my family is very spread out. By "spread out", I mean that I need to get on a plane to see three of my four immediate family members. And there's no destination I can go to where I will be within 200 miles of more than one of my immediate family members. As you can imagine, this means we spend most holidays with her family. It just makes logistical sense, especially because traveling over the holidays is such a nightmare. But at the same time, I feel that this is a bit inequitable. I grew up assuming that my wife and I would alternate families to visit for the holidays, as a lot of people do. For instance, we see her family for Thanksgiving, I see hers for Christmas, then do it the reverse the following year. But the distance makes this impractical. I also have limited time off from work, and we like to travel outside of the holidays for leisure purposes as well. How can we heed logistical realities while making things fairer?

ANSWER: Short of a couple or more of your family members moving, there isn't really a way to do it without working around the geography. There are a great many families that can't simply do the one-side-for-Thanksgiving/other-for-Christmas pattern that you mentioned. For instance, some relatives have limited mobility. Some relatives have much smaller houses to support family gatherings than others. And as in your situation, geography is often a major factor. So I'd say the first step for you would be to step back from the script that you've been trying to follow and recognize the diversity of experiences out there. There's no one-size-fits-all model for the holidays.

Now come the actual logistical suggestions. You may not see your family as often as you see hers, but there are still some ways to work out compromises. For instance, maybe travel every other year to see a long-distance relative around Christmas, since Christmas tends to be a little bit better than Thanksgiving for travel. You can cut down on outside-of-holidays travel in the years that you go to see your relatives. Or you can invent your own traditions. For example, you could have an early Christmas at one of your relatives' houses and arrange for other family members to fly in as well. This avoids the worst holiday travel and also gives you another celebration to look forward to. You could do the same for Thanksgiving. I have experienced both of these things, and the celebration feels just as festive as if it were on the official calendar day. These situations are challenging at first, but they are definitely workable. So go enjoy your Festivus or your Pre-Christmas. I am sure they will be as wonderful and memorable as the traditional holidays.

QUESTION: I'm expecting my first baby in a few months, and I'm struggling with a decision I never thought I'd face. I always assumed I would stay home with my kids, at least during the early years—that's how I was raised. My mom stayed home throughout our entire childhoods. But now that I'm actually pregnant, I realize I don't want to leave my job. I work in HR at a midsize company, and while the work is challenging, it's also predictable and I find it fulfilling. It also doesn't make financial sense right now because I bring in roughly 60% of our family's income—my husband is a schoolteacher. Most of my friends either don't have kids yet or are stay-at-home moms, so I don't have great models for working motherhood. My coworkers who are moms seem frazzled and complain about their kids all the time, which scares me. Is it even possible to be a happy working mom, or am I letting money make a decision for me that should be moral or emotional?

ANSWER: Yes, it's absolutely possible to be a happy working mom—millions of women do it every day. The fact that your coworkers complain doesn't mean they're unhappy; sometimes people vent about challenges without meaning they regret their choices. You might try talking to them directly: "I'm expecting and trying to figure out the work-life balance. I hear you venting sometimes—can you tell me what you actually like about working and parenting? What makes it work for you?" Their answers might surprise you.

The bigger issue here is the "should" in your question. There's no moral imperative to stay home or to work—there's only what works for your family, your finances, your personality, and your circumstances. You're bringing in most of the income, you find your work fulfilling, and you don't want to leave. Those are all valid reasons to continue working. The key is to set yourself up for success: discuss with your husband how you'll share childcare responsibilities, consider what kind of childcare arrangement would work best for your family, and be realistic about what you can and can't do. You might also find that your feelings change once the baby arrives. Some women who planned to work find they want to stay home, and some who planned to stay home find they need the structure and adult interaction that work provides. Give yourself permission to make the decision that's right for you, and know that you can always reassess as your circumstances change.

QUESTION: My husband and I recently discovered that our 17-year-old is depressed and has contemplated suicide. I found out by going through their phone after noticing they seemed "off" and didn't want to talk to me. Our teen feels betrayed and angry that I went through their phone. We took them to their pediatrician for an evaluation, and they refused to talk at all or to consider antidepressant or nonmedical interventions. We went to a therapist twice and they refused to speak at all. I've tried drawing them out, waiting patiently, explaining how suicide cannot be undone and we will get through this together, but nothing seems to get through. They did confirm that there was no event that triggered this—they're just sad. They said talking to their friends helps. But I don't know what to do. I'm barely sleeping and every time they're out of sight I'm wondering if they're okay. I asked if they'd see a different therapist and got completely shut down. How do we continue in this liminal space where our teen is suffering but refusing help?

ANSWER: This is terrifying, and I'm so sorry your family is going through this. The most important thing right now is that you and your husband get professional support for yourselves, even if your teen won't. Find a therapist who specializes in adolescent mental health—not to “fix” your teen, but to guide you on how to support them. This is one of those situations where you need expert instructions, not just well-meaning advice.

Since your teen won't talk to a therapist, you need to be their support system. Keep doing what you're doing: spending time with them, doing things they enjoy, taking them outside for walks even if there's resistance. But also, get eyes on them at school—talk to the school counselor confidentially about your concerns. Make sure any firearms are completely removed from your home (not just locked up), and ask friends and family to do the same if your teen visits. The phone issue is tricky—you violated their privacy, which they're rightfully upset about, but you also found critical information. You might need to apologize for the method while explaining why you were worried: "I'm sorry I went through your phone. I was scared because you seemed so different, and I didn't know how else to understand what was happening. Can we find a better way for you to let me know when you're struggling?" Most importantly, keep the lines of communication open. They said talking to friends helps—that's actually a good sign. Don't try to replace that, but do make sure they know you're available whenever they're ready to talk. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and you need to take care of yourself too so you can be there for the long haul.

QUESTION: I'm getting married next year and I want to wear my grandmother's wedding gown. She got married in 1970 and her dress is a stunning floor-length fuchsia A-line gown with a square neckline—she hated white as much as I do. My grandmother is having it dry cleaned and says it's still in perfect condition. My future mother-in-law thought it was wonderful that I'd be wearing my grandmother's gown until she saw a picture of it. Now she insists that it couldn't be a wedding gown since brides only wore white back then, even though the picture is clearly of my grandparents on their wedding day. She can't let it go and keeps saying what a mistake it will be to be married in "that dreary old pink dress" and that I'll miss the fun of picking my own special gown. My mom also suggested I wear something more traditional like she did, and offered me her white gown, but I hate it—it's poufy and over the top with tulle and beading. My fiancé says I should wear what makes me happy, which is my grandmother's dress. With both moms objecting, is this a stupid hill to die on?

ANSWER: No, this is not a stupid hill to die on. It's your wedding, and you should wear what makes you happy. Your future mother-in-law is wrong about historical wedding dress colors—plenty of brides wore colors other than white throughout history, and even in 1970, non-white wedding dresses weren't unheard of. But more importantly, her opinion about what you should wear on your wedding day is just that—an opinion, not a requirement.

Here's what I'd suggest: thank both mothers for their input, then firmly close the topic. "Thanks for everyone's thoughts, but I've decided to wear my grandmother's dress. The topic's closed." Mean it, and don't engage in further discussion about it. If they bring it up again, you can say, "We've already discussed this, and my decision is made." Your fiancé is right to support you, and it's good that he's on your side. If your future mother-in-law continues to push, he should be the one to tell her to stop, since it's his family. This is actually a good test of how you'll handle future boundary issues with your in-laws. If you give in on something as personal as your wedding dress to avoid conflict, you're setting a pattern of letting them dictate your choices. Start as you mean to go on: with respect for their opinions, but with firm boundaries about what's yours to decide. Wear the pink dress, and have a beautiful wedding.

QUESTION: My brother and I have always been very competitive. We were raised in a household where academic success was valued above almost everything else. He and I were both very good students, but he was the better one. In particular, I struggled at math. But he always aced his math classes and now has a math PhD and one in physics. I have, "only," a single PhD in a non-math related field. Our competition dynamic led to a distant relationship that we have had during our entire adult lives. We're both in our early forties. I want to try to mend the rift, but I'm not sure where to begin. This is complicated by the fact that on the relatively rare occasions that we see each other, the old competitive dynamic emerges again. For instance, recently when we were visiting our mother, we played games such as Trivial Pursuit and Scrabble in which he smoked me. He's never been a jerk or bragged about beating me in things, but I still feel the effects of it. How can we move towards a more productive dynamic?

ANSWER: Sibling rivalries are always difficult, and while your relationship is generally cordial, the competitive dynamic from your past complicates it. I admire your willingness to reach out. Start by having an initial conversation with him to break the ice and build a better relationship—in this first conversation, don't mention the competitive dynamic unless it comes up. Just focus on the fact that you've been distant and that you want to be more a part of his life. He should be receptive to that unless he has some sort of secret grudge against you.

Regardless of how he responds, it's important for you to do some work on yourself to question this mentality of competition, ideally with a therapist. Try to understand not just where this idea of competition comes from, but how it affects you now: does it add to your life or take away from it? I would also urge you to cultivate hobbies and interests that don't depend on competition, such as gardening, art, or single-player video games. And stay away from social media, which amplifies the "keeping up with the Joneses" dynamic. With some healthy new hobbies and ways of thinking, you'll be well on your way to better managing this relationship and, equally importantly, your own mental health.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been in a long-distance relationship for the past year. We met online and hit it off immediately, and we've been making it work with visits every few months. But lately, I'm starting to feel like the distance is taking a toll. We talk on the phone and video chat regularly, but it's not the same as being together. I'm starting to feel lonely and disconnected, and I'm wondering if I'm missing out on opportunities to meet someone local. We've talked about one of us moving, but neither of us can right now—I'm in grad school and they're established in their career. I love them, but I'm not sure how much longer I can do this. How do I know if the distance is just a temporary challenge we can overcome, or if it's a sign that this isn't meant to be?

ANSWER: Long-distance relationships can work, but they require a clear end date or at least a concrete plan for when you'll be together. The fact that neither of you can move right now is understandable, but "someday" isn't a plan; it's a hope. You need to sit down together and have a serious conversation about timelines: when could one of you realistically move? What would that look like? What are you both willing to sacrifice to make it happen? If the answer is "we don't know" or "maybe in a few years," then you're essentially asking yourself to put your life on hold indefinitely, which isn't fair to either of you.

The loneliness you're feeling is valid, and it's worth examining whether you're staying in this relationship because you genuinely see a future together, or because you're afraid of being alone or of hurting them. Ask yourself: if you knew for certain that you'd be long-distance for another three years with no clear plan to close the distance, would you stay? If the answer is no, you have your answer. It's okay to love someone and still recognize that the circumstances aren't right for you. That doesn't make the love less real—it just means that love alone isn't always enough to make a relationship work. You deserve to be in a relationship that meets your needs, including the need for physical presence and daily connection. If this relationship can't provide that within a reasonable timeframe, it may be time to have an honest conversation about whether the sacrifices that each of you are making are truly worth it.

QUESTION: My husband and I have been married five years and we have two young children. My husband's job requires him to travel frequently—he's gone about two weeks out of every month. When he's home, he's often exhausted and wants to relax, which means I'm still doing most of the childcare and household management even when he's here. I work full-time too, and I'm burning out. I've tried talking to him about it, but he says his job is demanding and he needs downtime when he's home. I understand that, but I also need a break, and I feel like I'm doing everything alone. We can't afford for him to change jobs right now, but something has to give. How do we find balance when his career requires so much travel?

ANSWER: This is a really tough situation, and your burnout is completely understandable. The issue isn't just the travel—it's that when he's home, the division of labor isn't fair. Yes, he's tired from work, but so are you, and you've been holding down the fort solo while he's been away. His "downtime" shouldn't come at the expense of you never getting any.

You need to have a serious conversation about restructuring how things work when he's home. Start by acknowledging his need for rest, but also make it clear that you have the same need: "I know you're exhausted when you get home, and I want you to have time to recharge. But I've been working and parenting solo while you're gone, and I'm exhausted too. We need to find a way for both of us to get breaks." Then get specific: maybe he takes the kids for a few hours on Saturday morning so you can sleep in or have time to yourself. Maybe you alternate who handles bedtime routines. Maybe you hire help—a babysitter for a few hours a week, or a cleaning service to take some of the household burden off both of you. The key is that his travel schedule can't be an excuse for you to carry 100% of the load when he's home. That's not sustainable, and it will breed resentment.

You also need to talk about the long-term plan. If his job requires this much travel indefinitely, you both need to decide if that's the life you want. Can he seek another role in the same company that requires less travel? Can you make financial changes that would allow him to take a job with less travel, even if it pays less? The current arrangement might work short-term, but if it's going to be years of this, you need to know that and make an informed decision about whether you can handle it. Your mental health and your children's well-being depend on you not being constantly overwhelmed.

QUESTION: I'm the mother of two kids, a son age 15 and a daughter age 13. My son has expressed a strong interest in being a physician, a goal that I support because he has a genuine love for medicine—he's been interested in it from a very young age and has loved his hospital shadowing experiences. The problem is that he's so focused on school and grades that he isn't doing any extracurriculars. I worry that now that he's in high school, not having extracurriculars will hurt his chances of getting into a good college and eventually medical school, even if he maintains his excellent grades. I don't like the "extracurricular arms race" that high school has become, but I recognize we have to work within the system as it exists. I've repeatedly encouraged him to find an extracurricular he likes, even suggesting the Science Club since science is his favorite subject, but he always says he's focused on schoolwork and that Science Club would be redundant since he already studies science outside of school. I want him to forge his own path, but I also don't want him to make choices that could hurt his chances of getting into medical school or another professional or graduate school. How can I strike a balance between providing sound parental advice and giving him the autonomy he needs to make his own choices?

ANSWER: I agree with you about the extracurricular arms race—it's unfortunate that these activities have become boxes to check rather than enriching experiences, but you're right that we need to work within the system. A good first step is to talk to his guidance counselor (and encourage him to do the same) to understand what extracurricular portfolios look like for recent graduates who got into good colleges; you can also talk to other parents and look at reputable websites (avoid sources like U.S. News and World Report, which exaggerate prestige factors). Being armed with facts helps reduce over-worrying. I would stress that having one or two extracurriculars can be important for college admissions—it's not fair, but that's how the system works. My brother had virtually perfect grades and a 1600 SAT score yet didn't get into Yale, and we think his lack of extracurriculars was a major factor. Does your son have friends in extracurriculars who've had good experiences? Does he have interests outside of science that could be pursued in an extracurricular? Most schools offer many options, and even if his doesn't, there should be something that appeals to his interests. Remind him that these organizations are good ways to make friends and can be enriching beyond just a line on a resume. Good luck—he sounds like a really good kid.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I are both 25, and we've been dating for about eight months. Things are going well, but there's one issue: he wants to move in together, and I'm not ready. I like having my own space, and I'm not sure we've been together long enough to take that step. When I tell him this, he gets hurt and says it makes him feel like I don't see a future with us. I do see a future with us, but I also think moving in together is a big step that shouldn't be rushed. How do I explain this without making him feel rejected?

ANSWER: Your instinct to take things slowly is valid—eight months isn't very long, and moving in together is a significant commitment that changes the dynamic of a relationship. His hurt feelings are understandable, but they shouldn't pressure you into making a decision you're not ready for. Moving in together before you're ready is a recipe for resentment and conflict.

Have a conversation that acknowledges his feelings while being clear about your own: "I understand why this feels like rejection, and that's not my intention at all. I do see a future with us, which is why I want to make sure we're making this decision for the right reasons and at the right time. Moving in together is a big step, and I want us to be in a place where we're both excited about it, not where one of us is doing it to avoid hurting the other's feelings." Then talk about what "ready" looks like for you: maybe you want to hit the one-year mark, or maybe you want to work through some other issues first, or maybe you just need more time to feel comfortable with the idea. Be specific about your timeline if you have one, or be honest if you don't know when you'll be ready.

It's also worth exploring why he's pushing for this so soon. Is he insecure about the relationship? Is there a financial reason? Understanding his motivation can help you address the underlying concern. But ultimately, if you're not ready, you're not ready, and that's okay. A partner who truly cares about you will respect your boundaries and timeline, even if it's not what they hoped for. If he can't accept that and continues to pressure you, that's a red flag about how he handles not getting his way in the relationship.

QUESTION: My wife and I have been married for eight years, and we have a good relationship overall. But there's one recurring issue: she's very close with her group of college friends, and they have a group chat where they're constantly messaging. The problem is that they often share very personal details about their lives, including things about their relationships and sex lives. My wife participates in these conversations and sometimes shares details about our relationship that I'm not comfortable with. When I've asked her to keep our private life private, she says I'm being too sensitive and that this is just how her friend group communicates. But I feel like my privacy is being violated, and I don't want our intimate details discussed in a group chat. How do we resolve this?

ANSWER: Your feelings are completely valid—you have a right to privacy in your relationship, and your wife sharing intimate details about your life without your consent is a boundary violation. The fact that she's dismissing your concerns as being "too sensitive" is also problematic. Your comfort level matters, and a good partner should respect that, even if they don't fully understand it.

You need to have a clear conversation about boundaries: "I understand that your friend group is close and shares a lot with each other. But when you share details about our relationship, especially intimate ones, it makes me feel like my privacy isn't being respected. I'm not asking you to stop being close with your friends, but I am asking you to keep our private life private. Can we agree on what's off-limits?" Be specific about what you consider private—maybe it's anything about your sex life, or maybe it's details about arguments or personal struggles. The key is that you both need to agree on what's okay to share and what isn't.

If she continues to dismiss your concerns or refuses to change her behavior, that's a bigger issue. It suggests she doesn't respect your boundaries or your right to privacy. You might need to consider couples counseling to work through this, because trust and respect for boundaries are fundamental to a healthy relationship. Your wife's friendships are important, but they shouldn't come at the expense of your comfort and privacy in your own marriage.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for two years. We get along great and have similar values and goals. But there's one thing that's been bothering me: there's a 12-year age gap between us—I'm 35 and they're 23. When we started dating, the age difference didn't seem like a big deal, but lately I've been thinking about it more. I'm at a point where I'm thinking about settling down, buying a house, maybe having kids. They're still figuring out their career, want to travel, and aren't sure about kids. I'm worried that we're at different life stages, and that might cause problems down the road. Am I overthinking this, or are these legitimate concerns?

ANSWER: These are legitimate concerns. Age gaps can work in relationships, but they often come with life-stage differences that can pose challenges. The fact that you're thinking about settling down and they're still in the exploration phase is a real difference that needs to be addressed, not dismissed.

The age gap itself isn't necessarily the problem—it's the life-stage mismatch. If they're 23 and want to travel and explore, that's completely normal for someone that age. But if you're 35 and ready to settle down, you need to decide if you're willing to wait for them to catch up to where you are, or if you need someone who's already at that stage. Remember that your partner was 21 when you first started dating them. That's only barely old enough to drink. And it's only a few years past high school. When you reached drinking age, they were only 9 and in elementary school. By the time they catch up to where you are now, you might be in your early to mid-40s. And while I don't want to presume the gender of either of you, that's generally a late age to start having kids. 

So you need to ask yourself some hard questions. Then if you haven't already done so, have a frank and honest conversation with them. Open with something like: "I love you, and I want to make sure we're on the same page about where we're headed. I'm thinking about buying a house and potentially having kids in the next few years. Where are you with these things? What does your timeline look like?" Pay attention to their answers. Are they open to having those conversations? Do they seem to want similar things, just on a different timeline? Or are you fundamentally wanting different things? You need to be honest with yourself about what you want and whether this relationship can provide it. Don't stay in a relationship hoping someone will change or "catch up"—that's a recipe for resentment. Either you're both moving in the same direction, and at a speed that you feel works well for both of you, or you need to acknowledge that you might be on different paths.

QUESTION: My girlfriend and I have been together for two years, and we're both in our late 20s. She just got offered her dream job, but it's in a city about 500 miles away. She wants to take it, and she's asked me to move with her. I have a good job here that I enjoy, my family lives nearby, and I've built a life in this city. I love her and I want to support her career, but I'm not sure I'm ready to uproot my entire life. She's hurt that I'm hesitating and says it shows I'm not committed to our future. How do we figure this out?

ANSWER: This is a major life decision that requires honest conversation, not guilt or pressure. Her hurt is understandable—she's interpreting your hesitation as a lack of commitment—but moving far away for a partner is a huge ask that deserves careful consideration, not an immediate yes. You need to have a real conversation about what this move would mean for both of you: What would your job prospects look like in the new city? How would you maintain your relationships with family and friends? What's the long-term plan—is this permanent, or is there a timeline for potentially moving back? Are there compromises—could you try long-distance for a period while you both explore options?

The bigger question is whether you see a future together regardless of location. If you do, then this becomes a logistics problem you can solve together. If you don't, then the location question is really a proxy for a deeper incompatibility. Be honest with yourself and her about where you are. It's okay to say, "I need time to think about this because it's a major decision that affects my career, my relationships, and my life. Can we talk through the practicalities and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us?" If she can't give you that space and continues to frame it as a test of your commitment, that's a red flag. A healthy partnership allows both people to make major life decisions thoughtfully, not under pressure.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for three years, and we're talking about moving in together. The issue is pets. I have two cats that I've had for years, and they're like family to me. My partner is allergic to cats and doesn't really like them anyway. They've suggested I rehome my cats before we move in together, but I can't imagine giving them up. My partner says it's not fair to expect them to live with animals they're allergic to and don't want, but I feel like asking me to give up my pets is asking me to give up part of my family. How do we resolve this?

ANSWER: This is a fundamental incompatibility that needs to be addressed before you move in together. Your partner is right that it's not fair to expect them to live with animals they're allergic to, but you're also right that asking you to rehome pets you've had for years is a significant ask. (And in my view, a deal-breaker. But I'll get to that in a moment.) The question is whether there's a compromise that works for both of you, or whether this is a deal-breaker for one or both of you.

First, explore the allergy issue: has your partner tried allergy medication or immunotherapy? Some people can manage cat allergies with medication, though it's not a guarantee. If the allergy is severe and can't be managed, then you're looking at a choice: either you keep your cats and don't live together (at least not in the same space), or you rehome the cats. But before you make that decision, you need to be honest with yourself about what you can live with. If rehoming your cats would cause you lasting resentment, then that's not a viable solution—it will poison your relationship. And it will be traumatic for the cats. You and your partner might stay together or you might not, but for the cats, the trauma of permanent separation will last for the rest of their lives. 

You need to think hard about whether you're compatible for cohabitation right now. Some couples make it work by living separately, or by waiting until circumstances change (like the cats passing away naturally, though that's obviously not something to rush). The key is to have an honest conversation about what each of you can and can't accept, and to make a decision based on that, not on pressure or guilt.

Honestly, though, it seems to me that even if the allergy problem can be managed, this is a serious and probably insurmountable incompatibility problem. You love your cats and see them as family. And your partner “doesn't really like [cats] anyway.” So even if they grudgingly agree to cohabit with you with your cats around, and the allergy can be brought under control, it's unlikely to be a happy situation for either of you. They will resent you for being "forced" to live with animals they don't like, and you'll pick up on their resentment, even if  they don’t verbalize it, and you'll resent them in turn. (Of course, it's possible that the opposite can happen, and your partner could fall in love with the cats when they actually start living with them--provided, of course, that the allergy can be taken care of. But I have found that it's very risky to make big decisions like this based on wishful thinking.) This seems like one of those situations where the honest and respectful thing to do would be to break up and find someone more compatible.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been together for a year, and things are mostly good. But there's one issue: we have very different comfort levels with public displays of affection. I'm someone who likes to hold hands, give quick kisses, put my arm around my partner when we're out. He's much more reserved and says he's not comfortable with PDA—he'll hold my hand sometimes, but that's about it. When I try to be affectionate in public, he pulls away or seems embarrassed. I feel rejected, and he feels pressured. We've talked about it, but we can't seem to find a middle ground. How do we navigate this?

ANSWER: This is a common problem, and both comfort levels are valid. The key is finding a compromise that respects both of your boundaries rather than one person having to completely accommodate the other. Start by having a conversation about what specifically makes each of you uncomfortable: is it any physical contact in public, or are certain things okay (like holding hands) while others aren't (like kissing)? Understanding the specifics can help you find a middle ground.

Then, try to meet in the middle. Maybe you agree that holding hands and brief hugs are okay, but more intimate displays of affection are saved for private. Or maybe you have certain contexts where PDA is more acceptable (like at a party with friends) versus others where it's not (like in a professional setting or around family). The goal is to find a level of affection that you're both comfortable with, not to convince him to be more affectionate or you to be less affectionate.

It's also worth considering whether this is a symptom of a larger issue: does he show affection in private? Does he make you feel loved and valued in other ways? If the only issue is public affection and you're both happy with your private relationship, then this might just be a difference in comfort levels that you can work around. But if he's also reserved in private or if you're feeling generally unloved or rejected, then this might be a sign of a deeper incompatibility that needs to be addressed.

QUESTION: My younger sister has taken up this strange new habit of commenting on my appearance every time we see each other. It’s always framed as concern about my health or “just trying to be honest,” but the comments land hard and linger with me for days. I’ve already tried gently telling her that these remarks don’t feel supportive, yet she insists she’s doing it out of love and that I’m being overly sensitive. I’m starting to dread family gatherings because I never know what she’ll say next. She isn’t trying to be cruel, but the pattern is wearing me down. How do I set a boundary she will actually respect?

ANSWER: First, let me ask: what's changed recently that might explain this behavior on her part? You frame her actions as a "strange new habit." This suggests that it hasn't been going on very long. You might want to start by asking her if there's anything in her life that's changed that's led her to start asking these questions of you. This might not solve the problem on its own, but it could be a step in the right direction. Or she might not feel comfortable discussing this with you, but it's worth a shot.

Regardless, you will need to set better boundaries with her. Since the softer approach didn’t shift her behavior, you need to set a boundary that is both clear and firm. The key is to remove the debate entirely. Instead of explaining why her comments hurt or asking her to see them differently, state the limit as a simple fact: “I’m not discussing my body or my weight with you. If you bring it up again, I will end the conversation and step away.”

Deliver it calmly and without extra justification. You’re not asking for her approval. You’re naming your boundary.

Then, and this is the difficult part, you must follow through. The moment she crosses the line, end the interaction immediately. No flustered explanations, no arguing, no trying to convince her that you’re reasonable. Just a short “I’m going to step away now,” and do it.

This isn’t about punishing her. It’s about teaching her, through consistent action, that certain topics are not up for discussion. Some people only take boundaries seriously when there is a predictable consequence. Holding that line may feel uncomfortable at first, but it is often the only way to truly change behavior. You’re allowed to protect your well-being.

QUESTION: My fiancé has a lifelong best friend who has always been part of our social circle, but lately I leave gatherings feeling deflated. His friend has a habit of making jokes at my expense. None of them are hateful or crude, but they’re pointed enough that I feel more scrutinized than included. When I mentioned this to my fiancé, he brushed it off as “just his sense of humor” and said not to take it personally. The problem is that I do take it personally, because I’m the one absorbing it. I don’t want to ask him to choose sides, but I also don’t want to spend the rest of my life avoiding someone who matters to him. How can I bring this up in a way that makes him understand the emotional reality without making it a fight?

ANSWER: Focus on describing the impact rather than diagnosing the friend’s behavior. Instead of saying “he’s rude” or “he targets me,” try something like: “I know he’s important to you. I just leave these hangouts feeling drained and a bit singled out, and I want to talk about how we can make those situations feel less lopsided.”

This invites your fiancé into the problem with you rather than casting him as the gatekeeper for his friend. After that, shift toward what support would look like. Maybe you’d feel more comfortable if your fiancé stepped in when the friend’s jokes start piling up, or if he changed the subject instead of letting the moment linger. You’re not asking him to confront his friend dramatically. You’re asking him to help shape the tone of group interactions so you feel more grounded and respected. Standing up for you doesn't have to be hostile unless the friend really pushes the matter. It can just look like your fiance changing the subject or saying something like, "Hey, you know, she doesn't like these jokes very much. Let's stick to a topic that we can all enjoy."

If he struggles to respond, explore what’s underneath that. Sometimes partners minimize these things because they feel caught between loyalty and discomfort. Naming that tension gently can help him see that you’re not attacking the friendship, but trying to create a dynamic where you don’t bear the brunt of someone else’s humor.

Bottom line, you don't have to live your life in fear of the next harsh joke. If your fiancé can't or won't stand up to his friend, that's an early indicator that he may not stand up for you in difficult situations in the future. Because what happens, say, five years down the road, when his new friend from work starts commenting on your body or on some idiosyncrasy that you have? Is the fiancé (who would then be your husband presumably) going to be a puddle of goo then, or is he going to stand up for you? If he's not standing up for you now, then he's not likely to do so down the road, unless you two have a discussion where you make clear that he needs to step up more for you when his friend makes these jokes, and then he actually follows through and does it.

This can be solvable if both of you stay oriented toward the shared goal: making social time feel welcoming for everyone involved. If your fiancé can't or won't do this, it's time to question whether he's the best match for the rest of your life.

QUESTION: One of my coworkers is very friendly and has made a point of inviting me to various after-work activities. I’ve turned down the invitations every time, partly because I’m introverted and partly because I like keeping a clear line between my work life and my personal time. He never gets pushy or inappropriate, but he is persistent. Even after several polite nos, he keeps asking as though I might suddenly change my mind. I don’t want to embarrass him or make things awkward at work, but I also don’t want to spend the rest of the year repeating myself. How can I shut this down kindly but firmly?

ANSWER: When polite refusals don’t work, it usually means the other person is interpreting them as circumstantial rather than categorical. Or he's just quite socially inept. Regardless of why he's doing this, though, you need to give him a clear and unambiguous statement that leaves no room for hope. Something like: “I appreciate the invitation, but I don’t do social events outside of work. That’s a personal boundary for me, and it’s not going to change. I just want to be upfront so you don’t feel like you need to keep asking.”

This removes the ambiguity and gives him a way to save face. He didn’t misread your signals. He simply did not have full information.

If he slips and invites you again, keep your response short and steady: “As I mentioned before, I don’t do after-work hangouts.” No apologies, no elaboration. Reducing the emotional padding in these moments actually makes it easier for him to adjust because the message is consistent. The last resort would be after several more times when he doesn't get the message, go to HR about this. But, of course, there could be professional and personal costs to this, hence why it should only be a last resort.

Handled this way, the work relationship doesn’t need to suffer. Most people appreciate clarity once they have it, even if it wasn’t the answer they hoped for.

QUESTION: My teenage son has been irritable and withdrawn for weeks. He comes home from school, goes straight to his room, and barely speaks to anyone. His grades have slipped, and when I try to check in he insists he’s fine and just wants to be left alone. Part of me wants to push harder because I’m worried something serious is going on. Another part of me remembers what it felt like to be a teenager and how suffocating it was when adults demanded explanations I wasn’t ready to give. I feel stuck between wanting to respect his space and wanting to make sure he’s not silently drowning. How do I show up for him in a way that actually helps?

ANSWER: The key is to create multiple low-pressure avenues for connection. Teenagers often shut down when conversations feel like interrogations, but they will open up in small, sideways ways when the setting feels safe. Try brief check-ins during shared activities: a car ride, cooking dinner, folding laundry. Keep the tone light. Something like, “You seem stressed lately. I’m around if you ever want to talk,” is often more effective than “Tell me what’s going on.”

At the same time, gently monitor the basics: sleep, appetite, school workload, changes in friend groups. Reach out to teachers or counselors if you’re seeing consistent decline. You’re not tattling. You’re gathering context.

If he continues to withdraw or shows signs of depression, bring in a mental health professional. Many teenagers open up more easily to someone who isn’t a parent, and having a neutral adult in the picture can relieve both of you. You’re not abandoning your role by asking for help. You’re broadening the support system so he doesn’t have to navigate a tough period alone.

The balance you’re trying to strike is real, and it’s delicate. But showing steady, non-intrusive care is often exactly what a struggling teenager needs.

QUESTION: I've been married for a few years. My wife and I are mostly open with each other about things. But I have one thing that I haven't told her about. I watch porn. It's always from mainstream sites. Never underage porn. And I never interact with any of the performers directly, a la OnlyFans. I usually do it when I'm sleeping in the other room for various reasons, or sometimes when she goes out for a while. I feel guilty about this, but at the same time, I also feel like it's important to me since our libidos are mismatched. My libido is significantly higher than hers.

I feel that this is a better solution to the libido problem than actually going out and having an affair, but part of me feels this is still cheating because after all, I am deliberately getting sexually stimulated by other women's bodies. Is this cheating? What's your verdict on this?

ANSWER: The use of sensual materials, when all common sense and ethical guidelines are met, is a question that good people can disagree upon. Some marriages can still do well when one or both partners use porn, whereas it kills other marriages. I'd start by asking yourself a few questions. First, why haven't you told your wife about this porn use? Is it that you're worried about her reaction? Do you feel ashamed? You did mention that you feel that it feels like a "betrayal." But engage in a thought exercise for a moment: how would you compare the following situations when it comes to whether it's a betrayal of your spouse: Watching porn; reading an erotic novel; masturbating through pure fantasy?

Almost all married people masturbate at least sometimes in their marriage. So that fact itself isn't a reason to feel bad or like you're betraying your spouse. And I gave you the above list to get you thinking about what really separates porn from these other activities. Not to justify porn but to simply try to isolate your thinking as far as what its role is or should be in your life. I think the biggest issue here though is the secretiveness. You should have a frank conversation with your spouse about this. Mention using these materials and mention your concern about them. Even if they disagree with your use of them, hopefully they will react in a compassionate and loving way. And also look at Bernie Zilbergeld's book, "The New Male Sexuality." He offers a lot of common sense advice on such topics.

QUESTION: My husband and I usually communicate well, but lately we’ve been getting stuck in the same argument about how we spend our free time. I’m someone who likes to plan outings or small activities on the weekends. He prefers to decompress at home and gets overwhelmed when he feels like the weekend is scheduled. When I bring up wanting to do more together, he hears it as criticism. When he asks for quieter weekends, I hear it as disinterest. We’re not fighting constantly, but we keep circling this mismatch and neither of us feels fully understood. How do we bridge this without either of us feeling steamrolled?

ANSWER: Start by shifting the frame from “How do we solve this?” to “How do we understand each other better?” Because underneath the scheduling conflict is a clash of needs: your desire for shared experiences and his desire for rest. Try approaching the conversation with that lens. For example: “I’m not trying to take away your downtime. I just feel more connected when we have a few planned moments together. Can we talk about how to make space for both?”

Once you’ve established that you’re both trying to meet real needs rather than win an argument, experiment with structure. Maybe you designate one weekend day as low-key and keep one small planned outing on the other. Or you agree on two or three “anchor points” each month so he can anticipate the energy required. You’re not erasing his need for rest or your desire for activity. You’re creating a rhythm you both can breathe in.

Finally, check in periodically about how it’s going. These patterns evolve as stress levels and life demands shift. The goal isn’t perfect balance every week. It’s a sense that both of you matter in the equation.

QUESTION: My older brother has always had a forceful personality, but lately he has started giving me unsolicited advice about every aspect of my life. My job, my finances, my relationship, even how I organize my house. He means well, but the constant commentary makes me feel like I’m being managed rather than supported. If I push back, he gets offended and says he’s only trying to help. I don’t want to damage the relationship, but I can’t keep absorbing this. How do I set a boundary with someone who thinks boundaries are personal attacks?

ANSWER: People who overreach often believe their intentions should override your experience, so start by separating the two. You might say: “I know you want the best for me, but the unsolicited advice is overwhelming and unwelcome. I need to come to you when I want input, not feel like I’m being evaluated all the time.” This honors his intention while making your limit unmistakable.

Then be explicit about what you want going forward. Something like: “Unless I ask for advice, I need you to just listen.” No apologies, no over-explanation. Just clarity.

If he reacts defensively, keep your tone warm but firm: “I’m not questioning your desire to help. I’m asking for space to handle things my own way.” His discomfort does not mean the boundary is wrong. It just means it’s new.

You also say that “lately” he has “started” giving you unwanted advice. This implies it's a relatively new development, at least in its frequency. Do you have a new relationship, a new job, or some other recent event that has triggered this? I ask this not to justify his behavior, but to try to understand it a bit better. It's possible that his overbearing actions are hiding a deeper fear or insecurity. Just to give a hypothetical example, someone whose sibling just started a new relationship might worry about how their sibling’s new partner will treat them; being overbearing might be their way of coping. Not saying this is what's happening with you, but just suggesting that there might be multiple things going on here aside from just his “forceful personality.”

Regardless, consistency is the lever here. The first few times he lapses, redirect calmly: “I’m not looking for advice right now.” Over time, even the most well-meaning micromanagers learn that your autonomy is not up for negotiation.

QUESTION: My college-age daughter comes home on breaks and immediately reverts to treating me like a full-time provider. She expects meals, laundry help, rides, and emotional labor on demand. I love her and I’m glad she feels at home here, but I’m exhausted by how quickly my boundaries get erased the moment she walks through the door. When I try to bring it up, she gets defensive and says she’s only home for a short time, so why can’t things just be easy? How do I reset expectations without turning every visit into a standoff?

ANSWER: Start by acknowledging the transition she’s navigating. Coming home often triggers old roles for both parents and young adults. But then name your reality: “I love having you here, and I want this to be a place you can relax. At the same time, I can’t take on every responsibility the way I did when you were younger.”

Be specific about what needs to change. Instead of “I need more help,” try: “If you want laundry done, it needs to be your responsibility,” or “I’m happy to cook some meals, but not every meal.” Concrete expectations reduce the emotional charge.

If she protests, stay calm: “I’m not trying to make your time here stressful. I’m trying to make sure it’s sustainable for both of us.” Give her a little space to adjust; role shifts rarely happen overnight.

Over time, the goal is to build a new adult-to-adult rhythm rather than sliding automatically into parent-child mode. You’re not being harsh. You’re updating the household contract so it respects both of you.

QUESTION: My partner and I recently merged our finances, and we’re discovering that we have very different spending habits. I’m frugal and tend to think months ahead. He’s more spontaneous and comfortable with impulse purchases. Neither of us is reckless, but the mismatch has caused a few tense conversations about what counts as “necessary,” and I can feel resentment creeping in. How do we navigate this without turning every purchase into a referendum on our values?

ANSWER: Start by separating the emotional layer from the logistical one. Spending habits often reflect deeper stories—security, identity, pleasure, scarcity. You might say: “I think our reactions to money come from different places. I’d like to understand yours better, and I want to explain mine so we’re not guessing at each other’s motives.”

Then build a system that contains the differences rather than erases them. That might mean setting a monthly discretionary allowance for each of you—money you can spend without explanation. Or creating a threshold above which you both discuss a purchase beforehand. Clear rules remove the ambiguity that fuels resentment.

You might even take the monthly discretionary allowance idea one step further and decouple your finances a bit. Still maintain a joint account, but also maintain separate bank accounts. This isn’t for everyone but it works for a lot of couples as it strikes a balance between having shared finances and having funds for each partner to spend how they wish. Your partner will likely offer resistance when you bring up the idea of partially re-separating your finances. You can explain that it's a practical step that has nothing to do with how you feel about them or whether you trust them. It's a way for the two of you to respect each other's differences and to reduce conflict over spending. 

Finally, check in regularly. Not about individual purchases, but how the system feels. You’re not trying to force each other into identical spending styles. You’re trying to build a shared financial culture that gives both of you room to breathe. When you treat it as something you’re designing together, the conversations get easier and the stakes feel lower.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over two years, and we generally communicate well, but there’s one recurring issue I can’t seem to crack. When he gets stressed about work, he completely shuts down emotionally. He doesn’t get angry or lash out. He just becomes quiet, withdrawn, and unreachable. I’ve tried giving him space, and I’ve tried gently checking in, but both approaches leave me feeling shut out. I don’t need him to be cheerful all the time, but I do need some sense of connection during hard weeks. I’m worried that if we don’t figure this out, we’ll drift into a pattern where stress equals distance. How can I help him open up without adding more pressure?

ANSWER: Start by naming the pattern without judgment. Something like: “I’ve noticed that when work gets overwhelming, you tend to pull inward. I want to support you, but I also want us to stay connected during those times. Can we talk about what kind of support actually feels helpful to you?”

This shifts the conversation from “Why are you shutting me out?” to “How do we navigate stress as a team?” Then explore concrete possibilities. Maybe he needs a predictable check-in each evening, or maybe what helps is physical closeness rather than conversation. Sometimes people withdraw not because they don’t trust their partner, but because they never learned what healthy support looks like.

From there, agree on a small shared practice. For example, even if he isn’t ready to talk, he might say, “It’s a hard day, but I love you. I’m just needing quiet.” That one sentence preserves the connection and reassures you that his silence isn’t a rejection.

You’re not trying to change his coping style completely. You’re trying to weave the relationship into it so neither of you feels alone in the process. With patience and clarity, this can become one of the strengths of your partnership rather than a fracture line.

QUESTION: I feel that I'm a walking, breathing cliche. I'm a 54-year-old woman whose similarly-aged husband cheated on me with his 24-year-old secretary. It's really the oldest story on God's green earth. I naively took him at his word when he told me that he was working late on Monday and Wednesday evenings. He told me that he had a big project to finish up, and his boss had laid off his assistant, so he was forced to do two people's jobs. Thus, he had to spend many hours at work outside of the workday to get it all done. 

Imagine my surprise when my best friend told me that she had seen my husband and a much younger woman out at a nice restaurant after working hours while my friend was on a date there! I confronted him, and after initial predictable denials, he confessed. He told me she made him feel young and wanted. Again, you can find countless examples of this story down to the small details. But now that I'm reeling from this betrayal, I'm wondering whether to stay or to leave him. He has always been a good husband and provider, and I believe him when he told me that he hasn't slept with anybody outside of the marriage except for the secretary. He swore to me he would change. However, a couple of weeks ago, after we tried to reconcile, my friend once again saw him out with his girlfriend at the same restaurant. (He could have at least been smart about it and gone to a different restaurant with her.) Clearly he hasn't ended things with her. He has many good qualities, but I don't know if I can forgive him for this. Should I stay or should I go?

ANSWER: I am sorry you are in this situation. Nobody deserves to be cheated on. Whether to stay or go in the event of an extramarital affair is one of those questions where good, reasonable people can disagree. Some are of the opinion that even one incident of cheating is too much, and that the trust can never be restored. On the other hand, others subscribe to the school of thought of allowing their partners a second or even third chance. Clearly you're at least open to the possibility of taking him back, but given that this betrayal has happened multiple times and that the deceit is continuing after his assurances that it wouldn't, I would be hesitant about taking him back.

If you haven't already, find a good therapist to discuss this issue with. Try to look for larger patterns. For instance, have you been cheated on before and then taken a partner back? What happened then? Your husband told you that he hasn't cheated on you with anyone except for the secretary, but has he engaged in any other dishonest behavior, such as using family money for questionable purposes? Usually when somebody is deceitful or dishonest in one area, they act similarly in other areas. Ultimately, the decision on whether to stay or go is yours, but I would exercise caution regarding his ability to change given what you've experienced thus far. If there were a graveyard for all failed relationships and marriages, probably about half of the headstones would read: "I tried to change them."

QUESTION: I’ve become close friends with someone at work, and the friendship has been great, but lately he’s been leaning on me in ways that feel more intimate than a typical workplace bond. Long messages late at night, venting about loneliness, asking for emotional reassurance. He has a partner, and so do I, and nothing explicitly romantic has happened, but the line feels blurry. I don’t want to lose the friendship, but I also don’t want to compromise boundaries I care about. How can I reset things without making it awkward at work?

ANSWER: Start by reestablishing the frame of the relationship. Try something like: “I value our friendship, but some of our recent conversations have gotten a bit more personal than I’m comfortable with. I want to make sure we keep good boundaries, especially since we both have partners.”

Lonely people often are keen to reach out to others, and at times, this drive can override the usual social boundaries. Emotional affairs usually begin as friendships of the type that you describe. I take you at your word that nothing romantic has happened, but as you also alluded to, it can be a slippery slope. It's best for everyone concerned to put a kibosh on this possibility now, rather than later.

That's why it's so important to set a clear limit about timing and topics. For example: “I’m going to stop responding to late-night messages. I'm also not comfortable discussing sensitive or intimate emotional topics. Let’s keep our conversations to work hours and to lighter topics.” You’re not rejecting him. You’re defining the shape of the connection.

If he reacts with embarrassment or over-apologizes, keep your tone steady: “There’s nothing wrong. I just want our friendship to stay in a place that feels good for both of us.” But if he does the opposite and reacts defensively or angrily, then that shows you something important as well. Regardless, connecting with a valued friend doesn't justify crossing lines that you don't want to cross.

Friendships at work can be meaningful, but they also benefit from guardrails. You’re creating these guardrails early enough that the relationship can adjust instead of rupture.

QUESTION: I've become very attracted to someone at my school. I'm in my mid-30s, and I am in an intensive vocational school that's co-educational. My cohort ranges in age from early 20s to 50s, although most of us are in the late 20s/early 30s range. I am a guy, and there's a girl in our cohort who is a few years younger than me. She and I are both introverts, and we bonded over this. She has also said that she sees me as handsome, though I need to remind myself that this doesn't necessarily indicate romantic interest. But I feel that our connection is becoming stronger with each conversation. We don't spend a lot of one-on-one time, but we always seem to end up talking to each other in group settings.

Unfortunately, she's engaged. I really want to be respectful of her relationship and not be a homewrecker, but at the same time I feel what I feel. Is there a way forward for us? Should I venture to satisfy my curiosity regarding whether she shares my feelings, or should I keep quiet about this?

ANSWER: While acknowledging the emotional complexities of the situation, I think you've answered your own questions. You want to respect her relationship, you don't want to be a homewrecker, and she's engaged. So that means that no, there's not a way forward for you two romantically, unless she breaks up with her fiancé. And needless to say, if this happens, it can't be because you contributed to it.

People have unrequited romantic feelings all the time, and also requited ones that can't be acted upon in situations such as yours. It's possible she shares your feelings, but it's equally possible she doesn't. And the larger point is that this is a question that needs to remain unanswered. Because, let's say she does share the feelings. Well, then what? There's no way for you two to act on them without breaking ethical rules that we can all agree on. So knowing that she shares these feelings, if she indeed does, would cause you even more torment. 

Continue to engage her as a friend within appropriate boundaries. Approach her with the mentality that romance is off the table and always will be. Some hard questions must remain unanswered.

QUESTION: My partner and I have different approaches to socializing. I enjoy hosting people and creating opportunities to bring our circles together. He prefers one-on-one interactions and finds group gatherings draining. I’ve tried balancing both, but lately I feel like I’m shrinking my social world to fit his preferences. When I bring it up, he says he doesn’t want to hold me back, but he still rarely participates. I don’t want to pressure him, yet I want a life that feels full. How do we navigate this mismatch?

ANSWER: Start by identifying what you actually need. Is it his active participation? Or is it his support for you to host and socialize freely? Once you know that, express it clearly: “I don’t need you at every gathering, but I do need to feel like I’m not choosing between my social life and our relationship.”

From there, propose a shared compromise. Perhaps he joins a few events each month, and the rest you host or attend without him. You’re creating a rhythm that preserves both his energy and your desire for community. This is one of those problems where there's ample compromise, even though it may not feel like it. 

In addition, is there a way for him to feel more comfortable at the larger social gatherings? I'm more on the introverted side, too, as your husband appears to be. I find that in large group settings, breaking out into smaller conversations is often much more comfortable for me than the intimidating setting of a large group. Something like this is probably already happening to some extent, but you can look for ways to make it a bit more structured. For example, is he a fan of games? Games can be a way to bring people together and can reduce the psychological barriers for more introverted people because there's a clear structure to it and more specific rules for interaction. And games are often turn-based, unlike conversational free-for-alls, which can make games much less intimidating to introverts than a large group conversation. I'm not saying to turn all of your social evenings into game nights. But for us introverts, we appreciate a bit of structure and more often than not respond well to it. 

Reassure him that opting out isn’t a failure. Many introverts feel guilty for not matching their partner’s social stamina. When you frame it as balance rather than pressure, he may feel freer to participate in ways that genuinely work for him. And over time, hopefully he will get to know the people at the gatherings who aren’t part of his circle better and find at least one or two people who he's comfortable enough with to talk to on a regular basis. This can also help a lot and make the atmosphere feel less daunting.

You’re not trying to merge personalities. You’re trying to build a life where both styles can breathe.

QUESTION: I work from home, as do many people. As many people have experienced in the work-from-home era, this can be at once liberating and lonely. None of my coworkers are even located in the city where I live, so I can't even meet up with them occasionally for coffee. But I have found a warm and inviting professional group in my area. These folks are passionate about the same things that I am, and I've been frequenting the group's meet-ups. I now even pay for a co-working space so that I can spend time with some of the same people during the workday. The culture and the vibe are great, and have been a huge morale boost in my work life.

The problem is that recently a new person has started to come to these meetups. He's kind on the surface, but after a while, he starts making nasty racist jokes and often speaks in a crude manner. He's borderline misogynist and seems to be a political reactionary. When he comes to the meetups, I try to relocate to another table. I haven't confronted him about the jokes because I don't want to rock the boat and cause an unpleasant situation with this group that I care so much about. But if he keeps coming, I don't know if I can keep coming. It would be heartbreaking to let him ruin my experience, however. How can I preserve my experience while also making it clear that his jokes are not okay?

ANSWER: Unfortunately, as you've discovered, a single person can ruin a dynamic. But by the same token, you have agency too. You said that you don't want to cause an unpleasant situation, but from my reading, you're already in such a situation. And I doubt you're the only one to experience discomfort over this. What I would do is: the next time he comes to your table, don't change tables, at least not before confronting him, if needed, in a polite but firm manner. If he makes one of the racist jokes, you can say something like, "Hey, I think that members of X group would find this offensive." Or, "How would you feel if you were in their shoes?" 

This person or others might very well respond by claiming that they're just joking and that you're being too sensitive. But if this happens, then you can say things like, "I know that different people have different brands of humor, but these jokes are dehumanizing, and I don't find them funny." Or, "These jokes cross a line for me, and I'm not comfortable with that. I want this space to remain a place where everyone feels included and can have a good time. Can you please refrain from making these jokes while I'm around?"

A lot will depend not only on how this person responds but also on how others in the group respond, particularly the leadership. If, after taking your concerns to the person in question, the situation still isn't improving, then you might want to take your concerns to the leadership. But if the leadership brushes it off or justifies the jokes in some way, even by just saying, "Oh, they're just joking around, they're not being serious," then I would reconsider what kind of culture these leaders are creating. I know this group is important to you, but I would wager that your integrity is as well. Life sometimes forces us to make hard choices between our integrity and other things that matter to us. I hope this isn't the case, but unfortunately, this might be one of those situations.

QUESTION: My younger cousin frequently asks me for career advice, which I’m happy to give, but the pattern is becoming draining. He’ll ask for guidance, I’ll spend time talking him through options, and then he’ll do the exact opposite or drop the conversation entirely until the next crisis. I’m starting to feel like a sounding board rather than a mentor. I want him to succeed, but I can’t keep investing energy into conversations he doesn’t act on. How do I help him without becoming a revolving door of advice?

ANSWER: Shift from providing solutions to setting expectations. Try: “I’m happy to be someone you can talk to, but I’ve noticed that we go over the same topics and nothing really changes. I want to make sure my support is actually useful.”

Then ask him what he hopes to gain from these conversations. Many people seek reassurance, not guidance, and naming that can reset the dynamic. You might also introduce some structure: “Before we talk, think about one or two options you’re genuinely considering.” This puts responsibility back on him.

Careers can be stressful and intimidating, especially if you're at the beginning stages of one. So, it's possible that your cousin is just stressed or overwhelmed. But you're not wrong to expect follow-through. His future bosses certainly will, and you nudging him in the right direction might be a good lesson for his future career. After all, ignoring your advice now is far lower stakes than ignoring what a boss asks him to do for a project due next week. So let this be a lesson in accountability.

If he continues the same pattern, step back gently: “I care about you, but I can’t keep revisiting these decisions when there’s no follow-through. Let me know when you’re ready to take concrete steps, and I’ll be here.” You’re not withdrawing love. You’re withdrawing from a cycle that isn’t serving either of you.

QUESTION: My boss is kind and supportive, but she relies on me emotionally in a way that feels inappropriate for a workplace. She vents about her stress, asks for reassurance, and sometimes uses phrases like “I don’t know what I’d do without you.” I like her and want to maintain a good relationship, but I don’t want to become her emotional anchor. How do I create distance without damaging my standing at work?

ANSWER: Keep the tone warm and professional. You might say: “I appreciate that you trust me, and I want to support the team. At the same time, I need to keep some boundaries so I can focus on my role.”

Then gently redirect the emotional conversations toward appropriate channels. If she begins unloading personal stress, respond with something like: “That sounds overwhelming. Have you talked to HR or someone on the leadership team about getting more support?” This signals care without absorbing responsibility. It's tricky because you don't want to sound like you're usurping her boss role by telling her what to do. It's a fine line. But framing your suggestions as just that, suggestions, might help reduce this potential problem. Something like: “This is just a suggestion, but last week, you talked to me about how stressful our relationship with Client X is. Do you think that you could assign some of Client X's lower-stakes work to our new intern, Jean? This could help reduce your load.”

If she uses emotionally loaded language—“I don’t know what I’d do without you”—you can deflect with professionalism: “I’m glad I can help, and I’m committed to the work we’re doing.” No deeper reassurance. Or you could say something like, "Thanks for your confidence in me. I'm focused on making sure that Client Y is pleased with our work this quarter."

You’re not rejecting her. You’re anchoring the relationship back in its intended structure. Work boundaries protect both career growth and mental health.

QUESTION: My younger sister and I used to be close, but ever since she joined a very tight-knit religious community, our relationship has grown strained. She’s kind and still reaches out, but conversations feel scripted, and she gently critiques my choices in ways she never used to. She keeps inviting me to events that feel more like recruitment than connection. I miss who we were to each other, but I also want to respect her path. How do I keep the relationship alive without feeling pressured to participate in a belief system that isn’t mine?

ANSWER: Start by affirming the bond you want to preserve. Something like: “I love you, and I want us to stay close. But I need to be honest: I feel pressured when our conversations center on your community or when invitations sound like recruitment.”

Proselytizing, by its nature, can feel dismissive of personal choice and often carries an assumption that the devotee's beliefs are superior to the other person's. While most people who proselytize are acting out of good intentions, the approach frequently comes across as forceful and unwelcome, and ultimately often only succeeds in imposing distance. I'm sure your sister means well, but the pressure on you to participate is clearly taking a toll on your relationship.

That's why boundaries are especially essential in these types of situations. And this starts by clarifying what type of relationship you want to have with your sister moving forward. “I’m happy to hear about your life, but I’m not comfortable attending events tied to your group. I want to connect as siblings, not as someone evaluating a belief system.” If she persists (which she likely will), you could also say, "I respect the path that you've chosen, but it isn't my path and never will be. I want to pursue my own path, on my own terms. My beliefs are just as valid as yours, and I want us to engage with each other as equals, rather than as one person trying to convert the other."

Expect her to feel awkward at first. When someone’s identity changes, they often don’t realize how much their communication changes. Be consistent. Redirect gently when conversations slip into persuasion: “I appreciate you sharing, but let’s talk about us.” 

In my experience, proselytizing needs to be met by respectful but clear, consistent, and firm boundaries. As with many other types of boundaries, the boundaries that you set here need to be clear and unambiguous. Because even the smallest hesitation or ambiguity can give her an opening that she'd gladly take. And repetition is key here. Expect resistance and some "backsliding" on her part (sorry). But if you continue to convey your own needs and wishes in a kind, loving manner, that will increase the chance that she will come around to halting the recruitment pitches and engaging with you as a sibling again.

You’re not rejecting her faith. You’re shaping a version of the relationship that both of you can inhabit with honesty. The connection can evolve, but only if it’s grounded in mutual respect rather than quiet discomfort.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have very different levels of political engagement. I attend rallies, donate, and stay active in local organizing. He supports my involvement but has little interest in participating himself, saying he prefers to “keep politics out of daily life.” Lately I’m feeling a sense of mismatch, like our values align in theory but not in practice. I’m worried that this will become a deeper divide over time. How do I talk about this without sounding self-righteous?

ANSWER: Short answer: you probably can’t. Asking him something like how he lives his values (which is really what you want to know, right?) will inevitably invite comparison to you and to your heavy activism, regardless of your intention in asking the question. This is partly because of how emotionally loaded political activism is, closely tied as it is to virtue signaling. But it's still worth discussing, since it's obviously very important to you. 

You can start with something like: “I know we agree on many issues, but civic engagement is a big part of how I live my values. I want to understand how you think about expressing yours.” Frame this as curiosity rather than judgment. He needs to feel that you want to be able to understand him better, rather than goading him into becoming more politically active. Because if he starts to sense the latter, he'll probably shut down.

Along these same lines, avoid framing involvement as a moral hierarchy. Instead, describe the emotional impact: “When I’m deeply engaged in something meaningful and you’re neutral, I sometimes feel alone. I want to understand where you’re coming from, not judge it.” And then give him space to explain his own perspective. 

From there, look for overlapping ground rather than identical action. Maybe he won’t march in the streets, but he might support you in smaller ways—researching issues, helping with logistics, or simply being a sounding board. Meaningful alignment doesn’t require carbon-copy activism or the loud forms of engagement that are often held up as superior to quieter forms. I have known of cases where introverts have stepped down from leadership posts in their political parties because the work just didn't match their personality. But they still contributed in other ways. Maybe your boyfriend is more of a “behind-the-scenes” type of guy. So I would urge you to see that as equally valid with other forms of activism. Recalibrating your own stance on activism could be an important step in helping you understand where he's coming from.

The goal isn’t to convert him. It’s to build a shared understanding so your engagement feels like part of the relationship rather than something you do in a separate emotional world.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for a few years, and we’ve always talked about wanting kids “someday.” Recently, I’ve felt that desire growing stronger, but when I brought it up more concretely, he hesitated. Not a firm no, but a real uncertainty. He says he needs more time to think about what he wants his life to look like. I don’t want to pressure him into parenthood, but I also don’t want to put my own timeline on hold indefinitely. How do we talk about something this big without turning it into an ultimatum?

ANSWER: This is a common but challenging situation. When partners differ on the all-important issue of whether or not to have kids, there are only a few outcomes that are possible. Either one of the partners genuinely changes their mind, in which case the pair either become parents (fertility or adoption processes allowing) or they don’t, with each partner fully on board. Or one of the two partners gives in without truly changing their mind, which leads to either one partner being in a parental role that they didn't truly want or one partner feeling resentful about losing their chance at parenthood. The final possibility is that both partners, recognizing the irreconcilability of their differences, are honest with themselves and each other and break up. I doubt that you or your partner want option number 2. That leaves the two of you to figure out whether you're truly on the same page about having kids (or whether there's a reasonable chance of that in the near-ish future)  or whether it might be time to part ways.

That being said, of course, this doesn't imply that you should rush the decision. Parenthood is such a huge responsibility that hesitation and reflection is a completely natural and, in many cases, necessary course of action. After a certain point, though, a non-answer becomes an answer. Not making a decision is the decision. I would suggest that the two of you have an open, honest conversation about your potential timeline for having children. Not so you can pressure him into becoming a parent or give him an ultimatum, but rather to remind him that the two of you don't have forever to make this decision, and after a certain point, if you truly want children and he doesn’t, then the relationship will no longer be tenable. After all, this isn't one of those situations where you can compromise. Either you have at least one child with your partner, or you don't. There’s no “half a child.” 

I know that still sounds like an ultimatum, but you can begin by grounding the conversation in openness rather than urgency. Try saying: “I’m feeling a clearer sense of what I want, and I need to understand where you are so we can navigate this together.” This signals that you’re not demanding a decision on the spot but it also implies that you are not willing to wait this out indefinitely.

Then dig into what “uncertainty” means for him. Is he unsure about the timing? His readiness? The idea of parenthood itself? Uncertainty has many shades, and clarity will help both of you understand whether you’re facing hesitation or a deeper ambivalence. After all, sometimes ambivalence reflects genuine uncertainty about something, whereas other times it's really a “no” in nicer clothing. You need to figure out which one it is, and if it's the former, what is the core cause of the uncertainty?

At the same time, articulate your own timeline without apology. You’re not issuing an ultimatum by acknowledging that your desires matter. You’re simply saying: “I can’t stay indefinitely in a holding pattern. I want to explore this with you in a way that respects both of our needs.” Without naming a specific time in the future by which he needs to make his decision, you're clearly communicating to him that the status quo of uncertainty cannot continue forever.

Finally, agree on a structured follow-up—a real check-in a few weeks or months down the line. “Sweetheart, I know that we've talked about having kids at some point, and I know that last time we checked in you were hesitant. But has your stance changed at all since the last time that we talked?” Big decisions often require reflection, but they also require momentum. You’re not rushing him. You’re creating a shared path forward. But you're also gently letting him know that at a certain point, there will be a fork in the road, and that he will need to decide which of the two paths to take.

QUESTION: My partner recently disclosed that he’s been feeling lost about his career, and now he wants to explore a totally different field. I want to be supportive, but I’m anxious—this could mean years of retraining, financial instability, and a major shift in our future plans. I don’t want to discourage him, but I also don’t want to ignore the practical impact on our shared life. How do I support his growth without sidelining my own needs?

ANSWER: Career changes often mean more than simply a new way to make money. They often also involve shifts in our sense of identity or a response to long-standing frustrations. In other words, they are often quite personal. You want to validate your partner's explorations of this new field, but you're also understandably concerned about its implications for both of your lives. Underlying all of this is the uncertainty surrounding what will happen over the next few years, both in his professional life and by extension, in your lives more generally.

You should convey to him both of these things: validation but also concern over the uncertainty. Begin by validating the courage it takes to consider a big change: “I admire that you’re thinking deeply about your future.” Then shift into partnership mode: “Let’s talk about what this might mean for us, both emotionally and practically.”

When I underwent a career change a decade ago, it involved a lot of complex emotions. Such is probably the case with him as well. So if he is eager to share the reasons for his career change, such as excitement over the possibility of a fresh start or frustrations in his current career, then hear him out. Simply listening will probably mean a lot to him, and it would also make it more likely for him to listen to you in turn when you express your concerns. It's also important to keep in mind cognitive biases. Even for the most sober-minded and careful people, the prospect of a career change often leads to distorted thinking where we romanticize our prospective new career with respect to the career that we're in now. But you can help to gently "reel him in" when he does this without coming across as though you're trying to crush his dreams.

If he doesn't volunteer this information, ask questions that clarify the scope: What draws him to the new field? What steps would he need to take? What timeline is realistic? This isn’t interrogation; it’s co-planning. If he pushes back, remind him that he would surely want to know the same information if you were considering a career change. Make sure that you thoroughly discuss aspects of the career change that would most affect your shared life. Would the career change require both of you to relocate? How much, realistically, would any retraining cost? And how long would it take, in a reasonable estimate, from the day of graduation until he starts earning the salary that he did in the job that he is now considering leaving? What does this all look like for retirement and other aspects of your shared financial life?

Name your own concerns without framing them as obstacles: “I want to make sure we’re honoring both of our needs. Stability matters to me, and I need to understand how this transition would fit into our life.”

Career changes are multi-stage processes, and the two of you might work together to decide upon a phased approach to this transition. One in which the first steps would be somewhat experimental and relatively easily reversed. He can start by simply researching the new field, which is probably what he's doing now. This can involve talking to established professionals in this field, reading articles and websites, etc. And if he's able to, he can shadow professionals in the field as well. The next step might involve more commitment, such as part-time classes, depending on the target career. If the field he's aspiring to is one with a very rigid and pre-set course of study, such as the law, then he might sit in on one or two classes if he's able to. This approach could allow him to test the path before making a full leap.

All in all, you’re not denying him growth. You’re ensuring that your relationship with him is woven into his career change decision rather than left behind.

QUESTION: My partner and I have different approaches to religious traditions. I grew up celebrating holidays with specific rituals that still feel meaningful to me. He didn’t grow up with those traditions and doesn’t feel connected to them. When the holidays come, he participates politely but without enthusiasm. I feel oddly lonely celebrating something that matters deeply to me while he seems indifferent. How do we bridge this emotional gap?

ANSWER: From your letter, this seems like more of a problem regarding traditions than religious differences. The distinction matters. The former type of problem is usually more solvable, as it's typically a lot easier to participate in traditions meaningfully or even to create your own traditions than it is to adopt a new religious identity wholesale. One can derive meaning from traditions, even if they don't believe in the underlying faith. It sounds from your letter as though what matters to you is that he participate in these traditions without just going through the motions, as opposed to believing all of the underlying doctrine. This is certainly lower-hanging fruit than trying to blend religious identities among partners or determining a single religious identity for an interfaith couple. I'm going to write the rest of my response on the assumption that this is more of a tradition issue than a religion issue.

I've known a lot of people who are not particularly religious, but can still find meaning in some religious traditions. For example, some of my most treasured memories are participating in Christmas Eve celebrations at my uncle's and aunt's church, singing along, and feeling a sense of joy and community even though I have never actually believed in Christian doctrine. I even remember fondly the hot candle wax burning my little hands during the celebration. (We used real candles back then.) So is there similarly a way in which your partner can find meaning in the traditions you've been raised in? There are many “hooks in” to religious traditions for those not raised in faith, or in the same faith. Do you think he could put forth more effort in practicing some of your traditions in the name of community or connection with you and your family or a love of music, for instance? Unless you feel strongly otherwise, you can also emphasize to him that the main importance of his meaningful participation in these traditions is in their connection with you and your past, as opposed to believing in a particular doctrine.

Start by sharing the emotional significance: “These traditions are tied to my sense of family and identity. When I celebrate them alone, even with you present, something feels missing.” Then ask what parts of the rituals he might connect with—not for religious reasons, but relational ones. Maybe he can choose one element to adopt as “ours,” creating meaning through shared intention rather than inherited symbolism. Growing up, I'm sure that your family put their own "stamp" on the religious traditions that you all practice. Maybe you and your partner can do the same.

At the same time, make clear that you don't expect him to feel exactly the same way about your traditions as you do. “I understand you didn't grow up with these traditions, and that's totally fine. I’m not asking you to pretend as though you did;  I don’t need you to feel what I feel. I just want us to create a way of celebrating that feels participatory rather than polite.” Hopefully that plants a seed that convinces him to more carefully consider what these rituals mean to you and how he might find meaning in them as well. 

Blended traditions evolve slowly. You’re not asking him to convert. You’re asking him to co-create a ritual landscape that honors both histories.

QUESTION: My friend is extremely committed to a cause she cares about, but lately every discussion feels like activism. If I express any uncertainty, she treats it as a moral lapse. I support the cause too, but the intensity is exhausting. How do I maintain the friendship without feeling like every conversation is a test?

ANSWER: Especially in the current political climate, activists on both sides are particularly passionate. Both sides also frequently impose “purity tests” and ostracize those who are deemed to have failed. And laypeople and activists alike often see every issue as existential. I'm not saying your friend is actually engaging in these actions, but rather I'm just reminding you of all this to illustrate the larger context in which your friend is operating. This doesn't justify her behavior, but it can help you understand it better. If one cares deeply about a cause, then it can be easy to fall into the trap of thinking that everyone must be equally passionate about the cause. This is especially true if, as I assume is the case with your friend, she's part of a larger community of activists. In an activist mentality, one can easily forget that other people are complex and may not share the same views. And that if they don't share the same views, that doesn't necessarily mean they are morally deficient.

This situation requires clear boundaries that you need to set with your friend. You need to explain to her that while you also support her cause, you're choosing to not put as much time and effort into it as she is, and she needs to be okay with that. Shift the focus from ideology to your connection to her. Say, “I care about this cause too, but when every conversation becomes a debate, I feel more evaluated than understood. I want us to be able to talk as friends, not as adversaries or as political mentors and apprentices.”

You might also remind her that you also have passions and strong interests, but you're not asking her to devote her life to them. “Peggy, I love crocheting and programming, but I'm not asking you to constantly drop everything and become an expert crocheter or become the next Bill Gates.” And if she pushes back that that’s different because her cause is more morally urgent, then remind her that we each get to decide how much effort to put into the things we care about, and that if one chooses to spend their time crocheting rather than marching in the streets, that doesn't make them a bad person or apathetic towards injustice. “I also care deeply about women's rights, but I'm not able or willing to go to every march or to send donations to every activist program as a result. You need to accept that these are my decisions, and it doesn't mean that I'm a bad person or don't care about women's rights.”

Set a conversational boundary without discrediting her passion. “I’m open to discussing this sometimes, but I can’t have it be the only lens we connect through.” A genuine friend will understand the distinction between limiting a topic and rejecting a value. If she interprets your boundary as betrayal, the friendship may need some distance until she can relate in more than one register and can respect your choices. 

Caring for someone and sharing their interest in a cause doesn't mean accepting their harsh moral judgments or letting every conversation with them revolve around their pet issue.
